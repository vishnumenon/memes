{"body": "To be blunt: You don't have a problem with atheists, you have a problem with science, knowledge, understanding and thinking.\n\nFirst, on the topic of extraterrestrial life. If you're at all into statistics or just the mathematics of probability, you will know that a gigantic sample space makes the improbable common. The origin of life on Earth was most likely caused by a fortuitous combination of circumstances; likely rare and seldom in relative terms, but given the (at least) sextillion planets in the universe, it becomes very unlikely that Earth should be the *only* place this happened. We can be almost *certain* there is other intelligent life elsewhere in the universe; it's most likely very far away though. Anyway, that's why scientists look for alien life: there's a small but finite possibility there is some where we can find it.\n\nNow here's your first error in thinking: alien life that's naturally evolved like we have has *nothing* to do with a divine, universe creating entity. Do you grasp the difference between postulating beings that arise naturally *within* the universe, and of a being who *created* our universe?\n\nThe reason we don't accept a god as the creator of the universe is that it's not at all scientific to postulate one as such. Here's the scientific way of thinking about this: the universe exists (as far as we can tell) and that's a fact looking for an explanation; so we look through the facts we know for plausible reasons and mechanisms. Everything we know of in the universe seems to have a natural cause and explanation, so natural causes and explanations are at the top of our list of candidate explanations. Look at the scientifically plausible explanations: \n\n* giant quantum fluctuations could explain the universe and are similar to something we know about. \n* Multi-dimensional strings explain the universe (or perhaps a multiverse, if you take M-theory) and at least have coherent mathematical models. \n* An eternal universe would explain our universe at least as a brute fact. Variations on this include eternally \"big bouncing\" universe ideas.\n\nYou apply one of those explanations, and you've at least tentatively answered an interesting question.\n\nAlternatively, if you propose a supernatural explanation, you've ended up raising more questions than you answered. For example, how does \"the supernatural\" work? Who lives there, is it just one god or many? Are there demons, spirits, poltergeists? You open up a whole world of questions with no answers, based on an explanation that has nothing going for it, not even the foundation in physics and/mor mathematics that the other hypotheses have. That's just opening up a field of study based on fantasy, conjecture and fiction. You could just as easily be studying rainbow-vomiting unicorns or Loch Ness monsters or invisible flying kittens. Summary: the \"explanation\" has no basis and it raises more questions than it solved.\n\n&gt; If we can exist, why can't God? He's merely another form of life, right?\n\nWho says? Who knows? As far as anybody knows, God is nothing but an imaginary construct. He has whatever attributes anybody chooses to think up.\n\n&gt; but don't think me crazy if I believe that he does.\n\nYou *are* factually crazy to believe that your idea of God exists, whether you like it or not. It's a (usually mild) form of craziness called delusion (it's listed in the DSM-IV) and the diagnosis is based on believing stuff that has no basis in the real world.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349091115", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Although there exists several thoughts on when and where rice cultivation began, the consensus seems to be that it happened late in the *upper paleolithic* timeline (about the 15th century BC).  So, I suppose that one could arguably state that rice is \"paleo\" (by the skin of its teeth... err, husk).  However, one could also justifiably argue that definition is nuance and rice consumption does not really meet the intent of the \"paleo diet\" which is to eat the foods that we are most genetically adapted to eat.  The paleolithic era spanned from about 2.6 million years ago to 10,000 BC so we have really only been consuming cultivated rice for the last 0.5% of human existence...\n\nThat being said... let's address the thing that actually matters here and that is whether or not rice is going to adversely affect you:\n\nRice, like most living things, exists for the sole purpose to survive long enough to reproduce.  In order to do this, it has developed defense mechanisms over its evolution to prevent animals from eating it, in this case... anti-nutrients (toxins).  These anti-nutrients are meant to cause gut irritation so, truthfully, our bodies are just plain better off without them.  However *white rice* (which is what most people are used to) is just rice that has had their husk, bran, and germ removed.  This process pretty much removes all the nutrients from the rice but *also* removes the gut irritating anti-nutrients.  The bottom line is that white rice is much less harmful (if harmful at all) to our bodies than other varieties (e.g. brown) but offers very little (if any at all) benefit to us.\n\nIf you really like [white] rice, there is little to worry about in terms of an auto-immune response and should be considered a more-or-less \"safe\" option (Sushi lovers rejoice!).

Angel continued to thrust, with every smack of his ballsack against George Washington's sack making Angel harder and harder. The tight-feeling of George Washington's extra butthole was unlike anything Angel had ever felt before, considerably more pleasurable than anything his hand could do. George Washington was quivering, his entire body thrusting backwards as a reverse to Angel's thrusting, creating a perfectly fluent, butt-fucking motion. George Washington and Angel took turns moaning loudly. Even Angel was surprised at his stamina, and amazed that he'd lasted this long. But all that was slowly changing. Angel could feel the cum beginning in his balls. he didn't want to cum yet, but George Washington's warm, tight ass was too good to stop. Angel began thrusting harder and harder, his orgasm coming closer and closer. Soon, it was too much. Angel pumped one last time, giving it his mightiest thrust yet and  unleashed a long flow of semen into George Washington's hot, sweaty asshole.\n\nAngel finally pulled out after what seemed like a pleasurable eternity. He stopped to stare at George Washington, whose formerly bright red, dull asshole was now moist with his own cum. Angel leaned closer, then obediently stuck his tongue deep into George Washington. All he could taste was George Washington's salty sweat and his own sweet semen. The thought alone that this was his own cum almost brought Angel to another orgasm, but he kept his composure and licked George Washington's fake ass clean.\n\n\"That was good boy, but now, you'll now what pure pleasure feels like.\" George Washington removed the rest of his uniform (cumstains on Nazi uniforms ruin the value.) revealing his broad, muscular chest, his bright pink, perky nipples and his 22 and a half inch cock. \"Oh crap\" thought Angel, the mere thought that George Washington's cock was going to be inserted inside of his own ass giving him visions of being torn in half. \"I don't think I can fit all of that.\" said Angel, worryingly. \"Bite the pillow. I'll make it fit.\" was the confident response.\n\n\"Welp.\" Using his own sweat as lube. George Washington forcefully inserted his cock straight into Angel's asshole. Angel's entire body quivered from the strain of George Washington's massive penis against his butthole. But something magical happened in those few seconds. In those few seconds, the amount of serotonin and dopamine his brain released spiked, reaching higher levels than ever previously released.\n\n\"OH FUCK YES!\" screamed Angel. As George Washington pile-drived his humongous dick into Angel's anus, Angel continued to moan and scream in ecstasy, engulfing all 22 and a half inches of George Washington's man-meat in his tiny butt. George Washington's pelvis moved with the speed of a machine gun, but with the accuracy of a sniper rifle. Angel's tiny, brown body could barely contain his pleasure.\n\nOver the next 20 minutes, George Washington continued to pound Angel's ass into submission, no closer to orgasm then when he started. Angel, however, had already ejaculated twice already, experiencing his first all-anal orgasm, a feeling he likened to a female orgasm. Then, with just a slight gasp, George Washington announced, \"Prepare your anus.\" \"Wait, what?\" asked Angel. Then, **BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!** In that  instance, George Washington completely emptied his load into Angel's ass, with so much force that it actually rocketed Angel off of George Washington's dick, leaving Angel airborne for the better part of five seconds.\n\nWhen Angel gathered his wits, he looked around, then took notice of the gallons of warm cum that covered every inch of his body. \"Holy fuck, that was amazing. Can we do it again?\" asked Angel excitedly. \"Okay, but before we do that, Imma nee a bow tree fiddy.\" \"What the-\" That's when Angel realized that he didn't actually get anally-fucked by George Washington in a Nazi uniform, but an 8,000 foot tall, aquatic reptile from the Paleozoic era. \"Goddamned Loch Ness Monster.

{"body": "What do you think of when you think of Africa? Do you think of lions, running on the open plains? Do you think of giraffes eating in the trees? Maybe you think of the meerkats buried in their holes. I think of KFC, but that's just me.\n\nGeorge Washington was uneasy on the plane. His thoughts wandered back and forth through his mind at the challenge he would face. He had to cure all of Africa, and he would cure them the only way he knew how. With his teeth. His wooden, termite-riddled teeth.\n\nAngel Fuentes was also on this plane. Only, instead of worrying how to cure Africa, he was learning how to play sucky emo songs on his guitar. What a pleb. As Angel continued to pleb up the place and spam his words on Reddit, George Washington looked out of the window. He watched the plains and the trees roll by, unbroken, except for the... what the fuck? Is that rice? George Washington yelled at the pilot, \"YOU SON OF A\n\nGeorge Washington was uneasy on the plane. Only now, he was in the pilot's seat, having thrown their pilot, John, out of the plane at altitude, somewhere over a rice field in Asia. \"I'm going to cure those sumnaguns if it's the last time I can wear this suit!\"\nThe plane touched down around noon, which is about 6 in Africa time. When they stepped out, the first thing George Washington noticed was an absence of white people and Angel noticed an absence of burritos. Both were very foreign concepts to the two of them. \"Well, well, well. If it isn't a honky and a worker.\" \"BLACK DYNAMITE?\" (DYNO-MITE, du duh, DYNO-MITE) Indeed, his blackness himself, Black Dynamite, was there before them. \"Now, what did I TELL them CIA honkies about interUPTIN' mah charity killins'?! Black Dynamite still has a lot a killin' ta do!\"\n\n\"We come not from the CIA, but of our own accord, to cure Africa.\" replied George Washington. \"Uh-uh, what is it about you honkies an tryin ta fix tha mothaland.\" \"I believe I hear trouble brewin', so don't mind me, I'll be goin'.\" \"Shut up, Bullhorn. If you honkies want to take over this here country, it'll take a nation of millions ta hold us back.\" \"Very well then\" replied George Washington. \"Come, slave-boy, we have much planning to do.\"\n\nThat night, George Washington and Angel camped out in the plane. This was much better than just throwing up a tent on the savanna. You know, bears and the like. Anyway, as Angel covered his second penishole (we believe it was caused by an evil, baby-dick-hole-punching doctor named Dr. James Russells) in order to use the bathroom, George Washington slipped into his finest pajamas. Well, they weren't really pajamas. It was a SS uniform from 1938. Mint condition. Oh, grandma, you so cray-cray.\n\nAs Angel exited the lavatory, he was slightly surprised at the sight of George Washington laying under the sheets. \"Come, boy.\" he crooned, playfully. Confused, yet obedient, Angel followed. \"We have a long day ahead of us. Come, let us relax before our work.\" He poured champagne into two glasses, handed one to Angel, then took a big gulp from his own glass. Angel wasn't as fast to drink from his own glass, becasue HE's SO LE COOLIO, TRUE STORY BRO LE XD XD sXe LOL! LEMON KEY FACE! George Washington leaned in close, almost whispering in Angel's ear, \"So, what's it like having to go through life with two penis-holes?\" \"GODAMMIT, IT'S A REGULAR FUCKING PENIS!!\" exclaimed Angel loudly, causing a lion to fart in the distance. \"I will reveal to you something that I have never told anybody, ever. I...have gone through my entire life...with the possession of... two buttholes.\" George Washington hung his head in shame, his dirty, brown secret revealed to his servant.\n\nAngel did not quite understand, and, being the Redditfag he is, started asking questions to someone he has never met, about something he knows nothing about, which he could easily find out more about with a quick Google search. \"So, every time you shit, you... double shit?\" asked Angel confused. \"Alas, no.. Only one hole is actually connected to any other organ. The other one is merely... another hole in my ass.\"\n\n\"Can I... feel it?\" asked Angel, a sense of amazement and guilt washing over him. \"You may.\" As George Washington undid his uniform, Angel could feel his formerly flaccid penis growing harder and harder. He was so confuse. Why boner? I thought we had an agreement. Only red-haired, chubby, rapeable hermaphrodites. But alas, his wood turned into plank, his penis rising to its full (insert actual size of Angel's penis here). George Washington bent over, revealing his two assholes to Angel, one stacked on top of another. It was beautiful. Two perfectly shaven, red buttholes. \"Boner of shame.\"\n\nAngel inquired as to which one was the extra. \"The top one.\" was the crooned response. Angel finally stopped staring and placed one hand on George Washington's smooth buttocks. He felt all over his firm bottom, eventually adding another hand to the mix. He got braver and braver, exploring more parts of George Washington's body.\n\nEventually, Angel could no longer stand the strain of his rock-hard cock against his pajama bottoms. He tore off his bottoms and underwear in one motion, his erection finally free from it's cage of punishment. He positioned it for insertion into George Washington's fake ass. Somewhere, another lion farted (what the fuck, did Angel feed them beans or something? Why are these lions so fucking gassy?).\n\nAngel spit on his dick to lube it up, but it was redundant as his pre-cum had leaked out of his other hole already, providing a more than viable lube.\n\nAngel thrusted his pelvis forward, with the force of a raging bull, into George Washington's fake ass.

{"body": "It can be a silly argument, but it isn't.\n\nFor example, you could argue that I am typing this response to you while utilizing a pair of hands with five fingers to each. You don't have any evidence for this. You don't have any evidence against it. All you have is the understanding that having a pair of hands with five fingers to each is the typical situation with people. It is reasonable to believe that I specifically have two hands, each holding five fingers. On the other hand, without any evidence in support, it would not be reasonable to believe that I specifically have fewer or greater hands, fewer or greater fingers, or some uneven distribution of ten on two.\n\nLikewise, barring *any* evidence of Sauron's incarnate status, it is reasonable to believe a character involved in current events of a story is embodied, because people who are not flesh and blood typically are not.\n\nFor we are not dealing in strict logic. Were we, it would be impossible to say more than a handful of things not stated explicitly in the text, and even then one could argue that nothing is necessarily literal. No, we are dealing with realistic applications of rational reasoning. Your Nessie example neglects to mention that we can *never* prove that Nessie isn't there, no matter how frequently and thoroughly we try. For practical use, as is our desire here, such strict scientific rigor is not only  unnecessary, but detrimental.\n\nSo, having the understanding that it is more reasonable for a character to have a body than not (and countering the idea that Sauron died three thousand years before with both the ideas that he is currently around and with the knowledge that he died and returned before), a single mention of part of the appearance of that alleged body by a second character is sufficient to conclude that the first does, in fact, have a body. It is not absurd, or silly, to then claim that the absence of evidence to the contrary, in a situation where we would expect evidence to the contrary if the contrary were the case, the contrary being the unexpected, strengthens the claim and raises it to the state of truth.\n\nThe point being that, contrary to your original assertion, the evidence, even ignoring the rest, is conclusive.

{"body": "Well I used to be a troll, and hopefully this will help you understand why. Back when I was younger, my dad always ignored me. He watched tv rather than play catch, he made me go to church but wouldn't take me to a baseball game (I don't even like baseball but I asked him all the time to take me because I knew he did, and I wanted to spend some time with him.) he just spent no time with me and overall was an asshole.\n\nWhen I was about thirteen though, he started telling me he would do things with me, like take me to go get that game I wanted, or next week we would go out to eat. He never really followed through with anything, but I still let myself hope a little bit every time he lied. Every time he said he just wanted to finish that game and then we could go get ice cream, I had to believe him. He never followed through, not once. Every single time he lied to me, just to hurt my feelings. \n\nWhen I got to be about fourteen I had become extremely cynical, I hated everyone and everything, and was a pathological liar. I started stealing things just for fun, just for the thrill to break the imprisoning monotony, if only for a second. Then one day, I got caught stealing. I had stolen a zippo lighter from the gas station, and the clerk called the police. The cop took me home and told my dad what I did. Here's how the conversation went\n\nOfficer \"Sir, I just caught your son stealing.\"\n\nDad \"Oh my god, what did he steal?\"\n\nOfficer \"Just a lighter, but I think you should keep a closer eye on him, next time he might rob the place, or kill someone.\"\n\nDad \"Son, why did you steal that lighter?\"\n\nMe *looking down, almost crying*\n\nDad \"Well officer, do I need to pay a fine?\"\n\nOfficer \"Yes you do.\"\n\nDad \"How much is it?\"\n\nOfficer \"Well it's five hundred dollars, but if you want I could make it not show up on his record.\"\n\nDad \"What would that take?\"\n\nOfficer \"Well I'm gonna need about tree fitty.\"\n\nOP is a faggot", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349486352", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": ".1)    \n**theKingMan**: I found the inspiration for this subreddit from the \"fox guy\", a strange man photographed in a fox costume. People requested that he do an AMA, but sadly it was removed.  Similarly, the AMA by Overly Attached Girlfriend was also removed, with the mods directing her to /r/adviceanimals. However, \"fox guy\" is neither an advice animal nor a meme. Thus, /r/internetama was born.    \n**AlbertIInstein**: Our growth catalyst has been the growing divide between the /r/IAMA moderators and users. It seemed /r/casualama lacked any sort of quality control mechanism, and /r/IAMA was being confusingly strict with their selection criteria. Even after they relaxed their rules to allow internet famous people, (on a case by case basis) Alexander Rhodes, the 8th most popular actor on IMDB, and Lynfect of cumbox fame did not make the cut. That made us saad pandas. /r/InternetAMA is our answer.    \n\n.2)    \n**loves_being_that_guy**: Right now by visiting /r/InternetAMA you can expect to see a lot of focus on reddit moderators, reddit storytellers, and famous reddit accounts. This was not necessarily planned.    \n**theKingMan**: A lot of people think that this subreddit is for internet-related things only, but feel free to think of the word \"Internet\" in \"InternetAMA\" as an address: \"Internet, ask me anything\". In other words, you should be able to find all kinds of AMAs here.    \n**SpagettInTraining**: It seems moderators and users alike have taken a liking to the channel we opened up between the respective factions of reddit. We make moderators seem and feel human. We offer a channel for novelty accounts to break character. We offer you a place to be heard, no matter who you are or how small you feel.    \n\n.3)    \n**theKingMan**: I think this subreddit would probably have received an even greater initial boost had it been created about a week earlier, at the peak of the backlash on OAG's AMA removal. I have expressed regret in not doing so. But on the other hand, we would not have formed this excellent mod team if timings had played out differently. Everyone here, working diligently, is what makes this subreddit into what it is today.    \n**RedditTreasures**: Considering the short amount of time we have been around, the community resembles itself since the day we launched. Our users have exhibited exemplary behavior, and we have not felt negative externalities from the influx of subscribers. They have come to define the phrase 'model citizens.' There has been no need for severe action on our parts thus far. (first person to say challengeaccepted.jpg gets banned /s)    \n\n.4)    \n**theKingMan**: We have a proviso stating the OP must write an opening blurb (paragraph) about themselves if they are not well-known. This stipulation performs three roles: 1) It forces the OP to put some effort into their AMA, discouraging lower-quality posts. 2) The opening post tends to attract similar comments: so a one-liner (e.g. \"Ask Away!\") tends to attract inane questions, while a detailed post tends to attract more complex/interesting questions. 3) It distinguishes us from other venues such as /r/casualiama and /r/shittyama.    \n**chlod4chlod**: Moving forward we are proactively chasing down stars from other venues. We are constantly taking requests, so come make yours. As mods, we are working hard to line up internet famous people from outside of reddit. We have a lot of ideas in the works so stay tuned, we are just getting warmed up.  \n\n.5)      \n**Rolmos**: [Our theme](/r/edurne).  \n**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE**: We look a lot better than some other AMA havens (caugh /r/IAMA.)         \n**theKingMan**: Plus, it seems that as of right now, we seem to be dominated by AMAs from redditors and reddit mod/mod teams. We welcome those, but we will be seeking to diversify. So basically, we resemble /r/casualiama, but with a greater emphasis on \"serious\" stuff as well as more internet-related AMAs. We are also the only subreddit whose mods will solicit AMAs from anyone whom they find interesting.  Our promo team is second to none, and that fact, above all else, is why we are such a success.     \n**AlbertIInstein**: To add to that, we are incredibly friendly.  Maybe not if you read our comment histories, but we treat our subreddit with the appropriate amount of levity.  At the same time, we are trying to maintain a minimum level of quality defined by an invisible bar.  Akin to the \"you'll know it when you see it\" rule set forth by Justice Potter, we strive to only remove the most egregiously low content posts.  'IAMA Teapot' will be removed, we don't care how stout you are.  Conversely, we will accept offers of porter any day however, hit us up if you want to go get drinks.       \n\n.6)     \n**theKingMan**: OAG, we missed the boat on her the first time around, and would love to have her come back to reddit and spend more time answering questions. Her plight was instrumental to the skyrocketing popularity of our subreddit.    \n**Thehealeroftri**: I would love to see TheAmazingAtheist and Bad Luck Brian.    \n**AlbertIInstein**: I have my hopes set too high and came up with a list of the following: Catherine Wayne, Karmin, Donald Glover, crashcourse, zeropunctuation, Jenna Marbles, Justin Bieber, Rebecca Black, Rucka Rucka Ali, Salman Khan, and VenetianPrincess.   I knows many of these people have done AMA's, but with the \"internet famous\" rule change, we believe our community to be more accepting and loving of their fame.        \n**NarwhalAnusRape**: Marina Vladimirovna Orlova, BodyRock.TV, Czech Fitness Girl.  I love you gals, come talk to us! Please!      \n**Onahail** : 5secondfilms, FND films, The Gregory Brothers, Lloyd Ahlquist, blamesocietyfilms, barelypolitical.    \n**Apostolate**: Gary Brolsma, Harley Morenstein, Blendtec, Jonathan Paula &amp; Jory Caron.    \n**Knowthem**: Epic Meal Time, a bad lip reading, agentparsec, and ZDoggMD.     \n**daskoon**: If you know any of these people, please shoot them a friendly message.          \n\n.7)     \n**All**: We love you subscribers, oh yes we do. We love you subscribers, it's true. When you're not with us, we're blue. Oh subscribers we love you! Join up, and encourage the Internet famous to drop in and post. Invite your friends. Ask everyone you know to come do an AMA. We want anyone with an ego who thinks they matter on the Internet, even the tiniest bit. Have you ever had 15 seconds of fame? Know somebody that did? We are all about learning what makes you click and and peering inside you to see how you do what you do so well. :) Also, /u/Thehealeroftri could use about tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349551052", "subreddit": "InternetAMA", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well... When I was 13 years old I began to get really, really curious about sex and all things similar.  People say that when boys approach that age they begin to get very horny.\n\nI was the exact same way as most boys, except I was willing to go a little bit further than just masturbating.   It started out as masturbating, then when that started to get boring I'd start to masturbate in front of them without trying to get caught.  You know, in the car under a blanket, in my room with the door open, etc.\n\nOne time I even masturbated at my Grandma's family birthday party while I was sitting right next to my mom.  \n\nBut anyways, that's just some backround on how daring I would get.  \n\nBy the time I was 14 I had even started to get bored with some of the riskier stuff and I was desperately wanting to lose my virginity so I decided I'd go get a prostitute.  \n\nIt was the middle of summer and I lived in somewhat of a run down neighborhood.  I was still middle class but many of my neighbors were definitely poor.  It wasn't that hard to find a streetwalker, I'd seen them all the time and knew where their general spot was where they liked to hang out.\n\nI snuck out of my window and began to make my way down the street to a certain street corner where prostitutes liked to hang out.  When I got there, there were two prostitutes walking around.  I walked up to them and they gave me some strange looks.\n\n\"How much for one of you?\" I asked the younger looking one.  She didn't take me seriously and kept telling me to \"Go home, kid.\"\n\nI persisted for about 5 minutes and eventually she realized I wasn't kidding, I really wanted to buy her.  She told me her price, I gave her some money (It was just recently my birthday, so I had some birthday money saved up as well as some from doing chores) and I told her to follow me.\n\nI walked back up the street to my house and we snuck in through the same window I had exited out of.\n\nSoon, I was on my bed losing my virginity to a prostitute. I had totally forgotten that my parents were home and just sleeping, so I didn't even think about the noise that was being made.  \n\nRight before I finished I heard my mom or dad get up and turn on some lights.  I began to panic.  \n\nThe thing I remember most is the prostitute kind of cared.  I would have expected her to not care, she'd been paid.  But she kept asking if I should hide in a closet or something since she didn't want me to get caught.\n\nI heard one of my parents coming down the stairs so I told her to get in the closet as she had suggested.   Just as the closet door shut my dad walked into the room.\n\n\"Thehealeroftri, were you masturbating?\"  \n\nMy parents were religious, so this would have been a big deal for them.  I played dumb, and acted like I didn't know what masturbation was.   My dad sat down and awkwardly told me what it was all while the prostitute I had hired was still in the closet.  This is by far the most awkward moment of my entire life.\n\nMy dad told me goodnight and started to walk out of my room.  The prostitute apparently thought it was a good idea to leave my closet at this time.\n\nShe opened the door and walked out of the closet, not knowing my dad was still in the room apparently.  My dad heard this, turned around and saw her then started screaming at me and her.\n\n\"What the fuck is this tramp doing in my house? What the hell are you doing Thehealeroftri?\"  \n\nI felt awful, I still do, not because I got caught but because the poor prostitute was near tears.  My dad was a really religious man, and this was the first time I'd ever heard him swear so much.  The whole thing was just unreal.  He exited the room screaming while my mom was asking what was going on.  \n\n\"I'm calling the fucking cops, right now, you stay right here, whore!\" \n\nI kept telling the prostitute to exit through my window and run away but she said she wanted to take the fall so *I* wouldn't get in trouble.  I was shocked, why would someone, especially a prostitute, do this?  \n\nThe prostitute started talking to me, \"My older brother did almost this exact same thing when he was your age, he got in so much trouble and I think that it mostly could have been avoided if his hooker had just stayed and taken some of the fall.\"\n\n\"I don't care, you're not even supposed to be here, I paid you, you can go.\" I kept saying as she stood there waiting.  \n\nBy this time my dad was waiting in the hallway and said some officers were on the way.\n\nThe prostitute kept trying to give me a life lesson, \"Let me tell you, don't get caught up with hiring prostitutes all the time, can you do that for me?  Make this your only time, can you do that?\"\n\n\"Yes, I can do that.\"  It was really awkward, because I really just wanted her to go.  I didn't even know her and she was making the moment a lot more emotional than it needed to be.\n\n\"Before I get arrested and try to take the blame, I need you to promise to never hire another prostitute again.\"\n\n\"Ok\", I replied. \"I can do that.\"\n\nShe walked towards the door after we heard a cop car pull up into the driveway. She said, \"Before I go, I need something else from you.\"\n\n\"What do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized the prostitute was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That goddamned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again!\n\n\"GODDAMNIT LOCH NESS MONSTAH, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nAnd that's my story.  My parents never did look at me the same after that and were always cautious about me whenever I was alone in my room.  I'm pretty sure they still don't trust me.  \n\nWe never did mention it again though, and I never did tell them what the prostitute was doing while waiting for the cops.\n\ntl;dr: Hired a prositute at 14, I get caught and it gets really awkward", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349562275", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 772, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've never told anyone this because it is really fucking weird. So back when I was 16 my mom and my dad were having a tough time in the relationship. I was old enough to realize that stuff wasn't going that well for them. They never really talked to each other and whenever they did it seemed like they were both being really mean to each other. The only time I saw either of them happy was when I was getting praise for my science project. I was a total nerd back them and was into that whole chemistry, electronics, physics scene. \n\nI would do little project just because I thought they were so interesting. I was not your normal kid. So anyways as the tension between them started build I decided to throw myself into my current little project was a small electronically pendulum type thing that was powered by a motor. Kinda like that pendulum in Iron Man but it hadn't come out yet, but it's the same concept. Anyways, I was so focused on completing this project because it was the only thing that made them look, seeing their son learning. \n\nWhen I finished it I showed it to them and they were so happy. I couldn't believe it, it was the happiest I'd seen them in months. So next day I went to school all jolly and what have you, then went to a friends house straight from school and told my parent's i was gunna stay there for the weekend. But me and my friend got into a fight which was unusual since we were best friends. As I got home the door was unlocked so I just walked inside. I heard nothing so I figured they went to bed. As I walked upstairs I heard a weird noise, and I realized it was my pendulum, but the motor sounded like it was straining. I ran into my parents room because it was coming from there and I saw my mom's brother going down on my mom will having anal done on him with assistance by my pendulum motor! I couldn't believe it! My mother screamed and I started running down the hallway! My mom was cheating on my dad, no wonder! But all of a sudden I heard my father's voice come from the bedroom. He was walking out in his underware with a huge boner and a video camera. He started explaining he whole situation.

{"body": "You misunderstood what I was trying to say.\n\nI maintain that all new ideas are marginal improvements on existing concepts. That's the key idea. It's a statement of fact, not of value: Whether that's good or bad doesn't matter. That has probably been the case since... let's say the paleolithic era to be safe.\n\nTo be precise, my argument has two parts you can attack, if you wish to: The words \"improvement\", and \"marginal\".\n\na) Every new idea requires a scaffold of existing related ideas that preceded it in order to be thought. Every new idea is merely an improvement of existing ideas.\n\nb) Compared to the improvement a new idea brings, the sum of improvements that its predecessors made is much, much bigger. Compared to all that happened before to make a new idea possible, the improvement a new idea can make is always marginal.\n\nMy argument fails if you can prove wrong either of these two points.\n\nSo for a: Show me a radically new idea. Something somewhere in history that is not an improvement of existing concepts.\n\nFor b: Show me an idea which, compared to the ideas that preceded it, was so much better that the improvement wasn't marginal.\n\nNote though: Marginal improvements sometimes can have big consequences. Evacuating an electrical light bulb has changed the world. But that still was only a marginal improvement on the preceding idea of the elecrtical lightbulb.\n\nOther example: Newton's Principipia Mathematica. That guy discovered the laws of modern mechanics, and by that founded modern physics. The consequences of his ideas were huge.\n\nAnd still the Principia was a marginal improvement on what was around already: The idea that there was something like gravity, and that it worked by the means of an inverse square law, that planets and moons behaved according to Kepler's laws, and the mathematical tools necessary.\n\nEven the most influential book in all of the history of science is merely a marginal improvement, compared to the thousands of years of thought and observation that had to precede it. Even that is merely a small pebble, added to the huge pile that was there already.\n\nSo if you have anything that is not merely a marginal improvement in the history of ideas, I'd be thrilled to hear about it!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349580758", "subreddit": "philosophy", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well you write like a guy whose mind is made up forever, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, so here goes. I guess sorry for the long post.\n\nIt's a fair point that Earth itself has problems, why spend all that money on intangibles in space? Starving children/Shiny rockets, seems like a no-brainer. \nWell, the comment about Columbus sailing off to India was totally relevant, because as it happens, while Columbus sailed away for silk and spices, he ended up finding gold and tomatoes instead, making Spain a very rich country. \nThe history of exploration is filled to the brim with unintended consequences; they leave looking for one thing, an ice passage, the Garden of Eden, and they come back with a fucking potato that feeds millions in the dead of winter. Have you ever stopped to wonder why Europe eats so many potatoes? it's not just because they're delish, it's also because a single potato, along with milk and some nuts and berries is a complete diet that you can live on. They're maddeningly easy to grow, you can carry enough of them to feed your family for a week in an upturned skirt, and they last for months in the closet, in the shed, on the shelf or in the ground. Invading armies felt it was beneath them to dig in the ground, so while your wheat crop was hauled away, dinner till spring was still there. That's fucking progress. \n\nIn the simplest sense, we don't know what we'll get by going to Mars or the Asteroid belt simply because we haven't been there yet. People knew the Earth was round, there are theories that people even knew there was at least one continent between Europe and Asia, but nobody knew what they would get because they hadn't been there. In the process of launching things and people into space, we will develop propulsion systems, computer systems, alloys and ceramics that we haven't dreamt of on Earth. I'm not technical enough to give you all the examples, but I know a big part of semiconductor and space age ceramics technology traces straight back to the US space program. These technologies are used in making your computer cool and fast, and if you have a ceramic cooktop, thank Nasa. Or don't because it's such a fucking bear to clean. \n\nWater is a huge problem in Africa. Wouldn't you know it, water filtration systems small enough to fit in a space capsule and filter shitty water into clean drinking water also applies to a village in Central Africa that doesn't have a truck resupplying it daily. Solar panels developed to run a satellite can power an internet relay in Madagascar so some tribesman can sell Vanilla on Amazon. \n\nOk, you're not sold. There are real tangible problems in the world, and the money that we're spending on space-age shit that might be useful 20 years from now is needed right freaking now. Fair point. I'm sure we can both agree that there have always been problems like starvation, war, disease and the like, yes? Let's say we stopped everything and tried to solve every problem next week, could we? Have we solved cancer in the 100 years of research? Have we stopped starvation? Can we electrify rural Africa in the next year, or will we constantly have to fight heavy storms, marauding hippos tearing down our poles and assaulting our linesman? \n\nMaybe you've heard the expression \"man can not live on bread and water alone.\" We need projects like space travel to give meaning to our lives and motivate us for something better. I don't know many people that would give up their lives to dig water trenches and open sewers. Even if we could solve all the world's issues tomorrow by simply focusing on them, would you be willing to give up movies and internet, games and desert to do so? I mean you don't really need it, right? Come on, if you're serious you'll never waste another penny again.\n\nThe fact is, throwing money at problems isn't the solution. In fact, the US military is a great example of what happens when you give people $1 for every ten cent problem. We have boondoggles on our boondoggles, and jets that cost hundreds of millions apiece can't fly without poisoning their pilots. Congrats. On the other hand, we have NASA that has to come up with real viable solutions when Congress gives them 10 cents for every $1 problem. It's astonishing they manage to get anything done, and we have memory foam mattresses to thank for it. \n\nUltimately I'm disappointed in this Orion project because it's *not ambitious enough.* The world isn't a zero sum game where working on one thing means not working on anything else; for every project we have, we have follow on projects for our follow on projects, and when you develop high speed trains all of the sudden you have to develop high speed cell towers to keep up with them, and so on. In my opinion, NASA would come up with a list of goals, and a reasonable cost estimate for accomplishing them. Then, Congress would take a look and make sure it's not bullshit, and write them a fucking check. Not this \"let's fly to Mars but I'm only giving you about tree fiddy\" bullshit.

{"body": "Third Grade.  End of school, and we're just back from art class or something.  Now we're all rushing to the \"cloak room\" to get our jackets (this was in the Paleolithic Era).  As I rounded my desk and changed direction toward the jackets in the closet, I slipped on a puddle of water.  Why was there water on the floor?  No idea, but it was apparently left by the (idiot) janitor who had just swabbed the floor while we were in art class in another room.  He could have waited until the school day was over, but I'm pretty sure he was the world's laziest janitor and just wanted to get home and didn't care what conceivable danger water on the floor would produce.  I slipped hard, fell forward, my upper row of teeth smashing into the desk next to mine, and knocking out my two brand new (8 years old remember) front teeth.  Blood everywhere, I'm in complete shock, the teacher comes in and sees this bloody kid and totally freaks out.  She grabs me and hauls me into the hallway and shoves my face into a drinking fountain.  I guess the idea was to keep the room as tidy as possible?  Someone was sent to the office, the principal called my Mom who was a stay-at-home Mom thank goodness.  She drove to school (1 mile away) in a complete hysterical panic.  By that time, I was sitting on a bench in front of the principal's office, toothless in front, and with an enormous wad of sterilized gauze stuffed in my mouth and not feeling all that good.  Somehow she managed to call our dentist in there somewhere.  We raced off to the dentist.  Now, today, you might save the teeth and maybe they'd be reattached?  Not sure if that's possible.  But in the Dark Ages, you just patched people up.  So, I got sterilized, swabbed down, and had two of the biggest ugliest plastic \"caps\" stuck into the upper front of my mouth that you ever could imagine.  And I spent the rest of my childhood and my entire adolescence with those Beaver Teeth as my signature \"look\".  Really helped with the girls, I tell you.  Later, I realized I could have them replaced pretty easily, and I was able to get real looking teeth attached.  My parents, apparently, as soon as the blood was mopped up, my Mom had calmed down, and the fake Beaver Teeth were attached pretty much lost interest in how I looked.  Of course, they had six kids, so I'm not surprised.  Moral: Don't run with teeth.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349588119", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I used to try to get porn by hanging around outside a gas station and waiting for a willing adult to help.  My friends and I would stay out there, sometimes for hours, before we even picked someone worth the attempt to ask.  It was quite scary to us, as if we could be arrested for asking or something; like we were attempting to bribe a federal agent.\n\nOne particular Saturday, we were out there yet again as we had learned from previous magazine editions that this particular issue coming up was going to have some very choice appearances in it and they were *locals*.  The girls in it lived near us!  We were very eager and thus, perhaps, a little too bold in our impatience.  We were asking way too many people.  We didn't realize it right away but we were drawing a lot of heat down on us.\n\nEventually we were approached by someone who identified herself as law enforcement.  She said that a lot of people were complaining that we were \"harassing\" people (which I guess technically we were).  So we ran... and we were chased.  \n\nWe ran across two major highways, up and over several fences, and ran into an open garage.  She was right on us when we stopped.  Couldn't have gotten there any quicker if she had already been in that garage.  So there we were, getting the second half of our lecture on bothering people... in some stranger's garage.\n\nYou would think this strange all by itself that the cop didn't lead us out of there right away, but it gets weirder.  She ended her little talk with, \"You do know I could arrest you for attempting to evade.  You didn't even break a law up until then.\"  When we were puzzled she said, \"Yes there's nothing illegal about asking people to buy it for you.  It would be illegal for them to say yes and actually do it for you, sure, but not for you asking.  You're juveniles.\"\n\nSo I said, \"I'm sorry, it's just that we love looking at beautiful women and none of them would ever talk to us in person so this is what we do.\"  She gave us a heavy sigh and walked us back to the shopping center.  She had us stand in front of the Baskin Robbins across the street from the gas station and she walked that direction.\n\nWhen she came back, she was carrying a clear plastic bag.  She handed it to us, and it was the very issue we were looking for.  She said, \"Look don't tell anyone I did this.\"  I told her that was the exact issue I had wanted and she said, \"Why, because I'm in it?\"  She then admitted she was not law enforcement at all, but had just overheard us asking people.\n\nI know it sounds awkward, but we started to slip through the pages trying to find her in it right there on the spot.  While we were going through the pages we asked her if there was anything we could do to thank her.  That's when she said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was then we realized that this woman was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.  The god damn Loch Ness monster had got us again.  We, of course, did not hand over the money but instead took our magazine and went home.\n\nWe never did find her in it, either.

{"body": "You asked for it.\n\nIf we're sticking to the dating category:\n\n(if we weren't #3 would be bumped down to #9)\n\n1.)Dating someone not for who they are, but for who they'll be.\n\nI'm not even going to get into how shallow this is. You don't even care for the person you care for an idea. \"He has so much talent. He'll be someone someday if he really puts his mind to it.!\" \n\nHe's someone right now and you don't like him. \n\n2.) Thinking abusers can change. \n\nI'm all for second chances, but when someone cripples you emotionally and/or physically you don't go back to them after you've gotten away. I've had women threaten to cut me if I so much as *thought* of going to the police on their behalf. Men have hid in my parents' backyard to get away from their verbally abusive wives. I've tried googling it, but there's no written reason for it. \n\n3.) See above. \n\nAnd women wondered why there was an [/r/askmen](/r/askmen) thread in which men thought our sexuality was unwanted. SHEEEIIIt. Somebody expressed sexual interest? HE MUST BE A PERVERTED MISOGYNIST BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE COMMITTED TO ME! WAAAHHH WAHHHH!\n\n4.) Reddit's Friendzone^TM.\n\n I've never seen so large a group of people this upset at the fact that people would like to be their friend. I frikkin *love* friends. Have you ever *not* had friends? It sucks! Go to a theme park by yourself. Go to a concert by yourself. Heck, GO TO THE MOVIES BY YOURSELF. That shit is lonely. Friendship is a wonderful thing.  It is completely different from what I knew as the friendzone growing up. \n\n5.) Which brings me to my #5^th point on this list. The actual \"friendzone\". \n\nThis is when someone you're attracted to strings you along and is also a *bad friend*. Think about it. If one of your friends was complaining about being single/lonely what would you do? Set them up with someone? Go out and make it your mission to get them some action? Heck, give 'em some porn? You do *something*. If one of your friends helped you out with something(a ride to the airport, moving furniture, about tree fiddy) you do *something* to show appreciation. When you go out with a friend, does he/she pay for you? Not unless they said \"my treat\" first! These people are friends. They pull their own weight and they enhance your life in some way. Either through fun, laughter, or just plain comfort.\n\nHere's an accurate test to determine whether or not you're in the actual friendzone: Ask the person who said \"let's just be friends\" to wingman/wingwoman for you. If they cockblock, then you're in the friendzone. \n\nAnother accurate test? When a dude who won't commit to you has sex with you, *then gets angry, jealous, and most of all* ***possessive*** *when you get yourself a boyfriend*. People call this the \"fuckzone\" It's just as stupid. It's a friendzone with sex. \n\n\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349711521", "subreddit": "AskMen", "score": 476, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Conquest                                 (never written sci-fi before. Here's just a lil somethin I whipped up)\n\nNormally, when you hop on a spaceship, it's not supposed to crash. It's not supposed to land on some exotic planet, people aren't supposed to get hurt; no one's supposed to be struggling to fight for their lives. That's what they told me when I signed up.\n\nTwo years ago, I signed on to help with this project. No biggie, right? We were headed over to a new planet, Turnaskaclout, and try to start mapping out the construction for a big stadium they wanted to put in. A PoundIt Ball Court. \n\nWe couldn’t even land the damn plane correctly. A rust bucket pilot ran us straight into the ground. And we crashed. We crashed hard. I was surprised everyone was still alive at that point. That’s the key phrase, though, ‘at that point.’ \n\n“Remain calm, please. Everything will be okay.” Those robot messages always have an eerie air about them. They sound cold, blank, empty. Like a college campus the week of spring break. I get a chill just thinking about it. The voice, I mean. It gets to you after a while. When you’ve been listening to them for some time. They always like, they hypnotize you; tell you everything will be okay. Spew statistics and shoot out flow charts of probability and such. I never bought it.\n\n“The fuck?” It was the president of our organization. We called him Cap.\n\n“I’m sorry sir. Please stop pressing the help button. An attendant will assist as soon as possible. Thank you.”\n\n“Damn machines. Talbad, status?” Talbad was our IT guy. He knew what was what. \n\n“We’ve crashed, sir.”\n\n“Smartass” Cap mumbled. “Give me some damn information, boy.”\n\n“Ship looks alright.” A pause. “That’s…not supposed to be on fire, is it?” I shot him a glance and ran over to the window. One of the engines had been caught in a brush and the greens were burning, slowly, approaching the ship like greedy hands in a graveyard, yearning to add us to their ranks. \n“I’m on it, Cap,” I said. I was sort of the Do-Whatever girl on the ship. I did anything the Cap, Talbad, Jemmy, and Marvanto couldn’t do. Sometimes that wasn’t as easy as it sounds. \n\n“Right, ok, Nessie. Uh, go ahead.” Cap’s the only one who calls me Nessie, everyone else calls me Ness, even my mom. \n\nI stepped out onto the soil and looked around. Turnaskaclout was a green planet. Lots of vegetation and clean air. We hadn’t yet contaminated it like the others, but the negotiations were being handled, and were later passed, once we got control of those snake things. It’s a shame, really.\nI picked up a FireStop kit and walked over to the fire. I’d never used one of these, I’d only heard about them. I threw it at the fire and watched as it shot a fine mist in all directions covering a good 5 square feet of vegetation with frost.\n\n“Fire’s out, Cap.” We don’t talk much, usually. It’s a waste of time and Thought Training. Thought Training’s sort of like studying, but it happens in your head and without you doing anything. Talking disrupts the activity and makes it difficult to learn. Silence is Golden and all that.\n\n“Good, good. The fuck is flying this thing?” He stepped over the bag that’d fallen to his side and walked up to the cockpit. “Hello? What’s your credentials, pilot?” \n\nThe door opened. “Unit CYV 4689327,” the robot said. An appropriately cold voice.\n“Figures. Why’d I think they’d let us fly with someone who knew what the fuck they was doing,” he yelled this last part directly at the Unit and it sat there staring ahead, oblivious to the change of tone and anger. \n\n“I truly am sorry. I am. I miscalculated.”\n\n“No shit,” Talbad scoffed. People call him Tally. I’d known him in high school and we’d stayed friends through college. Had a couple drunken hookups, but all was forgiven and we figured out we were no good for each other anyway. \n\n“You’re not helping anyone.” Cap was criticizing the Unit, something for which he was notorious. He hated the idea of robots. Not that they’re evil, just stupid.\n\n“I am doing my best, sir. I am programmed to–”\n\n“You ain’t programmed for shit. You have no real experience. It’s all simulations. If we replaced you’re sorry ass with a real pilot, damn it, we’d–”\n\n“Cap, you’re going off again.”\n\n“If I wanted your opinion Talbad, I woulda asked for it.” A mumble to the effect of “Sassy fuck.” I’m glad I never introduced the Cap to my parents. They’re a bit too conservative for his kind of...vernacular.\n\n“Sorry.”\n\n“Jemmy, Marv, you alright?”\n\nJemmy had been struggling to get out of her seat. “Yeah. I’m a bit stuck, though.”\n\n“I got it.” Marv was pretty smart. One of those nerdy kids in school, who did all the homework and participated in class. Always gave a lot of attention to his Thought Training, unlike me. \n\n“Always the show-off.” Jemmy was the youngest member of our crew. We picked her up around 3 months ago. She was bratty and a total daddy’s girl from the get-go. She never spent her own money. Probably didn’t even have her own bank account.\n\nWe were an interesting crew. We had all the attributes of old war buddies. Been through some shit, seen some shit, done some shit. We were good at what we did. Mapping things. Architecture and stuff. Nothing too drastic, nothing too interesting, except to us, but it was something. \n\n“Cap,” It was Jemmy. “You better take a look at this.” I walked over to where she was pointing. \n\n“What is it?” \n\n“Looks like a snake.”\n\n“Maybe a salamander.”\n\n“Watch out!”\n\nThe creature grabbed onto Jemmy and started squeezing her.\n\n“Guys, help,” she said between gasps for breath. It was instant. She popped like a gum bubble. Her head just exploded. It was kind of beautiful. Red and pink pieces scattered like the brain of a meth addict. Her eyes flew from her skull like shooting stars, blotting the ground the way the paint flicked from a brush by an aggressive surrealist blots the canvas. Her nose fell flat and landed on its side, perched on a small pebble, facing the sky. We weren’t sure what to do. We stood in awe. Just long enough for the second to grab onto Tally. Cap quickly ripped it off and snapped it in half.\n\n“Nessie, come on.”\n\nI was lost in a daze. The beauty of Jemmy’s head exploding still beating in my mind. I still remember when her eyes landed they seemed to look right at me, as if asking me for a reason why. \n\nI noticed Cap was yelling at me to come on. An evac team had shown up already. We were on our way out. We were leaving this place. We weren’t going back. I wasn’t. Why inhabit a planet with creatures looking to destroy everything in their path? It doesn’t make sense.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349757760", "subreddit": "KeepWriting", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I appreciate that you are answering.\n\nThis is a bit besides the point, but I dismiss God(s) the same way I dismiss the Loch Ness monster; the people who claim that there is one hasn't met their burden of proof. If someone shows me proof, I'll will change my position, since I'm not dogmatic about the results of reasoning, but could perhaps be called rather dogmatic on *how* to actually reason.\n\n&gt;I can see where you are coming from but it sounds like you are saying:\n\n&gt;I would do things according to my plan if I were God.\n\n&gt;My plan was created with logic.\n\n&gt;Anyplace Gods plan isnt what I would do, it is illogical and therefor wrong.\n\nWhat I was getting at was that I, far from omnipotent, could device a pretty simple way of increasing the number of people who would believe in what my holy book claims.\n\n&gt;It appears that you dismissing God and the Bible because you dont understand why God isnt doing things your way (ie explaining explicitly that we evolved from apes) which is pretty flawed logic itself.\n\nI think you missed a point (that is my fault though!)\nIf god is real, and he wrote in the bible that we have a common ancestor with apes then \n\n**a)** You would believe it, since it would be in the bible. \n**b)** All biologists would also believe it, since it's a fact. \n\nThis would make the bible match what we learn from observing the world, doing experiments, etcetera. If the book actually contained truth, then I would not have to rely on spinning it like Craig does to believe it. See what I'm getting at?\n\nAnd \"me not understanding God\", I give you that. I don't. I don't see the morality of slavery, justice in genocide, or death penalty on specific kinds of love. So yes, I don't understand why God does what he does.\n\nBut much more important is this: **God does not understand humans.** If he is real, this is what he did: \n\nHe decided to reveal himself to peasants living in bronze age Palestine, instead of going to China or Greece where they had civilizations far more advanced, and most likely better at keeping an accurate account of what happened.\n\nNot only that, but he accepted that his message be written in a language that he *knew* would more or less die out in just a couple of centuries, **and** he knew all these original accounts of his sacrifice would be lost, so that what we have now are copies of copies of copies. And the gospel that he makes them write contains *nothing* that will stand up to any critical scrutiny?\n\nAnd he knew we would get to this point, did he not? What he actually adds to the gospel, in regards to the followers doubting his existance, (since this is adressed from time to time, you can sort of see how the author, whoever that was, had a feeling this would come up) is not something that can convince anyone through evidence, but he resorts to faith. Which is exactly what a human does when he runs out of arguments.\n\nThe account of creation is factually not true, we know that much, through science. He could have written things that would match what we are learning about the world. I mean, even if he just added in genesis that he created stars and light at the same time would have been a huge improvement.\n\nOwning another human being is abhorrent, *we* have recently rejected slavery, which he knew we would. But he still approves it in his book.\n\nAnd he claims the right to *torture me forever* when I doubt his existence?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349790329", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Whoosh?\n\nHaven't you ever seen $3.50 executed on Reddit? \n\nNever fails at least once a week there is an Askreddit or random post where it happens. Someone responds in-depth and then it breaks into $3.50 time...\n\nFor example, let's take the above post...\n\n&gt; DISCLAIMER: This is all done using numbers off the top of my head. I have no formal economics training, but I've watched the WoW economy for years\n\n&gt; Now, the WoW economy is nothing like the real world economy, but let's say that the top 10% of players control 90% of the gold. That's 1 million players that are considered \"top tier\". 100,000 are the 1% of WoW.\n\n&gt; So how much does the 1% have? 100,000g? 250k? Let's say 250k. 100k players each have 250k, that's 25 billion gold.\n\n&gt; So you have the rest of the top 10%. Lets say these are the 100k+ club. These are the guys riding around on the super yak already. The guys who had the vial of the sands in the first weeks of Cataclysm. There's a million of 'em. 100 billion more gold.\n\n&gt; So let's say that 90% of the gold is wrapped up in the top 10%. 138 billion gold. A quick googling finds a site selling 1000g for US$2.59 on every US server. US$357 Million.\n\n&gt; Now, keep in mind, this is WoW. Literally every second, thousands of gold pieces are appearing out of thin air as people kill mobs, turn in quests, and vendor items. The gold sinks in the game can't do anything to keep up with it. There is no \"keeping the poor man down\" in WoW, where anyone can farm the same mats, learn the same recipes, the poor man is the man who doesn't do much. Right now, it's really hard NOT to have 10k, between dailies at 90, and all the leveling everyone's been doing. I had to give my wife 4k to buy her 310% flying when MoP came out, and now she's sitting on 10k.\n\n&gt; Let's say the top 50% have 10k each. that's 4 million more players, and 40 billion more gold.\n\n&gt; Then you have the lower income group. The PvPers who don't do instances, who don't farm, who don't loot anything to sell. Whatever they get is what they loot off mobs while leveling and grinding reps. I'll say the bottom 11-50% have 2k each. 4 million players, 8 billion gold.\n\n&gt; The bottom 10% are those \"below the poverty line\". These are the guys who grind but never loot. Who don't queue for randoms so they never get the reward at the end of the dungeon. Who don't do any quests. Those guys are trying to find repair money. Those who can't afford ANY gems or enchants. Let's say that's 1 million players, and they have 100g each. This is the legit beggar who couldn't afford to train back when you had to pay to train. The guy who is holding up the group because he's riding on his (slow) mount to the instance cause taking a flight path eats into his wallet too much. 100 million gold.

(Yes, this story is about a friend of my friend's sister, told by some random dude on reddit. Legit, right? Sorry, reddit, no proof.)\n\nThis guy from northern Jersey had been set up on a blind date with some chick, and they were to spend the day in NYC. Once there, he met a girl who was supposedly pretty attractive and who he was pleased to be spending the day with.\n\nAs they wandered around the city, he started feeling rather uncomfortable. After lunch, he'd let out a fart or two in a crowd or someplace which wouldn't be too noticeable, and generally tried to play it off like he was all right. Eventually, though, it got to be too much and, yes, he sharted himself.\n\nAs they wandered into a clothing store, he realized it would be difficult to get away to assess the damages, let alone find a bathroom on such short notice, and so the guy cleverly opted to buy himself some new pantz and underwear. To make it not seem too obvious, in case the girl had caught on, he decided to buy a sweater, as well. (Smart thinking, eh?) He paid for his items and they left the store.\n\nPresumably, this was near the end of their time together, and it became time for them to head home. They boarded a train back into Jersey, and he finally had an opportunity to clean himself up and change. On the train, he took his purchases, excused himself, and made for the bathroom. Once there, he quickly stripped, (presumably took his wallet and other usefuls) balled up his soiled underwear and pantz, and threw them out the bathroom's window. Finally, he opened his shopping bag only to discover that the cashier had neglected to bag his new pantz. So, changing his underwear, he tied the sweater around his waist, walked back to his date, and said words which I only wish I ever had the balls to say: \"I'mma need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nJust kidding. If you're still reading, thehealeroftri, I tip my hat to you, sir. For the sake of finishing the story the only way I know and to round things off nicely, what he actually said to the girl was this: \"I can never see you again.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349834998", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT!** I'll repost a story I posted a few days ago in response to /u/thehealeroftri (that bastard):\n\n&gt;So, this is a story told to me by my old roommate. It happened to a friend of his sister's, apparently. (Yes, this story is about a friend of my friend's sister, told by some random dude on reddit. Legit, right? Sorry, reddit, no proof.)\nThis guy from northern Jersey had been set up on a blind date with some chick, and they were to spend the day in NYC. Once there, he met a girl who was supposedly pretty attractive and who he was pleased to be spending the day with.\nAs they wandered around the city, he started feeling rather uncomfortable. After lunch, he'd let out a fart or two in a crowd or someplace which wouldn't be too noticeable, and generally tried to play it off like he was all right. Eventually, though, it got to be too much and, yes, he sharted himself.\nAs they wandered into a clothing store, he realized it would be difficult to get away to assess the damages, let alone find a bathroom on such short notice, and so the guy cleverly opted to buy himself some new pantz and underwear. To make it not seem too obvious, in case the girl had caught on, he decided to buy a sweater, as well. (Smart thinking, eh?) He paid for his items and they left the store.\nPresumably, this was near the end of their time together, and it became time for them to head home. They boarded a train back into Jersey, and he finally had an opportunity to clean himself up and change. On the train, he took his purchases, excused himself, and made for the bathroom. Once there, he quickly stripped, (presumably took his wallet and other usefuls) balled up his soiled underwear and pantz, and threw them out the bathroom's window. Finally, he opened his shopping bag only to discover that the cashier had neglected to bag his new pantz. So, changing his underwear, he tied the sweater around his waist, walked back to his date, and said words which I only wish I ever had the balls to say: \"I'mma need about tree fiddy.\"\nJust kidding. If you're still reading, thehealeroftri, I tip my hat to you, sir. For the sake of finishing the story the only way I know and to round things off nicely, what he actually said to the girl was this: \"I can never see you again.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349904553", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I decide to try my luck again by ordering another, I get lucky and the one that was dangling plus the second one I paid for come out. Not a terrible outcome. So I go back to my room to study more. A little while later I hear glass break outside my window and hear a loud \"fuck!\". I take a quick look out to see what happened, but don't see anything, so I resume studying. A little while later, I decide to go back to the vending machine, as I'm very busy with the studying and don't feel like going all the way to the dining hall.

I take a look at the candy in the machine and see a Reese's peanut butter cup dangling. Then it starts to click. Someone got pissed because the machine ate their money without spitting out the Reese's and smashed the window. I put in my money hoping to get a 2-for-1 this time. Before I can key in the number for the Reese's peanut butter cup, this guy comes up to me and says \"watch out, this machine is eating people's money. It ate mine a little while ago.

{"body": "Not trying to be a story-topper here but my junior year of high school something really similar happened to me. I was failing Spanish so my teacher asked me to stay after school so she could help me work through some grammar stuff I was behind on. I was pissed off because it was a Friday afternoon but she basically told me I'd get an F for the quarter if I didn't go to extra help. \n\nI know it's going to come up, so I'll just say it now: she was cute but in a quiet way, I wouldn't say she was hot. Wavy dark brown hair, glasses, mid to late 20s. Little dimples right off the corner of her mouth. Very soft-spoken during her lectures, kind of deep-thinking and reserved. Clearly intelligent. So while I was pissed off that I had to meet with her, she was pretty hard to be mad at.\n\nWe're in her classroom at like 4, maybe 430pm, so it's just us in there. She's trying to teach me about subjunctive clauses and I'm doing my best to keep up, but I really just didn't care, and it was Friday, so I started trying to make her laugh, get her to open up and talk about the class with me - we had some characters in it, and she and I had shared a couple of \"roll your eyes\" moments about some of the other students. She was clearly enjoying my company, but genuinely wanted me to learn Spanish, so eventually she got frustrated with me, gave this little sigh, and asked me why I was even in her class in the first place.\n\nI was in a goofy mood, so I didn't even think about what I was saying next, and I just let it slip out. I told her I had a crush on someone in the class, and was taking it for her. I thought she'd just give me a \"dream on\" scolding look and keep trying to teach me, but instead she took this this sharp little inhale, like a surprised gasp, and couldn't hide the genuine smile on her face. She was blushing. I couldn't believe it. No way she was into me. I was 17 and this was my teacher. No fucking way.\n\nThis was it. I couldn't believe it was happening to me. That was a clear sign, so I set all systems to go. She was really nervous, still blushing and looking down so her hair fell over her glasses and face. I reached out and lightly stroked her forehead, brushing her hair off her face, over her ear. My go-to move. She was clearly uncomfortable, but in a fidgety, excited way, so I didn't take my hand back, and started to slowly move it down the side of her neck. She was giving these weak little protests, whispering \"wait\", and squirming around but not moving my hand away. She was still facing forward, at the desk next to me, but out of the corner of her eyes, she was staring right at me, eyes wide as I stroked her neck. Finally this light tickling and flirting became so blatant, I had to go all in. So I thought fuck it, took a deep breath, and moved my hand about onto her thigh, about halfway up - right where her skirt ended.\n\n\"Do you like that?\" I asked, starting to rub my hand up and down her thigh. \n\n^\"Yes,\" she squeaked in a tiny voice.\n\n\"Well, what do you want me to do to you?\" I asked. The tension was so thick around us, the only sound was her tiny squeak as she turned bright red at my question. I started to creep my fingers further and further up the inside of her thigh, her bare leg warm and quivering at my touch.\n\n^\"What?\" she peeped. I could feel the corner of her panties now. Lacy, thin. Probably white.\n\n\"I said, what do you want?\" I repeated, as I snuck my middle finger under the corner of her panties. I could feel her straining, turning herself towards me in her chair, breathing hard and trembling.\n\n^(\"I want about tree fiddy,\") she said.\n\nIt was about that time that I noticed that my Spanish teacher was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. The loch ness monster!\n\nI said \"damn it monster! I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nShe said \"how about only two-fiddy then?\" and I said \"damn it monster, what is there a sale on Spanish grammar tips now?

I'm talking 11/10, always immaculately dressed, and, according to some, almost always wore a thong (she was the kind of woman who wears a skirt short enough that you could see it all if she had to bend over) and, as always, there's something incredibly sexy about a woman who can speak Spanish.\n\nNow, I myself was not the best Spanish student, in fact I sucked at it. I pretty much sat in Spanish 101 for 4 years. That's how bad I was. But, nonetheless, I tried my best. So, near the end of 10th grade, it was almost finals (yay, finals!) and one lesson at the end of the day (on Thursdays, last period was always Spanish) she called me over at the end of the period to sit down and have a talk with her. She said that over the past 6 months, I wasn't doing too great. My grades were below average for me, and below a satisfactory level. She said that I would have to try really hard to pass my final otherwise I would fail the class.\n\nNow, I'm not one to fail a class. I hate the premise of failure in it's entirety, but, further we go into the story.\n\nI asked her \"well, I have a lot of problems with conjugating verbs and such, and it's quite a hassle for me.\" and so we spent the next hour going through how to conjugate various verbs and such, and the special cases (ser, estar, etc.) and how to remember it easily. Even after this I was not getting it, and so she said to me \"Well, even if you can't conjugate verbs, there are other things you can do to boost your grades...\" to which I obviously replied \"like what? have sex with you?\" (jokingly, obviously. she was the kind of teacher that was laid back and joked about shit like that all the time)\n\nShe didn't even reply, she just looked at me dead in the eyes, and grabbed my penis. \"Yes.\" she simply said. She then planted her lips on mine and we started to make out for about 10 mins, her groping me, me groping her, when I asked her \"really? is that all you want? ;)\" (I added the face so you know what kind of tone I said it in.) and she whispered in my ear \"no, there's something else I need you to do for me.\" \"what's that?\" to which she replied \"I need about tree fiddy.\" And that's when I realized that a 150 story tall creature from the paleolithic era was standing on my penis, and that is why I can't make love anymore.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349979273", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I remember going to my first coed birthday party in the sixth grade. The girl I liked was going to be there so I had to impress her with more than my legit laser tag skills. I had to be a man. We had an exchange student living with us who was a senior in high school; he was basically my awesome older brother and I looked up to him like he was a god among men. He used axe in the mornings and had lots of girlfriends (though in retrospect it was probably his amazing soccer skills and accent) so I figured if I would spray some on me as well I would get the girl of my dreams. \n\nI proceeded to go into the bathroom and absolutely DRENCH myself in that stuff. Like a solid ten seconds of spraying it all around me. Then I realized it would probably wear off by the time we got to the party, so I went for another ten second round. Then it struck me that I would get sweaty running around playing laser tag, so I finished it off with another ten seconds. I was seriously a fire hazard at this point. \n\nFast forward to the party. I kicked ass at laser tag, ate pizza and played arcade games all night. After cake I finally get the courage to go talk to the girl I liked so much. She was playing DDR and I was ungodly good at that game so I was ready to show off. I stood around and watched for a few songs, until the other girl she was playing with got tired and decided to take a break. \n\nI hopped up on the machine, prepared to make her lust for me and my quick tapping feet. She was going to leave, but as she stepped down I asked her to do just one last game with me. She told me that she wanted to but had to get change first. Lucky for me I had come ready for hours of arcade games, so I had a ton of quarters left. I asked her how much she needed, and she told me \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was about that time I noticed my crush was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era. \n\nTLDR: I axe body spray is awful stuff.

This was in addition to my full-time job serving natural fruit smoothies and pastries in a Greek coffee lounge-type place.\n\nI wasn't getting much sleep around this time due to my various commitments, and I guess I started faltering at my job (forgetting to peel the bananas in the smoothies, serving the wrong shit to the wrong people) and I got fired because the owner of the shop was an eccentric old gentleman who didn't really tolerate poor work ethic.\n\nAnyways, I had told the call center that I couldn't come in for a while and they were severely understaffed, but when I found out that I now had a ton of free time I called them and told them I could come in and help out again. They were ecstatic because they didn't really have anyone in that day.\n\nI show up that day and what the hell do you know, Barack Obama is making a visit to the call center to thank them for their work. They actually point him towards me due to the excellent job I'd been doing up until this point. At this point my heart was kinda fluttering and I was really nervous, but I kept my cool as he started talking to me.\n\n\"lethargicwalrus,\" he said, \"I hear you've been spreading the word quite effectively.\" I practically cream myself in excitement, but I somehow respond something kinda neutral, I don't remember exactly what it was because my mind wasn't really working in the heat of the moment. Apparently it pleased him, because the next thing I know he's inviting me out of the room to talk with me in more privacy.\n\n\"I could use people like you in my campaign,\" he tells me. \"But I just want to make sure you're the right fit for the job, could you do something for me?\"\n\n\"Anything,\" I reply, my heartrate that of several drunk hummingbirds.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy,\" says Obama. It was about this time that I realized the future president of the United States was a 500 foot tall creature from the paleolithic era. \"Goddammit loch ness monsta!\" I cried, \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nHe accepted me into his campaign as chief organizer of telephone communications, a much higher-paying job than I'd had previously as a barrista and I'm still working with the campaign today.\n\n**TL;DR** met Obama while telemarketing for him, he gave me a much higher-paying job than I could have possibly hoped to obtain otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350194102", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 256, "controversiality": 0}

For instance, the Christian God and Allah would be more similar here, in that the absence of evidence is not justifiably the evidence of absence.\n\nFor the Loch Ness monster and Yetis, the absence of evidence is justifiably the evidence of absence. The difference is that these are physical beings that, if they exist, exist somewhere on Earth. We look at the evidence for their existence (perhaps amateur video) and weigh it against the evidence for their non-existence (never finding these creatures where they're supposedly sighted). In these cases, we're justified in believing they probably don't exist based on the lack of evidence that they do.\n\nWhile it makes it simpler to group all these beings together, we're not justified in doing so.\n\n&gt; What is the possibility of having 2 gods vs. none, 3 gods vs. none, ad infinity? They can't all be 50/50 as well, because they would contradict each other logically.\n\nThere's no rational way to really weigh all these gods against each other. No one's contending that they all exist simultaneously, and of course it would be contradictory for Allah and the Christian God to exist together. But this has no bearing on their individual existence. For instance, the soft agnostic, if he is consistent, will think both the Christian God's existence is 50/50 and also that Allah's existence is 50/50.\n\nThe Christian of course is justified in thinking Allah doesn't exist, since Allah's existence is contradictory with his God (and vice versa). In this case, a Christian or Muslim, in order to convince each other that their God is the true God, would need to bring up de facto defeaters of the God they think is false. But this is neither here nor there since you're not a person of faith.\n\n&gt; In the same way that I can say fairies don't exist, I can say gods don't exist.\n\nThis depends on the conception of \"fairy\" you want to use. Some regularly interact with humans. But I'll let you respond here if you want.\n\n&gt; Do I know with 100% certainty that there was or is never going to be a being in all of the universe that we could describe as such? Of course not, but that doesn't affect my beliefs that there probably isn't.\n\nAgain, no one's talking about 100% certainty. We're talking about what is reasonable to believe based on the evidence we have.\n\nThe Christian, though, has little reason to think fairies exist. Say, for instance, that someone believed they saw a fairy. A Christian is justified in thinking that these encounters are more likely do to his justified belief in angels/demons.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350225346", "subreddit": "ChristianApologetics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Again you compare everyone to Nazis in order to sensationalize\n\nAbsolutely not. I compared only those parties and actions to Nazis and Nazi actions that are actually similar; and because of my family background, it is possibly somewhat easier for me to notice just how similar they indeed are. I absolutely did not previously and do not now compare \"everyone\" to Nazis, and moreover, when I compare specific parties and actions to Nazis and Nazi actions, I don't do so to sensationalise, but to warn. \n\n&gt; The invasion of Poland was making war. Unjust and wrong yes, but it wasn't crimes against humanity\n\nI am not surprised that somebody so in need of being warned proves himself thoroughly ignorant of the Nuremberg Principles. Look at [principle six](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_principles#Principle_VI). \nNB: [Principle four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_principles#Principle_IV) is also highly relevant to this thread. It was precisely the oft-repeated, stereotypical Nazi excuse of having \"only followed orders\" which lead to the formal encoding of the obligation to disobey immoral orders – which this thread is about. \nBut to return to principle six and [rub it in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_peace#Nuremberg_Principles), in case [you've still missed it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression):\n\n## The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, which followed World War II, called the waging of aggressive war \"essentially an evil thing...to initiate a war of aggression...is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\"\n\n**tl;dr**: Memory *is* RAM.\n\n&gt; and it was the politicians and leaders in the wrong, not the soldiers. \n\nThat's EXACTLY what most (\"former\") Nazis said after the war. But look again at Nuremberg Principle Four. That Nazi excuse did not stand then and it shall not stand now.\n\n&gt; (and where the whole nuremberg defense comes in) \n\nIt's odd enough that you now actually mention Nuremberg after you've shown yourself as ignorant of its trials and principles as we've seen above, but it absolutely boggles my mind how you can mention the Nuremberg defence *right after resorting to it yourself.*\n\n&gt; where as we are already out of Iraq and didn't even help ourselves to the oil. \n\nMan, it's about about tree fiddy here. You can't do that to me. The neighbours will complain because of my roaring laughter at shitfaced o'clock.\n\n&gt; There are different ways to prevent human rights violations, just because different countries spell them out in different ways doesn't mean that they don't care.\n\nYou've *still* not understood the essential point. Read the positive temperature coefficient part of my previous response again. And really, I don't know in what other ways I could explain this to you. Maybe someone else has some more ideas and patience. But I'm frankly suspecting [Sinclair's Law](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sinclair%27s_Law) at this point.\n\n&gt; It seems like you are just eager to demonize the US.\n\nYou're the one who brought up the US. Defensively. And that's a start. Because the fact that you did so proves that at least on some level, deep down you know why. Work on that. And read Bullock's [Hitler: A Study in Tyranny](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0140135642/) to begin with. (NB: The abridged version is for pussies.)

{"body": "Okay, I'm going to tell you my story sans throwaway because fucking whatever.\n\nI was assaulted when I was in middle school.\n\nI had a teacher, we'll call him \"Mr. L,\" and he was my history teacher.  I was decent at school, but for some reason history just didn't click.  I guess all the memorizing of dates and names just was hard for me, I don't know.  But when we got our grades, I had all A's except for history, where I had a B-.  My parents got super mad at me because my sister did really well in school, and they expected me do as well as her, but that's a whole bunch of other shit that I don't want to get into.\n\nMy parents called Mr. L, and we set up a meeting to talk about how I could improve my grade.  He said he doesn't give out extra credit, but he suggested staying after class some days to tutor me.  We all thought this was a pretty good idea, especially me because I just wanted my parents to not be so disappointed in me.\n\nSo I started getting tutored.  For the first couple weeks nothing weird happened, I would go into class and he would sit down next to me and read and study whatever we were learning.  After I got question right, he would pat me on the back, then after awhile it turned into rubbing my shoulders, and after a couple weeks he would give me a hug at the end of the session.\n\nThen one day I was reading state history after class with him, and he put his hand on my knee.  I stopped reading and looked up at him, but he just started sliding his hand up to my thigh, then my crotch.  He just smiled at me and started rubbing me there.  I was still young so didn't really know about stuff like that yet so I just let him do it.  After awhile he stopped and I went home.  I didn't tell my parents, of course.\n\nThis went on for some time, me showing up for tutoring, studying for a bit, then rubbing me, kissing my neck, having me touch him.  I didn't know what we were doing, but I knew I didn't like it.\n\nHe started touching me more, like during class, he would walk around the class, and come up to me and brush my back with his hand.\n\nI started getting sick.  Well, not really sick, but telling my parents I was sick so I wouldn't have to go to school.  I just couldn't bring myself to show up to school.  Looking at all the other teachers and kids, I feel like they knew what I had done.  I felt like everyone had heard and they someone told them I liked it, and they were talking about me behind my back and laughing at me down the hall.  So I didn't go to school.  Just for one day at a time, then two, but one time I was gone for a whole week.  \n\nAt the end of that particular week, I was home alone because my parents were at work, and the door bell rang.  I was confused because nobody had ever come by at this time before.  So I answered the door, and Mr. L was standing there.  \"Haven't seen you at school in awhile\" he said.\n\nI was so scared.  I didn't know what to do, so I just said \"What do you want?\"\n\nHe said \"About tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350274557", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I used to work at a McDonalds when I was a teenager.  It wasn't a bad job as one would have you expect, sure it sucked and I had to deal with a lot of shitty customers but overall it wasn't a bad experience.\n\nBut one day in particular sticks out to me.  Our McDonalds was not usually very busy, and it was no different on this day.  One of my co-workers was a really cute girl.  I was an awkward teenager so I didn't even think about asking her out, but I really enjoyed talking to her and working with her.\n\nAnyways, at around 1:00 which is the end of the lunch rush, an obese lady walks in along with her trashy, dirty looking husband and her large children.  Usually I can deal with rude customers, but this lady was beyond rude.  \n\nFor context, just the week before I'd gotten in a car accident and my face was pretty banged up.  I had a black eye and multiple cuts on my face.  They were healing pretty well, but still definitely visible.\n\nShe rudely orders her food, treating me as if I was a lower person, and then goes to sit down as she finishes ordering her food.\n\nMy manager happened to be walking around and she calls him over and quietly tells him something.  My manager comes over to me and tells me that she's offended with the cuts and bruises on my face and he asks me to go into the back so she doesn't have to look at me.\n\nI was so offended, I told him that it wasn't my fault that I looked like that.  Apparently, the fat cunt overheard and started telling me that she doesn't want her children seeing someone that looks like me when they're eating because they might get sick.  By now I was about to cry but then the co-worker I was talking about earlier steps up and defends me.\n\nShe starts yelling at the woman (with our manager right there, mind you) and telling her that she's a disgusting person.  I couldn't believe it.  \n\nAfter a minute of her yelling at the fat cunt, the fat cunt's husband starts screaming at her and their kids start crying.  The manager is telling my co-worker to stop getting angry at the woman but she doesn't relent.  \n\nI sat there trying to hold back tears and feeling useless as people around me were yelling at each other.  Eventually, the woman's food is done and she takes it and storms out of the McDonalds along with the rest of her fatass family.  \n\nMy manager isn't happy about this, and he scolds my co-worker for doing it and then fires her on the spot.  I still feel absolutely terrible about this and I felt terrible then.\n\nMy co-worker wasn't even phased though.  After my manager went into the back a few seconds later, I followed her outside to her car and started talking to her.  She said she had been planning to quit for a few months now and couldn't stand seeing people treat me the way that they had treated me.\n\nI asked her if there was anything I could do for her, because I felt like I owed her something.  She just said, \"Nope, I can't think of anything right now.\" \n\nWe talked for a second then I decided I should probably go back in, as I was heading in she yelled after me, \"Wait, there is something you can do for me.\" I turned around and said, \"What do you need?\" \n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that my co-worker was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That goddamned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again!\n\nI kept working at McDonalds after that but I never felt the same without her around.  I eventually ended up quitting that job a few months later because I was sick of the terrible customers and my passive aggressive manager.\n\n**tl;dr: Stupid woman at McDonalds gives me shit, my co-worker goes above and beyond to defend me.**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350675482", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 375, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Storytime motherfuckers.\n\nWhen I was 17 years old I hung out with a group of people who were kind of on the wilder side.\nThere was also a girl in this group who was very beautiful, 9/10 at least.  I always tried to flirt with her but she always had a boyfriend or just seemed disinterested.\n\nOne day me and some friends went to a concert, it was a really fun concert but the entire time I was just wanting to hang out with this girl.  I knew she'd just keep rejecting me, but I was a complete beta and couldn't help myself.  I just liked being around her.\n\nI was the only one in the group who had a car and their drivers license so I was the one who picked everyone up and dropped them off.  After the concert I purposely dropped everyone else at their home first so it was just me and the girl alone in the car.  I wasn't planning on making any move because I'd tried before and nothing ever worked but I did like the feeling of being alone with her.\n\nAs we pulled up to your house, I said goodbye to her and without warning she leaned in and kissed me.  I was in shock.  She looked at me with those blue eyes and told me to come inside with her.  Then she winked.\n\nI kept thinking to myself \"Fuck. Yes.\" over and over again.  I couldn't believe this was happening.  You know where this is going.  We go in her house and no one is home.  She leads me up to her room and we start making out.  Eventually I'm sliding off her shirt and her pants.  We're both almost but naked except for our underwear.\n\nI slide off her underwear and soon we're having sex.  Once we finish we layed in bed for awhile.  I've never been so happy in my life in those few minutes cuddling with her.  She turns to me and gives me a look, something that says, \"are you read for round two?\"\n\nWe start kissing again and as we're about to rub our private parts against each other's again she stops me and says, \"Before we do this, I need something...\"  she said.  \"What do you need?\" I asked.  \"I need about tree fiddy.\n\nIt was around this time I realized that my friend was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That goddamned monster had gotten me again!  \n\nDon't even say you didn't see this coming.  This time the trap story is actually relevant to the conversation.

{"body": "Alright, here's how this would play out:\n\nI'd make reservations at the fanciest restaurant I could afford. (Sure, I already know that I'm getting lucky tonight, but why not make it a memorable evening?) I'd bring her flowers and a jar of captured starlight, because if I'm setting up to bang a mythological creature, I'm going to bring some mythological physics along as a gift. I'd pick her up, apologize for the mundane nature of my car, and bring her to a verdant park, where we'd walk and talk through the afternoon.\n\nWhen the time came to go to dinner, I'd explain - if she didn't know already - how to use the city's subway system. (Downtown parking is a nightmare; well-planned date or not, I would *not* risk my evening on the availability of a parking space.) We'd people-watch and laugh, feeling sparks fly between us as we brushed against each other with each movement of the train car.\n\nUpon arriving at the restaurant, she'd discover that I had hired a string quartet to play during our meal. (They'd sit over in the corner, and they'd play quietly so that my date and I could still talk to each other.) We'd share stories, learning about one another. I'd confess my surprise to her being so savvy about the modern world, fantasy creature as she was. She'd find that endearing, and admit in kind that she didn't have much practical experience... in fact, most of what she knew, she learned from television shows.\n\nAs the night grew deep around us, we'd head to the fancy hotel room I'd reserved. There would be a minor misunderstanding with the bellhop, but it would be quickly resolved... and he'd have one hell of a story for his mother, let me tell you that! My date and I would ascend to our room, our hearts pounding in our chests, our fingers slowly intertwining as we approached the door that would lead to our final destination.\n\n\"I don't know if I mentioned,\" I'd say to her, \"but you look absolutely beautiful tonight.\"\n\nShe'd smile at me, blush slightly, and whisper her thanks. Then, our lips would meet, we'd embrace each other, and we'd slowly help one another out of our clothing. We'd fall to the bed, our motions growing more passionate, until at last we became as one body, folding together like waves against a warm beach.\n\nWe'd lay in the afterglow, holding one another. I'd turn to her with a smile.\n\n\"Can I get you anything?\" I'd ask.\n\nShe'd look back at me and bite her lower lip, as though she was both tempted and embarrassed to ask at the same time. Finally, she'd slide towards me, put her lips beside my ear, and answer: \"I...

They call the guy....he says he's on the job site, but his wife was home. He calls her and tells her to take the delivery and sign for it. \n\nA minute later she comes down and opens the door, and HOT DAMN! she was amazing...at least 15-20 years older than me for sure, but wow, easily a 9....tall brunette, low cut tank top, short jean shorts, and a body to die for!

I said it's ok and that i'm just glad I was able to get the prints there.\n\nShe signs for it and asks me if I'd like a glass of water or something before I go...and of course whatever buys me more time to stare at her, I'm all about it! She invites me into the kitchen and gets me a glass of water.

Nevertheless, by this age she was actually fairly attractive and had definitely become more confident in this regard. I'm not like most other fathers, I was happy for her to have boyfriends- as long as he was a decent guy. \n\nSo, this dude- Jack, he was called- comes round to dinner at our house. I must admit perhaps being a little brusque with him, just to make sure he was genuinely interested in my daughter and nothing else. I figured if he put up with a little early rudeness then that would show he was committed to making it work.\n\nI must admit I was seriously impressed. He greeted us with great friendliness- even going so far as to bring flowers. He offered to help during the preparation of the meal- an invitation I feel we had to decline. Throughout his manners were excellent and by all accounts he was great company. \n\nSo, he asked me... \"Excuse me sir, I don't suppose I could take your daughter out for a drive?\". Now, I must confess I perhaps had wind of his intentions, but if he was an actor he was a very good one. \"Alright\", I replied, \"Seeing as you seem pretty decent, you may. But be back by 12:00\". A fair time, I thought.\n\nWell, he sets off with my daughter, and I sit up waiting for her to return. It gets to midnight- and there's no sign of them. I call his mobile (he'd given it to me earlier in the evening). No reply. I'm panicking now- when at about quarter past I get a phone call from my daughter in a tearful state.\n\n\"Darling, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Dad\", she sobbed, \"it's awful.

{"body": "In high school, I used to be very socially awkward, to the point of having almost no friends.  So generally my birthdays were bland and depressing as I sat playing video games as another year of my life passed by. But in the months leading up to my 17th birthday, I developed a crush on a classmate. She was obviously the hottest girl, in the school, easily a 10/10, incredible body, face, and personality. And my crush grew to the point of obsession. In retrospect, she probably flirted with me quite often, but being so insecure, I assumed that she was teasing me. This pained me to no end, I was certain my feelings were unrequited. \n\nThe day before my birthday, her boyfriend, an incredible douce, noticed that I was looking at her. I really have no idea how someone as wonderful as her could have ended up with someone so awful as him I tried to hide my interest, but it probably was obvious no matter what I did. He swore at me for trying to take his girlfriend. He threatened to beat me up if he saw me do it again, and I almost wet myself in fear. That night I cried myself to sleep knowing we could never be together.\n\nThe next day, my birthday, I had already resigned myself to moping in shame after the previous day's event. But oddly, as I was walking home from school, I happened to notice my crush walking behind me. I feared being disappointed again or invoking the wrath of her boyfriend so I quickened my pace and tried to avoid her. But sure enough, she eventually caught up to me. She began by apologizing for her boyfriend's actions and told me she wanted to break up with him, but was worried he might react violently. She then broke down in tears and told me that she loved me, that her relationship was just a front, so her 'cool' friends wouldn't be upset at her being with me. I put my arm around her and told her it would be alright. That seemed to cheer her up slightly and she suggested we go back to my place. I still was in disbelief and almost expected this to be a cruel prank, but still, my hopes were lifted.\n\n Pretty soon, we got home and ran up to my bedroom. In almost no time, we stripped off our clothes and were making out. Shortly she gave me head, I could barely believe my luck. After that, after months of thinking my crush was unrequited, I finally lost my virginity to her. It really was too wonderful to describe. \n\nMy parents were out of town so she stayed the night. After having sex again the next morning and eating breakfast, she told me she should probably go back home so her parents wouldn't get worried. I suggested she just call them and tell them she was fine, but she said they would still worry and insisted on going. As we kissed good-bye, she said she had two questions for. First, \" Do you really love me?\" It may have been just the hormones, or the heat of last night, or the thrill of finally knowing someone loved me, but I had no choice but to say yes. Then she asked, \"Do have 'bout tree fiddy?\" And it turned out she was a six story tall mesozoic monster from the Loch Ness.\n\n**TL,DR: DM;HS**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350869160", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[–]unashamedlibertarian 1538 points 5 hours ago\nLet me tell you about the time that my 17 year old daughter first got a boyfriend.\nI'd always worried about her, as she was quite a late developer and had been teased in the past for her looks. Nevertheless, by this age she was actually fairly attractive and had definitely become more confident in this regard. I'm not like most other fathers, I was happy for her to have boyfriends- as long as he was a decent guy.\nSo, this dude- Jack, he was called- comes round to dinner at our house. I must admit perhaps being a little brusque with him, just to make sure he was genuinely interested in my daughter and nothing else. I figured if he put up with a little early rudeness then that would show he was committed to making it work.\nI must admit I was seriously impressed. He greeted us with great friendliness- even going so far as to bring flowers. He offered to help during the preparation of the meal- an invitation I feel we had to decline. Throughout his manners were excellent and by all accounts he was great company.\nSo, he asked me... \"Excuse me sir, I don't suppose I could take your daughter out for a drive?\". Now, I must confess I perhaps had wind of his intentions, but if he was an actor he was a very good one. \"Alright\", I replied, \"Seeing as you seem pretty decent, you may. But be back by 12:00\". A fair time, I thought.\nWell, he sets off with my daughter, and I sit up waiting for her to return. It gets to midnight- and there's no sign of them. I call his mobile (he'd given it to me earlier in the evening). No reply. I'm panicking now- when at about quarter past I get a phone call from my daughter in a tearful state.\n\"Darling, what's wrong?\"\n\"Dad\", she sobbed, \"it's awful. He used me for sex, laughed at me, told me I was terrible and then threw me out of his car in the middle of nowhere. I'm gonna need- \"\n\"What? A lift?\"\n\"No. I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\".\nIt was at this point that I realised that my daughter was an 8 storey tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.\n\"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!\" I yelled down the phone, \"Get your own goddamn money!\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350870125", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So there I was, about 10 years old hanging out at my local swimming pool on a hot summer day, just minding my own business, being a kid and playing around, when all the adults at the pool start whispering to one another and pointing. Now I've got a vague idea of who he is at the time thanks to Ghostbusters, but I didn't realize he was such a comic icon, much less have any knowledge of the classic movies he was in. Well my dad, being a huge Caddy Shack fan tells me to go to the snack bar and buy him a Baby Ruth, and what ever else I want. So, here I am feeling like a boss with a fresh Abe Lincoln waltzing over to the snack bar. So i get over there, ask for a hot dog, a coke and a Baby Ruth. Turns out they don't serve them, but the cashier informs me that they do have Snickers, which is basically the same thing. So I go ahead and get the snickers, plus my food, and strut back over to my dad. I give him the Snickers and he proceeds to promptly unwrap it and toss it in the deep end. Well the life guard sees this brown floating thing in the pool, and proceeds to clear the whole pool. It's at this point that I'm thinking that my dad's gone crazy, and the pool will be closed for the day to clean the whole thing, so I dive in after the deliciousness that is nuget layered in caramel, topped with peanuts, and covered in decadent chocolate to allieviate the whole situation. I swim up to the Snickers and reach out, but before I can grab the chocolaty goodness, another set of hands snatched the brown baton. It was none other than Bill Murray.  He holds the bar high in his hand for the entire pool to see and yells \"Here it is!\" takes a wiff, and takes a bite. Everyone in the pool area bursts out into laughter, and I have a look of shock on my face that he stole my thunder. And whispers the magic words in my ear.  I swim back to my dad, and he asks me what he said. Confused I replayed \"...he said 'Imma need about tree fiddy.'\" Well it was about that point that I realized that Bill Murray was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. My dad said \"Damnit monster get out of our pool! I aint givin' you no tree fiddy.\" Loch ness monster sure got us good that day. I didn't know he did this to other people a lot, makes the story seem a little less special, but it still makes for a good story.\n\nTL;DR?

{"body": "This was back in college when I worked as a waiter at a restaurant. The area the joint was at was kind of seedy but jobs were scarce so there I was. \n\nIt was closing time, the manager tells me to lock up and leaves. There I am sweeping the floors, arranging chairs and whatnot. I turned out the lights and I headed for the door when I saw two men standing outside. Neither of them had noticed me in the darkness so I knelt down and crept over. Through the crack in the glass doors I could overhear what they were saying. \n\nIt was then I realized that it was witnessing a mugging. \n\nThe first man was threatening the second for money, while the second was pleading with him. I can still remember, he said \"please, I have to feed my daughter\" and the man was just shaking his head saying \"give me your money.\"\n\nI was kind of shellshocked and realized that I had to stop this somehow.  I couldn't just let the mugging happen. But how? I had no weapons, I had nothing to defend myself and break up the fight. I looked around, and noticed a fire extinguisher on the other side of the door. I don't know what I was thinking, maybe I was going to bang him on the back of him head, or just spray him with the foam to disorient him. But as I was creeping towards the extinguisher I saw the man tilt his head in my direction. Our eyes both made contact and I knew I was fucked. \"get out here or I'll shoot you bitch\" he commanded. I stepped out cautiously, my eyes focused on the gun the entire time. My mind was racing a thousand miles a minute, I thought for sure I was going to die. I croaked out a feeble \"w-what do you need?\" to which the man replied \"I need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nIt was then that I realized the mugger was a 500 foot tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.\n\n\"Fuck you Loch Ness monster!

{"body": "I think the idea that a sparsely populated geography comprised of roaming, 30-person, foraging kinship groups could undergo anything like famine is pretty novel.  That was the scale of society for all but the last .015% of the Paleolithic era.  They did the same thing year-in-year-out for generations, often over the same rotating pieces of land.  You could never have whole populations affected by a single crop disease because everyone ate thousands of different things.  One theory of our cranial mass (also on the decline of late) was all of the specialized knowledge necessary to recognize, harvest and process all of these gathered goods.  It was incredibly stable, like it is for apes, only wit the added benefit of bipedal migration and big-brained processing and recognition.  I realize there is a prevailing narrative that there was scarcity and agriculture solved it, but the evidence I was exposed to does not bear this out, much less alternatives to the idea of 4-year offspring spacing as the motivation for abandonment/infanticide.  It is not only archeologists like jared diamond who believe this, but both anthro teachers I had (One from Berkley one from somewhere in Germany) both of whom disagreed with him on many other points.\n\nI was under the impression that there is little if any evidence that h.sapien populations even came into contact with h.neandrathal, though there may be new info since my professor told me that.  He said they occupied the same areas as us, but that it would be a leap to say we had meaningful contact.  That said, I am not denying that prior to the upper paleolithic era we did not compete with other species.\n\n&gt;total calories available to human brain development, developed a keen ability for long-term planning and a docility\n\nNot to be an ass but we survived a long time without those things, and we are pretty close to killing ourselves of because of them.  I don't say this because I think we should unlearn everything, only that we need to try to leverage what we know toward making these idiosyncratic developments work *for* us long term, rather than against us.

None of that ever seemed to build my confidence though, especially around girls. It's like they can smell the lack of self-esteem on you.  \n \nSo senior prom was coming quick, and I still didn't have a date. Back then there was this one girl I had been infatuated with for years. She was petite with bright blond hair and adorable freckles. The classic beach girl. She was the first person who was nice to me there and I was smitten. I found out she was single, and still didn't have a date to prom. Thinking that I'd never get her to say yes by just asking, I decided to do something a little grandiose. \n \n \nI wrote her a long poem, trying to capture how I felt about her. About the years I had spent as her friend, but always wanting more. About how I had seen her slew of abusive boyfriends, knowing I could treat her better. I won't go into it more, but it got pretty involved.  \n \nBeing as awkward as I was, I couldn't just hand it to her, so I left it in her locker. \n \nThat day at lunch she came up to me and said \"So...I read your letter. It was...sweet? I didn't know you felt that way about me, but you're just...not what I need right now. You know?\" \n \nSo I asked \"Then what DO you need? Just tell me and I'll change. I just want to be with you.\" \n \nShe turned to me and said \"Well...I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" \n Well it was at about that time I noticed my high school crush was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "This was a few years back. I live in the PNW and spend a lot of time fishing up in the Columbia River Gorge, prime Sasquatch territory. Honestly if you are going to find one it will be here. This was probably around the age of 19-20. My Cousin, a friend, and I had decided that we were going to go night fishing for the hell of it. Honestly just to toke it up a bit, a night out fishing with the guys. My cousin was always the superstitious type. Any time we were in a dark lake there could be some lake monster, or if it was night in the woods there was a big foot. So we pack our stuff up and head out to go fishing around 7-8PM. We head up there and our friend was being quiet, weird kid, not really in his element out there I guess. My cousin was making jokes that we were going to get as he liked to call it, \"The No Permissions!\" (Raped) by Bigfoot. So he keeps rambling on about Bigfoot and aliens and whatever else, I don't know, it was funny as all hell! He got our friend all riled up and ready to piss his pants. So a few hours later we arrive at our destination. It is pitch fucking black. You can't see shit and all we had were glowsticks and lighters. You have to hike a mile or so in to get to our spot. Night fishing wasn't allowed here, so if you are curious about flashlights and lanterns, there is your answer. We trekked our way through the thick brush to get to our fishing/smoke spot. When we arrived it was amazing! The moon lit up the entire lake, you could see clear across it. The lake was completely still, you could hear fish 'Rolling,' on the water and catching insects from the surface. Very surreal. It was perfect. We set up our gear and cast out and sat down then lit up our joints (We only had one each, this is important!) and started to bullshit. After awhile my cousin just gets a look on his face like he had seen a ghost. I thought maybe it was something I said but he looked right through me and told me to shut my mouth for a second and turn around. I turned around and took a look towards the middle of the lake and he asked me \"Do you see it there? On the island?\" The island was maybe 50 yards away from the bank we were at. I didn't see it at first, I thought he was full of shit trying to freak us out or just completely paranoid. At first the way the moonlight glistened off the hair I thought it was a Brown Bear. Then it stood up and grunted. It then took a step across the narrow pass of water from the Island to the bank near it. It's about an 8ft gap. An awful large stride for a man, let alone a bear. The trees started rustling and moving and whatever it was mad. It was howling and making blood curdling screams. Chilled me right to the bone. What was even scarier is that in the corner of my eye, to the left, I saw bushes rustle where the screams and figure I was focused on weren't. I moved my attention there and had my cousin watch the other figure. Our friend was almost crying. I quickly realized there were two of whatever we were dealing with. As the one figure was making a huge ruckus and throwing objects, I realized it was distraction to draw attention from the other figure which was making its way around our flank. Knowing that the situation was getting fragile, we booked it. We dropped most of what we had with us. All we had was a Glowstick that my cousin was carrying. We frantically tried to not lose sight of him. As we were running this awful skunky smell had stuck with us, I thought it was the joints, but those were long gone, and I could hear rustling behind me that wasn't coming from my friend. My cousin tripped and we had to stop and get the stick. Whatever it was, was still moving towards us, fast... It wasn't even struggling. We were on the trail, it was in the forest. It was keeping up no issue! Paralyzed in fear we struggled to keep our composure and grab the glowstick. As we stood there in disbelief, to my right I could hear something breathing, we all held our breath in silence just to make sure it wasn't us..... the breathing continued and then we heard a large inhale then out of nowhere it let out a wooping bellow so damn loud it brought me to tears. This was different from any animal I have hunted or heard. It was powerful and guttural. We grabbed that stick and ran back to the truck weeping like children. We finally got to the truck.... we got in and started up the car. We hit the brights on the forest to see what we could see... nothing! Then out of the corner of my cousins eye he looked to the left, and it was standing outside of the driver's door. My cousin had left the window halfway down because it was summertime and gets hot. We went silent, my cousin in shock, myself included.

I looked up and said \"Damn it monster! Get out the window! I ain't given you no tree fiddy! Get outta here you goddamn Loch Ness monster!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(On a side note, this is a true story up to the point we reach the car, we just left and were thankful.

{"body": "In Response:\n\nWhat happens when we die?\n\nOur electrical impulses that contain our memories, emotions, and \"soul\" if you will, cease to run throughout our bodies neurons. Since we know according to the first law of thermodynamics that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, we can safely assume that the energy which was us at one time, is still here just in a different form. Our bodies decompose and return to the life cycle from whence we came.\n\nIs it ok to commit:\n1) Murder. No, this causes obvious harm to another human being. It should also be stated that the hebrew word for Murder and Kill are the same. Yet the Bible contains many examples of justified killings. \n2) Rape. Again, No. This causes obvious physical and psychological harm to any person who is raped.\n3) Homosexuality. Yes. It causes no harm to any person outside of the homosexual relstionship, other than offending them, which is not a cause to ban such an action.\n4) Going to Stripbars. Yes. Again, it causes no harm to any person outside of the situation. \n5) Pornography. Yes. It causes no harm to anyone outside the situation other than offending them which is not a cause to ban such an action.\n\nI do not need a God to tell me what is morally right or wrong.\n\nIf we came from monkeys then why are monkeys still living today?\nWe did not come from monkeys. You lack even the most basic understanding of natural selection, or \"change within a kind\". We share a common ancestor with Apes and Gorillas that has long since gone extinct, in the same way the Neanderthals are now extinct. \n\nA good example even a fundamentalist can understand is Lions and Tigers. Both big cats with a common ancestor in exactly the same way we share an ancestor with Primates. Now the Lion is all tan and does a better job of surviving in the Savannah. They also hunt in packs to take down large prey for food. Tigers are solitary creatures with stripes to break up their silhouette in the shadows of the jungle. Both cats can be bred together to form Tigons and Ligers, both Sterile creatures because they are now too genetically isolated. \n\nThey did not \"turn into\" what they are today. The lions survived because of their tan color giving them an advantage over the tigers in the savannah. They were able to pass on their genes (solid color fur) while the striped gene cats died. This works in revers for the tigers in the jungle.\n\nHow can you explain how a banana fits in your hand?\nWell the common day banana is a mutation that was cultivated in1836 by Jamaican Jean Francois Poujot. It was a random mutation that he discovered and he cultivated it from that point on. So you can thank a freak accident about 190 years ago that a man using science took advantage of. Also, our hands evolved to grip things just like many other land dwelling creatures. It's an adaptation that helped us survive.\n\nIf fox news is such a dishonest channel, then why are the reporters such as Bill O'Reilley such true Christians?\n1 Corinthians 2:11\nFor who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.\n\nDid you know that there are Biblical records of dinosaurs that were witnessed by men?\n1.There are modern day records of men witnessing the Loch Ness monster and Big Foot.\n2. There are cave paintings of men having contact with Megafauna like dinosaurs.\n\nHow did pond scum turn into us?\nIt took billions of years for basic chemical compounds to become multi-cellular life. It's hard to explain when you do not understand even the most fundamental concepts of evolution.\n\nHow did the eye form?\nAs an adaptation to perceive visible light. What is more interesting to ask is why does't the eye detect all the colors of the spectrum? Why just \"visible light\"?\nVisible light is just a wavelength. Why can't we see the rest of them if the design is so perfect? The eye is a product of the environment.\n\nHow did the grand canyon form?\nMillions of years of weathering. \n\nIf you call yourself an atheist in Regards to God, then do you call yourself an Atheist in regard to Santa or Bigfoot?]\nNo. Neither of these things is a divine being whose followers tout a moral code that should be applied to all other humans. Althought there is more proof of both their existences than there is Gods. Saint Nick was a real man, and BigFoot has been photographed. Whether or not you choose to believe in the validity of Santas story, or BigFoots pictures, they are more definitive than a millenia old text that has been modified again and again.\n\nHow did everything come from nothing?\nWho said there was nothing in the beginning? There was obviously something because it is here now. \n\nIf evolution is true how come we never see frogs turn into birds?\nWell such a process would be impossible. While birds may one day turn into something very froglike or visa versa, the process would take millions more years and would not be observable in an effective way. But we can see with the fossil record that creatures came before us whose descendants still roam the earth. (Whales have leg bones)\n\nHave you heard of the shroud of Turin?\nYes. Another thing you place your \"faith\" on, with zero proof of its authenticity.\n\nYours in science.\n\nedit: grammar and spelling.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350950058", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Until one day in thirty years time when you get a knock on your door. You'll open the door to a complete stranger. A beautiful female will be gracefully walking into old age, perhaps a reminder of your own mortality. She reveals herself to you as your \"drug dealer loser\"'s brother. She tells you that after being imprisoned for a number of years, he returned to the world a changed man. He regret his actions and had revealed to his sister that he had compiled a list of undoing every wrong he could remember, and over the years had gradually begun his tour of apologetics. \n\nWhile he was driving to the last person on his list, he considered whether apologising was truly necessary. He began to question whether he truly was remorseful for his actions. Staring at the last name on his list, he sped unruly through the streets to get to the house of the final name. Being quite a drunk (an addiction he could never truly shake) he caused a three car pile up, dying in an urban inferno. His sisters presence could then be explained as she was wondering if the last individual on his list would know whether he finished his goal, or whether you knew anything about his final moments.\n\nYou reveal that this is all new information and that you the last time you had remembered the incidents was when a similar question was posted on an internet forum. The story, while but a distant memory, was still truly touching, and the mans sister was clearly distraught. You place an arm around her, and tell her that her brother was truly noble. You remind her that we all make mistakes. She thanks you, and in a moment that cannot be explained, she kisses you.\n\nWithin moments of this embrace, she calmly removes herself from your lips, walks towards the front door. You quickly jump up to open the door for her, but you find that she slid her pants down to her knees with her arms against the door. \n\n\"Fuck me\", she said, within you quickly notice something strange. It was impossible to not notice that between the most delicate ass and irresistibly long legs, was a mans testicals. You freak the fuck out. You begin to scream. Quickly the woman, or, should you say, transvestite is pulling up her jeans and underwear, and is screaming back at you to stop. \n\n\"I'LL EXPLAIN! PLEASE! PLEASE!\"\n\nYour usual instinct would be to grab the six-shooter your father left you when he passed, but because of a combination of the terrified and unthreatening nature, in amalgamation with the fact that she wasn't trying to kill or worse, rape you, you stop. \n\n\"ensay, it's me.\"\n\nWho the...\n\n\"ensay, look closer.

{"body": "&gt;You put it very well yourself when you noted that one religious leader opposed Galileo, while another supported him. Same religion, different man.\n\nBut that's because Pope Urban III opposed the religious beliefs of the time. He took a giant risk, and went against the wind and reformed his church. Perhaps Urban was an admirer of science. \n\nThe problem with this is, while there are admirers of science in religious institutions, they are the minority. We won't always get that lucky. To top it off, religious admirers of science is kind of a contradiction, science can only come up with answers that will replace the religious understanding, as a result, religions will either have to reject their own beliefs and admire science, or fight against science. \n\nHow likely are they to reject their own beliefs? Considering the opposition of contraception, it's pretty clear people don't even reject beliefs that are not even in the fucking scripture. You cannot possibly then make the argument that religious people are likely to support science, unless the religion is shaped to be pro-science (which currently it's not).\n\n&gt;their entire political structure is based on religion. They have a theistic government. Therefore, religion IS power, you can't separate the two. \n\nAnd that's a problem. Ataturk knew this in Turkish republic, he read books on the US and France, and he implemented French Laicity or US 1st amendment (secularism), and he tried his best to remove religion from his country.  He changed the arabic script to latin, to distance himself from the religious arabs. He abolished the caliphate. He reformed religious education. He focused on public education. \n\nHe understood that if you allow religion to dictate your government, your government will fall behind. \n\nAs a result, Turkey today is the strongest mostly-Islamic nation in the world. As a G20 economy and 3rd strongest armed forces in NATO after Germany and US. Also the 5th largest and technologically advanced air force in the world. They have an industry, a vibrant economy. They've had their struggles, but they have proven just as capable as Western European nations because Ataturk embraced the West and taught people to forget their ethnicities and focus on unity, education, peace, and embracing the Western ideas.\n\nYet Turkey has NO OIL. Their success is being self-sufficient and embracing science and education.\n\n&gt;they use religion as a way to control the people. \n\nAbsolutely, but they don't control people because they enjoy controlling people, that's a part of it. They control people because they believe in the religion. So even the controllers are strong believers in the religion.\n\nIt's control without a master. With a goal of morality in the views of the leader, with justification from religion. But without religion, who would allow that leader to make such terrible decisions on morality?\n\n&gt;By its nature, the supernatural is beyond those things.\n\nThe supernatural doesn't exist, therefore science doesn't talk about it except to say it doesn't exist. And this is in direct conflict with religion, which accepts supernatural entities.\n\n&gt;, but the moment that one tries to use science to \"disprove\" something that cannot be disproved, it's a perversion of the method itself.\n\nI disagree with your statement. You're saying that science cannot disprove God. Sure you are right. Absolutely. However, science cannot also disprove the existence of unicorns. But statistics and logical reasoning tells us, if we don't have evidence then the probability of something existing is close to zero (but non-zero), therefore, by default we can assume it is false.\n\nSo while no one can disprove God. No one can really disprove Sasquatch, alien UFOs, Russell's teapot, unicorns, loch ness monster, vampires, or God. We can never disprove these things. But that doesn't mean we should ask scientists to figure it out and start projects about them based on belief.\n\nThere needs to be evidence. Without it, we have to assume by default, the answer is false.\n\n&gt;Consider, for example, ghosts.\n\nExactly, science cannot disprove Ghosts, just as it cannot disprove God. Thus, in terms of science, a scientist must dismiss both ideas because the probability of either being real is a total waste of time to even think about.\n\nUntil evidence is discovered.\n\n&gt;It can be used to find the actual explanation for \"haunted houses\" or to identify the rational explanation behind \"sightings\"\n\nAgain this would be a total waste of resources, time, effort, manpower, then we would have to investigate every paranormal activity, and absurd beliefs people have. If people want to investigate the truth value of something, they should first consider what evidence there is to start an investigation. \n\nThere's no way that ghosts exist. If they did exist, we would have had evidence by now. Video recordings of them. Actual physical interactions with those spirits. If we don't, then they don't exist. If they exist but don't communicate, don't physically interact, aren't visible on cameras---then why even bother researching them or investigating them?\n\nIF there is a deist God that never interacts with the physical world, why live life believing in it without evidence. Because of possible consequences? What kind of supreme being would punish people for not finding any conclusive evidence of his existence?\n\nIt's a scope issue. No need to concern yourself with things that don't interact with your world.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351099753", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was a fat kid at the beach, with my boogie board watching some bad ass surfers catch some waves out farther from shore. It was not late but it was getting later, so the waves were getting worse. I was only 13, dad and sister left me by myself to walk the board walk.\n\nI really wanted to get out there and ride those waves, I was a BAMF. I got out farther and had a lot of fun, but I realized those other surfers had drifted far away, or rather, I had drifted far away. I start to try and swim back to shore... but fuck, I was going out farther. I start to freak the fuck out alittle, the waves start to feel bigger, I lose my boogie board, the rope is still tied to my wrist. I am being pulled ferociously by my boogie board in what is slowly becoming high tide. I abandon my boogie board by riping it off my wrist, now I am all alone, against the mighty sea.\n\nWhether I am lucky or Posiden took mercy on me, I ended up crashing against these rocks that extended far out into the ocean. Just rocks that went out into the water, they were covered in little clams. These things were alive, jumping around and biting, they bite. I was basically in a race against the tide, soon these rocks would be submerged in water and my route back to land cut off. I climbed on these rocks while being attacked by 1000s of little clams while racing high tide. \n\nI got back, collapsed on the beach and just laid there. my hands and feet were bleeding because of the clams, and this lady comes up to me and offers me some pizza, because I am a fat kid right? And after all that I must be hungry right? Well fuck you!\n\nI agreed and followed them back to their towel and umbrella. They showed me the delicious pizza and as I reached for it they stopped me and said \"Hold on, before you eat this we are gonna need something from you\" I looked at them, \"And what is that?\" I said. They leaned in and whispered in my ear \"I need about tree fiddy\". Well it was about that time I noticed these people were about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

My last argument is this, when I dont have a girlfriend I feel lonely, sexually frustrated, and just plain bored, it takes time to get over these things but would you exchange the memories of the time you two spent together for a bland, drab nothing? sometimes it is better to have intermittent joy with a period of horror at the end than nothing at all.

{"body": "It was three years ago. I was 24 years old and just got out of a nasty relationship with the woman who I was completed infatuated with. I was deluded, I guess, but I seriously thought she was the girl of my dreams. In reality, this girl was a manipulating bitch who twisted my emotions like a nipple in a BDSM film. She knew the exact trigger points that killed me on the inside, the exact points that made me feel like I was a giggling three year old playing with his favourite toy, and the ways to make me feel in love. She made me feel like a king among men, or, if she wanted, a peasant among thieves. I was just blinded by love.\n\nOne day it ended. Abrupt. She came in to the living room where I was pretty busy studying for my final exam and she said to me \"Simian, I am leaving you. I am seeing someone else. I will be gone tonight.\" She turned and left, and just left me sitting there like a fool. She left for a walk to let me cool down I guess, but I was freaking out. I went up to her room to wait for her, but I already saw that she had packed all her things. I lost the game, and felt like shit. Long story short, she left that night after a heated argument where she admitted to cheating on me for a long time. I was heartbroken.\n\nSkip forward three months - I failed my final and had turned into a different person. I was consumed by alcohol (not the other way round), and if there's any sort of comparative reference that will help you understand \"who\" I had become, look at Jack Nicholson in The Shining (I mean just appearance wise, okay?). I mean, the woman I loved was fucking a guy. Probably right now. Probably right fucking now. I became angry. So angry, that one day I decided to burn her car down. I was pretty drunk, but I remember this so clearly, like it was a brilliant idea that would solve all my problems.\n\nCut scene - I am outside her apartment at 11pm with a tank of gasoline that I bought from my local petrol station. I break her car window, and start flooding the car with petrol. I remember feeling... almost relieved? I don't know, it was an alien feeling to my body. So anyway, it all happened so quick, but after about two minutes, I am sitting there with a match in my hand and a car full of fucking petrol on my right. It was intense. So I do it. I fucking light the car on fire. I just sit there like a dumbass for a minute until she runs out of the apartment and looks at her car in disbelief, with this dumb fucking look on her face. She sees me and gives me this look of disgust, and yells \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, SIMIAN?\" I look at her dead in the eyes and say calmly \"I'm burning your fucking car down, what do you think?\". Maybe she saw that I was crazy, but she got this look of pity in her eyes and I kind of melted a little. I panic and yell \"WHY DID YOU DO *THIS* TO ME? LOOK AT WHAT I'VE BECOME!\", she responded  \"you can't give me what I need, Simian\". \"What do you need, then!?\" I yell. She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was about that time that I noticed that my ex was about 500 feet tall and from the paleothic era. I shouted \"I ain't giving you no free fiddy you god damn loch ness monster, get your own money\".\n\nThe cops came soon after and I was arrested on arson/assault charges.

{"body": "I was out on the town a few months ago. Me and a few friends were having a blast, drinking ourselves into the ditch, as you do on a saturday night. I was about halfway through my third pint, and a third of the way through this long joke about an almost-blind guy buying underwear for his wife, when I glance over my friends shoulder and see this beautiful girl in a long red dress, just about to leave the bar.\n\nI must have been more taken with her than I thought I was, because I stopped talking mid-sentence and just stared. She was the prettiest, cutest girl I had ever seen, and I was completely head-over-heels with her. My friend sort of poked me to see if I was okay, and I suddenly snapped out of the trance. I murmured something and looked back, but she had gone.\n\nAbout 3 weeks later I was walking through town, trying to buy some shoes for myself, when I turned a corner and there she was, alone, right in front of me. I instantly recognised her. I don't know what it was, but something changed inside me and suddenly I had all the courage in the world. I talked to her, and surprisingly she was really friendly to me, even though I was just some stranger on the street. We talked and laughed, and agreed to see each other again.\n\nWe dated for a few months, taking it slow. She was the best person in the world, and the only thing I ever looked forward to, until one date at a quiet bar she asked me if I wanted to come back to her place. Being the fool that I am, I jumped at the chance, not knowing what I was letting myself in for.\n\nWhen we got to her place we sat on her couch and started talking. Things were getting comfortable and a little intimate, and since we were both a little drunk that helped too. We wandered to the bedroom, and things started getting heated. As she got my shirt off, she told me that she had a bit of a strange request for me. As I'm always open to try new things, I obliged her, and asked her what she wanted.\n\nShe says, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time that I realised she was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic period. I said \"Damnit Nessie I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nNeedless to say I got out of that relationship pretty damn fast.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351186988", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

She said that they brought her coke and not pepsi (or something to that extent)!. When the server returned, she dumped the whole glass of soda on him, and demanded a refund for the meal that I was paying for! I was disgusted- she would treat a working class, respectable guy in such an appalling fashion? ugh.\n\nFinally, I took her outside after dinner to explain that she was a nice enough girl, but I didn't think the experience deserved a second date. She went insane, throwing rocks, trying to take my keys, etc. She DEMANDED tree-fiddy. That's when I realized my date was a 300 million year old monster from the palaeolithic era.

I wave my whole arm, still nothing. I finally stand up and wave both my arms. Nothing. I figure it's no big deal, the motion sensor must have died somehow. My phone has a light on it, and I use that to navigate down the hall towards the exit. None of the lights seem to turn on, but I figure maybe the lights all turn off after a certain time.

{"body": "One time I was working in my garden and breaking a sweat, I got the feeling I was being spied upon. Through the cracks of the wooden fence we have (we got side by side houses and gardens) I could notice someone behind there. For a while I decided to ignore it and just continue my work of cutting plants and the hedge on the other side. My garden is quite a mess because I work full time. \n\nI took my shirt off and had a nice refreshing drink when I suddenly hear some groaning. Confused I turn my head and see a shadow (who I assumed was my neighbor) quickly move away behind the fence and run inside the neighbors house. Creeped out I put my shirt back on and decided to call it a day.\n\nNext day I decided to continue (it was Sunday and once again a hot day) and seriously, the same thing fucking happened again. I was mowing the grass, shirtless, and hear heavy breathing. Now mind you my next door neighbor is a pretty obese hairy guy, and has no wife or anything, so my hopes of it being a cheap porn flick of a hot cougar touching herself at me working were very slim. So I put my hand-mower down and walk to the fence already saying: \"Excuse me, can I help you with something?\" I stayed polite despite being annoyed. I stepped up the side so I could look over it to say something. It was then when he said \"Well, I need about tree fiddy.\" About this time I noticed that my hairy neighbor was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351260151", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was waiting in line at JFK to go through security. traffic was bad and I got ther with only a little more than a half hour to spare so I knew I was cutting it close. When I make it the detector I already had most of my stuff off and ready to be thrown in a bin so I can get the fuck through there and run to my plane, but there is some woman in front of me. She is bullshitting with some lady in front of her about her hair, she had a kind of flip in it and she kept turning her head side to side to show off that it was the same on both sides. She didn't actually know the woman but she was talking her ear off, still had her shoes on, still had her bag on the floor, and I'm getting antsy. I also notice that she keeps calling any woman near her \"mom\", something was a little off about her but only just a little. I don't say anything but I am getting pissed off, I know better than to make a commotion directly in front of airport security/TSA and after they painfully explain to her she has to put her stuff on the belt (she kept trying to walk through the detector with her luggage in hand) she finally makes it through. I go through quickly, throw my shoes on without even tying them and run to the plane.\n\nSo I finally make it, this is Jet Blue so we have seat numbers and I am in the middle between a black lady and some jewish girl about my age. The black lady kept asking me to switch seats with her friend because she wants to sit with them, I kept politely refusing because the girl next to me was cool, my carry on was with me, and I didn't really want to. She kept pressuring me and I still keep my cool because I don't feel like getting thrown off the plane.\n\nI hear a commotion behind me, someone really doesn't want to sit in a middle seat because they have anxiety, she really really wants an aisle seat. What ends up happening is one person moves from one row so both black ladies move there so they are together and then ms anxiety sits next to me...the same blonde from the security line...fuck.\n\nEevrything is fine and she is talking to the black ladies and they are joking about getting drunk to help her anxiety and what have you, so I put my headphones in and watch TV. It wasn't until we were probably 3/4 through our ascent that I noticed the blonde is looking right at me and talking away...I don't know for how long and about what so I reluctantly take out one of my earphones and see what she was saying. It started with her asking me about actors and movies (something relevant on TV), I entertained her for a while and this got the attention of Jewish girl and she joined the conversation. We talked about the Jewish faith (she was on her way to a Bat Mitzvah, which I learned is for girls) and she was amazingly ignorant of anything that wasn't Christianity. It wasn't until the drinks came that things really started getting good.\n\nFirst off, this woman kept asking everybody around her what she should get. I kept thinking *you're fucking almost 30 you can't pick a drink?* the flight attendent was getting annoyed because it took a solid 4 minutes and 6 people to decide on a rum and coke for her, and she kept calling her mom. I was wondering at this point if there was a real problem with her and maybe she shouldn't be having alcohol but I didn't have any good way of actually saying \"hey you seem slightly mentally handicapped, you sure you should drink?\". \n\nNow she went from 0 to drunk in record time, and the juicy stuff started coming out now. I learned now that she had kids, two of them (holy fuck thought I). she has a husband also. At this point she asks me how old I think she is. I didn't want to answer but she kept persisting so I guessed 30. THIRTY? Do I look that old!? Why do you think that? I don't remember what exactly I said but I asked her how old she really was...she said she was 29...\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\nThen she asks if I thought she was pretty, truth be told she actually was really good looking putting aside her bat shit insanity. So I told her yeah your pretty, so she laughs and touches my arm and says \"you're really cute yourself\" and now I'm getting really uncomfortable. Jewish girl is havign a great time watching this conversation. So then she asked me what is the dirtiest thing I've ever done, I think I said having sex in some obscure location but idk, I didn't know what to say here. So she leans over and whispers \"the dirtiest thing I've done was cheat on my husband\". Oh God. She is good and drunk now. So I just look at her and then she told me about how it's okay because he cheats on her and abuses her. So now I'm really uncomfortable and I want to just grabe a chute and bail out of the plane. We finally land (she started getting dizzy on descent and she just complained the whole way down). When we land, she turned out to not be the loch ness monster and turned to me and Jewish girl and said \"you know, I'd love to take the both of you out to a bar\" We politely declined and I noped the fuck out of there. She also asked if she could use my phone and I said \"no it's dead\" because I fucking know better.\n\nSo I went from extremely annoyed, to extremely amused, to extremely concerned. \n\nTL;DR Got hit on by a hot drunk blonde with a possible mental disorder", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351268344", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had a somewhat similar situation:\n\nI was at Waimea Bay in Hawaii, towards the end of summer, I was there with a couple friends (a roommate and his friend that had come to visit him).  I had to head back to the mainland the following morning to finish school, so we were doing the whole \"North Shore\" thing.\n\nSo, in case you haven't spent much time in Waimea bay, the water can be smooth as glass, or just complete insanity.  This day, it was in between, during a set, the wave faces were about 13 feet, with off swells of maybe 4-5 feet (I think open ocean was 4-6 ft that day).  Sets were right around 2 minutes apart.  So, loads of fun in the sandy part, bodysurfing and playing around, we had a jolly old time.\n\nWell, the friend who was visiting, let's call him Ben, because that is his name, Ben decided that the rock off to the left side looked like a good place to watch the sun set.  So, we went up on it, and he was right, it was cool.\n\nThen Ben decided the rock looked like a fun place to jump off of, because he'd seen people doing it earlier.  The waves had picked up significantly since then.  We did not think it looked like fun at all, and it looked like a difficult place to get out in that type of water.  But, Ben's a grown man, he can do what he wants.\n\nBen jumped in the water, going WEEEEEEE, all the way down.  Then silence.  Can't see him, can't hear him, nothing.  \n\n\"You alright, buddy?\"\n\nNo response.  About this time, I'm getting a bad feeling about stuff.  I can see the next set a ways off, and a couple freaks come in.\n\n\"You alright?\"\n\n\"HELP!\"\n\nNow, my roommate is not a strong swimmer, and he's not a big fan of water in general.  I love water, but i hadn't spent much time in the ocean.  So, I give my cell phone, shirt, and sunglasses to my roommate, mutter, \"Fucking Ben\" under my breath, and jump in.  \n\nI quickly find Ben stuck on a little ledge, trying to climb higher, but it's not an easy climb.  I hop up on the ledge and go to boost him up.\n\nAt this point, the water is right about even with our feet, occasionally dropping below it.  I realize that i've been disobeying one of the biggest rules of the ocean by not paying attention to what's coming.  I look out just in time to see a wave crashing over my head and get hit right in the face with it.  It slams us up against the rock wall, then carries us UNDER the rock a ways (didn't know there was a little cave under there, but i found it), so when i try to swim up, there's just rock, no air.\n\nWe make it out from under the rock, and things immediately fail to get better.  I immediately start duck-diving, but Ben just learned about that earlier in the day, so he's ineffective and getting thrown around a fair bit.  Finally, the set ends and we try to get back to a place we can climb up.  Before we can even reach a good spot, another set is coming.  I decide we need to be away from the rock before one of us gets knocked out, so we pull away from the rock a bit to wait out the set.  I try to relax, but Ben is pale and working too hard, getting tired.  The set comes over us, and we weather it pretty good.  As soon as it dies down, we strike out for the spot i had picked, the very front of the rock, where pretty much everyone climbs up.\n\nI try to pull Ben along and help him, but i'm getting tired, and i'm certainly no lifeguard.  We almost make it when another set rolls in.  We avoid the rocks, but we're close.  The set ends, and we're damn near perfect.  I get a hold of the rock and reach back for Ben.  It's like a goddamn movie.  He gets to within a hand length of me and a freak wave hits me right in the back and washes me off the rock and Ben farther away.  I quickly regain the rock and climb up a little little ways so i'm about half out of the water.  Ben is close, but not close enough.  Almost there.  \n\nMy roommate yells:  \"WAVE!!!!\" \n\nI turn and the water just falls out from under me and my foot slips into a crack up to the bottom of my calf.  I fall over backwards hanging upside down by one leg, with my knee bent, looking at a giant wave about to smash into me.  You'd be amazed how much energy that gives you.  I'm able to stand up on the one leg and scurry up the rock high enough to get above the wave.  Ben's fucked.\n\nI'm sitting there watching as the set rolls him and throws him around.  I've got nothing left.  Totally gassed.  Then a giant fucker wave hits me right in the back, not paying attention again.  It slams me down on the top of the rock and i cling to it like a damn limpet, then climb higher as soon as soon as i can.\n\nMy roommate has been hooting and hollering for help, but there's no one around.  A girl and a guy show up.  The girl says, \"someone's gotta help him.\"  I'm out.  If i go back in, we have two people in trouble.  I'm a shitty lifeguard.\n\nThe girl dives in.  She's a GOOD swimmer.  She takes Ben out away from the rock, calms him down, takes him under the waves, finally gets him to relax and get a bit of energy back up.  All the shit i failed miserably at.  She can't really move him, but she keeps him going.\n\nAt this point, the first bit of luck shows up in the form of an offduty lifeguard stopping by to check on his boat.  He hears us and swims out with his fins, then slowly all three of them come in.  Ben can hardly stand.  The last light is gone.

{"body": "When I was 8 years old, I was really excited about Christmas. It was about the only time my family got together. My aunt didn't get along with my grandma, which was a real pity because both were really nice people. My aunt baked cookies for me and my grandma used to play with all the time. When my parents were busy working, my grandma was my babysitter.\n\nAnyways, getting back to the topic at hand, it was my 8th Christmas. The whole family got together at our house. I don't remember much but I remember having a really fun time, at first. My aunt brought her famous chocolate chip cookies, for Santa of course. How could you not leave Santa cookies and milk? \n\nOver the night, the adults chatted and did whatever adults do at parties. I played with my cousins downstairs in the basement. Sometimes we pigged out on candied apples, candy canes, gingerbread, etc. We got into a bragging fight about what we were going to get from Santa. I knew I was going to get a bazillion shiny new gameboys because we all know a bazillion is more than a gazillion. Psh, my dumb cousin never figured that out. \n\nLet children do, we quickly forgot about it and moved on. This time, we huddled around the Little Tikes children's table and talked about Santa. We all knew he existed because he mysterious brought us presents but nobody had ever seen him before. I said I probably could find him out, cuz you know, I gotta show I'm the cool kid. So we set up a contest that whoever could catch Santa putting presents under the tree first would get a gazillion bazillion cool points. \n\nI knew I had to win so being the smart kid I was, I spiked the other kids drink with some of the stuff my dad always drank. He said it was a real doozy and my dad was always sleeping after drinking that stuff. So bedtime came around and we all got into bed. I'm pretty excited so I stay there, lying awake. Soon, all the other kids fell asleep and I was hyped my plan was working. As the night wore on, I got sleep and fell asleep. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I hear a creak and I wake up. \"OMG It's Santa!\" I thought. \n\nSo, I creep downstairs and peek into the living room. And lo and behold, I see this man in a red suit eating the cookies and milk. \n\n\"Santa?\" I call out. \n\n\"Yes, my son?\"\n\n\"Are you real? Do you have gazillion new gameboys for me?\"\n\n\"Ho ho ho, I'm real and here for you! Don't worry, I know you, Suq, you are on my good boys list. But before I give you your presents, I need a favor first.\"\n\n\"Oh man, anything for you Santa!\"\n\n\"I- I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about time that I noticed this fat jolly man was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. \n\n\"God damn it Loch Ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nSo on that night, I learned the hard way the truth about Santa. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351305560", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"This is my time to shine... I guess I can tell the story of how I was picked up by a 'cougar'.\n\nSo I was couch surfing following a fall-out with my parents (long story, not worth going into). Anyway, this went on for a while and I ended up staying at one friend's for about a month or so. My friend lived with his single mum (dad had gone out to get milk, never returned type thing). His mum was young-ish considering my friend's and my ages at the time (18), in pretty good shape, lovely smile, always very friendly with me, and I was obviously very grateful to have somewhere to stay at this point. My friend worked in a mobile windscreen repair service and I was between jobs. His mum worked part time so we were often in the house together. Was kind of awkward at first (obviously) but we got chatting. She would make comments about how mature I was and how she couldn't understand how I didn't have a girlfriend etc., I would sort of giggle and brush it aside, but the more it happened the more I thought maybe I had a chance here. A chance for something great...\n\nWhich leads me to a piece of advice: if you think something is on, ask for it. Same with meeting any girls. You can whinge about not getting dates, but are you actually asking? The girl that smiled at you on the train, at the bar, buying coffee, did you just ask them? They are people after all! I digress, of sorts. So, with this spirit of adventure, one time when we were alone, I though I would give it a shot. She was sat on the sofa one morning, I decided to join her. Normal small talk, sly comments, 'why don't you have a girlfriend'... My heart is pounding, but I say something cliche along the lines of 'only being interested in you'. She cottons on, leans into me and says 'what can a young boy offer someone like me'. Excitedly, I ask 'well what do you need?' She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was about that time that I noticed this smoking hot milf was about 500 feet tall and from the paleothic era\". I shouted \"I ain't giving you no free fiddy you god damn loch ness monster, get your own money\".\n\nMy friend came home, and he never knew what went down.

{"body": "Let me recall a relationship I had with my wife's sister.  I was married to my beautiful wife for almost 8 years before the accident happened. Let me be a bit more clear.  My wife was, in fact, an identical twin, and seeing her was quite an unnerving experience especially after my wife passed.  She was driving home from work one day when another car crashed into hers. I can still remember everything that happened that day.\n\nBut, more towards the topic,  there were several times that seeing her sister greatly affected me, and I'll explain each one, for the sake of this post.  The first, as you might guess, was the funeral.  It was a closed casket ceremony, and as I sat there grieving the loss of my wife, I was almost taken off guard when her sister approached me with her condolences, just as saddened as I was by the loss of her sister.  For an instant, something lifted my heart up, just seeing her face again, in live flesh, but that died down just as quickly as it came.  I tried not thinking about her sister much that day.\n\nOur relationship started to become more complex from that day onward.  We had a pre-existing friendship, especially since she and my wife loved to spend time together, so we still kept in touch.  I began to open up to her, almost as if she were my wife, and she did the same to me.  The second complication arose was when she ended her relationship with her boyfriend at the time, about 6 months after my wife's passing.  Since we talked so much during that time period, she came to me after she ended it (he had been cheating on her and she found out).  As a friend, I thought I owed it to her to comfort her, but I soon found that I was trying to comfort her the way I would my wife.  I placed my hand on hers and even held her, and it almost felt the same. Almost.  I yearned for the connection I had with my wife, and spending time with her sister almost felt like starting over.  It was as if I was pursuing the same girl a second time, from scratch.\n\nThen the third event occurred, the one that completely impacted my entire relationship with her. As I spent time with her, I noticed that she was returning the feelings I began to develop for her on some level.  We would always spend time together during holidays, weekends, etc.  I could tell that she knew that I wanted to be with her too, but purposefully held back on the matter.  However, one night, I get a phone call from her, asking me if she could come over to my apartment.  Naturally, I accepted her request and she later showed up at my door, dressed up, as if she were preparing for this moment.  I can still remember the conversion when it took place.\n\n\"Is something wrong?\" A question I seem to always resort to.\n\n\"We need to talk.\" At that moment, she sat me down on the couch, sitting beside me, \"I know that you've had feelings for me for a while now and I understand why.\"\n\nMy heart was racing at this moment as I responded, \"Oh, you have?\"\n\n\"Yes.  And I came here tonight because I have those feelings as well.\"\n\nWhen I heard those words, it felt like my heart was opening itself up again, as it did when my wife was alive.  She continued on.\n\n\"But I need something from you to make sure this is going to work..\"\n\n\"Look, I don't just have feeling for you because your my ex-wife's twin sister...I genuinely like you for who you are, not who you look like.\"\n\n\"That's not it\" she replied to me.\n\n\"What is it? What is it that you need?\"\n\n\"...I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this point that I realized that my wife's twin sister was a large plesiosaur from the Early Jurassic Period. I was furious.\n\n\"Dammit, Loch Ness Monster get out of my apartment!\" I screamed, shooing it away as it wailed.\n\nI'll never feel the same way I was ever again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351348663", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 31, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So back in my college days I used to deliver pizzas. I'm close to getting cut for the night, and the manager sends me out on one last run. I was instantly curious - 8 pizzas, all larges, every single one of them different. The address was in the swanky part of town, so I figured maybe some rich college kid throwing a party for his or her friends. Before long I'm winding down a curvy road passing by the occasional drive way. I say occasional because I was clearly in mansion-territory - you couldn't see any of the houses from the road, and even the driveways had the look of old money.\n\nThe 2879... that was the house number and as the numbers started to wind down closer I slowed. Then I found it. Set back slightly from the road I could see the gates, wrought iron and heavy. As I pulled I could see an intercom set up to the right. I get closer, and it blinks once then a voice came out. \"Proceed through the gate and to the right. Do not take the left at the fork. Proceed to the right\". The voice was male, stern, with \"don't fuck this up\" undertones. A loud beep and the gate began to swing ponderously open.\n\nTwenty yards past the gate I came to the fork. The right was well-kept. The left, not so much. I could see the undergrowth encroaching on the left path, the trees overhanging ominously. It was late, and the distilled light from my car didn't penetrate the darkness in that direction far enough for me to see anything more. Shrugging, I turned to the right and continued down the driveway. The house was big - more than big, it was massive. Shuttered windows, gothic architecture, it filled my vision with a quiet menace. I sat in the car, studying it for a moment before I saw a light flick on, then another. Then a light came on behind the front door and I knew that was my cue. I got out, loaded up four pizzas, figuring this was a two-tripper.\n\nWalking up to the door, I reached to knock when it swung open before my knuckles could make contact with the aged oak. It was a woman. She was beautiful - long black hair that fell over her shoulders. High cheekbones, large round eyes. Her lips were full and red above her delicate chin. Her neckline fell gracefully to a hint of cleavage from what appeared to be full breasts sitting high on her chest. Of course I was distracted from all of this by two facts. The first, she was in a wheelchair. The second was the man standing behind her. He was impossibly tall - 6 and a half, 7 feet. Clothed as he was, it was impossible to say for sure but he looked to be 250 lbs of pure muscle. I blinked hard, then looked back to the woman.\n\n\"I uh.. the rest is in the car. Let me go-\"\n\n\"Leave it\". Her voice cut in coldly.\n\n\"But, it'll get co-\"\n\n\"Leave it. I have everything I need now.\" She stared at me hungrily, and her tongue slipped out of her mouth to lick her full lips. I went to turn and run, and she stood up. She was 80 feet tall! That's when I realized she was a 300 million year old dinosaur from the Triassic Period. As she dived into a nearby pond I screamed \"Curse you Nessie!\" I never saw her again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351349862", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Thanks for the reply, I can gladly answer answer these.\n\n&gt;The pro-UFO argument seems to somewhat conveniently route around the evidence by saying that the government censors it at high levels. Is it possible to assess just that argument, leaving UFOs out of the question?\n\nIt is possible to corroborate the claim that the government does censor certain things, as it has been shown to be the case through declassified items over the years.  It is known that certain information is intentionally kept from the public, for instance, things like experimental aircraft.  However, this says nothing about *what the government does know*.  Claiming that *because the government keeps secrets, aliens are being kept secret* is no more valid than accusing me of knowing where Jimmy Hoffa's body is on the simple fact that I don't want people to know everything about me.\n\n&gt;Given that these testimonials are coming from experts in space-related fields, does that lend them any more credence? And does the quantity of testimonials affect the weight of the argument any (eg. if 1 astronaut vs. 1000 astronauts had claimed to see aliens first hand)?\n\nI don't believe the authority of the person really matters in a truly rational discussion.  Even top scientists are required to show their work when presenting studies and data to the public.  Claims about aliens by people who have been to space are no more legitimate than people who sit on mountains with binoculars by themselves.  The evidence itself is the only thing that has any authority (and even *that authority* is subject to scrutiny).  Another thing to consider is that *just because you're an expert on space, it does not mean you're any more an expert on extraterrestrials than a layperson*.\n\nQuantity means little as well.  There are many things in the world that are claimed among large numbers of people that still lack evidence.  Be it Bigfoot, Nessie, specific claims about religion, etc., we still need evidence.  There have been some pretty widely-claimed things in this world that still have no factual basis to speak of, even among populations of certain professionals.\n\n\nEdit: accidentally a word", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351374971", "subreddit": "skeptic", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

She probably had no idea I even existed and I don't even think she knew my name. She was pretty smart. Always had her hand up in class and always knew the answer, and as far I knew she got pretty good grades. One day, the teacher changed the seating and we were next to each other. A few days went by and no words were said. We had literally no contact whatsoever. After about a week, she said to me \"I hate this teacher so much\" and I was like \"I know, right? She's so annoying\" And then we became friends because of our mutual hatred for a teach who should have been fired a long time before that. Soon we became really good friends, and eventually she broke up with her boyfriend and a week afterwards I got the courage to ask her out. \nDating her was an amazing experience. It was mostly some basic stuff. We'd go to movies, and go out to a diner in town on some nights. Again, really basic stuff.

{"body": "I can remember asking my first (Now ex)girlfriend out. We had known each other for about 4 years. We met when we were about 11 or 12. We weren't great friends at first. More like acquaintances. We talked occasionally, and might have exchanged a few hellos in the hallways at school. Around the winter of 2010 we were seated next to each other in class. At first it was a bit weird. We never talked and were unaware of any common interests that we shared, so conversation was almost nonexistent besides the occasional \"Do you have a pencil that I can borrow?\" or a \"Can I borrow your calculator for a second?\" After roughly two weeks of this we gradually became friends over our mutual dislike of the teacher in our class. Soon after we discovered that we had quite a few mutual interests and after a few months I eventually got her phone number. At first, it was nothing major. Just texting about random stuff, but when she broke up with her boyfriend it seemed like she was flirting with me a little bit. At first I thought it was just my mind messing with me, but then the messages and signs from her end became stronger and I realized that she really was flirting, and that she was interested in dating me. One day, as we were leaving class about to go to lunch, I asked her if she wanted to go to Starbucks with me to grab a coffee. She said \"Sure!\" and I was extremely excited. Then, she looked at me and said \"I'll go, but first, I'mma need about tree fiddy.\" It was at that point that I realized that the girl who I had just asked out was actually an eight story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.

We'll call the guy John and his girlfriend will be Jane. Anyway, I had known John a little bit longer than Jane, but we were all in the same circle of friends, and John and Jane had also known each other for a while. At one point, Jane started flirting with me when John wasn't at school to be with her, which struck me as a bit odd. At first I just figured that it was my mind playing tricks on me, but then the signals she was sending got stronger and stronger and I realized what was going on. Now, John was one of my best friends, and so was Jane. I was now put into the delicate situation of trying to get her to leave me alone for John's sake, but also trying not to ruin our friendship because I actually liked her. Eventually, all of this flirting and whatnot climaxed when one day she knocked on my door and when I answered it she told me that she had feelings for me. I told her that she was with John and that I didn't want to hurt him and that she would only regret trying to make something of those feelings while still in that relationship. She immediately walked forward and pressed her lips on to mine in one of the most passionate kisses I have ever witnessed, let alone be a part of. I pushed her back and looked her in the eye for a second, and she leaned in and we started making out. I closed my door and we walked into my living room and I sat on the couch with her in my lap, making out. Very soon, clothes came off and she was giving me oral, and then positions switched and I was eating her out. I felt her orgasm and she gave me this look that practically screamed \"I want you inside me NOW\" so she grabbed a condom from her purse and I put it on and we had sex. It wasn't anything super special. It was over in about five minutes and we were both satisfied. \"Need a ride home?\" I asked her. \"No, but I'mma need about tree fiddy.\" It was at that point, that I realized that one of my oldest friends and the girl I just lost my virginity to was actually an eight story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "I actually saved two peoples lives. I was awarded a great service for it in my honor. I worked at a summer camp for a majority of my life from the age of 13-17. I was known as a ANT (yes like the bug ._.) aka Assistant Naturalist. My job was to go around with a TN aka Teacher Naturalist and another ANT with a group of kids ranging from 10-15 individuals. Now in the most non-egotistic way possible I was known as the go to ANT in case of literally everything as I attended the camp since age 4 I was familiar with the policy and overall lay of the land. I could walk the trails of the hundreds of acres in my sleep or blindfolded by a ninja assassin forced to walk with a knife to my throat. Anyway, the group of kid's I was watching that week were about 11-13 years of age, in direct translation they were all stubborn pricks that didn't listen to a fucking thing I said. Now the other ANT that worked with me I was good friends with, she was a year younger than me but worked at the camp almost as long as I had. She was also the blonde vixen of the camp, in translation the 11-13 year old girls wanted to be like her and the 11-13 year old boys wanted to hormonally touch all of her. So they listened to her over me. Now this camp is notorious for being a camp not for little children to go home and be like \"Daddy, Daddy I got a mos-kait-oo (mosquito) bite\", \"Im proud of you son, good job, maybe get some dirt on your knee tomorrow\", we go fucking hard. One activity we do with the kid's is they gather sticks and logs and try to build a raft, they then use the raft to float across a large pond connected to an even larger ravine/swamp. The water is fairly still but it's murky, gross and swampy. Worse thing in the water though is leeches and snappers. Snappers wont bother you and leeches will tough you the fuck right up. Anyway, the TN i was working with (coolest fucking dude ever, he was my councilor growing up) came down with Lyme Disease, so he was basically dead. By dead, I mean he'd sleep in a coma-like state and put me in charge. So it was raft day and the kids were building there rafts, my female coworker was helping them in the pond-swamp because they'd listen to her as they either ogle'd her C-Cup bikini or wanted to fill out like her. So my job was easy, make sure everyone was safe and together. So the raft finishes and they go out on the pond. Their raft is perfect it floats, it's also huge as it's holding like 10-15 pre-teens. So they do their little trip and come back. Everyone gets off and we start discussing the trip, kids proud as can be for accomplishing their awesome feat. Except there's one issue, one kid starts screaming, he was sitting on the raft and it started to float back in the middle of the pond. Now there's a kid stuck in the middle of the pond and there's no way he's strong enough to paddle the big mess of sticks and branches back. The other ANT already in her swim gear, swims out to the raft to retrieve it and the dumbstruck child. Now this area is known the be relatively safe, it's sweeped frequently by park rangers to insure the safety of the kids however on this day someone fucked up. As i'm monitoring my co-worker mount the raft and calm the child I see it breach the water. A motherfucking crocodile is in the pond with them. We haven't seen a croc in the area in forever, the rangers regulate them from the lakes to insure the children's safety and move them to secure locations. I fucking activated. Shirt off, shoes off, adrenaline pumping, knife in my pocket, testosterone fuming out of my nose. This wasn't fucking happening. I jumped into the pond and swam towards the raft screaming for them to watch out for the croc. Not my smartest move, I freaked out the other ANT and she slipped, knocking herself out and slipping into the water. She was half on, half off the raft. The kid out this point is going BALLISTIC, screaming, crying snot, throwing up through his ears. Release of all body fluids. However the little bastard is a hero in himself, he was holding her on the raft/trying to pull her up. I was so proud. Now the problem. Where the hell is the croc? Also i'm in the water, she's half in the water. I reach the raft, pull up my co-worker, who was still sexy as hell knocked out, (giggity) and begin to administer CPR. I couldn't tell if she was breathing as her face was partially in the water i didnt know if she had taken any in, she also had a bluish tinge to her skin tone, I began giving her CPR (oh my god her lips were like sweet swamp water cotton candy) when SMACK! Something rams the raft. The raft is made by children, this will never hold together for long and somehow I convinced myself the croc was gone, as I didn't see it nor did it attack. WHACK WHACK WHACK WHACK! I have no idea what to do. The raft is breaking apart, the kids freaking out and this girls still unconscious. So i did what any man would do, I took out my knife and jumped in the water. Then i see it, a dark shape moving toward me like a bullet, as it moved closer I noticed it was about five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "I actually saved two peoples lives as well. I was awarded a great service for it in my honor. I worked at a summer camp for a majority of my life from the age of 13-17. I was known as a ANT (yes like the bug ._.) aka Assistant Naturalist. My job was to go around with a TN aka Teacher Naturalist and another ANT with a group of kids ranging from 10-15 individuals. Now in the most non-egotistic way possible I was known as the go to ANT in case of literally everything as I attended the camp since age 4 I was familiar with the policy and overall lay of the land. I could walk the trails of the hundreds of acres in my sleep or blindfolded by a ninja assassin forced to walk with a knife to my throat. Anyway, the group of kid's I was watching that week were about 11-13 years of age, in direct translation they were all stubborn pricks that didn't listen to a fucking thing I said. Now the other ANT that worked with me I was good friends with, she was a year younger than me but worked at the camp almost as long as I had. She was also the blonde vixen of the camp, in translation the 11-13 year old girls wanted to be like her and the 11-13 year old boys wanted to hormonally touch all of her. So they listened to her over me. Now this camp is notorious for being a camp not for little children to go home and be like \"Daddy, Daddy I got a mos-kait-oo (mosquito) bite\", \"Im proud of you son, good job, maybe get some dirt on your knee tomorrow\", we go fucking hard. One activity we do with the kid's is they gather sticks and logs and try to build a raft, they then use the raft to float across a large pond connected to an even larger ravine/swamp. The water is fairly still but it's murky, gross and swampy. Worse thing in the water though is leeches and snappers. Snappers wont bother you and leeches will tough you the fuck right up. Anyway, the TN i was working with (coolest fucking dude ever, he was my councilor growing up) came down with Lyme Disease, so he was basically dead. By dead, I mean he'd sleep in a coma-like state and put me in charge. So it was raft day and the kids were building there rafts, my female coworker was helping them in the pond-swamp because they'd listen to her as they either ogle'd her C-Cup bikini or wanted to fill out like her. So my job was easy, make sure everyone was safe and together. So the raft finishes and they go out on the pond. Their raft is perfect it floats, it's also huge as it's holding like 10-15 pre-teens. So they do their little trip and come back. Everyone gets off and we start discussing the trip, kids proud as can be for accomplishing their awesome feat. Except there's one issue, one kid starts screaming, he was sitting on the raft and it started to float back in the middle of the pond. Now there's a kid stuck in the middle of the pond and there's no way he's strong enough to paddle the big mess of sticks and branches back. The other ANT already in her swim gear, swims out to the raft to retrieve it and the dumbstruck child. Now this area is known the be relatively safe, it's sweeped frequently by park rangers to insure the safety of the kids however on this day someone fucked up. As i'm monitoring my co-worker mount the raft and calm the child I see it breach the water. A motherfucking crocodile is in the pond with them. We haven't seen a croc in the area in forever, the rangers regulate them from the lakes to insure the children's safety and move them to secure locations. I fucking activated. Shirt off, shoes off, adrenaline pumping, knife in my pocket, testosterone fuming out of my nose. This wasn't fucking happening. I jumped into the pond and swam towards the raft screaming for them to watch out for the croc. Not my smartest move, I freaked out the other ANT and she slipped, knocking herself out and slipping into the water. She was half on, half off the raft. The kid out this point is going BALLISTIC, screaming, crying snot, throwing up through his ears. Release of all body fluids. However the little bastard is a hero in himself, he was holding her on the raft/trying to pull her up. I was so proud. Now the problem. Where the hell is the croc? Also i'm in the water, she's half in the water. I reach the raft, pull up my co-worker, who was still sexy as hell knocked out, (giggity) and begin to administer CPR. I couldn't tell if she was breathing as her face was partially in the water i didnt know if she had taken any in, she also had a bluish tinge to her skin tone, I began giving her CPR (oh my god her lips were like sweet swamp water cotton candy) when SMACK! Something rams the raft. The raft is made by children, this will never hold together for long and somehow I convinced myself the croc was gone, as I didn't see it nor did it attack. WHACK WHACK WHACK WHACK! I have no idea what to do. The raft is breaking apart, the kids freaking out and this girls still unconscious. So i did what any man would do, I took out my knife and jumped in the water. Then i see it, a dark shape moving toward me like a bullet, as it moved closer I noticed it was about five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era. It swam up to me and in perfect English asked if I had about tree fiddy. Now like the hero I am, I lunged forward under water, its own territory and fought it. i think breached the surface and swam the raft back to shore. The kids were cheering and the hospital was called to check on us. I felt not only did I save their lives but I had accomplished the most miraculous task I would ever face in my life.

{"body": "I lost my virginity to my friend's girlfriend and he has no idea.\n\nThey had been dating for about six months. I had known both of them for a long time. We'll call the guy John and his girlfriend will be Jane. Anyway, I had known John a little bit longer than Jane, but we were all in the same circle of friends, and John and Jane had also known each other for a while. At one point, Jane started flirting with me when John wasn't at school to be with her, which struck me as a bit odd. At first I just figured that it was my mind playing tricks on me, but then the signals she was sending got stronger and stronger and I realized what was going on. Now, John was one of my best friends, and so was Jane. I was now put into the delicate situation of trying to get her to leave me alone for John's sake, but also trying not to ruin our friendship because I actually liked her. Eventually, all of this flirting and whatnot climaxed when one day she knocked on my door and when I answered it she told me that she had feelings for me. I told her that she was with John and that I didn't want to hurt him and that she would only regret trying to make something of those feelings while still in that relationship. She immediately walked forward and pressed her lips on to mine in one of the most passionate kisses I have ever witnessed, let alone be a part of. I pushed her back and looked her in the eye for a second, and she leaned in and we started making out. I closed my door and we walked into my living room and I sat on the couch with her in my lap, making out. Very soon, clothes came off and she was giving me oral, and then positions switched and I was eating her out. I felt her orgasm and she gave me this look that practically screamed \"I want you inside me NOW\" so she grabbed a condom from her purse and I put it on and we had sex. It wasn't anything super special. It was over in about five minutes and we were both satisfied. \"Need a ride home?\" I asked her. \"No, but I'mma need about tree fiddy.\" It was at that point, that I realized that one of my oldest friends and the girl I just lost my virginity to was actually an eight story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. I screamed \"God dammit, Nessie! I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!

{"body": "Matias Duarte 07:14 +21\n\n**Why did you make the system buttons and status bar consistent across all devices in Jelly Bean?**\n\nConsistency and usability are really important to us, and that’s something we strive to improve in every new version of Android. With Honeycomb we first introduced the idea of a completely onscreen navigation UI which gave us unprecedented flexibility in how that UI adapts and transforms - both when you turn the device in your hands and when the software changes and has different control needs. Now in Jelly Bean we’ve made the universal software navigation buttons and system bar consistent across all screen sizes.\n\nThis new configuration is based on usability research we did on all of the different form factors and screen sizes that Android runs on. What mattered most of all was muscle memory - keeping the buttons where you expect them, no matter how you hold the device.\n\nPhones are almost always used in portrait mode, flip sideways occasionally, and never go upside down. As screen sizes get larger though, any which way goes. Imagine the frustration you’d feel if every time you picked up a tablet off the table ‘the wrong way up’ you found yourself reaching for a home button that wasn’t where you expect it to be? That irritation adds up and over time like a tiny grain of sand in your shoe and undermines the rest of your experience.\n\nThe Jelly Bean system bar always keeps the same 3 buttons where you expect them. This happens dynamically for every screen size, up until you get to small handheld screens where stacking the bars in landscape mode would leave too little vertical space.\n\nThe second thing we discovered was that there are almost as many different ways of holding our devices as there are people. In fact people love to use their Nexus so much that they use them for such long periods of time that having a single ‘correct grip’ is actually counter productive and increases hand strain. The Jelly Bean navigation buttons work equally well for left handers and right handers, one handed use, or two handed use, and for devices you’re carrying, resting on your knee, or putting on the table.\n\nLast but not least, by unifying the design we are now able to put Notifications and Quick Settings right where you’d expect them, and only one swipe away.\n\n\n\n**Why don’t Nexus devices have SD cards?**\n\nEverybody likes the idea of having an SD card, but in reality it's just confusing for users.\n\nIf you’re saving photos, videos or music, where does it go? Is it on your phone? Or on your card? Should there be a setting? Prompt everytime? What happens to the experience when you swap out the card? It’s just too complicated.\n\nWe take a different approach. Your Nexus has a fixed amount of space and your apps just seamlessly use it for you without you ever having to worry about files or volumes or any of that techy nonsense left over from the paleolithic era of computing.\n\nWith a Nexus you know exactly how much storage you get upfront and you can decide what’s the right size for you. That’s simple and good for users.\n\nGood questions! Keep 'em coming!﻿", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351598261", "subreddit": "Android", "score": 283, "controversiality": 0}

That is until we stumbled upon the old Hamilton Mansion. This mansion stood out as it was the nicest and biggest house on the block by far. When I say by far, I mean the other houses did not even come close as they actually looked like meth houses with dead yards and lots of dogs. What was even stranger about the Hamilton mansion was that it's yard was very well kept even though there were no lights on and it never looked like anyone was there. Until we walked by. \nWhen we walked by we had originally planned to tp the trees in the yard of the mansion but then a porch light turned on. My buddy Patrick decides to then go up to the porch and get some candy since we were too creeped out because this is the most activity we have ever seen come from the mansion. Well Pat walks up and knocks on the door and a young man in his 20's dressed in a tuxedo answers and asks Pat to come in. Usually Pat would not do this bit he walks in. We wait about 20 minutes and still no sign of Pat so we start shitting ourselves. So out of desperation to get our friend back we walk to the door and knock and out comes the same man except this time he is sweating and panting and his clothes are ripped. He immediately grabs me by the throat and yells, \"I NEED IT, I NEED IT.\" And I yell, \"I'll give you anything just don't hurt me!\" And he says, \"I NEEEEEED... about tree fiddy.\" At that point I realized this guy was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "2 years ago I was staying up in Scotland with my parents (I'm Scottish but live in London), this was an annual thing and it has always been normal until this one particular experience 2 years ago.\nMy parents always cook a big dinner when I go up to visit and we just finished polishing off the leftovers at about midnight when my parents said they were heading up to bed, I myself wasn't tired so I stayed downstairs watching TV and eating mashed potatoes (yum).\n\nI was slowly starting to drift off at about 1:30am when I decided I best head upstairs and hop into bed as my parents always went mad when I left electronics on over night and would always tell me off, no matter what age I was. So I head upstairs and get changed in the bathroom, take a piss then head off to the guest bedroom. This room was kinda creepy in it's own essence but I'd slept in much scarier rooms, so I thought nothing of it.\nThis is where it gets weird, it should be noted that my parents live in a 300 year old house at the very northern part of Scotland in the countryside, I couldn't get to sleep at all, even though I was dozing off downstairs, something was just... off. I felt the room get much colder and then suddenly the window shot open. My heart was racing at this point but I the window was letting in a chilling breeze so I had to shut it.\n\nAs I was closing my window I glanced out across the field, the trees were swaying and I couldn't see much further than 15 meters. All of a suidden, this huge black figure shot out towards the window. I almost pissed myself at this point, this figure was taller than the house and was outside my window. I still had to shut the window so I just blurted out at the top of my voice:\n\"WHAT DO YOU WANT!!\"\n\nSilence, but then I heard a little whisper from outside. I got closer until I saw the figure again, his features slowly starting to become more clear and focused. It spoke louder this time and I managed to figure out what it was saying...\n\"I need about tree fiddy\".\nIt was at this point that I noticed that this scary black figure haunting my house was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era!

{"body": "Here is what he's answered so far --\n\nOriginal Post: https://plus.google.com/114892667463719782631/posts/JAAMUzx1PFX\n\n**Why did you make the system buttons and status bar consistent across all devices in Jelly Bean?**\n\nConsistency and usability are really important to us, and that’s something we strive to improve in every new version of Android. With Honeycomb we first introduced the idea of a completely onscreen navigation UI which gave us unprecedented flexibility in how that UI adapts and transforms - both when you turn the device in your hands and when the software changes and has different control needs. Now in Jelly Bean we’ve made the universal software navigation buttons and system bar consistent across all screen sizes.\n\nThis new configuration is based on usability research we did on all of the different form factors and screen sizes that Android runs on. What mattered most of all was muscle memory - keeping the buttons where you expect them, no matter how you hold the device.\n\nPhones are almost always used in portrait mode, flip sideways occasionally, and never go upside down. As screen sizes get larger though, any which way goes. Imagine the frustration you’d feel if every time you picked up a tablet off the table ‘the wrong way up’ you found yourself reaching for a home button that wasn’t where you expect it to be? That irritation adds up and over time like a tiny grain of sand in your shoe and undermines the rest of your experience.\n\nThe Jelly Bean system bar always keeps the same 3 buttons where you expect them. This happens dynamically for every screen size, up until you get to small handheld screens where stacking the bars in landscape mode would leave too little vertical space.\n\nThe second thing we discovered was that there are almost as many different ways of holding our devices as there are people. In fact people love to use their Nexus so much that they use them for such long periods of time that having a single ‘correct grip’ is actually counter productive and increases hand strain. The Jelly Bean navigation buttons work equally well for left handers and right handers, one handed use, or two handed use, and for devices you’re carrying, resting on your knee, or putting on the table.\n\nLast but not least, by unifying the design we are now able to put Notifications and Quick Settings right where you’d expect them, and only one swipe away.\n\n**Why don’t Nexus devices have SD cards?**\n\nEverybody likes the idea of having an SD card, but in reality it's just confusing for users.\n\nIf you’re saving photos, videos or music, where does it go? Is it on your phone? Or on your card? Should there be a setting? Prompt everytime? What happens to the experience when you swap out the card? It’s just too complicated.\n\nWe take a different approach. Your Nexus has a fixed amount of space and your apps just seamlessly use it for you without you ever having to worry about files or volumes or any of that techy nonsense left over from the paleolithic era of computing.\n\nWith a Nexus you know exactly how much storage you get upfront and you can decide what’s the right size for you. That’s simple and good for users\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351609613", "subreddit": "Android", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

We didn't have to share a room, because the house had something like five bedrooms, but we did anyway because hey, shenanigans. We were doing our normal thirteen year old crap, gossiping about shit at school and whatnot. Her parents kept banging on the wall and telling us to be quiet, so finally we were left just giggling in hushed tones. There wasn't a clock in the room, but I would guess it was about two or three in the morning when we heard a loud crash downstairs. We froze, then she dared me to go downstairs and check it out. Eventually, we both decided to creep downstairs and see what it was. We walked by her parent's room on the way downstairs and noticed that they were sound asleep. After we got to the kitchen, we held our breath and flicked on the light. A wine bottle somehow made its way out of the trash and was shattered on the floor. The weird thing was that the trash can was by the sliding glass door, but the wine bottle was smack dab in the middle of the kitchen floor, about five feet away. We stood there for a second staring, when I caught a flash out of the corner of my eye. I yelped, and we both went running into her parent's room. They were pissed at first, until we started saying that there was someone in the house. her dad grabbed the nightstand, and pulled a small gun out of it, I was scared because I had no idea he had a gun, and I started mentally freaking out that we were all gonna die. We heard another crash, and my friend's mom grabbed my friend and I and pulled us back into the room while her dad sneaked downstairs. After about thirty seconds we heard two shots, and my friend's mom started crying. Not even a minute after we heard the shots we heard my friend's dad yell \"it's ok, come down.\" we ran down the stairs to find my friend's dad laughing and standing in the middle of the kitchen next to a shattered glass door. A fat, dead possum was laying in the middle of the floor. My friend's mom started freaking out and yelling at the dad. She was more concerned with how much it was going to cost to replace the door than the fact that her husband just discharged a firearm inside of the house. \"It can't cost that much!!!!\" her dad yelled. Then her mom said it would be about three fiddy and it was then I realized my friend's mom was a tall monster from the paleolithic era trying to trick her husband into thinking that there was an intruder in the house so she could kill us all in our sleep.

He has heard of its divine powers and enchanted taste all his life. So he embarks on a quest to the wonderful land of Pepsicola. Along the way, he picks up a ragtag group of misfits -Toucan Sam, a pirate who's allergic to peanuts, a girl with Twizzlers for hair, and Noam Chompsky, among others- and is threatened by an evil conglomerate made of companies that sell other soft drinks. Said villains try to kill him in vaguely punny ways- the Crush CEO tries to crush them, the Sprite president summons a hoard of fairies, etc.. The kid's final and most grueling task is to get through the realm of Cocacola, the warring neighbour of his destination country. He wears his only clean shirt, a Pepsi one, and he ends up near-constantly running from angry mobs, and at one point, the entire Cococola army. This creates a distraction, that allows the other side to strike a decisive blow. The Pepsi nation decides to honour him as a hero, but alas, the boy died at the hands of Coke's army. The whole of Pepsicola weeps at such a sorrow, and the tears bring him back to life. He refuses all rewards, saying he in truth is no real hero (and because he has no way to take any swag back home with him), and only wants to taste, for once in his life, the sweet, sweet taste of Crystal Pepsi. The Grand Vizier of the country takes him to the Crystal Pepsi spring, hidden deep underground, under the local Radio Shack. The youth cups his hands, dips them in the liquid and brings them up to his mouth. He takes a moment to catch his breath, and to reflect upon his lifelong dream being realized. He takes a deep drink, and then makes a face. \"This tastes like syrupy sugar sludge!

{"body": "&gt; The word wouldn't exist if it didn't have a purpose.\n\nWhich word? I assume you're referring to the word \"*agnostic*\". The word is used when discussing epistemology; that's what it means - \"gnosis\", *knowledge*; epistemology - the study of knowledge. It's not a word that you have to use every day every time you make a knowledge claim. If you did, it would be come *extremely* tedious. Can you imagine having to say \"*I'm an agnostic believer in the claim that I'll be right back, as I'm also an agnostic believer in the statement that I'm just going to the bathroom*\" instead of just \"*Be right back, going to the bathroom*\"? It would get pretty tiring, wouldn't it? Thankfully we don't have to deal with the idiocy of people assuming that we're making absolute claims requiring infinite knowledge every time we say something... except when it comes to religious beliefs or lack thereof.\n\n&gt; And yes, I would define myself as an agnostic mono-theist.\n\nI didn't ask you that. My point is, and I quote, \"*It's reserved for the one exception, religious beliefs or lack thereof.*\" So providing me an example of a religious belief while deliberately ignoring all of the other examples I gave you only reinforces my point. Let's try again, shall we?\n\nIf somebody asks you if you believe in Santa Claus, do you tell them that you are an agnostic non-believer in Santa Claus, or do you simply say that you don't believe in Santa Claus?\n\nIf somebody asks you if believe Islam is the correct religion, do you respond that you are an agnostic non-believer in the claim that Islam is the correct religion, or do you simply respond that you don't believe Islam is correct?\n\nIf somebody asks you if you believe in the Loch Ness monster, do you respond that you are an agnostic (non-)believer in the Loch Ness monster, or do you simply respond that you do or do not believe it?\n\nIf somebody asks you if you think there's a small chine teapot orbiting somewhere between the Earth and the Sun, do you respond that you are an agnostic-ateapotist, or do simply respond that you don't believe in the existence of this teapot?\n\nIf somebody asks you if you believe in aliens, do you respond that you are an agnostic alien(-non-)believer or do you simply tell them that you believe in aliens or don't?\n\nThe answer, of course, is that in *none* of these situations do you have to clarify that you are an agnostic, and in *none* of these situations would anybody ever accuse you of making absolute claims if you didn't. If somebody asked you if you believe in the Loch Ness monster, and you replied with \"*No, I don't believe in the Loch Ness monster*\", then they responded by saying \"*Ha! So you think you have infinite knowledge?*\" then you would rightly think them utterly ridiculous and walk away.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351682955", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

You can hold the belief that a God exists and still be an agnostic, and you can hold the belief that a God does not exist and still be an agnostic. The default position is to have no belief in a God, just as the default position is to have no belief in unicorns, no belief in aliens, no belief in the Loch Ness monster, no belief in the Hindu gods, no belief in ghosts etc. To get from there to the position that a non-interventionist God exists requires a leap of faith or reasoning.
