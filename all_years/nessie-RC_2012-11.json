Otters have hat same [head shape](http://www.naturefootage.com/video_clips/TSC03_252) when they peek out of the water. The two surgeons photos show different angles for the neck. This is easily explained with otters, but a toy model built by hoaxers would have had to have built two different models to make the neck change shape.\n\nThere are also several problems with the \"confession\" in adaption to the fact that the person who \"confessed\" wasn't actually the one who took the photo nor the one who supposedly built the model. Primarily is the fact that toy historians have pointed out that toy submarines of the era were not capable to actually being submerged. Also puzzling is that if the motivation for the hoax was to get revenge on a newspaper, why didn't the hoaxers come out right after the paper published the surgeons photo? Wouldn't that have been the best time to publicly shame the newspaper? Its sort of tough to publicly shame a newspaper if you keep the newspapers faults a secret for over 60 years.\n\nOccms razor: What sounds simpler? 1) Its an otter or 2) Two guys decided to get revenge on a newspaper but never actually carried out the revenge by building a toy model that the technology of the time couldn't do and then both took it to their death bed while a third guy who wasn't involved at all confessed to it without providing any other proof besides just his word.\n\nIts a freaking **otter**! Ya don't have to go the path of hoaxes and cover up and conspiracy and death bed confessions to prove that the loch ness monster is not real. Proving the loch ness monster is not real is very very easy. Its just an otter.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351811348", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Had something similar happen to me. I was in my 5th year of college after some family issues had forced me to drop out for part of one semester. There were some poor decisions on my part as well but it was mainly having to help take care of my sister (who was still in high school but lived an hour and a half away) since my single mother was often nowhere to be found. After she graduated she moved closer to me and life got easier as she and I were able to share an apartment, but money was still tight as we were both only able to work crappy on-campus jobs part time. On-campus housing was not an option either as they had some rule about 5th years not being allowed in the (admittedly overcrowded) dorms. Money was tight, to say the least. This was getting towards the end of the year and I had started to get worried about money- my on-campus job was about to dry up and I had no prospects in that city. I had been emailing and calling in all of my free time to try to find something- anything- to get me started so I wouldn't have to move back home (with my sister) to my mom's house. Again, since I was living with my sister moving wasn't an option unless it was to live with her. Between loan repayments and some unforeseen medical trips brought on by a drunk driver money was tight already and I had to have a job. Months went by as all of my leads ended up dead. Demand for my job was scarce in this region of the country (much less this city). Finally about a week before graduation I got a call from one of my professors that was helping me out and he told me about an interview opportunity that he had found at a branch of Company A here in the city, but the interview was that night only and it was in a city about 4 hours away (at the main headquarters). Unfortunately he had called while I was at work and didn't get the message until later that afternoon (I got off work at 11:00 AM after working the breakfast shift and the interview was to be at 4:00). I hauled it back to my room to try to get ready but the only interview-worthy outfit I had was dirty. I grabbed it and trucked it down to the laundry room to try to wash it before the interview, but when I got down there all of the washers were full. I quickly checked the knobs to see when they had started and it looked like all of them were only just started, but all were less than halfway. I waited there for a few minutes for someone to come by so I could ask them the favor of jumping in line in front of them, but no one came by, so I had to decide if I could wear the clothes as-is (obviously dirty) or be a douche and take someone else's clothes out of the wash. I decided to be a douche. I picked the one that looked like it had been started the latest and set all of their laundry on the cleanest place I could and began my load. Since I didn't have a pen or paper on me I decided to wait down there for the owner of the clothes to come by so I could explain myself and hope for the best- I figured best case scenario one of the other washers would finish and I could restart the load in a different washer. After waiting a few minutes my professor called back and I went outside to get some better reception and finalize some of the interview information, which lasted about 10 minutes. Apparently this was too long, and by the time I came back in I noticed that apparently the owner of the clothes I took out had returned, and, discovering what I had done, had thrown what appeared to be half a can of dorm-colored paint into the washing machine with my clothes, ruining the only vaguely \"nice\" clothes I even owned. I had to call my professor back and explain what happened- he said he understood my position and would relay that info back to the interviewing company and would get back to me. Of course they never did- I'm assuming they were able to hire someone else interviewing around the same time.\n\nLater on that week I was doing another load of laundry in the same room. I was paranoid that someone would mess with my clothes again, so I waited in the laundry room for them to finish up. Not to mention competition for the washers was fiercer than ever, because 1) people were washing up to move out and 2) the washer with the paint was now unusable. Since it was the end of the semester it was obvious that they weren't going to fix it until summer. I waited down there for a while and after a few minutes a couple of guys came down to do laundry and were idly chatting. One happened to mention to the other that the other day someone had taken his laundry out of the washer before it was done and had left, so he bragged about dumping paint into the wash to his frat-bro buddy, who giggled like an idiot at the tale. I decided that I would take the high road here and apologize for the mild inconvenience I caused him even though he ruined about $100 worth of clothes and cost me a job interview. I walked up and started to explain what happened- he started out smirking but by the time I got to the end he was apologizing profusely. I was still fairly upset at him and the situation as a whole, so when he asked me what he could do to repay me I told him there was pretty much only one thing I wanted. I told him \"You know, I could use about tree-fiddy.\" At this point I noticed that I was not a senior in college, but was actually a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351811698", "subreddit": "funny", "score": -6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Man, I just had the biggest realization about this with my (just now) ex-girlfriend. For some reason, after I first hook up with a girl, I kind of lose sight of whether she's actually attractive or not. It's like I can't look at it objectively – either I overcompensate and think she's hotter than she is because she's cool, or I get it in my head she's not hot enough because, deep down, I know that we don't really click. This girl was a prime example of the first situation. We met in college at a random frat party, side by side hitting the \"Octobong\" (an 8 tube beer bong). I was a freshman and she was a little older, but we somehow hit it off. I was on fire that night, making jokes and telling stories that a shy sucker like myself usually never has the balls to pull off. I really don't know how I'm so much more charming when I'm that drunk. We ended up hooking up that night at her place and got breakfast together the next morning. I was in love with her from then on. I can definitively say I may never love another as much as I did her. When I first introduced her to my friends, they were kind of critical. They'd say things like \"she's too tall\", or \"she's too old\", or \"she has bad skin\". I always just shrugged it off though. I liked that she was tall, and that she was older, it made me feel like a man, like I stood out. We went out for five years and went through everything together. We travelled the world, from the Pyramids Giza to Machu Picchu. We shared everything together, I feel like I know her soul and she knows mine, and I truly feel like there will always be a little piece of her soul in mine. But one day things just kind of came full circle and I realized the things my friends had said were true. It didn't really have to do with the fact that I had grown into my lanky frame, and gotten a lot more attention from the fairer sex. Nor was it that I wanted different things. I thought I knew exactly what I wanted. But that fateful day we were just lying in bed, chatting about nothing and everything all at the same time, and she really stumped me with a question. She asked me, \"if we were to stay together forever, what's the one thing you'll always need from me?\". I paused for a second to think, but I really didn't know. I mean is there one thing I could possibly respond with? Love? Emotional support? Something sexual? What could I even say? So, I turned the question around on her and asked what she would need. She was waiting for me to do that. She responded instantly: \"I need about tree fiddy\". And it was at that exact moment that I finally realized my girlfriend of five years was a giant eight foot crustacean from the Paleozoic Era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351869979", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;But I don't think your comparison is valid.\nSpecifically: That animals exist, is not equivalent to the conviction that animals have a right to not be eaten or bothered. \nSome people believe in god[s], some don't. Some people believe animals have a fundamental right to not be manipulated by humans, others do not. There is no objective proof in either case.\n\nThat is not my comparison, and you are making my point for me. My point is precisely that the two terms are *not* to be substituted. *You* are the one who wanted to '...replace \"animals\" with \"souls\" '.\n\nRegarding your desire to confuse ethics with ontology -  again, you're conflating two entirely different things. \n\nNormative ethics is not about 'believing' any particular entities exist. Religion is entirely about that belief. Most of us don't think that ethics is 'real' in the sense that christians think 'god' is real, or that sane people think, say, a particular chair is real. You aren't going to find empirical proof of some molecule of pure ethic under a microscope.\n\nEthics isn't under the same obligation to be 'proved' empirically in that way. You seem to want to confuse the multiple definitions of the word 'belief' to make, IMO, a dishonest point. 'Belief' in particular ethics is not the same as 'Belief' in god, or the loch ness monster. \n\nAs I pointed out before, you can literally say that any ethical statement 'is what Mormons and fundies believe, if you just replace... etc,' it doesn't just apply to veganism. \n\nIf people proselytise against racism, or sexism, or homophobia, is that 'not much different than doing the same about accepting Jesus?' \n\nOr are you wanting to say that veganism is somehow *especially* similar, over and above all those other ethical positions? If so, why? Because it's a position not held by the majority? How about anti-sexism 'proselytising' in contemporary Saudi Arabia, say, or against slavery 200 years ago? Is that not much different than doing the same about accepting Jesus? \n\nOf course, ethical and religious beliefs are utterly, fundamentally different, as are the behaviours that follow from those beliefs.

{"body": "[](/squintyvinyl) It became a massive problem. Johto was the first region to realise the problem behind too many trainers capturing too many pokémon. As numbers of wild pokémon decreased, and the number of new trainers increased, Professor Elm and his team did the math that would shake the foundations of the system that the pokémon world relied upon.\n\n[](/pinkasad) As numbers of wild pokémon decreased, Professor Elm set about telling the world that, unless strict regulations were put in place *immediately*, wild pokémon would simply cease to exist, and new pokémon trainers would have no pokémon to capture, and the whole system would collapse upon itself.\n\n[](/disangry) However, the greedy governments did not approve of Elm's message and did everything they could to surpress such delicate information becoming public. Elm's word *did* get out, but before the movement could gain any momentum, the government made a controversial move; they assassinated Professor Elm by destroying his laboratory whilst he was inside, and all of the research was lost.\n\n[](/chaos) And so it began. One region after another simply ran out of wild pokémon, whilst the government stuttered and stalled to bring in regulations that would stop the madness - they were too wrapped up in their system, all they could see were their precious pokédollars.\n\n[](/lpcrying) What followed was utter mayhem. People stole, rioted, even maimed and killed fellow trainers, in a mad dash to try and reach the top of a crumbling dogpile. The years came and went. Society was on its knees.

The few pokémon that were left alive had been raised in captivity since birth and any attempts to reintroduce them into the wild were usually met with early deaths.\n\nIt was over. The world of pokémon had gone. Legends tell of a few who survived; the most famous being the tale of the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n[](/ajsmile)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351980430", "subreddit": "pokemon", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "EDIT: Yes, there IS a tl;dr at the end.\n\nRight, this one actually happened... exactly a week ago today, actually! On my birthday.\n\nAnyway, back in my last 2 years of high school I had this friend. She was a new girl, and not many people liked her, so we ended up hanging out. She seemed like a great friend, but tended to do shit to me that'd make me feel like crap, but I was the kind of person who put up with it.\n\nThen, about a month ago, I hear that she's in the area, and it's my birthday coming up (last week, btw) so I invite her to stay for the weekend since my girlfriend couldn't come down due to work and whatnot, and because it'd be nice to have someone there other than my regular friends, especially since we hadn't seen each other in about 2 years.\n\nThen it started. The moment I realized how much of a monumental bitch she was. Don't stop reading, read on, seriously, it gets good soon.\n\nBasically, the first point was the introduction to all my friends. \"Hi I'm [redacted] nice to meet you. I was pretty much Rory's only friend in high school haha he was such a loser\" and things along those lines. Now, that was totally false right there. So then she goes on to say a bunch of things to my friends about how I was always unclean, how I was never dressed up properly (no shit, bitch, we had to wear school uniforms, a hurr durr) and how my room was constantly messy, shit like that. She basically spent ages putting me down in front of all my friends just to make herself look good even though she would probably never see them again.\n\nBut, it gets better. On the night of the celebration of my birthday (since the actual day was a Sunday... eugh...) she met one of my best friends, who happens to be a redditor so you'll probably see this HI TOM &lt;3 anyway he basically introduced himself and was being one of the friendliest guys ever, like he always is (background: he has a pretty serious relationship) and she took it as flirting, purely because she thinks she's hot shit. Literally she thought all the guys who talked to her that weekend were flirting with her. I wish I was joking. \n\nThen when we left, she told me how he was a massive asshole because he was flirting with her and stuff, even though he is just a friendly guy who wants to be nice to everyone. But NOOOOOOOO he's an asshole because she thought she was hot shit.\n\nThen came my house. She stayed on the couch, which was great because she's a sleep talker, and at one point yelled out in the middle of the night. She was also a heavy sleeper, and slept all day for the entire weekend she was here. Now, I wouldn't mind the fact that she slept most of the time, but after she woke up and complained that I was on reddit (because she was asleep) she said \"I came down here so we could spend time together.\" now. while her intentions may seem well, seriously? Nah. Not a chance.\n\nAlso, on my birthday, she wanted Dominos because they did 2-4-1 on my birthday, but I couldn't afford it, yet she demanded it, almost angrily, so I said \"Fine I'll walk down and get your pizza\" and I ended up crying on the phone to my girlfriend. I broke down, and realized that she'd made my birthday really shitty. I also looked back at all the times she left me for other friends, and how shit she made me feel. Then, I decided to lock myself in my room because I had enough of her shit. \n\nWe then talked about the whole thing, and she basically gave me a \"oh woe is me, you're an asshole for not ever getting me any water, not feeding me proper food, not treating me with respect, not wanting to do what I want to do yadda yadda\" on MY BIRTHDAY. Oh, and she also complained, saying she spent loads on me that weekend when all she did was buy me a kebab. Which was around $8. She then proceeded to tell me how my housemates went behind my back to tell her how I was being a massive asshole and that I should be sending her money for all the things that she's been buying me (i.e. all the kebab she bought me. All one of them.) and that I was a terrible friend and shit. Yeah, that's not how it works. I know my housemates better than her. If they were going to say that I was a bad host, they would have told me, not her. \n\nBut, in the end, I told her \"Well how much do I owe you then, because apparently me owing you money is more important than you ruining our friendship by being a total bitch.\"\n\nAnd I haven't heard a word from her since, or her best friend who is a friend of mine, or anyone even remotely close to her. She's actually disappeared off the map to me, actually, and I've been the happiest I've been since I met and last saw my lovely girlfriend.\n\ntl;dr invited long time friend over for birthday, she turned into a bitchy, self obsessed asshole who treated me like shit, demanded so much crap from me and then got angry at me for not wanting to do what she wanted to do on my birthday, then tree fiddy loch ness monster.\n\nOh, and we're no longer friends, and we never will be again.

{"body": "Yesterday was my 19th birthday, so me and my buddies decided to celebrate by going to the bars at my college campus (minimum age is 19). I usually don't drink too much, but, since it was a special occasion, I decided to get really wasted. We pre-drank a lot before the bar, since it's difficult to obtain alcohol in a bar when none of us are 21, plus it's really expensive so I wasn't trying too hard to get my friends with fake IDs to buy me some. I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my mind.\n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this really hot chick dancing by herself. Being drunk , I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance sexy! Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up grinding hard/making out a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes.\n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated. We were making out a lot on my bed, and we took off each others shirts and things were really escalating. I had her clothes off, and I was starting to think me losing my virginity was a sure thing. I could tell she was really into it. She said \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". I figured she meant me going down on her, and me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\". Then the question came: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"I aint givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!

She starts talking about how she came over from Ireland and that's all well and good, but then she starts saying she'll get sent home if she doesn't marry someone soon.  I start to panic.  I just wanted to get my dick wet.  I just sort of laugh it off nervously.  \n\nWell we get to the end of dinner and I'm ready to high tail it out of there and I pull out my wallet.  She pulls out hers and says she'll get the bill, but she says I can get the tip.  I asked her how much I owed and she looked at me and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNOW IT WAS ABOUT THAT TIME that I noticed my date was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.

{"body": "OK THIS POST IS REALLY LONG SORRY ;-; we've got a kind of long story haha.\n\nMy boyfriend and I are both band kids. We're about seven hours apart when I'm at home-home, and three and a half hours apart when I'm at school-home. He's actually up in Indianapolis right now for the biggest competition of the year...the one we met at last year.\n\nThe travel company our bands had booked the trip through was hosting a party in the hotel across the street from ours. They served pizza and fruit punch and it was a pretty good time. A marching band actually ended up coming in at one point and that was pretty cool -- there were about five or six bands' worth of kids (so easily a thousand of us, considering there were three large bands of 200-300 kids and probably 1-2 smaller ones...I don't know the exact numbers.)\n\nI was hanging out with my friend Aaron, who went to my school, and Xander, who went to another school (I'd met him the previous summer at a summer camp hosted by the same people hosting the competition). I was having a good time...normally I'm not a partier but it was full of band kids so I got to hang out with cool people, y'know? Anyways, so Xander had gone off somewhere and I was just shootin' the breeze with Aaron when I say \"Wait a minute, there's a guy over there wearing an awesome shirt and I really gotta go high-five him.\"\n\nThe guy in question was wearing a Minecraft creeper t-shirt (which is actually currently in my possession....bwahahaha) and I walked right up to him and told him \"Hey, your t-shirt is awesome! Can I get a high-five?\" He said sure, and we high-fived. Then he asked me what my name was. I told him my name, he told me his, and we started talking more. We kept talking that whole night, and he says he felt that \"spark\" between us. My memory is absolutely terrible (it's a wonder I can remember this much of the story, but he helps) so I don't remember if I did or not, but he swears up and down that he did. :)\n\nThe party was showing a livestream of the prelims results announcement, and I was following the txbands live blog on my phone -- they do live coverage of a lot of major band events, mostly in Texas -- and I was actually getting results before the video feed was showing them. Heh.\n\nSo anyways my now-boyfriend and I kept talking and right as we were about to exchange phone numbers, his phone literally dies. Like, it whitescreens and won't even turn back on. He's kind of freaked out, but I shrug it off and I add him on Facebook from my phone. We leave the party eventually, and I don't really think anything of the encounter besides \"hey, I just met this cool kid from another band.\"\n\nThe next day is the semifinals and finals competitions, and my band kicks some ASS in semis. Like...man we did good. My dad finds me in the stands, we watch some performances, and then it's results time and the announcement of the finalists. I don't remember when they announced my band but we were seriously crying. My school was four years old, and the little blue band that could made *finals*. The stadium cleared out after the finalists were announced, and we went back to the convention center that rehearsals had been held at for dinner.\n\nAs I'm walking in to get in line, I hear someone call out my name. He horribly butchers the pronunciation of my last name, but whatever. He can say it properly now :P It's the dude from last night! Cool! I go stand with him in line and we start talking. Again. We get food, and I end up sitting with him and a bunch of kids from his band. Everyone else finishes their food and leaves...and the two of us are still talking. We end up leaving almost at the same time to go off with our respective bands to get ready for finals performance, even though we perform second-to-last and last.\n\nSo this particular competition has what we call a full finals retreat. That means every member of every one of the ten bands in finals plus the class exhibition bands is on the field at the same time. [It gets pretty crowded.](http://neisd.net/fa/Fine%20Arts%20News/images/Grand-Nationals-Finals-Retreat-700.jpg) We'd agreed to meet on the 50 after break ranks was called. The finals ceremony was INCREDIBLY long (and when you've both back and ankle injuries, it's doubly so) and as Dan Potter FINALLY calls break ranks, I quickly congratulate the drumline of the band to my right, and turn around to see who else but my current boyfriend. We walk around together and I end up with the hottest item of the season -- a full pair of black gloves with neon-green palms from Carmel. Most people only got one.\n\nThe bus ride back home was mostly uneventful. I'd had my eye on possibly dating one of my friends, but that basically never happened because once I showed interest, he completely dropped all of his. Good for me, though, because my now-boyfriend and I started talking again once he got back home and accepted my friend request. I posted on his wall, we started Skyping...and we haven't stopped talking since. He asked me out exactly a month after we met. :) It's been almost a year to the day that we've known each other, and our anniversary is this weekend. He's the absolute sweetest boy ever and I couldn't ask for anyone better. [He even visited me for prom and I'm going to visit him for his senior prom this year, too. :)](http://i.imgur.com/zSCX9)\n\n**tl;dr: band kids meet at major competition, fall in love, neither one is the loch ness monster**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352351018", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Is that correct? \n\nEDIT: More on this question at the bottom. \n\nI'm going to grab the questions from your other comment instead of forking into two long simultaneous threads.\n\n&gt;Your first 3 quotes all really just say that fertilization is the beginning of development. That's not what I'm asking, i think everyone agrees that is the point at which development begins. But that zygote doesn't have a brain or a liver or a heart...does it have a (for lack of a better term) soul? It's alive in the sense that it is metabolizing, but does it posses the status of human life?\n\nI was only attempting to answer the biological question of when life begins. I take your questions about ensoulment and \"status of human life\" as philosophical/metaphysical questions. They are very important questions, and I have thoughts about them, but are we on the same page that those are not biological questions? I don't want to accidentally strawman you.\n\n&gt;But that zygote doesn't have a brain or a liver or a heart.\n\nI completely agree. I never said it does. I don't think any of those things are necessary to argue for it's value, although I know that sounds counter-intuitive for people that think a functioning brain is a necessary condition for value.\n\n&gt;I'm asking a more Ship of Theseus question in reverse; at what point does it become a human life? Sure, the process of the replacement of the Ship of Theseus began with the replacement of a few planks....but when did the ship get to the point where it is no long the original ship?\n\nEXCELLENT question. (I hope I don't sound patronizing. That's not at all my attitude. I just think this is the most interesting sub-topic within the debate about early embryology.)\n\nRichard Stith [wrote an article](http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2006/11/stith-arguing-with-pro-choicer) explaining why he thinks some pro-choice people think pro-life people are nuts. I'll summarize it, although the entire article is worth reading. He basically said that most people think of human development like the process a car goes through during construction on a factory line. The question, \"when is it a car\" is difficult if not impossible to determine. Some people would say when the engine is in place, some would say when the car drives off the lot, but *nobody* would say it's a car when the first two pieces of steel are welded together. Many pro-choice people think construction is analagous to pregnancy. So it makes sense to say that it's impossible to know when philosophical life begins, maybe in the middle, maybe at birth, but nobody in their right mind would say it starts at fertilization.\n\nHere's why Richard Stith thinks their reasoning is flawed: human beings aren't *constructed*. They *develop* themselves from within.\n\nIn other words, humans (and other animals) develop more like a Polaroid picture does. Imagine you're fishing with your friend on Loch Ness, and suddenly Nessie pops her head out. Since you're a weird antique collector, the only camera you have with you is a Polaroid camera, but nonetheless, you quickly get a nice, clear shot before Nessie goes back underwater. The little piece of film comes out and your friend excitedly grabs it from you. He then looks in disgust at the little smudge, assumes that the camera malfunctioned, and stupidly rips up the picture and throws the remains in the lake. Would you be justifiably upset? Of course! Because the picture was there, you just couldn't see it yet, but nothing needed to be added. It just needed to develop itself from within.\n\nI think that's how humans develop. A heart isn't added at 22 days after fertilization. It develops a heart from within at 22 days.\n\n&gt;I don't follow the logic in the 4th quote between \"zygote is radically unlike sperm or egg\" and \"thus life starts at that point\". Is she asserting that a radical change from one state to another is the criterion?\n\nPerhaps I shouldn't have quoted from the summary of the article instead of a section within the article. It might have over-simplified it. I'm sure the whitepaper answers your question better than I could. I think her argument is that an embryo becomes a unique organism at the beginning of fertilization as opposed to some point later in the 12-24 hour process like syngamy, because of the way the embryo acts after sperm penetration. Whether or not that's a solid biological argument is above my paygrade. I'd be interested in hearing any counter-arguments though. My view before this paper was that syngamy was a more important landmark than sperm penetration, but her paper kind of convinced me otherwise. \n\nIt doesn't really effect the abortion debate if the person agrees that biological life begins at some point during the process. That's why I sometimes say, \"by the time the fertilization process is complete...\" to cover myself. I'm not that concerned with how certain we can be about the landmark during the process that really signals an individual human life.\n\nThat's weird about the link not working. It worked when I tested it. Here's the full link: [http://bdfund.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wi_whitepaper_life_print.pdf](http://bdfund.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wi_whitepaper_life_print.pdf)\n\nOh, it looks like you answered my question from the beginning of the comment here:\n\n&gt;The cells in my incubator react to stimuli, they convert food to energy, and they grow.\n\nWhat do the cells grow into? If you leave them alone to develop, do they simply reproduce more stem cells, or do they develop to the next stage of development? I think that's probably the key difference.

{"body": "I think the worst thing I ever did was drink bleach by accident because I thought it was milk.\n\nThing is, our family liked reusing things. And whenever we went out, my mom used to wash out old bleach bottles and use them to store milk in so I could snack on it. We didn't buy bottled water and we found the bleach bottles were for some reason better to carry around than the cartons we used to get milk in. \n\nYou can tell where this is going.\n\nOne time, I was left home alone, and like kids do, I got hungry. I'd seen the bleach bottles under the sink, had drank delicious milk from those bottles, and put two and two together. I opened up the sink and as luck would have it one of the bottles was open. \n\nNow, I don't know if you know this, but some brands of bleach do actually taste almost tolerable. That's why they have to be kept in child-proof containers to stop kids drinking them. It was a white liquid, so I just drank the lot without thinking. It was an odd taste but I just thought it was a new brand of milk.\n\nAt that point my mom burst in on me drinking the lot and started screaming with horror. They called 911 and immediately rushed me to hospital.\n\nBy the time I got there I was slipping in and out of consciousness, and my stomach was killing me. I was scared of dying but at the same time I just wanted the pain to pass. The thing is, I was from a poor family, and I remember as I started passing out in the ER my mom pleading with the doctor to treat me. She promised him anything he wanted. I remember his words to this day.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this point that I realised that my doctor was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.\n\n\"I ain't givin you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!\" I yelled as my stomach started dissolving, \"Get your own goddamn money!\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352483510", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Looking out across the water I saw something out of the corner of my eye. Figuring it was that god dang Lock Ness monster again I figured I'd take out the three fifty its always going on about. \n\nTurns out this was no Loch Ness monster, but a 15$ Golden fish.\n\nOh Sake, its all good bud. Prices are a hard thing to nail down especially in a community of collectors. \n\nWhen dealing with retailers like T&amp;T or your local card shop, theres a fixed posted price they put up and you essentially have to meet it or \"screw off.\" Its similar with ebay as well. Even in their auctions most valuables have reserved prices.\n\nIn a barter/auction community-based system of exchange like the one our little subreddit operates in, the value of a card is determined by what the individual feels is worth paying and what the seller is willing to let the card go for.\n\nSure we can look at the baseline price outside our community to determine value (Heck thats how I most of my trade value pricing, then cut it 20-50%), but we as a community need to understand that our market and motives for participating in this market specifically are a little different than our interactions anywhere else.\n\nGiven that our online system of exchange primarily revolves around trade, lets think of how that system of exchange traditionally operates: without cash. A goods' worth is based on the amount of time it takes the \"active lister\" to procure it, the goods' scarcity, how essential the \"seeking agent\" views it, and even loyalty or social status relationships of privilege (Schultz, 2009).\n\nWe take all theses things into consideration, and realize that our authority as traders and members of this community are in relation to one another. In order to survive, effectively operate, and build status we need to understand the unique nature of our community.\n\nAnother example of catering to a communal market system is FMTU's card shop. Yes there are fixed prices, but the prices listed are always below that of any online shop I've ever seen. Why? Because he is a catering to a community that falls outside the basic system of exchange, and in knowing this, he tailors his prices accordingly.\n\nTo seek anything but the \"fair and fixed\" market price of a good in a traditional market economy is seen as madness because there is often a net loss associated with such action. Why does it occur here in our little pseudo cash n' barter system? In part because are not established agents of trade with the resources to go mainstream, but our community can also be examined through the lens of Good Neighbourliness (Igoe, 2004).\n\nA market philosophy commonly employed by indigenous groups, Good Neighbourliness is all about treating your neighbour well in their time of need so they in turn will do the same to you (Igoe, 2004). Of course there are comparable value sets in our own society, but since we are a trade oriented system and this example evolved from a trade oriented system, lets stick with it.\n\nWith Good Neighbourliness, you have a social responsibility to work with others to ensure an equality of exchange and resource use (Igoe, 2004). This does not mean that the rest of the community has the right to veto exchanges because one person is getting a better deal, the individual is making that choice in order to acquire the goods he desires. It just means that others in the community should realize what one neighbour has done to the other in exploiting him, and that it will be remembered the next time he requires something from the community (Igoe, 2004). \n\nIn a way this is almost what our Rep page does. It gives each \"Active Seeker\" a report on the \"Active lister\" based on their past actions if they can be trusted as fair, honest, and good traders. Given that we have no real authority to exert powers over others beyond banning them from the sub, its amazing how smoothly things tend to operate.\n\nThis \"Law Without Order\" is based on the understanding that communities work together to achieve common goals and ensure prosperity against those who would upset that order (Ellickson, 1991). It helps that reddit itself operates in an abstract karma-based system because it implies that most users subscribe to the idea of worthless yet worthwhile rewards for significant contributions (Up-votes) are a good thing, but that and altruistic motives are really the only things keeping this system of exchange sustainable.\n\nWhat does this this speak to our groups' objectives? Well apart from catching them all, one could argue that because we rely on a reputation system that earns you status based on repeated interactions and transactions to determine whether or not users will interact with one another in the pursuit of acquiring pokemon cards, one of our pursuits is that we have a stable system of exchanges in which to operate.\n\nFinding a stable conception is not simply a matter of avoiding problems or punishing deviance however. What counts is the kind of stability and the nature of the forces that secure it- us (Rawls, 2003).\n\nWhen we trade or sell in here it isn't just for pure profit. We are also building a community of players and collectors who have invested their time and money into something we love. For those of us who don't have leagues or local shops as a passionate haven for pokemon cards, all we get is the cold interaction at a walmart till. This sub along with /r/pkmntcg and /r/pkmntcgcollections are the closest some of us will ever get having a sense of community while doing something we enjoy.\n\nThe point is that even the \"Experts\" don't get it right when it comes to pricing and we operate in a very unique situation. The popularization of the internet is relatively young when compared to the long history of market and trade based exchange. The system is still going through growing pains. We are the pioneers of the new-age digital market and we will determine how this hybridity grows. So don't feel that bad man. Its a lovely card to have. I've seen you around the forum enough to know you're an alright dude. \n\nI apologize on behalf of all the people who may be showing some animosity towards you right now. I know none of us would ever want to hurt one of our own, so I'm sure they didn't mean to be so harsh.\n\nBibliography\n\nEllickson, Robert C. *\"Order Without Law: How Neighbours Settle Disputes\"* Harvard University Press 1991\n\nIgoe, Jim *\"Conservation and Globalization: A Study of National Parks and Indigenous Communities from East Africa to South Dakota\"* Thomson Wadsworth 2004\n\nSchultz, Emily A. *\"Cultural Anthropology: A Perspective on the Human Condition\"* Seventh Edition Oxford University Free Press 2009\n\nRawls, John \"*Justice As Fairness: A Restatement\"* Harvard University Press 2003\n\n**TDRL: We are a special group of people operating in a unique market-trade exchange hybrid that hasn't existed very long compared to the history of markets as a whole.

I've never bought from her and I think it drives her secretly crazy because I will occasionally buy from someone else in the office.\n\nLast year she came around with the old cookie order form again.

I can make due with just one box of the thin mints, so I ask her how much they are this year.

{"body": "I'm Vietnamese but moved to the US years ago. My father fought against the Americans in the war. He never saw any actual combat but has a pretty interesting story of the time he took care of an American prisoner.\n\nSome time in 1963 he witnessed an American fighter get shot down over water in the north. Around where his group was stationed, other soldiers were operating a Soviet anti-aircraft weapon called the ZU-23. Anyway, it was night and they were firing off into the darkness and eventually hit an aircraft. My father was sent out with 2 other soldiers and local fishermen to go out in search of the pilot. After an hour or so they finally found the man who was so badly busted that he just gave himself up. My father told me that the aircraft he was piloting turned out to be an A-4 Skyhawk, which in the Vietnam war took heavy losses.\n\nThey took the American back to their camp on a bamboo stretcher but there was no prison nearby so his fate was going to be decided by the fired-up soldiers who shot his plane down. They tied him up and tortured him for hours until he passed out. The next day they brought in interrogators from a nearby Vietcong camp to get any intelligence they could out of him. My father told me that when this was going on, he was responsible for keeping him alive by feeding him and bringing him water.\n\nMy father asked the interrogators to stop torturing him, convincing them that he would just end up lying in order to get it to stop. Apparently because he was responsible for taking care of the prisoner, they had some sort of closeness sparked between them. My father would speak to him in Vietnamese and the prisoner would reply in English or just smile and nod. Neither knew what the other was talking about but foreigners can communicate with some effectiveness non-verbally.\n\nThat night when the rest of the camp was asleep, my father got up to check on the prisoner, whose name ended up being James. (It was just a word he kept repeating ever since he was captured and then when my father finally realized that he was saying his own name, he repeated it and the prisoner nodded and said \"yes, yes.\" So that's what he called him.) He got James some water and they began to talk. Eventually my father noticed that James was looking distressed. He kept looking down. My father asked \"is there something wrong?\" It didn't matter that neither understood the other when they could communicate with their eyes and facial expressions.\n\nJames appeared to be looking down at his lower body, and my father pointed to his stomach and asked if it was hurting. James nodded and my father moved forward and lifted up his shirt to see what was hurting. He started touching him on the stomach and James moved his head from side to side, saying \"no, no\". James kept looking down. My father realized that he was trying to point out his crotch. He took his hand off James' stomach and pointed at his crotch, asking him if that's what was hurting. James nodded furiously.\n\nMy father realized that since James had his hands tied up, he had not been able to masturbate, so that's why he was distressed. My father paused for awhile while thinking about helping the prisoner out with his problem. He knew that not having a release like this was also like torture. James looked so desperate, only needing help. Since him and my father had gotten so close, he decided to help him out. He moved his hand down James' stomach to just above his pants. James was looking into my father's eyes, begging him. He opened up his pants and saw James' cock getting hard, making an outline against his underwear. He pulled his pants down further in order to see the full length of James' cock.\n\nIt was nice and big and straining against his underwear. \"He really needs release\", my father thought. \"Please, please\" James pleaded. My father slowly pulled down the helpless prisoner's underwear to free his big circumsized American cock. He put his hand around it and rubbed the leaking precum around the head. James moaned and closed his eyes. He was going to enjoy this. Slowly stroking up and down the entire length of the shaft, James was getting the best handjob he had ever gotten. \n\n\"You like that?\" My father asked, quickening his pace. James did nothing but moan deeper, the pleasure clear in his voice and desperate facial expression. Faster and faster my father jerked James, until he realized James was starting to get close. He started focusing on the head, telling him to cum. Finally James started spurting out ropes of white cum all over my father's hand and Vietcong uniform. James cried out in pleasure and put his head back and could do nothing as loads of hot semen were drained out of him, hitting my father's skin. Eventually James stopped shooting and he opened his eyes, grinning madly.\n\n\"Is there anything else?\" my father asked, smiling.\n\n\"Just one thing,\" James said, suddenly speaking in perfect Vietnamese. \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it was about that time that my father noticed that James was no ordinary American air serviceman. He was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the palezoic era.\n\n\"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own damn money!\" My father screamed at him.\n\nJames waded off into the distance and my father never loved again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352598247", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 112, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;I suppose my point was that British culture could be seen to be a much wider umbrella of things than Scottish culture, so people who are either immigrants or recent descendants of immigrants might more readily associate themselves with Britain as a whole.\n\nAhh okay, thank you for clearing that up. \n\n&gt;Damn. I was hoping you were English so I would be able to explain the differences more easily. \n\nHaha, I'm from New England, does that count?  (That's the part of the US that's in the north east, east of New York state. It's not really any sort of political boundary or anything. just where some of the original colonies were, but we still like to call ourselves 'New Englanders')\n\n&gt;We have healthcare which is free at the point of service, and a variety of benefits in our welfare system for various circumstances, although I beleive Americans tend to see this sort of thing as socialist?\n\nYou do hear such things, but honestly I think that's a bit silly, and I'm not sure how actually widespread that belief is.  It might just be a very vocal minority saying things like this, I don't really know, myself.\n\n&gt;...It may still be of interest, just so you understand that we have a degree of self governance, but not independance or a federal system.\n\n: nods : though it probably won't come up, I will keep it in mind. \n\n&gt;in fact the party currently in power (the Scottish national party or SNP) was likely helped into that position by most of the English based newspapers being very anti SNP before the election in which the SNP gained power.\n\nLOL that's great. XD\n\n&gt;Out of interest, could you tell me what the story is actually about (roughly anyway), then I might be able to highlight perhaps more relevant differences.\n\nWell, it's about an arts academy.  Glen (that's his name, or...really it's Guren, but he got nicknamed Glen early on in his life... anyway, probably not that relevant here...) is there to study piano.  He's not really the main character but he is sort of the main character's sidekick and does get his own significant subplot.  \n\nThough you have me a little worried now that you mentioned the 'Scottish drunk' stereotype, since Glen does wind up drinking quite a bit.  I'd actually based his character on the mythical Japanese version of the tanuki (raccoon-dog) who's traits are a bottle of sake in one hand, and a promissory note he'll never pay back in the other. ( http://www.obakemono.com/obake/tanuki/ ) You see them often outside restaurants and are a symbol of hospitality. (http://pinkytoky.hubpages.com/hub/popular-japanese-souvenir-tanuki-statue )  I don't really wish to offend anyone, but at the same time, I'd rather not change that bit of Glen's subplot if I don't have to.  \n\nHis father's family is world-renowned for their taiko drum manufacture, having an extensive history in fine instrument making for generations, however Glen's father is sort of the black sheep of the family.  His older brother (Glen's Uncle) inherited the company proper, only leaving Glen's father (sorry, he doesn't have a name yet) a token portion of the family business (which actually is still not really too shabby).  Glen's dad then decides to branch out to other forms of instruments, which eventually leads him to Scotland.  I haven't really decided on what instrument he came to study... I guess the obvious thing would be bagpipes, but I need to do more research.  Any suggestions? Since they're traditionally a drum company, maybe some kind of traditional Scottish drum?  Actually, do you have any recommendations on some good traditional Scottish folk music?\n\nGrowing up in a musical environment (For instance, one of his fondest childhood memories is his dad and him refurbishing an old Boesendorfer together.), Glen found he loved piano and eventually became good enough to attend the arts academy where the story takes place.  \n\nThe story itself is probably about 70 percent music academy drama, 30 percent supernatural elements. Don't know if that's important, but maybe there will be more suspension of disbelief in a supernatural drama than if I went with a straight music school story.   OH but that reminds me.  I've been looking into (or trying to) Scottish mythology I might want to color the story with, but apart from the Loch Ness Monster, I'm having a hard time finding anything that's not under the blanket term of Celtic Mythology.  I don't suppose you know of any myths that are quintessentially Scottish, do you?  Really beyond the scope of this post now, but what the heck... might as well ask anyway.

Also, it wouldn't bother me as much if Polaroid film had the same failure rate of fertilized eggs in utero (ranging from 1 in 4 to 1 in 6).\n\nI don't think the fact that many early human beings die in the womb is relevant to the biological or philosophical discussion. Just because something happens a lot naturally doesn't necessarily give us the right to do it. For example, just because a country may get a lot of earthquakes doesn't give us the right to nuke them.\n\nAnd yes, I would be upset if I got a picture of Nessie, and even though the film only had a 1 out of 4 chance of developing, my friend ripped it up before I could see. But that's not the point of the story. The point of the story is contrasting construction with development.\n\n&gt;Also, if someone approached a pregnant woman, drugged her, and forced her to have an abortion, you'd have pro-life and pro-choice people holding each others' pitchforks and sharing torches.\n\nOf course we would. Most pro-choice people would be upset because that wasn't the woman's choice, and pro-life people would be upset, both because of the egregious crime to the woman, and because they believe a baby was killed.\n\n&gt;The paper you linked works now. I lightly skimmed over the basic biology part. The author does have a few things wrong...but nothing is hugely incorrect. I assumed at first this was primary literature or at least a review, but apparently it's just a white paper; that detracts a lot of weight from it. Furthermore, it is put out by the Catholic church. I really can't see it as an unbiased look into the issue. Imagine reading an article written by a staunch pro-choice group arguing for loss of specific dependence being the cutoff (that is, once the fetus can survive out of the womb). Nothing wrong with it, just that it is going to be biased; there is a conflict of interest there.\n\nThis paragraph is a little confusing to me. First you state that there are no major problems with the article, and then you complain about the source. I agree that it's helpful to have neutral sources, (and I gave you several,) but I think if somebody rejected the information in this article simply because the publisher (not author) is Catholic, they would be committing the Genetic Fallacy. I've spoken with Dr. Condic and she is far from biased. She dislikes several pro-life talking points that imply inaccurate things about fetal development, [as do I](http://prolifepodcast.net/2012/10/how-much-do-pro-lifers-need-to-know-about-embryology/).\n\n&gt;My main problem with saying fertilization is the only place one can use to define as the start of life means that one of each monozygotic twin pair is not a human being. That is, of course, absurd.\n\nNo, I would say the biological life of the twin that splits off begins at the point of splitting. \n\nEven if I'm wrong about that, I think twinning and recombination is a really fascinating thing that very young human beings can do, (like living without a heartbeat or brain activity) but it doesn't prove that they are not human beings. You can cut a flatworm in half and you end up with two flatworms, but that doesn't mean you didn't have a flatworm before the split.\n\n&gt;But I do occasionally take the precursor cells and \"tell\" them to develop into different types of epithelium, fibroblasts, endothelium, or a few other things. But they have a tendency to form epithelium, that's what they are there for (caveat : this is not completely accepted yet. It's work in progress). But these are tissue resident cells, the ones that reside in the marrow are different.\n\nI agree that you need to \"tell\" stem cells what you want them to become, but I'm not sure how much instruction is given by the womb or anything else that \"tells\" an embryo what do do next in the stage of development. As you said, there's still research being done in this area though.\n\nIt seems like if you look at a healthy fetal human at just about any point of development, it seems to be growing and developing itself from within to the next stage of development. That seems very different from stem cells that have been cultured and told to become a certain kind of tissue. I can't think of another point in human development besides the beginning to call it a human being. I don't think it becomes value at some later stage of development.\n\nOne thought from the scientific community has been to say it's possibly valuable as early as 14 days, because that's the point when twinning/recombination is no longer possible. That's why human embryos are always killed for their stem cells before they are 14 days old. Even if we decided that *was* the point you have a person, that would pretty much ban all abortions, because they can't do them at two weeks post-fertilization age.\n\nThoughts?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352668649", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

So like a rabbit caught in the headlights I asked \"well what precentage do you think is appropriate for such a small bill?\" She replied \"Well I think I need about tree fiddy\" It was about that time I realised that the waitress was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era. So I said \"Goddam you loch ness monster, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" Needless to say my sister couldn't work out what was going on, so she just bolted and left me to deal with it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352683938", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Public places include parks, sidewalks, malls, etc. Malls? Yeah. Even though it’s technically private property, being open to the public makes it public space.\n\nII. If you are on public property, you can take pictures of private property. If a building, for example, is visible from the sidewalk, it’s fair game.\n\nIII. If you are on private property and are asked not to take pictures, you are obligated to honor that request. This includes posted signs.\n\nIV. Sensitive government buildings (military bases, nuclear facilities) can prohibit photography if it is deemed a threat to national security.\n\nV. People can be photographed if they are in public (without their consent) unless they have secluded themselves and can expect a reasonable degree of privacy. Kids swimming in a fountain? Okay. Somebody entering their PIN at the ATM? Not okay.\n\nVI. The following can almost always be photographed from public places, despite popular opinion:\n\naccident &amp; fire scenes, criminal activities\nbridges &amp; other infrastructure, transportation facilities (i.e. airports)\nindustrial facilities, Superfund sites\npublic utilities, residential &amp; commercial buildings\nchildren, celebrities, law enforcement officers\nUFOs, the Loch Ness Monster, Chuck Norris\nVII. Although “security” is often given as the reason somebody doesn’t want you to take photos, it’s rarely valid. Taking a photo of a publicly visible subject does not constitute terrorism, nor does it infringe on a company’s trade secrets.\n\nVIII. If you are challenged, you do not have to explain why you are taking pictures, nor to you have to disclose your identity (except in some cases when questioned by a law enforcement officer.)\n\nIX. Private parties have very limited rights to detain you against your will, and can be subject to legal action if they harass you.\n\nX. If someone tries to confiscate your camera and/or film, you don’t have to give it to them. If they take it by force or threaten you, they can be liable for things like theft and coercion.

{"body": "**Part IV: First Contact**\n\n\"Captain, there's nothing I can do. I'm pretty sure they can't see or hear us, so that brings the possible senses down to smell, taste, and touch. I have no idea how to create smells and tastes, and even if I did, I would have no idea what I would be saying to them. And as for touch: I don't think these things even realize how big we are. They've only ever touched our feet and legs; nothing higher. Maybe they think we're just moving sticks!\"\n\n\"Well they're clearly expecting us to do something,\" the Captain said unhelpfully.\n\nI turned back to the crab. It hadn't moved since its little performance. I didn't want to touch the crab itself, for fear of frightening it. Murray was right: a camouflaged animal meant an animal with predators. I knelt down in front of him and tapped the hard ground in front of him with two fingers, the same way that it had done. Hopefully that was just a greeting. The only way to know was to wait for the mob to swarm over me, in which case I would know that I was wrong. \n\nInstead, the crowd parted and the communicating crab skittered away toward the base of the cone. He stopped, maybe 50 yards away, and turned back to where we stood. The Captain starting following him, and Murray and I uncertainly followed. We hadn't explored this far up, yet; I began to get worried that we wouldn't find be able to find out way back to our ship. \n\nThe terrain began to grow bumpy and ridged. The bulges where we had found groups of crabs clustered began to grow larger and more common.   We began to see strange formations, including some that were clearly unnatural, with gleaming metal and moving parts. Although we could only speculate as to what they were for, we assumed that they must had something to do with flying the ship. Their technology seemed to be an odd mix of biological components, structures grown into a pre-planned shape, and clearly artificial materials. \n\nWe noticed specialized types of crab, too. The ones we had previously encountered were the most common, and seemed to be doing routine maintenance, repairs, and tending the growths of mold or fungus that they ate and used for light. But we caught glimpses of others; some that ran incredibly quickly, but were about half the size of the normal crabs. Some that moved very slowly on 6 stout legs, carrying rocks and other items on their flattened backs. \n\nFinally, our crab leader stopped in front of a giant bulge, about three stories high. The walls here seemed about twice as thick as the others. Inside, we saw the usual phosphorescent bacteria, but also large clumps of what must have been eggs on the walls. They were perfectly clear, with dark shapes floating inside. The light from the bacteria shone through them, illuminating the eggs eerily. From across the chamber, we saw a shape moving slowly down a wall. As our eyes adjusted, we saw yet another species of crab, different from the others. It was the largest by far (about the size of a human), and had no shells. It left a trail of eggs on its slow path, using its pincers to find the perfect niche in the porous walls in which to secure the eggs. \n\nIt seemed to sense our arrival as the maintenance crabs that had escorted us here scuttled away. It shuffled over, moving slowly and deliberately. \n\n\"Must be some sort of hive society\" Murray whispered into the mic. \"This is clearly the queen, and the fact that they brought us to her indicates some kind of leadership position as well. Fascinating that they would have a similar social structure to our own hive-like cultures, like ants and bees!\" \n\nShe (I guess we were referring to it as a \"she\", although that might not be the least bit accurate) came to a halt in front of us and tapped the ground as our previous escort had done. I tapped the ground in front of her, which seemed to set off a frenzy of activity; she flailed around, arms waving and pincers tapping. \n\n\"Shit, shit, shit!\" I yelled. \"What do I do? I have no idea what she needs!\"\n\nBut, before Captain or Murray could respond, a deep voice emanated from the Queen:\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352763369", "subreddit": "FutureWhatIf", "score": 129, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't tell this to people but I have a friend who created a lie about me which comes back to me every now and then. It started off as a joke that I am an amazing pianist (I know, it sounds like penis, giggle and continue). Anyway he just started saying this among friends as a troll, then people asked me to play and I would just sort of brush them off. He then proceeded to continue to tell people when I wasn't there that I was in fact an amazing pianist but I was very shy about my skill and wouldn't play for just anyone. He would add details about me having near perfect pitch and general music ability and this slowly spread to other people randomly coming up in conversation. However he always told people I was very shy about it and people couldn't ask me to play, I would only ever play when I wanted to and then perform some sort of solo symphony. He told people he only knew this because one evening he heard a beautiful rendition of some famous song, he actually knows music so can bullshit through his teeth about it. \n\nAnyway, I didn't realize that it had spread around at all because nowone would ask me about it. Until, one fateful eve, me and my SO are having dinner and she starts talking about keeping secrets from each other. I start to freak out, have no idea what she's talking about and she starts saying things like its ok, you can tell me or show me, I would love more than anything to hear you. I still have no idea what she's talking about until she looks over at the piano in her house sort of hinting me to go. I told her I couldn't play anything but she persistently attempted to get me over to the piano. \n\nEventually, still not believing me she asked me to come sit with her while she plays, trying to get me to play with her. Well I can't play anything on piano at all so just sat listening to her for a while before she started to get angry at me.\n\n\"Why won't you just do this for me!\" She basically started abusing me for not being able to play and it escalated pretty quickly. I just freaked out trying to explain and yelled \"what do you want me to do? What do you need?\"\n\n\"What do I want?\" She replied \"what do I need?\"\n\n\"Well... I guess I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this point I realized that my girlfriend was actually an 8 foot tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \n\n\"God damn you Loch Ness monster!\" I yelled, then proceeded to subdue the beast with my perfect rendition of Bach ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352798143", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I believe in what I can best determine to be true. \n\nThere's a fundamental level of uncertainty (we could all be brains in jars/the Matrix, or under the spell of Harry Potter/gods or just all insane). \n\nThere's also many explanations I believe, I could be wrong about, because I'm not educated enough and have biological biases. There's also stuff I know exists based on reasonable standards of evidence, but don't fully comprehend. There's other stuff which is plausible based on existing knowledge, but we don't *know* has happened, like sapient aliens and a movie where Mark Wahlberg doesn't have a thick Boston accent.\n\nThen there's the stuff which is severely implausible, like the Loch Ness Monster and Sandman. Then there's the stuff which contradicts the basic natural laws we understand, and corresponds directly to human superstition and fiction, and is often inherently impossible by definition, like gods and an eternal 'soul' corresponding to consciousness.\n\n&gt;\"The External World\" is a everything past our senses.\n\nNearly everything's past our senses. Our senses are flawed, but we can examine what we know and try and determine what else is out there, and find ways in which the indirectly observable impacts the observable. Nearly all existence is past our senses, but everything real impacts reality, and so is potentially observable. I suspect humanities scope is limited in understanding, so that's a great reason not to pretend made-up claims can substitute for discovered truth.\n\n&gt;Faith meaning assuming something to be true despite the known possibility of it being untrue.\n\nYeah, *No*.\n\nAll beliefs and even 'facts' can be untrue. That's why science treats nothing as unimpeachable. Faith is that which is believed with **no regard** for it being actually true. That's why it disregards evidence, and instead assumes a conclusion. It assumes truth, instead of testing for it.\n\nI know lots of religious people, including myself previously, assumed there was such proof at some point, which means that their faith is just incorrect belief. But when challenged by reason and skepticism, all religions boil down to faith by definition.

{"body": "1) I pointed out the failure rate and the similarity of reaction to show that the Nessie picture argument was flawed and unconvincing. That was the *only* point I was trying to make. I was in no way trying to make some naturalistic fallacy there.\n\n2) A genetic fallacy would be if I *concluded* that the study was *wrong* because if its source. I suspect the study is biased because of its source. There are two discrete things here: (1) it is not a peer review article. A peer reviewed article is more convincing to me. (2) Wholly seperate from this is the article's support, the Catholic church. This is a biased source. It doesn't mean it is necessarily wrong, just that it's biased. When MSNBC says that Obama is going to save the world, it's a biased source and I rightly doubt their claim. Same thing here.\n\n&gt;No, I would say the biological life of the twin that splits off begins at the point of splitting. \n\nThen that means there is another possible place at which life can begin (i.e., that splitting; one becoming two means there is a new \"start\"), and the statement that life can *only* begin at fertilization is disproven. Therefore, this article is incorrect in its claims. Which was my point in saying this; the argument put forth in this article has a fatal flaw.\n\n&gt; I'm not sure how much instruction is given by the womb or anything else that \"tells\" an embryo what do do next in the stage of development.\n\nNo one is sure how much, but it is known that there is a significant amount, and that the imput is necessary. \n\nFirst, if the signaling is removed but growth is somehow maintained (e.g., pulling the embryo from the womb and culturing it), the growth is abnormal and incomplete. Most features don't form, and those that do don't form correctly. Throughout development it is told to continue at certain checkpoints. Not all the checkpoints are known, and the signals are not all known. But the fact they exist is known; if they are interfered with a miscarriage results. So there is a \"no, no-go\" kind of thing going on, a gross control of the process.  \n\nSecond, there is fine control. Different parts of the blastocyst are fated early on, but (1) part of this fating is determined by implantation (interaction with the uterine wall) and (2) there are checkpoints along the way where the embryo waits for signaling to continue in its process.

The European dragon is closest to a European pagan demon, although since it has been conflated with Smaug. Zahhak of Zoroastrian mythology was a demonization of Babylonian entities, and is a corrupt human more than he is dragon in any other sense. The Leviathan is not a dragon any more than it is a whale, and it is a wholly different metaphorical animal than either; I've heard Rahab called a dragon but he really is a run-of-the-mill demonization. The Asian dragons are different again altogether, and they are the oldest of the traditional dragons - and they are lordly, intelligent, brutal cthonic deities.\n\nThe Indians don't have dragons at all. They have the nagas, who are Asura, but to give the naga any one physical form is a mistake. Being powerful deities, they can take on many forms, and are described as being *like* snakes in several ways but only *sometimes* do they have snake parts. The Asura are also not noble like Asian dragons, nor are the evil like Western dragons, they are of their own morality.\n\nDon't conflate 'dragons' because English happens to use the same word for them. To say all Western cultures have a preoccuputation with *snakes* would be correct - Python, the one in the Garden of Eden, the one who bit Cleopatra, the cobra as it comes into Western consciousness with the British, dragons, Jormungandr, the Loch Ness monster, basilisks, cocatrice, etc. It is possible that much of that is inherited from a single source, the Persians, but it's hard to say how much. But the idea of enormous snakes flying and having limbs is relatively new to Western culture, and it really begins with Smaug.

I'm quite toasted myself so I go into the makeshift tent I have, commandeering whatever I could find from the car. \n\nAll night the one girl whom my friend was interested in kept calling out to other guys, flirting, etc. He's an emotional guy to begin with. Coupled with his supremely drunken state, he decides to say fuck it and walk home. We'll we were a few kilometres from the closest town. I'm too drunk to care. I figured he'd come back anyways, it was starting to rain. \n\nIt starts to rain harder. He doesn't show. We don't want to stick around and get soaked and it isn't too late. So the two sisters and I take off. We look for my buddy but we can't find him. I later found out he walked to the closest town then paid for a very expensive cab right back into the city. \n\nMyself and the two sisters go back to her parents place in the city. The one more promiscuous girl invites me to watch TV. Her sister goes to bed. I lay down on one couch, she lays down on the other. I'm drunk. I'm tired. I'm wet. I don't care. Sex is the furthest thing from my mind. She decides she's going to go to bed. She asks if I want to sleep in her room. \n\n\"Sure.\" \n\nI figure it'd be nice to have someone to hold onto before I pass out. I'm an adult. I enjoy cuddling. I had no intention of anything sexual. \n\nI go brush my teeth, or rather rinse out the taste of alcohol with water and stumble into her bedroom. She laughs as I enter. \n\n\n\"Okay you can sleep with me, but the rule is no pants.\" \n\n\"Fine. I guess.\" \n\nSo I take off my pants and dive into the bed. She crawls in beside me and I roll over into the corner to sleep. She wants to talk. So I let her, occasionally grunting to agree and moaning to disagree. Whatever. \n\nI can't quite remember how it came up, but we started making out. Go figure. I'm kind of excited. I assume we're going to have sex. I let myself get turned on. Fully torqued, if you will, I proceed to grab her hand from my back and direct her towards my dick. \n\nShe stops, turns and looks at me. All of a sudden she's not the sister I went home with. All of a sudden she's the god damn lochness monster. She stares back at me and says, \"Before we do that I'm gonna need about tree fitty.\" \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352845630", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Backtrack 3 years ago (Me being 23 and it being the 2nd anniversary of our breakup.) I was working late at my office (1 story building) trying to get some reports done when I happen to look up out of my window past my computer screen and see a dark clothes figure just standing there looking at me.. I rub my eyes and blink a few times just to make sure I'm seeing clearly and when I look up again the figure is gone. I'm the only one left in the office and I decide it's time to lock and go home, the boss will have to wait and extra hour in the morning for his report.\nI gather my stuff and walk up to the front door which is glass, and I see the figure flash past the door again. This time I know its real and I start to shit myself in fear (Not literally) and shake. I step outside having no light available because my phone went flat from redditting all day (hence late report) so it was pitch black. As I was putting the key in the lock to lock the door I feel a hand on my shoulder as I turn around as there is nothing there.. This scares me more and I fumble the lock and actually snap my key off in the lock trying to get it out. My car is about 150 metres away up some stairs and around the block. On my very-fast-walking trip to my car this happens 3 more times, tap on the shoulder, turn, no-one there. Finally I get to my car and jump and and lock the doors. I start it up and look out my side window and there he is. My ex from 2 years ago. I turn away as I see a brick in his hand and it's coming toward my window. Glass smashes everywhere and I pretty much scream at the top of lungs \"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME YOU MONSTER?!?!\" He stopped, pulled off his black face mask, and said calmly- \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352886067", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok. I have been waiting to post this a long time.\n\nI have been single almost all of my life, there was a brief period where I had this amazing girlfriend, it ended badly (really badly) and bla bla bla havent dated since then. Now mind you, I'm not handsome but neither am I ugly. I am average. My best friend had recently gotten a girlfriend, she's really hot, nice and everything like that and they have been going out for about 1 year now. I almost love her like I love my friend.\n\nShe started talking about her friend who's been single a long time too and wants to go on a date ME because apparently she has heard so much about me. I give my friend a look that asks \"Is it worth it?\" to which he nods. I agree and yippie, it's a double date.\n\nThe night in question arrives, I'm rather excited, I know nothing about this girl except for that she's fairly intelligent and friend with my friends girlfriend, which should mean that she's a great girl.\nI'm waiting for everyone else where we were supposed to meet up. Suddenly, it's like I can feel the ground beneath me shaking. Approaching me is my friend, his girlfriend and a god damned humpback whale that has grown legs. Now mind you, I do not mind when someone has a bit of extra weight, I too am not in perfect shape. But generally I do not find you physically attractive if you are shorter than me &amp; weigh more than me.\n\nBut whatever, single for a long time, they said she was fairly intelligent and that she's a great person so I can at least give it a shot.\n\nMother. Fucking. No. She was the kind of girl that laughs at everything I said all the time. Touched my hand and said \"hehehehe you so funny\" alternatively she said \"Hehehehe, I don't get it\". \n\nShe ate like a beast, no manners what so ever and she was despicable towards the waiting staff and when the time came to pay she payed her share which was double to what I was paying, so I guess that was alright.\n\nWhen we finished, we went for a walk and after a time my friends girlfriend (who I no longer love like I love him, she's a witch and should be burned) said \"Ok, that was nice. Me and Anon are going home now, you kids have so fun *WINK*\" So now I was stuck with this girl all by myself, nothing to talk about and she's doing everything in her power to touch me at all times even though I made it clear that I wanted nothing of the kind. (I actually said \"Could you please stop doing that?\")\nAfter a time I said to her \"Listen, I do not think this went all that well. I have things to do tomorrow, so I'm just going to leave now\" and she started wailing and giving me her story about how \"no guy ever stays around\", so I tried to comfort her but was still intent on leaving so I ask her \"Is there anything I can do to help before I leave?\". She stopped sobbing for one second, looked at me and said with a quivering voice \"Actually... I might need...\" \"Need what?\" \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nWell it was about this time I noticed that this girl was an 8 stories tall crustacean from the palaeozoic era and I said \"God damn it Loch Ness Monster, I'm not giving you no god damned tree fiddy get your own money!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352902510", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 140, "controversiality": 0}

And as much as I would like to think that she's out there somewhere, still kickin' somehow, I just know that it's highly unlikely.\n\nI see the idea of theism as a chance. There's a chance there's a god and there's a chance there isn't. I've never personally seen anything that would make me immediately jump to the idea of a god, so the chances of having a god are low in my book. I'm not going to call myself an atheist, however, because my views aren't static. If a man tomorrow turned water into wine before my very eyes and proclaimed himself god, I'd be somewhat inclined to believe him. Even a 51-49 chance that there's a god would seal that deal for me.\n\nAs for your own death, indecision, and fear, I think it's fair to look at this world of logic in a logical fashion. Thousands of years ago, people used gods to explain the unexplainable, like the Reed (not Red, as numerous mistranlations) Sea parting for Moses. In reality, we have been able to say that there was a low tide around that point in history. There are similar explanations to things like the plagues and other stories which are heavily explainable. Entertaining the idea of a supernatural power in such a natural universe which has not known supernatural interference is as silly to my mind as entertaining the idea of the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot.\n\n3) I think that morals are just an instinctive thing in our society. All humans - all animals - are ruled by desire to survive, for the most part, and to carry on genetic DNA (care for children/descendants). Because human society has advanced, we now collectively choose rules that are better for society. As numerous movies and TV shows show, the collapse of society would likely lead to death. It's like collective insurance. So we don't kill people because we have order and society. It's wrong because the life or death of other people, in general, doesn't affect our survival or reproduction. If your life is being threatened (or the life of your children/grandchildren), cards are generally off the table.\n\nAs much as people like to pretend that morals are given by religion, it's simply untrue. When society began evolving, people didn't have as great a need to steal, in general. As society began evolving, religions and \"official\" moral codes were developed that said not to steal. At that point, it was almost unnecessary. A lack of stealing versus religious morals is correlated, but it's not cause/effect.\n\nThere are messier moral issues, like the right to life or abortion. When it comes to these, people tend to look to their beliefs. For instance, if I believe that life begins at conception, then no matter what religion I am, I'm likely to be against abortion. If I believe life begins at birth, then I'll likely allow for a choice for the mother regardless of religion. The difference is that some people are told from their religions that life does begin at conception or birth. The religion forces the belief, and the belief leads to your position on it morally.\n\n4) I'm not sure what you mean by grounding. If you mean \"what's the point,\" then I see it like this...\n\nLife is the best thing you or anyone else will ever have. You can look at the universe and say life is short, but at the same time, it's the longest thing you'll ever do. What did my ancestors dating all the way back to the dawn of civilization live for if there are no gods (including the JudeoChristian god)? Well, one generation was responsible for fire, another for the wheel. More recently, there was the steam engine, the cotton gin, electricity, skyscrapers.\n\nWe all advance our society, whether you are the teacher educating the future innovators, whether you're a plumber or electrician who helps ensure the standard of life for future innovators, whether you're a government official who should help people innovate, or whether you're a police officer, firefighter, doctor, etc. Everyone serves a function in society that propels the next Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. They make innovations that not only make life easier on the day-to-day, but advance science and technology.\n\nWe can now send a man to the moon. I'm going to repeat that because it's just so amazing. *We can now send a man to the **moon***. We create these things and make society better for our kids. Whether or not there is a higher purpose, everyone has an innate desire to protect and ensure the survival and comfort of our children. So we do that by making the world harder, better, faster, stronger...or well, two of those things.\n\nA thousand years ago, people were essentially slaves to high lords who controlled everything. In turn, those lords were controlled by kings who were controlled by the pope. That's only one area of the world, of course, but that was the \"pinnacle of civilization\" a thousand years ago. Now there are talks of a moon colony, and we have enough weapons to destroy any world a thousand times over. We could destroy every planet in our solar system and still have nukes left over.\n\nWhat will our great-great^10 grandchildren have because of us in the 31st Century? Will they have abandoned Earth for a new, better planet? Will they finally come up with a way to stop losing the remote? What's in store for the future? What is our legacy. *That*'s what it's all about.\n\n5) Self-reliance. I'm not sure what that is. I don't frequent that sub often. Just based on the name and how it relates to atheism, I would say that since we have no gods, we make for ourselves. We won't pray away our disease, but seek treatment. When faced with a problem, we follow known, scientific solutions instead of banking on a supernatural deity helping us.\n\n6) I didn't have a bad experience with religion. My grandparents and mother are all religious (Jewish), but they're not so religious that they don't believe in gay marriage or evolution, etc. I wasn't forced to go to weekly services until about 5th grade (because my asshole father tried to get me to become Christian, so they decided to fight fire with fire), so I wasn't indoctrinated early on. I would say that I'm just too logical a thinker to place odds on something without any evidence.\n\nI said earlier that if there was a 51-49 chance that a deity existed, I'd consider it. Hell, if there was even a small chance, I'd consider it. I don't see a chance. The only evidence people have are either incredibly personal things/feelings which likely stem from not knowing anything else in many cases. If I grew up with the fundamental, unquestionable truth of a god, then the idea of a god would just \"feel right,\" which is the main evidence anyone has barring explainable \"miracles.\"\n\nWow, this was long-winded, but I hope you take the time to read it.\n\n**TL;DR: Religion can cause a proclivity towards a certain moral code, but it doesn't mean that it causes morals. There is no afterlife; we do what we do for our kids and our legacy; there is no evidence to support gods.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352935792", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am not sure who you redditors talk to that work at WalMart, but you seem to have the opinion that many of us are paid minimum wage and we are treated poorly. As Zlipus stated, it is a case by case situation. Our town has about 30,000 people-the main jobs here WERE fishing and lumber. That does not exist any longer-not as people knew it anyway. In this town you have choices: work at WalMart, work at a horrid call center, work at the community college (which lays off more than hires), or work in caregiving. That is it. Our store is considered a million dollar store because we are constantly busy. In my department alone I have to order per month 13,000.00 of product and it sells. One either shops at WalMart for groceries or Safeway. You want better clothes, for example? Drive to the nearest big city which is 1 1/2 hours away or order online. Since this is a small town we are treated probably a bit better by management. My bosses know I keep my head down and my ass up and I work, so if I ask or suggest-they listen. When it comes to raises, they are based on performance-.40, .50, or .60 per hour. I am a .50 per hour person. I really don't think the .60 exists. It's like Nessie or big foot. People say they've seen it but you don't believe it. \nI have never been the type of person to expect things to be handed to me. I earn it. Perhaps your acquaintances that complain about wages at WalMart actually need to start earning their wages. \nI actually prefer not having customers in the store who are only going to complain about WalMart or state they hate the store. Do us both a favor and do not come in. Since working at WalMart, I've made enough money per year that when my son went to uni that whatever scholarships didn't pay for, I actually could do it. I've been taking classes for years because well, there is nothing to do in this town and I can actually afford it. I have a nice car, I have a nice home, I am not in debt. I can honestly say I didn't have that before working at WalMart. \nI resent the people who are trying to get a union in these stores.

{"body": "I replaced my work keyboard with a CMStorm 10key-less.  It's so freaking loud and drives everyone crazy when I type.  \n\nIn fact, it's known that certain mammals can be driven clinically insane if they hear the same repeated noise constantly over a long period of time.  Long ago, there was an study conducted in late 1872 where the not-so-famous Patrick McSorely would tap a small metal rod on a wooden table every evening in a pub of a small town.  Unbeknownst to the patrons at the time, the poor test-subjects became more and more agitated with the repeated sound.  The first few weeks, the occasional person would comment, \"What is that sound?\"  A few weeks later, the common crowd-noise of the busy pub would start lowering, as more and more people would cease talking while trying to pinpoint the sound.  This period of time was short-lived, as these people would then try to ignore the tapping, and instead, talk louder to try and drown it out.\n\nAfter almost 6 months of nightly tapping, Patrick noted that the bar patron's conversations had changed from once happy run-of-the-mill conversations, to more depressed and even violent topics, such as suicide and war.  With voices raised, and even an increase in altercations, the once peaceful pub had started to gain notoriety as the \"shady\" part of town.  Of course, some people had stopped going to the pub altogether, but with no other source of entertainment to unwind from their already stressful lives, people would shut themselves into their homes immediately after work, and on increasing occasions, end their lives.\n\nEven at their workplaces, a depressed citizens of the once quiet town would leap into the water of the nearby lake.  Work production that was once nearly double of that of neighboring towns was now so slowed, that several of the larger businesses simply shut down.  The few mom and pop stores that existed noted a decreasing sale trend during this period, with many simply closing, or abandoned.\n\nAs the town's population dwindled, Patrick decided to stop his experiment.  One evening, he stood on top of the bar counter, and proclaimed that it was him who had started the annoying tapping sound for a psychological experiment, and admitted that due to the increasingly disturbing results, he was henceforth stopping his experiment that night.  After a rather lengthy pause, a sudden resurgence of anger welled up in the crowd; not only were they riled up from discovering that their lives were a part of one man's \"test,\" but the results from the tapping itself had already rewired their brains so that they became a more aggressive, almost animalistic temperment.\n\nSeeing that he had now became the focus of the predator's gaze, Patrick quickly hopped down from the counter, and started for the door.  The bartender quickly grabbed Patrick's arm, and told him that he needed to pay for his drink before he left.  Patrick, more concerned for his life than his settled tab at this point in time, quickly exclaimed, \"You'll not be getting your tree fiddy tonight!\"  It was at this moment where the culmination of all of Patrick's research came crashing together in his head; the entire populous was actually a 500 ft tall creature from the paleolithic era.\n\n**tl;dr:** My keyboard is loud.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353097207", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in love with my now wife of 7 years me and her father didn't exactly get along very well.\n\nHe was Mormon.  I was Atheist.  He was Pro life.  I was pro choice.  He liked Battlefield.  I liked Call of Duty.  (OK, not that last one)  and etc.\n\nBut anyways,  me and his daughter had been together for 3 years when I finally decided that I wanted to marry her.  I knew that her father might reject me, but I had to try anyways.  Besides, I wasn't asking if I could marry his daughter, I was going to do that anyways, I was asking if he wanted to be a part of our family.\n\nI came over to his house unannounced and awkwardly brought it up after a short conversation about something, I don't remember what.  Of course, I was rejected.  After that I was sent out of his house and asked to never go near his daughter again because he didn't like me.\n\nI was more heartbroken than I thought I'd be.  I expected his answer, but didn't fully realize how much it would affect me.\n\nA few days went by with me mourning, I'd already bought a ring and was going to propose and then tell her what her father thought of me proposing.  I was worried she'd get upset and decide that her father was more important than me so I was extremely nervous beforehand.  \n\nI planned to take her on a date skiing and then propose to her at the top of the ski lift, where there was a beautiful view of the valley we lived in.  \n\nI went to her house to pick her up, praying that her father wasn't home at the moment.  I walked up to the door, knocked, and unfortunately... her father opened the door.\n\n\"Umm, hi, sir.  Is (name) here?  We were going to go on a date.\"\n\nHe sternly looked at me, his facial expression didn't change for a few seconds (which felt like several minutes...).  Then he said, \"Yeah, she's here.  I need to talk to you though.\"\n\nGreat.  What's he going to say?\n\nI'm invited into their house and saw his daughter sitting on a chair putting make up on.  She looked at me, smiled, and I told her to wait out in the car for a moment because her father wanted to talk to me.  \n\nHer facial expression went from smiling and happy to, \"Oh, shit.  What happened?\"\n\nShe agreed and went outside to my car.\n\nWhen her father saw she was in the car, he looked at me and said, \"I've been thinking about what you asked me awhile back.  About.. marrying her.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  I really love your daughter and I'd like to marry her.\"\n\nI was surprised because I expected him to be angry about me arriving at his house. But he seemed... sad, instead.\n\nHe looked at me and replied, \"I know you do.  I'm sorry I turned you down.  I know we may not get along at all, but you're still a pretty good guy.  You have my permission to ask my daughter to marry you.\"\n\nWow.  I was relieved.  I was not expecting this at all when he invited me in.  \"Umm, thanks sir!  You don't know how happy I am to hear that.. I'm going to go on that date with her now. Thanks again!\" I said, then I started to walk out the door.\n\nAs I was about to open the door he said, \"Wait, stop.\"  I was nervous... I thought he had changed his mind, I turned around and looked at him.  He said, \"I need one more thing...\"\n\n\"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\n\"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that my girlfriend's father was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had gotten me again!  \"Goddamnit monster I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I screamed.\n\nSo there's my story.  I'm happy that I could end my story with a happy ending instead of some of the stories here... haha.  \n\nI haven't really seen him since.\n\nTL;DR: Rejected by father, then he changes his mind.\n\nEdit:  To the people who gave me Reddit Gold, I love all of you.\n\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1353202248", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1814, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay buckle up, it's story time.\n\nSo I dated this girl named Nessie when I was a freshman in college, and she was like really incredibly gorgeous, but a total bitch. I didn't care at the time because hey, she was pretty (and also I never got a whole lot of action in high school). But don't think I didn't KNOW she was a bitch. One time she threw a fit on the phone with her mom because her mom had bought her a first class flight home for Thanksgiving and she didn't want to go. But anyway she was gorgeous.\n\nWe dated for about four months and then she broke up with me (yeah I'm kind of weaksauce), but I wasn't too broken up about it. After that I didn't really see her at all for the next couple years or so. None of my friends liked her anyway, so there was no reason to keep in touch. I would sometimes see her around campus but never talked to her during those couple years.\n\nAnyway, so my senior year of college, me and a couple friends go out to the midnight premiere of The Dark Knight. You guys remember that literally everyone in the world was seeing that movie that night. So we get there four hours early to get a place in line, and as luck would have it, my incredibly gorgeous and bitchy ex is also there with a group of friends! And we end up in line right behind their group.\n\nAs soon as I notice her standing there in her group a few feet in front of me, I'm like \"hey Nessie, what's up?\" Y'know, just for shits or whatever, thought I could hold an empty conversation with her, and also I was genuinely curious about her life since we hadn't talked in a couple years and I'm a nice guy.\n\nShe's like \"Hey you!! OH MY GOSH it's so good to see you! It's been FOREVER!\"\n\nAt this point, I have the weirdest feeling in my brain, but no way, it can't really be true. I feel like..... she doesn't remember my NAME?? No way.\n\nSo we talk for a couple minutes, just random stuff, I throw in a couple jokes about how we used to date or whatever, and the whole time she's being incredibly friendly and NOT USING MY NAME.\n\nI'm not offended at this point, but like, incredibly amused and I still can't believe this is happening. I mean, we dated for FOUR MONTHS. She slept in my bed five nights a week! She Skyped with my little sister and stuff! AND NOW SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER MY NAME.\n\nFive minutes into the conversation the fact has become exceedingly obvious to me, and at this point I know I could find a way to drop my name into the conversation to tip her off and pretend I didn't notice how much of a total bitch she is, but instead I think to myself: We're gonna be in this line for the next four hours, and I'm not going to let her stop talking to me. I'm going to talk to her for FOUR HOURS like my life depends on it and I'm not going to tell her my name.\n\nWell, let me tell you, it was just about the four most awkward hours of her life, as you can imagine. And then her group ended up right in front of us in the theater, and I know she feels the presence of her nameless ex right behind her for the whole movie. There's no way she could have enjoyed it.\n\nAfter the movie, we end up making small talk as our groups head out to the parking lot, and when I give her a side hug to say goodbye, she finally fesses up. So she says \"hey dude, I have to admit something to you. Can I ask you for something really awkward?\"\n\nI said, \"Sure Nessie, what do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that my bitchy ex-girlfriend was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Goddamnit monster I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I screamed.\n\nSo there's my story. I just can't believe that anyone could be so seflish and self-absorbed that that could possibly happen.\n\nI'm happily married now to a different girl, coincidentally also named Nessie.\n\nTL;DR: Dated a girl for four months, a couple years later she couldn't remember my name", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353212326", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 64, "controversiality": 0}

Turns out, while the parents were getting tours of the white house, the kids were getting to have their very own discussions with President Bill Clinton. When I got to meet him, he talked for a while about when he was a kid and I asked him if he ever thought he would grow up to be the President. \n\nHe said \"No, but I always wanted to be president like any other kid.\"\n\nWhen he asked me what I liked, I, of course, started talking about dinosaurs. Surprising enough to me at the time, he knew an awful lot about them too. He even taught me a few things. \n\nAfter our conversation, we shook hands and he told me to study hard and always stay interested in the things that I loved. As I turned to leave, he said, \"I need one more thing from you before you go.\"\n\nI said, \"Yes, sir. Anything.\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time I realized that Bill Clinton wasn't Bill Clinton at all, but about 80 feet tall and from the Paleozoic era. That goddamned monster had done it again! I said,  \"Goddammit, monster I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" Then I stormed out to find my parents.\n\nAnyway, that's how I met Bill Clinton when I was seven.\n\n**TLDR:** Met Bill Clinton when I was seven on Independence Day.

As a result we began to try and speed things up, we'd head out at lunch to get a coffee, away from the centre (the camp allowed the people in their last year there a bit more freedom).\nEventually the inevitable happened and we kissed, i think it was possibly the best kiss i'd ever shared with someone, because we connected on so many levels. The inevitable teenage cliches began to tumble out of my mouth, and soon it was becoming a regular thing. 1 day we snuck out at night as had become a routine, but this time we both wanted to go further...\n\nAs we lay there looking up at the ceiling she began to cry, i asked her what was wrong, and sure enough she was upset, as i was, about the end of the summer scheme approaching.

{"body": "Alright. I got this: \n\nEver since I can remember, I have hated the sound of brushes on rock. That is stuff like someone sweeping their driveway with a broom, or a street cleaner with those rotating brushes. I hate it like other people hate nails on chalkboards. It gets under my skin, makes my teeth hurt, makes me want to punch whoever is making the noise.\n\nI remember one time, when I was about four or five years old, in preschool, one of the teachers or monitors or whatever you call the adults in charge at a preschool, began sweeping leaves with a broom. Sweeping leaves off of the cobblestone path underneath the one big tree, near the shed in which they kept the tricycles.\n\nI wanted to go and get a tricycle, but with the teacher sweeping and making that maddening noise, I was incapable of coming near, let alone entering the shed, selecting a tricycle, extricating it from the shed, and riding away. My ears would start bleeding first.\n\nSo, what could a four year old do? I formulated a plan, as best as my infantile brain could plan. So, not very well.  \nThe plan boiled down to running at the adult, seizing the broom from her, and hiding it somewhere inaccessible to an adult. The spot I chose to stash the broom was in a small manhole type drain thingy. The lid was light enough for me to lift up, and the drain was deep enough, I believed, that the broom would be lost for good.\n\nHaving come up with this brilliant plot to eliminate the broom and the awful sweepy noise for good, I sprang into action.  I nonchalantly walked up to the teacher, casually-like despite the fact that I wanted nothing more than to stuff my fingers in my ears and run away from the noise.  \nOnce close enough, I stomped on the teacher's foot with all my four-year-old might. This was largely ineffective, but did cause the teacher to toss down the broom, preparing to reprimand me after she checked to see if I hadn't damaged her foot.\n\nI snatched up the broom from where she had thrown it and sprinted away as fast as my little legs could carry me. The teacher was taken by surprise and didn't begin to give chase until I had already left her view, having run around the corner of the school building.  \nThe drain was in sight now. I charged ahead with even greater abandon and reached the drain a few seconds after the teacher came around the corner. I pulled the drain cover off and tried to stuff the broom in. To my dismay, it didn't fit. I was trying to stuff it in brush-end first. I figured this out in a second or so, flipped the broom around and stuffed it in. The brush end wedged in the hole.\n\nI prepared to stomp the broom down, but before I did so, the teacher yelled at me to \"Stop!\"  \nI was four, of course I couldn't help but obey. Still, I was four, so I screamed back \"I hate the brush noise!\"\n\nThe teacher looked infuriated. In all my four years on Earth, I had never seen anyone look so irritated at a four year old. She calmed herself and told me, in a very dangerous tone, \"Pull the broom out of the drain. Then, hand it to me.\" I obeyed.  \n\"Good. Now, one more thing. I need you to-\" she cut off, coughing. I haven't mentioned it, but this teacher was a terrible smoker and this was probably the first time she'd exerted herself physically in years.  \n\"Need what?\" says I, annoyed that she interrupted herself.  \n\"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was at this point that I noticed my pre-school teacher was actually a five-hundred foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. The Lochness Monster had got me again!\n\nIn the end, though, I got in a bit of trouble with the preschool. My parents were also rather upset when I arrived home. I was upset too, having never gotten to ride that on any of the tricycles. Oh well. I probably deserved it for brattiness.\n\n**TLD;DR** I really, really hate the sound of broom on rock and have since I was young.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353275129", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Here is my story of my experience with a girl like this.\n\nWe were young (17), free and cruelly enrolled in a summer camp where parents send their children to rot for long periods of time. Our eyes met as she slowly pasted me into a kirby flavoured paste in super smash brother melee. Soon we began to hang out, discussing the other kids at the camp, and nothing brings people together like the malicious discussion of other's habits. But as we slowly became closer i realised that eventually the summer camp would finish and we'd be separated, most likely never seeing each other again. As a result we began to try and speed things up, we'd head out at lunch to get a coffee, away from the centre (the camp allowed the people in their last year there a bit more freedom). Eventually the inevitable happened and we kissed, i think it was possibly the best kiss i'd ever shared with someone, because we connected on so many levels. The inevitable teenage cliches began to tumble out of my mouth, and soon it was becoming a regular thing. 1 day we snuck out at night as had become a routine, but this time we both wanted to go further...\nAs we lay there looking up at the ceiling she began to cry, i asked her what was wrong, and sure enough she was upset, as i was, about the end of the summer scheme approaching. She turned to me then and said to me \"lobinius, promise me, promise me that... she choked at this point before sobbing for a while and continuing i just need one thing from you\". I of course promised her i'd do anything for her (as you do for a girl who you really believe is the first you've ever loved), to which she answered \"i need about tree fiddy\". It was at this time that i realised the girl was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That goddamn Loch Ness monster had got me again! \"Dammit Monstah i aint given you no tree fiddy!\" i yelled as it crashed out of the building and swam away.\nI never saw her again, never got pasted at super smash brothers by her again, and never really allowed myself to love again.\n\ntl;dr : met a girl at camp, fell in love and never saw her again... all because of one flaw.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353275463", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Before I begin, I'd like to stress that this should not be viewed as a sad story--the fact that I am no longer with my ex is a fact that makes me very glad every day. She had a lot of unresolved issues that I couldn't see 5 years ago, and I do truly think that I dodged a bullet with this one.\n\nAnyway, I had been dating my ex for about 3 years when I finally decided that it was time for me to ask her to marry me. First I told my mother and father, and then I drove from where we were living (also my home town) in Eastern Washington to Portland, Oregon (roughly 6 hours by car) to ask her father for his blessing. He consented (we'd always gotten along very well and I still talk to him from time to time, however weird that is), and I drove back to put my plans in motion. \n\nMy family's annual reunion was coming up in about a week, and she was of course going to come as my date (she was basically family at this point anyway), so I figured this was the perfect time to pop the question. I went out and bought a ring, made sure my parents knew what was about to go down, etc. It all looked pretty good.\n\nThe day rolled around, and of course I was nervous as hell. We'd never really talked about the subject of marriage before--at least, not in the terms of the two of us specifically--but we were in love and of course she was bound to say yes, right?\n\nI've always loved my family reunions. I have 4 brothers (all older, married, and with kids) and my mother and father have a number of siblings as well, so it's always a great big party with a bunch of people I love and don't get to see very often (we're a close-knit family, but not in a weird way). I was having a great time, as usual, everyone talking loudly and happily in my family's house, and was almost able to forget about my crippling nerves and sweaty palms until my father raised his voice and announced that I had something very important to say.\n\nI actually didn't get the chance to say anything at all--the moment I dropped to one knee I knew something was not about to go in my favor. My ex's face turned a sort of half-grimace as I produced a ring, and almost immediately she says to me \"Ooh, IThinkYouMeanThan, I can't,\" and just sort of turns to walk towards the door. \n\nIf there is a more profound silence than what I experienced in those few seconds, I challenge you to show it to me. I mean you could hear a mosquito shit on the moon as my ex walked out the door. My whole family had these looks of \"oh shit, did that seriously just happen?\" going on, and my dad just put his hand on my shoulder as I stared into space. \n\nAs she reached the door, though, she turned around and said \"Wait.\" and walked back into the group of my stunned family members. \"I need to ask you something.\"\n\n\"Y-yeah?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time that I realized my Ex was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. \"God damnit, Sharon, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I kicked that good-for-nothing right out of my house without another word, and I'm now happily in a relationship with the girl of my dreams.

He then asks for money, which is also rediculous, and on top of that - he needs about three dollars and fifty cents. Thats what is so funny to me. Is that he asks for an 'about' figure - but states an exact amount. About $3.50. But in classic form, you add another joke on that and say \"about tree fiddy.\" I told him that is my favorite part of the joke. \n\n\n\nNot realizing it, the waitress was next to me listening to my argument. She said she had heard this joke on south park a while ago. Is that true? I told her I did not care, and that it was still funny. I asked her for another Sam Adams but she was visibly upset. She said, 'You dont like south park?' I replied, 'no, who cares.. can I get another sam adams?' She said, \"well I cant get you another beer until you pay off your existing ticket then, because im going to hand your table off to Jenelle.\" At this point, she is getting loud and a small scene has been created. She looks like those rich blonde girls that always get her way. Anyway, I was pretty confused, so I start to laugh it off..\"why, because I dont like south park?\" I guess shes a big fan, whatever. She storms off and my friend and I are confused, but ok, be gone with her. \n\n\n\n\n\nI had the last, and (in my opinion) most important reason why your stories are so funny. I turn around to make sure the coast is clear but I catch Jenelle with a short fellow in a bring pink shirt walking over. When he gets closer, I notice that the guy in the pink shirt is the manager. He tells me that we need to pay and leave the area. I argue that I am not leaving, because I didnt do anything wrong. He says that customers were complaining that we were being too loud and we were creating a scene (we were not). Anyways, I told him we would leave, but that we were not going to pay for anything. It took him a second, but he agreed. He asked if I was going to apologize to our waitress for making her cry. I said no, and he led me to the front door. As we were waking away he said, \"I know she is a difficult girl sometimes, but she has a good heart. Just do me this service.\" I said no, im not apologizing to that BITCH. \"Well, fine, but I do need something from you.\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that the manager was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! I turned on the restaurants intercom and shouted \"Damnit Monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" \n\nAnd since that day we never spoke about eating at Buffalo Wild Wings again.\n\n\n**TLDR: Argued with my friend over why your joke is so funny at Buffalo Wild Wings and made some bitch cry**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353301745", "subreddit": "InternetAMA", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

Edward getting shocked continuously trying to train Bella's shield.  Jacob obsessing over taking care of Renesemee and getting all motherly.  Jacob stripping down in front of Bella's dad and creeping him out.  The leader of the Volturi being shown his future and the big slap in the face after the battle.  Dakota Fanning running for her life after being the bitch the entire saga.  Bella beating the giant Cullen in arm wrestling.  All of these are intentional, I assure you, and they are just the ones I can think of right now.

A few minutes later a girl came running out with a guy in hot pursuit shouting \"why won't you marry me?\" Soon there was an elderly dude in the room shouting at the guy to leave, the guy responded by screaming that he'd save the girl and no one could stop him, pulling a pistol at the same time. Obviously things got pretty serious then. The woman behind the counter called 911 and the old man began shouting at the guy to put the gun away. Then the first shot was fired, either he was a terrible shot or the stress was getting to him, it went well wide and drilled into a wall. At this point the old man lunged at the guy with the gun, managing to grab a hold of it. However an elderly man vs some manical 25 year old was not going to end well, and the elderly man was soon knocked out unconscious after having his head smashes off the counter (don't worry he's fine by the end). I'd been standing there the whole time in complete shock, unable to move. The police soon arrived and surrounded the building (I guess they knew the route there pretty well). We now basically had a hostage situation, with the lunatic gesturing with his gun widely at all of us while we lay on the floor. I'm not entirely sure what happened next but there was a loud bang and suddenly the girl who the man had been trying to \"save\" was wrestling with him, then there was a gunshot... He'd shot her, unable to believe what he'd done he shot himself too...\nI'm not going to lie, I was in tears by now as I scrambled over to the girl to see if she was alright. She'd been shot close to the hip and there was a lot of blood, but she was still conscious. I asked if there was anything I could do. At this point she replied \"I need... I need... I need about tree fiddy\". It was at this point I realised the girl was about 7 stories high and a crustacean from the paleozoic era! That god damned Loch Ness monster had got me again! \"I ain't given you tree fiddy you goddamn monstah\" I shouted after her as she swam off.

My father always seemed like a nerd (he's a Physicist) who didn't care for sports. Don't get me wrong, he'd always support me and come to my games, but never seemed interested in coaching or watching much on TV. \n\nI was about 12 years-old, playing pop-warner football (full-contact American football) as the running back (guy who runs with the ball on a handoff) and I broke off a 3/4 field touchdown run. Halfway through the run I stiff-armed a kid playing defense who was probably 30 lbs. lighter than me and at least a half a foot shorter, and he just looked dejected. \n\nGracious victory is not something you're born with, and at 12 I certainly didn't have it mastered. I was taunting the kid, my teammates were taunting the other team (we were up 35-0) and we were just acting like assholes all around. Our coach didn't stop us, he was just as much of an asshole as all the kids on my team and I were. Then I saw my dad walk up to him and say something about our behavior and sportsmanship to him. The coach got red in the face and started yelling at my dad. My dad, calm as ever, continued explaining that we were learning how to be adults, and he wasn't providing a good example. \n\nThe coach dropped his clipboard and shoved my dad, two-hands-in-the-chest, and got in his face and started yelling more, turning beet red and kinda breaking a sweat. Everyone was watching and I started going over to stop it from getting any worse when I heard my dad say \"if you touch me again you're going to regret it.\" \n\nThe coach poked him in the chest, and the best I can describe it is that my dad was a ninja. I didn't even see him grab the coach's hand, but before anyone knew what was happening my dad had the coach on the ground with his hand 270° from resting position behind his back.

We were beginning to leave, but quickly i said I had to go to the washroom, I told my friends I would only be one minute and be back in a sec.\n\nSo off I went, in to the mens washroom, into a stall and sat down. Found a number on the side with a note that said \"Call this number for the best bj of your life.\" I didn't think much of it at first, but then decided write down the number and call it as a joke.\n\nI eventually came back outside to all my friends waiting for me, they were having a quick smoke. I told them about the number and they agreed it would be pretty funny if i called it. So I did.\n\nThe phone began to ring forever until finally a young girl had picked up the line on the other end. With an loud and confused tone she said, \"Hello?\". I stuttered at first and said back, \"H-hi.\"\n\n\"Who is this?\" She quickly responded.\n\nRight away I came out with why I called her, \" I found your number in a stall that said call you for the best bj ever.\"\n\nOur conversation was short and sweet and she told me about how it was probably her ex that posted it there to get revenge on her, and explained how she cheated on him for another guy. I understood her situation and didn't think much of it.\n\nAfter I said my goodbye she asked me if I could come over.\n\nMy first reaction was \"what..\", but after a long silence she said \"well did you still want the bj?\". I agreed, got in my car and headed over to her place. She gave me directions and everything.\n\nOnce I arrived I rang her door bell, it wasn't the nicest house I'd ever seen, but still you could tell the owners worked hard to keep it clean. As soon as she opened the door she was all over me. At first I noticed that she had been crying as her mascare was all smeared. This chick was beautiful! Had all the curves in the right places.

My dad saw the whole thing and walks right up to the guy and whispers in his ear something and the guy goes white as a ghost and hands my dad the hot chocolate without a word. I think he was even trembling. My dad comes over and I was so super proud and excited but he said he needed something from me before I could have the hot chocolate, so I asked what he needed and he leaned down right next to my ear and whispers, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed he was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the palezoic era.

I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my fucking mind.\n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this really sexy chick dancing by herself. Being drunk as shit, I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance sexy? Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up grinding hard/making out a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes.\n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated. We were making out a lot on my bed, and we took off each others shirts and things were really escalating. I had her panties off, and I was starting to think me losing my virginity was a sure thing. I could tell she was really into it. She said \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". I figured she meant me going down on her, and me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\".

They were so close that i could smell the alcohol on their breath. \"He's only one guy ...and he'd have no choice if we did it for him,\" shouted another.\n\nBy this time my own wife should have been protecting me, but she was drunk also, and could see no problem. \"sorry ladies, i want to go to bed\". \"ah..not even one little ole strip for us?!  You know you want to!\" \n\n\"Afraid not ladies\" but all their hands were pawing me all over, \"i'm not sure if i like his answer girls...what do you think?\" \"we could always strip him ourselves!\" said one, \"what a good idea!\" remarked the wife...(huh some wife) they were really being serious.\n\nI could see where this was going if i wasn't careful, with serious trouble once my wife was sober.  So I broke away from their clutches, and was off. I obviously couldn't run home, because they'd be there waiting for me, but i could hear this massive horde giggling as they chased me down the street. \n\nIt was like a horny mob coming after me. \"Let's get his clothes off him!\" one shouted. \"He can't get far,\" that was my wife shouting. It was utter unexpected madness. they broke up into about 3 uneven groups trying to corner me, and in doing this they forced me into an old grassy playground. \n\nMy wife was now leading them on, and they actually managed to tackle me down to the ground (I was trying to not be too rough fending them off.

My boxers were yanked off in one quick movement. One of them yelled, \"Whoa..look at this girls...looks like he's enjoyed it too girls\". i was totally naked and still being held down from all angles as they tickled and played about with me. \n\n\"what now ladies?\" one shouted. i'm surprised no one heard them, they were laughing so loud. \"i know\" said the wife, as she sat down beside my genitalia area and began to play with me in front of all of them. \n\nThen her best friend came up to me with a huge grin.  I said, \"What do you want?!\"\n\nShe caressed my wife's cheek and said, \"Tree-Fiddy.\"\n\nIt was then that I realized my wife's best friend was a giant 500' tall crustacean succubus from the Paleolithic Era.\n\nI said, \"Goddammit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree-fiddy.\"\n\nMy wife, her friends, and that Loch Ness Monster relented, and I gathered my things and made my way home.\n\nMost embarrassing story I have.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353468685", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There are some who are in darkness\n\nAnd the others are in light\n\nAnd we see the ones in brightness\n\nThose in darkness drop from sight.\n\n- Brecht, Threepenny opera\n\n\nTrouble is, the topics you ask for are missing because either they're not in any journal, or they currently appear to us to be well known crackpotism.  Look for them on the junkheap.  (And no, things like phrenology and N-rays probably won't make a comeback, but Cold Fusion shows signs of holding some surprises.)\n\nAsk instead what niche fields will your graduate adviser warn you away from, as being career-death?  And what small portion of those are being judged unfairly?\n\nOne indirect tactic is to examine contemporary legitimate fields which once had been 'disappeared,' but later proved genuine.  The study of ball lightning, once it was dismissed as obviously retinal afterimages, and studying it was as bad as going after bigfoot and space aliens.  But things changed in the last thirty years, and today it has a literature and even yearly conferences.  Another was the study of water: workers in the field complained that it was the butt of jokes and suffered severe funding problems, but things turned around and today it's a fairly active and can be discussed openly at triple-A-S conferences without shame.  :)  Hypnosis was a big one; debunked by Ben Franklin and the Royal Society, and requiring more than a century for the taint to fade.\n\nDr. Thomas Gold describes several similar examples in his talk about [the resistance to new ideas](http://amasci.com/freenrg/newidea1.html) including the study of an active amplifer in mammal ears, and biogenesis of petroleum.  Both were still heretical at the time, but both have made the leap to become something close to normal science.\n\nWhat then today is, unknown to all, perfectly genuine, yet is completely unfundable heresy? The modern equivalent of Ball Lightning or the chemistry of pure water?  Hard to say.  We almost always notice these cases in hindsight.  After all, if we were certain they were genuine right now, then they'd already be part of normal science.\n\n\"[Journal of Scientific Exploration](http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/)\" publishes all sorts of peer-reviewed yet taboo and heretical stuff which would otherwise never see the light of day.  Some are semi-legit, such as insect antennae possibly detecting molecules across a gap of tens of nanometers ...all the way to classic psychokinesis studies, or the reincarnation demographics in India.\n\nPS  If you're considering a career choice, then seriously, beware of any such topic.  Without having already had a solid successful career and hopefully tenure, these things really are simple career-death.  But if your credibility is unquestionable, and you control some major resources, then that's the time to get involved with \"heresy.\"  Example: you've spent decades as the dean of a physical science department at a major university and are now nearing retirement.  Time to come out of the closet and get involved with Loch Ness Monster studies; perhaps be the first to put a plesiosaur in a zoo.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353488072", "subreddit": "AskScienceDiscussion", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

They're all built really solid and complex and they almost always branch off of and remain faithful to old continuity. Probably the best feature of his stories is that they can stand alone, but when combined with the knowledge of older cannon, they begin to carry so much more impact and depth. By working in such a restricted way, it involves more planning and thought, I can see this in his writing and I get a lot of enjoyment out of deciphering his work. His recent batman epic is just amazing, he's been weaving it for the past 6 years, and it is probably the best continuity done for Batman in my mind because it feels so complete.

{"body": "Actually i was trolling, what i said is actually a common mistake. The reason it's called Black Friday goes all the way back to the first Thanksgiving. After the very first day of giving thanks, back in Plymouth, the next day started out pretty normal. People got up in the morning, checked to see if there was any work to be done, and so forth. At about midday people started hearing this noise that was a mixture of both high pitched whistling and a gasp of air. It was faint at first, but it just kept getting louder and louder. Some of the men decided to go check it out. They started to follow the noise until the reached the coast, then headed left. The would up in a cove; one which nobody had visited before. They looked around and noticed a big ominous cave looming over the water, the light casting a shadow on the entrance that looked like a hood, with spikes coming out of he top. The men clambered down and looked around, but couldn't even see their hands fully outstretched. One of the men lit a torch and they proceeded into the bowels of the cavern. It was a bit colder inside, and the men could feel the wind rushing all about them, as if in a panicked frenzy. After about 10 minutes of wandering about the men noticed that two men where missing. They called out into the darkness but the only reply was their echoes, wind slapping them in the face, and that whistling gasping noise barely audible. The men trudged on, and before long they came upon a massive lake, with a hole at the top of the cavern letting in a beam of light focused on the center. In the center was this small little island, and peculiarly there was a small rowboat at the edge of the lake. It was only big enough to fit two men, the others would have to stay on the shore. The man with the torch, and a man with a primitive gun got in the boat, and slowly waded across the cold, dark, and motionless water. When the men got to the island, something was already there, but the men couldn't see exactly what it was since it was shrouded in shadows. One of the men spoke out \"he...hello. Is...Is someone out there?\" A deep voice that sounded like it was coming from all around them filled the air \"who dares enter my home?\". The men taken aback that this shadow creature could talk stood silent for a couple of seconds before the voice spoke again. \"Who enters my abode and for what reason?\" The man who remained silent up until this point spoke out \"we are men from the settlement over on Plymouth. We heard a noise and traveled to find out what is was?\" Suddenly the men on the lake shore started screaming and almost as soon as it started they stopped. The two men, ghastly afraid now, asked what was going on. The figure whispered menacingly \"Oh that? That was just my friends having a little snack. Now i think my appetite has returned, and something new to this place smells rather delicious.\". Then men begged and pleaded \"oh please don't eat us we will do anything anything at all. We have families that are waiting for us, they will surely die if we are not there. Please spare us.\" The figure spoke out again \"There is only one thing you can do to escape, and only one of you can leave.\". The man with the torch sputtered out \"I'll do anything you want. Just tell me what you need!\". The shadow creature replied \"I need about tree fiddy.\". It was at this point that the creature came forward and the men realized that it was an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. The men shouted out in unison \"Dammit you Lochness monster we ain't giving you no tree fiddy\" and they swam across the shore and escaped the cave, the only two men left. The men called it the Black Cave and no one ever went back. \n\nTL/DR: A group of men back in the day explore the Black Cave to find the source of an odd noise.

The situation has not changed; you have one clip of ammo- seven bullets, left. Your barrel has been fouled by months of rust. You know that the gun will soon be useless, but you lack the materials to clean it.\n\nThat's why you're making your way to the bus. Sometimes, you can find the odd cache of ammo, first aid or food. You salvaged this bus yesterday, but it was near dark at the time. You had to hurry back to your shelter. It's not wise to be out on the streets after dark.\n\nYou pry open the doors of the bus, and that is when you notice it; in the corner, there is a metal crate. Cautiously, you make your way towards it. Opening it with bated breath, you notice a dull glimmer of a new weapon, along with a whole tone of ammo.\n\nYou can't believe you're luck! The prospect of a safe way to defend yourself, with a mini-gun no less, almost takes your mind of the hunger and thirst! Hunger. Thirst. Those two needs kept coming back to you. You need to find food and water. The urge wasn't overwhelming: you had a can of spam and some recycled bodily fluids for breakfast. A can a day, you promised yourself. And so, you trudge out of the bus, balancing precariously with the mini-gun in your hands.\n\nSilent. Too silent, even for a desolate city like this. Sensing danger, your scrawny figure summons the strength to bring the mini-gun into a firing position. You have no idea how to even use the thing. But come on, a gun is a gun.

And then a yell.\n\nWhat can only be described as a cry of anguish and hatred rattles you and your ears. And that's when you see it. 10 foot tall, green and mean, standing at the end of the road. A humanoid figure roars yet again, and what can only be described as a monstrosity of nature charges at you. He is not alone. Others join him, gathering speed as they race towards you. Knuckles dragging along the ground, split open. These things want to rip you apart and eat you alive.\n\nWith a grim and grave look on your face, you aim the mini-gun and it begins to whirr.\n\nThat's when your realize you need about tree-fiddy bullets to defend yourself from the loch ness monsters.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353618511", "subreddit": "Fallout", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was eight years old, I lived in rural upstate New York (the Catskills region) in a town of about ~150. We had a few acres of land, and going up the hill in the back was this old, old graveyard. You couldn't see it really because it was at the top of a hill - but you could see the tops of some of the larger gravestones.\n\nMy bedroom window faced in that direction, and I was always terrified of that window. I would tape my curtains over the edges to make sure there was no possible way you could see in. My parents were hyper religious so they believed in demons/possessions and all that - and so did I. Honestly, I lived in fear for a good year of my life. They also told me that demons couldn't attack me as long as I had enough faith. I didn't know if I had enough faith, which meant I was doubtful, and if I was doubtful, my faith wasn't strong enough. Pretty terrible, huh?\n\nWell, once night after a church service, we go home and I head to bed. I hear a scratching noise on the window and my adrenaline starts pumping. I silently inch my way off the bed, turn the night light off, then move painfully slowly towards the window. I VERY carefully pulled back the edge of the curtain - and the window was *open*. There was nothing there, so I pushed the curtain back into its place and jumped back into bed. A minute later I heard the scratching again, and rustling of the curtains.\n\nI heard heavy footsteps... and I was trembling, praying to Jesus, trying to repent for any sins I could think of, when I heard a deep, gravelly voice. \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353624106", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, I was at summer camp when I was about to turn 16. I had just come out to my parents, and they decided it was best i spend some time away from them. This made sense considering they were both deep southern Church of Christ crazies. They send me away to camp, and when I was there, I ended up making quite a few good friends that I talked to for a few years after. I met a nice girl, and we hit it off pretty well. She happened to be a preachers daughter. She was mildly crazy. Or maybe just starved for attention. I think she just wanted someone to love her more than they loved god, which was impossible in her family. We enjoyed our time there, and almost had sex. I use the term almost, because she started getting more and more crazy, or so it seemed to me. She starts talking about how she wants to start a fire in one of the cabins. I do my very best to talk her out of it. She assumes I must have been threatening her to stop, so she ended up not talking to me for about two days. Then she warmed up again. She wasn't the same though. It was like she was planning something. So on the last day of camp, I go to say goodbye to her, as our parents were picking us up, and she was behind a cabin, attempting to start a fire. I ran over to stop her and she wouldn't. I told her I would give anything to make her stop. She just she needed about tree fiddy. Now it was about this time that I realized that she was actually an eight story tall creature from the Paleolithic era. That goddamned Loch Ness monster had tricked me again.

He's marrying a girl who stalked him and destroyed her life for a total stranger. He discovered her unhealthy obsession with him purely by chance, as he stumbled upon her reddit profile - her secret one. Through this he found that she had been stalking him for months before that reddit meetup.\n\nAlarmed by what he found, EvaSylvestre finds her old friends and family to talk with them, and what he discovered was not reassuring. He discovered she had spent three years in a mental institution when she was 19. She was committed because she had set fire to the crotch of a cheating boyfriend.\n\nHe rushed home and checks the time. He has an hour before he's missed at the wedding. He sets to quickly packing up his stuff and changing account information.

EvaSylvestre turns only to get caught by a right jab to the jaw, throwing him to the floor. No wimp himself, he throws a kick at his bride's face as he scrambles back to his feet. He throws the laptop at her to buy time as he rushes for the door, only to be decked by a left jab reinforced with a roll of dimes. She shouts \"WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME?!?\" as she kicks him in the face. EvaSylvestre decides enough is enough, and throws her into the cabinets as he sprints for the door. His sprint is stopped short, however, by a .44 bullet to the back of the foot. His bride, blood and dirt coloring her once pristine dress, points the revolver at his face and prepares to pull the trigger one more time. As a final message, she says \"We could've been togeth-\"\n\nHer sentence is cut short by a man with a baseball bat standing behind her. Standing over her now-collapsed form is a tallish blonde man with a cast over his crotch. EvaSylvestre says \"Oh my god thank you. You saved my life!\" in a shaken voice. \"Is there any way I can repay you?\"\nThe man replies, \"Well actually, yes. I could use about tree-fiddy\".\n\nHis face contorts in rage as he realized the man was a 750 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era, EvaSylvestre shouts; \"Goddamn Loch Ness Monsta! I ain't givin' you no tree-fiddy!\" and crawls out the door, into his car, and drives off.\n\nEvaSylvestra moved to Vancouver and now operates under a different reddit account, after learning a lesson the hard way: don't stick your dick in crazy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353829345", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Great question. However, this is presupposing the D&amp;D Monster Manual in a few cases, I think - not exactly a problem, but possibly a limitation. That said, here would be my picks, in no particular order:\n\n* **Elementals** - Incarnations of the natural and supernatural world, earth, air, water, fire, forest, magic. If those six categories are permitted and scaling power-levels can also be allowed, you can do a lot with those right there. It's possible to almost endlessly reskin for flavor and keep the mechanics, I would expect. Both the wizard's salamander familiar and the living ball of flame are fire elementals with the same stats, just different descriptions. It would also let you do things like include djinn and call them greater fire elementals, with certain wish-granting mythology surrounding them. Could also be \"spirits\" instead, for a more Shinto/Princess Mononoke-esque atmosphere. Possible caveat: Is this cheating? It feels like cheating.\n\n* **Minotaurs** - I feel that minotaurs are underused, but can be as intelligent or animalistic as needed. Satyrs or centaurs could also fill this role of \"close to man, close to nature,\" but I like minotaurs.\n\n* **[Silurians](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Silurian)** - Here's where we venture out of the realm of D&amp;D monsters strictly. An equally sentient race with an equally valid claim to the land as humans. Race relations aren't antagonistic out of hand, but they aren't exactly cordial either. Diplomacy may vary from place to place, in fact, depending more on how the local people have negotiated the use of space and resources with their neighbors; sometimes they may be able to live together, other times there may be all-out war.\n\n* **Illithids** - Jumping squarely back into WotC intellectual property, I do enjoy a good mind flayer. There is a lot to be said about a truly alien race, though nothing that is comprehensible to anyone with a Mythos score of less than, say, 30%. They make a great end villain too, I feel.\n\n* **Fae** - This is assuming that \"elementals\" above doesn't cover everything. Similar to the elementals above, though, we make certain gradations, from pesky pixies to naughty pucks to regal elves. I'm thinking of a real Seelie/Unseelie Court vibe here.\n\n* **Doppelganger/Changelings** - This might veer a bit close to the Fae above, and could even be subsumed into the category, if needed. Doppelgangers in the classic D&amp;D sense, fairly solitary shapeshifters that can infiltrate anything. Might instead just call them shapechangers generally, and use [Kitsune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune), though. Particularly malevolent shapeshifters with decidedly evil orientation could be a sort of bogeyman/Slenderman urban legend and old wive's tale.\n\n* **Golems** - Mindless animated constructs should always have a place as guardians of something. If this were a steampunk setting, I'd be equally adamant about clockwork automatons.\n\n* **Undead** - The other mindless henchmen. Something that doesn't occur organically, but arises from ill-treatment of the dead. Corporeal zombie-like undead for preference, but with the option of ghosts and poltergeists in uncommon circumstances.\n\n* **Kobolds** - My fodder race of choice. Typically scattered and tribal in their societies, but they have the capacity to organize in some rudimentary way and can pose enough of a threat to small villages. Throw enough kobolds at a problem, and you get a huge mess one way or another. I personally like the kobold-dragon connection too, and thus...\n\n* **Dragons** - Because they're classic, but also because, again like many of my other submissions, they can be reskinned as needed. Let's not limit ourselves to the giant lizards that breathe something dangerous and sit on treasure troves, but also branch out to include Chinese dragons.

I never realized that she literally drained the energy out of a room, while Im typically an active &amp; social person. I started to understand why she had so few friends or why her other friends had ditched her so often, there were many times where she would plan events or parties with her friends and I was the only one who showed up. I started to see how while she seemed like a good person she was doing good things for really shitty reasons. I kept thinking to myself about if I was such a good boyfriend &amp; she was happy in the relationship then why not talk to me and at least attempt to fix our problem rather just out right breaking up out of nowhere. I realized that while all her friends liked me and called me more than they called her that all my friends really only liked her because she was with me. Then it hit me.\n\nShe was right, we werent a good match for each other, hell, we weren't even a good match for acquaintances. With that knowledge I lost any care I had about her and told her I didn't want to be friends.

{"body": "God, how out of it are you?  Dont you know anything about the 19th dimension?\n\nOn the 21st of next month, the New World Orinati will usher in FEMA and UN death camps and exterminate 59.32% of the world's population.  At the same time, Nibiru (which wound up only being a few hundred meters wide) crashes into the earth and destroys Australia (probably for the best, fucking kangaroos and their bitchass pouches).  At that point, drones begin circling the earth and bomb anyone who speaks out against the government.  In 2014 rumors start sweeping the darknet that there is an underground movement called 'Ashes of the Past' that is going to overthrow the one world government.  On April 17th 2015, AotP puts hijacks all state owned news channels and broadcasts a 10 second long video.  In the clip, a silhouette of a tall, frail man says \" a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor.\" The video is quickly turned off and the station goes to static for the next 2 weeks.  The video makes its way to the darknet and a group of hackers creates a computer virus that, when opened, sends the video to everyone on the host computer's email contact book.  Since the video is so widely distributed (a study conducted by the Department of Freenet that was published on Dec. 3 2015 states that 94% of world computers are infected), the NWO decides that they can not round up those who have infected computer.  Rather they remotely wipe all hard drives.  Though its too late, everyone has seen it.\n\nFlash forward a few months.\n\nIt is the opening ceremonies.  The world elites are in the stands cheering on their pagan, occult rituals that are being conducted by the lowly peons of the world.  Dick Cheney is leading the chants when suddenly the darkness of the night flashes bright.  As both slaves and masters rub their eyes, the figure from the video appears before the crowd in the center of the arena.  Silence overcomes everyone when the figure, in a booming voice, speaks.\n\n\"For too long the evils of this world have prevailed.  Man and woman, brother and sister, have been persecuted by the hands of tyranny and injustice.  The beings that call themselves supreme harbor the worst that this universe has to offer and we have come, not with fire or sword, but with peace and love to topple you.\"\n\nMurmurs sweep the arena.  The slaves at the center fall to one knee and call out \"Through peace and love!\"\n\n\"SILENCE\"\n\nDick Cheney walks forward to the dark figure.  \n\n\"Who has the courage to stand up to us?  Reveal yourself so you may die a martyr for a cause that never stood a chance.  Enjoy your 15 seconds of fame, and your last 15 seconds of life.\"\n\nThe figure looks up and the onlookers gasp when they see the figure is giving off an ominous glow.\n\n\"I need not speak my name, for you all already know it.  I need not share my story, for my lessons have been shared for millennia.   I need not evoke my wrath, for that will come in time.  Make with me what you will, but thou must remember, when one feels most in control, fate was surely forgotten.\"\n\nThe face that spoke these words, this shadowy mysterious figure, this beacon of hope in a dark, cruel world raised his hands and began\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come.  Thy will be done i-\"\n\nCheney plunged his sword through Jesus's chest and the son of god fell to the ground, dead.  The elites broke out into cheer as Cheney wiped the blood off of the blade.  \n\n\"To all of you,\" Cheney cried to the slaves \"remember that you stand no chance against us.  Not even the son of god could put a stop to our plan.  I dare you to try us, for you will end up just like him\" spoke Cheney as he pointed at the limp corpse of Jesus with his weapon.\n\nFlash forward to the closing ceremonies. \n\nJesus's body lay in the center of the arena, lacking in color as the early signs of decay began to set in.  The slaves took their places around the floor, some weeping in tears as their only hope in life, their one shot at redemption, lay dead in the center of the stage.  \n\nCheney, accompanied by Mitt Romney and Donald Rumsfeld, slithered out to the center of the stage.  \n\n\"Tonight your hopes to overthrow us, your divine rightful masters, shall end in the glory of the flame.  Remember this moment as the time that we ended the legacy of the son of god.  The true love of your supreme being, shall be erased from the annals of history.\"\n\nRumsfeld bent down and lit the corpse of Jesus on fire with his torch.  The slaves burst into tears and wept.  Mothers held the bodies of their children who did not understand what was playing out.  Men stood quietly, and a single somber tear ran down their cheek.  When the body turned to ashes, the three turned to return to their seats when a rumble rocked the arena.  Mortified they turned to the ashes.  A single beam of light emitted from the ash.  Suddenly, a second beam appeared.  Then a third, and a fourth.  In few seconds time, rays of light engulfed the entire stadium.  With the roar of a thousand elephants, a giant, collosal phoenix emerged from the ash.  Body as red as blood, the bird rose to the rafters and with each flap of its wing, the lights across the stadium turned on.  With each nod of its head, each machine used in the cermenoies went off, spraying the slaves with water and smoke.  The bird flew into the sky and the night lit up like a beautiful spring morning.  Despite the lack of clouds, it suddenly began to rain.  Lightly it started, like a soft morning's drizzle, but over time it turned heavier and heavier until it was a torrential downpour.  \n\n\"Holy water!\"  Cried one of the slaves.\"Its...its...its working!\".  The slaves all looked up to the seating, and the elites were writhing in pain.  The water of god cooked at their skin, blistering whatever it came in contact with.  Writing in pain, Dick Cheney fell to the ground.  In  last moments of Cheney the Lizard King's life, the bird that was Jesus returned to the earth.  It landed next to the almost dead Cheney and whispered into his ear...\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit:  Sorry for all the spelling, grammatical, and tense errors.

I don't know  what could separate me from others on this subreddit. As far as I'm  concerned, all ~14k subscribers on this subreddit are avid Radiohead fans. \n\nHere is some information about myself regarding Radiohead\nMy top 5 Songs in order are: Packt, Kid A, Weird Fishes, Idioteque, Subterranean Homesick Alien... followed by Where I End and You Begin, which has been rising up the ranks continuously.\n\nI was privleged enough to see Radiohead at Coachella, and yearn to see them again.\n\nMy favorite album is Kid A\n\nFavorite B-side is 4 Minute Warning, and Radiohead's most underrated track is In Limbo in my opinion.\n\nSo why should you pick me? \n\nWell, I love radiohead. but so does everyone else here. Maybe I can tell you a story:\n\nSo I went to Coachella Weekend 2, and during this time after the Radiohead show I am walking around blissfully and in complete utter awe and shock. I was in the front a few feet from Thom the whole show, rocking out and having the time of my life. Well I'm sitting in the same spot when everyone clears out and I just can't really move, mainly due to physical exhaustion but I'd like to say it was just from sheer amazement. Anyways, I am about to head back when I walk by the right side of the stage (if you are facing it). For those of you that went to Coachella this is the spot where they walked out for their last encore of PARANOID ANDROIDDDD. A stage crew member catches my eye and motions for me to come towards him. Confused, I comply, and wonder what this could be all about. He tells me that someone wanted me to come backstage. At this point I am completely shocked and wondering 'Who and why would anyone want me backstage?' However, without question, I go backstage. I go backstage and have my head on a constant pivotal turn, checking out what is around me, the equipment and what not. Mesmerized by all of this, I keep on walking around the backstage area and the guy that brought me in says to sit. I sit down. I am shaking, wondering what this could be about, and if my dreams could be true. The guy returns a couple minutes later and says two members of Radiohead wanted to talk to me. ME?? Why me? Of all people in the crowd that suffered through 105 degree heat for 5 hours straight around me. WHY ME? I think that this has to be a dream. I nod my head, speechless. He then looks at me, and says \"Wait, before you meet them, I need to ask something...\"  I say \"Yes what do you need?\" He responds and says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time that I noticed this stage manager that would have led me to my ultimate dream in life of meeting Radiohead was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. So then I ran and I ran all while saying \"God damnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\"I kept on navigating through this magical backstage area, in complete shock and like what the hell is going on.\n\nAfter this magical moment ended, we parted our ways with a friendly goodbye. I floated back to my friends who asked where I was and told them this story. Their eyes turned green with envy and I will never forget that moment of my life. It was absolutely enchanting. \n\nThank you, and I can only dream that you will pick me kind sir. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354054156", "subreddit": "radiohead", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

They had to change entire characters to fit in all the time.

Marshall was originally a huge wimp afraid to ever get in a fight, and had never even hit anyone. Oh wait, change that, except for his brothers who he fought with all the time and oh yeah now he can kick anyone's ass.\n\nIf anything, there is even MORE direction now as the show comes to a close, because we have so many facts about the mother that we're just waiting to all come together. The umbrella, the wedding, everything. They didn't have that at first. Hell, they were even able to make \"Your mom is a stripper\" jokes at the beginning!\n\nSo in summation, I think your criticism is outright incorrect.

This little kid was in the back of the line and when i say little i mean young, about 7 or 8 years old, but this kid was a mammoth like none other. He probably weighed nearly 200 pounds. His mom had dropped him off by himself and he was just standing there staring me down from the back of the line like i had killed his family and he had just received his chance to kill me with his bare hands. The kid kept staring at me like 15 minutes later when his mom came back to check on him. I had talked to like 7 or 8 kids by now and this kid was almost at the front of the line. \n\nI had been feeling really uncomfortable and i was kind of afraid of this kid, like maybe he was a demon or something. I feel the sweat on the back of my neck and i realize i haven't said anything to the girl in my lap while her parents had been taking pictures of us for the last 20 seconds. I quickly asked her what she wanted for Christmas and what not then sent her on her way. \n\nI look back in the direction of stare boy and i audibly gasp. He's Gone! \"Oh gosh where is he?\" \"his mom wasn't back yet?\" \"what if something happens to him?\" i could get fired. I jolt up and then i see him he's hiding behind the little \"village of the north pole cottage\" i walk over to him and ask him what he's doing, trying to avoid making a scene, when he stands up and he throws a brick at my face. \n\nWHAT THE HECK! \n\nI'm staring at him now and i grab him by his collar and begin to beat his face against the cottage. Blood is literally everywhere. He looks me in the eyes and says \"that'll be about tree fiddy.\" I now realize this was no boy but a massive crustacean from the paleolithic era.

I was panicing that I wouldn't get to say goodbye, and that all those memories with him would be gone. Playing catch in the yard, him holding my hand that time I broke my leg...But then he started sitting and looking at me. \"tophat,\" he groaned, \"I need you to do something.\" I immeadiately moved to the bed. \"Sure dad, whatever you want.\" This only agitated him more. \"No, no, I need this, I need you...\" He broke off, and started coughing up blood. I yelled for the nurse and turned back towards him. I leaned closer, hardly daring to breath lest I covered up his faint voice.                                             \n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was at this moment I noticed that my father was a little to big for the bed, and his 500 foot paleolithic crustacean body was causing damage to the bed.                                       \n\"Goddammit you goddamm loch ness monster!\" I screamed \"I ain't giving you no goddamm tree fiddy!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354124013", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

That last part was included because she knew I was going to head for university, and already made plans for when we could see each other and so forth.\n\nI call her and we go on our last date at a local restaurant. She looked stunning but I couldn't lose focus, I wanted my freedom. We began talking and after a few drinks finally mustered up the courage to tell her I'm moving country.  Told her that we would be moving to Kenya, as my father got a job at the safari park. I sounded believable and she started crying. It started making people around us uncomfortable so I took her outside and asked her if she needed anything.\n\nShe says she needs time to absorb all of this. Over dramatic but I thought fine, I'm home free. I asked her if she needed a lift home, but she declined and said she wanted to take the bus home, and that she'll call me later. She had no money and suggested that I should pay for it, so I asked her how much it was.\n\nShe said \"I need about tree fiddy\".

I had also lost my virginity to a counselor at camp and knew how to please a man.\n\n   I used to get really wet on the schoolbus and I would touch myself under my books. It turned me on knowing that nobody knew what I was doing. We had a rule at the school that our skirts had to be a certain length so I would hike mine up so if I bent over, guys could get a nice upskirt shot of my wet panties. I would also sit with my legs spread and bend over a lot exposing my boobs sometimes slipping out a little nipple and guys thought I didnt know... I could look around the room at any given time and see them trying to hide their little boners. I was the absolute definition of a \"cock tease\"... In gym I would stick my hand in a guys shorts grab his shaft and work it softly until it got hard and then quit. Back in those days we didnt have internet either so guys had to use their imaginations when they were jerking off in their little beds... Every time I teased a guy I knew it was me he was going to think about that night, and every night after that. Pecker after pecker I would grope, tease, taunt, and harden, one time I made a guy in math class cum in his whities just by touching his tip... It was hilarious...\n\nSenior year came and I was the Head Cheerleader it must have been torture for those guys. Sometimes I would pull my underwear into my ass like a thong when doing kicks. Not knowing that one day I would let them all have it...\n\nAt the end of the year one of the team members had a huge party at his house, his parents were out of town for the weekend. The whole team was there with plenty of alcohol and a severe lack of girls. I started to feel like the only form of entertainment. Guys surrounding me, slapping my ass, groping me. I kind of hit it off with the guy throwing the party and we escaped to his parents room. He practically ripped my clothes off and threw me on the bed and we went right to it... After a little bit his friends were looking for him.. I could hear them tapping at the window and rattling the door. They pried the door open somehow and barged into the room as I was taking it from behind. It turned me on having them watch so they all piled through the doorway. One by one they started jacking off and a couple of them approached bed within arms reach. The next thing I knew I had a cock in each hand, one in my mouth and one after another pounding me from behind, but I wouldnt do anal. One of the players asked if I would do anal if he paid me... So I asked \"how much\"... He replied \"About tree fiddy\" It was about then that i noticed that this hot football player was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era\"\n\nEdit: Number of dicks for historical accuracy...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354131190", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Funny (kinda) story about vaccinations happened to my cousin. \n\nHer parents (my aunt &amp; uncle) are the odd, earthy-crunchy types who did everything at home save actually grinding their own wheat. Just walking through their house will set your brain in a weird place. Everywhere you look there seems to be a bag of spelt flour, dried fruits and nuts, or all-natural organic honey. If Burt's actual bees had a home, this would be it. I don't think they had a microwave, and all of their vehicles have either been Volvos, Subarus, or VWs. The amount of validation they give to the stereotype is almost comical. Anyway...\n\nMy cousin went to a small, private school (they are in a relatively small town in Vermont), and wanted to play field hockey. Her parents had to sign medical forms and give a vaccination record for her to be able to play on the team, and the school found out that she wasn't up do date on certain vaccinations (which ones, I have no idea). I am not even sure how long it had been since she went to the doctors. Like I said, her parents only barely believed in toothpaste (Tom's of Maine), let alone \"modern medicine.\" They were big on homeopathic medicine, and herbal remedies. Such is fine I know, but again, they are not ones to base their decisions on the science behind things.\n\nThey had probably waived the vaccinations prior, and despite being enrolled in a private school, had skirted getting them thereafter. As a result, the school, probably without much option, barred her from playing on the field hockey team, but allowed her to stay enrolled even without sufficient vaccinations. (Again, very small school, very personal in its relationship with the parents).  \n\nWell, this just wasn't enough for them. Rather than stick to their principles and just tell her not to participate, they started a tirade in the town. They kept pushing for people to sign their petitions about the, \"evil, mind and soul manipulating drugs\" they're forcing on the children! They were on about the autism, and allergic/deformity causing evils of injections. My cousin was mortified, but still a little brainwashed by her parents and going along with it, however her lack of enthusiasm for her parent's lifestyle seemed to grow with the whole ordeal. All of this lasted for way longer than it should have, and when they didn't seem to garner any support, they decided to go in for a meeting with the principle and demand he put an end to the policy.\n\nSo one afternoon (far after the field hockey season has begun, mind you), they go in for an after-school meeting with the principle. The principle had the school nurse there to back him up on health risks, and the reason they absolutely need to have people vaccinated to abide by rules and standards of the State (or board of health or whatever). The parents walk in there all ready for a battle, and my cousin is with them, and halfway through the conversation the principal says, \"Look, I'll let your daughter play for about tree fiddy.\" My aunt, uncle, and cousin all looked in shock as suddenly they realized they were in the presence of a 500 foot tall reptile from the paleolithic era, and were in awe of its dread and majesty. Suffice to say, she didn't play on the team. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354137545", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok so here is the deal mate, I have this crazy idea that I want to develop. It's called The faberglassmate. ok I know this sounds stupid but hear it first. It all started in the summer of 2003, me and my family where back in the old cabin in one of our old country farms, and we were having one hell of a time. This made everyone remember the good ol' days when things were simpler, when men where men, women where women, and cats didn't rule the internet. But we realized that, no matter what, you would never feel the same again, be it for the lack of time, the nostalgia-tinted glasses that you have but you just can't really point a finger and say \"that's what's missing\". But anyway, long story short, we where playing with the family dog when a cat started taunting him, who knows where that cat came, but it had such a majestic fur that our eyes where all over him. Have you ever seen one of those cats that look like they were in HD? I don't know how else to put this, but he was a one cute cat, but at the same time quite the joker. We decided that recording that moment for posterity would make this trip a great trip, so we where really trying to make it look all cinematographic and shit. Anyway, we captured the video with a Samsung Galaxy SIII and it looked so amazing, but at the same time it wasn't something nostalgia worthy. That's when my cousin said, \"You know what this needs? an instagram-like filter\" And that's when we knew we had a rag-to-riches idea, we started throwing new ideas, you know, oldschool tought clouds and shit. We developed quite a good plan of what to do and Since it was my cousins idea, he was in charge of everything, specially budget. So he cames one day, in a really nice suit, and he makes us his partners in this crazy new venture, but as always he was quite a cheap guy and wanted us to pay for all the bills involved in the development of this idea, I asked him how much each of us would expect to chip in and he said: That'll be about tree fiddy. Well it was about this time I noticed that my cousin was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era! No, I ain't gonna give you tree fiddy, now go away! I said.

I have to wonder if you've never actually looked at the front page or watched the Daily Show before, and are just repeating things you've heard other people say.\n\n&gt;In other words, Republicans have no good ideas at all.\n\nBy all means, point me at a few. I'd love to see them.\n\n&gt;I've never heard any criticism about Obama from here about his stance on things like school choice. Despite the Swedes doing it with great success and support from people like Cory Booker, r/politics claims that it is a plot by Republicans to educate people in Christian madrassas -- and people here actually believe it.\n\nI don't know if you're aware of this or not, but ultra-religious and right-leaning America is not secular, socialistic Sweden, and right now in Louisiana voucher schools are teaching children that the Loch Ness monster exists and disproves evolution. I am not exaggerating.\n\n&gt;I always found it ironic that those who read PoliticusUSA, AlterNet, ThinkProgress, et al can claim that another source of news is biased. These are Breitbart-level websites.\n\nLies promoted by Breitbart's website have been pretty thoroughly documented. Perhaps you'd like to furnish an equal number of lies from Thinkprogress to flesh out your unsubstantiated false equivalance here? I'm guessing not. Matter of fact I'm guessing that you will use the fact that I'm defending thinkprogress as a sufficient reason to say \"well you're too brainwashed to talk to so I don't have to back any of this up\" and run off.\n\n&gt;Liberal websites like Mother Jones rely on the fact that their young, college aged readers have never heard an actual Republican economic argument (except as described by Ed Schultz) in their lives.\n\nAgain, would you care to point to a specific misleading claim Mother Jones has made, or would you prefer to just keep pretending it's somehow equivalent to theblaze.com based on absolutely nothing beyond you saying so?\n\n&gt;Ninety five percent of the articles here are sensationalist garbage.\n\nThat's interesting, because right now two of the articles on the front page are critical of the Democrat choice for Secretary of State and her business entanglements. Another criticizes Obama's use of the NDAA. One is an article from the Guardian regarding false reporting on the Iranian nuclear crisis, is the Guardian part of the vast left wing media conspiracy too?

{"body": "Brace yourselves, this is a long one.\n  \nI played football my freshmen year of college at a rather large school (I won't mention the name for obvious reasons). At my school it was somewhat of a tradition for freshmen, especially walk-ons, like myself, to be treated like butlers for the older players. Getting fresh towels, carrying their gear to cars, getting their lunch trays, ect, nothing abusive just bitch work until you've earned your spot on the team.  Most players earned their place by just showing genuine effort at practice, making a huge play, or just being a cool ass mother fucker. And most players had gained non-bitch status after only a few weeks, but I was one of the few that hadn't. I was a kicker for Christ's sake. How the fuck was I supposed to show effort or make a big play? At practice I mainly just stretched and then dicked around for a bit. \n  \nAfter about 2 months of being on bitch status I finally got fed up and just said fuck it, I'm not doing anymore shit for anyone else, and surprisingly everyone was ok with that. Well... everyone except for our teams center, Al. He was perhaps the biggest, dumbest, sack of shit I've ever met in my life. This is the guy that everyone avoided because when he roid raged  (fucking everyone took steroids) he raged with the force of the Incredible Hulk. This mother fucker once caused $12k worth of damages to just our uniform items because he was pissed off over missing a block in game. \n  \nTrust me, you do not want to cross this guy on a bad day... which is exactly what I did.  Some how I was not informed that Al's dog was put down just before practice. Al was pretty emotionally unstable and when mixed with the steroids this guys was fucking insane. Anyways... When practice finally ends, I start walking towards my car when I hear Al grunt at me and say \"EmperorSnu, I got a question for you.\" Naturally I say fuck off and give him the finger, which I will admit was a mistake, because it was about this time that I realized that Al was was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. I said \"What'd you want monster!\" and he said, \"I need about tree fiddy\". I said, \"DAMNIT MONSTER!

{"body": "Throwaway here.\n\nI went to a medium-to-large sized high school (around 2,500 students).  Our cafeteria had six or seven lunch lines.  They all served the same food, we just needed that many lines to serve everyone in a timely fashion.  Anyway, starting freshman year, I pick a line, and I'd usually use that line for the next four years.  I figure most people probably did the same.\n\nWell, the same ladies usually worked the same registers.  So everyday I'd go through this line and I'd say hello to the same lunch lady (she was an older lady, maybe in her late 50s to early 60s).  I don't know how to describe it...but she seemed to be \"nicer\" to me than the people  ahead of me in line.  Just in how she'd smile and how just generally happy she seemed to be to see me when I got up to the front of the line.\n\nWe never really chit-chatted or saw each other outside of the cafeteria, but she was always just so sweet and positive during those ten second interactions day after day, for three and a half years.\n\nDuring my senior year, about halfway through, she wasn't working the line anymore.  Didn't see her anywhere around the cafeteria, never really thought to ask anyone about where she disappeared to.  It wasn't like we were particularly close or anything, I didn't even know her last name or really anything about her.\n\nDuring the last month of week of school, one of the lunch ladies stops me in line after I tap my lunch code in (every student had a lunch code and the lunch ladies operated with these POS monitors, made it convenient to load money on to your account so you didn't have to pay with cash every day) and she sees my name on the monitor.  She hands me an envelope and tells me it's from \"Susan\".\n\nLater, I open the envelope and it's a \"Happy Graduation\" card with a long letter from \"Susan\" inside and a $50 bill.  I wish to fucking God I still had the card, but I don't, but in short, she had been diagnosed with cancer and decided to take an early/temporary retirement to deal with it, and then she went on to wish me the best of luck, et cetera.   She never explained why she was so fond of me.\n\nSo there I was, a seventeen year old guy, but I cried like a baby in the bathroom.  I don't know why, but it really touched me.  Not even really the fact that she gave me $50, but just the fact that in a school with 2,500 students, she picked me out and after four years, she thought of me.  I don't know if she gave anyone else cards, nor would it really change the beauty of what she did if she had.  There's just something about a lunch lady who actually cares about the usually loud and obnoxious teenagers they deal with day after day.\n\nAlthough, now that I think of it, I was extremely quiet and a bit of a loner all through high school.  Maybe she saw me sitting alone reading books while I ate and it struck a chord with her, I honestly don't know.   I don't know what happened to Susan, or where she is now, but if I could find her, I'd really like to just say \"Thank you.\"\n\n(This is probably the longest post I've ever made, and I seriously considered making a tree fiddy joke at the end of it, but I didn't want to ruin the moment.)\n\nEdit: People keep asking why I made a throwaway for this.  Essentially, I don't like the idea of having something this detailed that people in real life that I've told this to would recognize, and then stalk my main account.  I don't have anything too crazy on my personal account, but I'll undoubtedly forget I posted this and may at some point post something I don't want people I know in real life to read.

I can see evidence contrary to *certain* truth claims about gods, so I can assert that those claims are false.\n\nAtheism is just the statement \"I do not believe in deities\".\n\nThis is why you make the rather bizarre statement \" I do not follow any organized religion, and teeter on atheism\". You either believe in gods or do not; if you teeter on the edge of atheism, it is because you believe in gods. If you do not believe in gods, then you are an atheist.\n\nAtheism makes no statement on spirituality, but, given that the majority of those who would call themselves atheists do so out of natural skepticism, then you would find that most atheists do also reject spiritualism, ghosts, faeries, the Loch Ness Monster, Santa Claus, Vampires etc. etc.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354268985", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}
