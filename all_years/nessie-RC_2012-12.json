{"body": "Now let me tell you a story of an unforgettable night, that i managed to forget. \n\nTo start, I'm not a tough guy; I'm fit but at a below average height of 5'6\", I'm not exactly intimidating. \n\nIt was the Summer of 2011, I was about to start my senior year of high school and things were looking good for me. I had went out to my friends house out in Queens (I live in the Bronx) for his graduation party. It was a typical affair, his friends and family all hanging out, eating and being merry. When the sun finally set i was informed of a party way out in Long Island that we would have to drive to. My friend, whose house I would be staying at, asked me if I was okay to go or just wanted to chill and play some video games. I had not slept that night and not had much of an appetite so i didn't eat, but fearing ridicule from his friends, who are all my age but much, much bigger than I am, I decided that I wanted to go.\n\nWe get there relatively quick, I'm not familiar with Long Island so I wouldn't know. We happen to be the first one's there, which made me uncomfortable because this was the house of a COUSIN of a friend of my friend, so I was a complete stranger.The host was a very typical looking tall long island tool and his friends. We were welcomed in surprisingly nicely and we all introduced ourselves. When I said my hello, the hosts immediately reacted. Imagine a short latin boy with a group of large white guys saying \"Hi, I'm Diego.\" They loved it. They had decided what they thought of me, the kid in the group. My goal for the night was clear, prove them wrong. \n\nWe enter and all take a beer and hang out for a bit and the hosts tell us to get up and take some shots. Awesome! I loved shots, i was small but i was a tank. I mean alcoholic. I was ready to get DRUNK. But i was ignored and everyone got a shot but me. I really wanted one so shyly I asked for a shot and with laughs the host gave me a shot of Johnnie Walker. I took it without hesitation and didn't even flinch, which surprised everyone because come on, its Johnnie. This was when it all began, by accession to God status.\n\nThe hosts and his friends loved it. They told me to take more shots and once again I didn't hesitate or flinch (the secret is a beer chaser, no one realized.) I had destroyed whatever image they had of me and was already one of their new favorite people. We went outside after this and started chilling drinking there. This house was 2 floors with a garage and had a pool in the back, it was gorgeous. Now we we're hanging out in our group and a couple people started showing up when all of a sudden, *SPLASH*, someone jumped into the pool. Now i don't mean from the side of the pool, they jumped off the roof the house into the 8 foot deep pool. We were all shock and thought it was awesome. It happened to be the host and his friends, who all had done it many times before. They tried to convince us to do it, but I was hesitant, as I am terrified of heights, but I wanted to do it. I have a werid adrenaline thing with heights and water, it scares me to death by I love doing it. But i decided against it and one of the kids in our group wanted to but wasn't doing to do it alone. \n\nSome time passes and they hosts are still trying to convince me to do it; after the shots they thought I was awesome and really thought I would do it. At this point I was still sober and had been nursing a beer, I didn't aim to get  drunk that fast. While I'm being coerced into jumping, more people arrive and say hi to the host. In the group of new people was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. She had bright beautiful blue eyes and dark black hair. She was like Zooey Dechannel, and shorter than me, so she fit my type perfectly. I wanted her. The host notices my reaction to her arrival and introduces us. Her name was Vanessa but she went by Nessa. While doing so he tells her that I'm going to jump into the pool and she gets visibly excited and tells me to do it. I give in instantly, you would too, trust me. While i get ready, and by get ready I mean get into my underwear because there was no reason for me to have a bathing suit with me, we flirt. We had a lot in common and she kept touching my arm and whatnot, she wanted it. I went off to climb to the roof and she winked at me. I had to do it.\n\nAfter scratching my chest on the tiles and struggling to get up the roof I finally make it. Let me tell you, 20 feet it much higher looking down than it is up. I see the pool and I see Nessa waiting for me. My balls grew 3 sizes that night and after a couple minutes of pure terror I ran off that roof and jumped cleanly into the pool. I came up from the water to deafening cheers and applause as others began joining me in the pool, including Nessa. She swims over to me and we hook up in the pool. Greatest moment of my life, but its not over yet. I whisper into her ear, \"Wanna get a room?\" and she replies \"Yeah, but i need something first.\" I was what and she looks me dead in the eyes and say \"I need about tree-fitty.\"\n\nIt was about this time i realized this \"Nessa\" wasn't no \"Nessa but was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. It was that god damn Loch Ness monster again, so i punched her right in the face out of the pool into the atlantic ocean where she belonged. And that was my most bad-ass moment.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354325704", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Long read: In August of 2009, I climbed Mt. Fuji with my family. I was 12 at the time. Well we had the whole family which included my 2 younger sisters one of which was 9 years old, which caused us to take practically all day to reach the summit. We reached the summit at about 5 pm and it was getting pretty dark. Well 2 hrs later, it was nearly pitch black and we were making horrible time back down the mountain when our flashlights went out. All 3 of the them in the same 2 minute period. Creepy, but we just thought it was a coincidence. At about this time we saw a couple of lights bobbing down the trail, and within a matter of minutes 2 young Japanese guys, probably 20-25, came down and realized we were lost and needed help and told us to follow them. We made AMAZING time down the mountain and stopped, at what turned out to be 30 yards from the main trail with lots of people somehow hidden, so they could smoke. They told us to just follow the trail and and we would be out and they gave us a flashlight. My older sister and I followed them down, and they took an immediate right onto the trail, when we turned the corner, there was no one. Literally. No one was there. The closest people were about 100 feet behind us going the other way, or 150 feet in front of us. To this day, no one in the family has any idea what happened to them. Also, the flash light has yet to have its batteries die. \n **teel;durr: Get lost climbing Japanese mountain, guys help us down, turn out to be ghosts, give us flashlight with invincible batteries.**\n\nNinja edit, wanted to turn it into nessie post but didn't want to ruin the story.

My parents had brought nutter butters and lunchables for us to snack on as we waited. They said that meteor showers made children very hungry. I believe that they said that to keep us quiet while we ate food.\n\nIt wasn't until around 2 A.M. that the meteor shower started. It was the most fantastic thing any of us had seen. The sky looked as though it was on fire. Around half an hour in one of the flames landed in our back yard.\n\nMy older brother went to see this new addition to our property. My father had yelled at him to let it be, but it was too late. From the smoke arose a strange creature. He looked so other worldly, but he spoke such proper English. \n\nMy brother finally mustered up the courage to ask him what he came to our planet for. He told him he was a interstellar traveler who came her for one thing. He only required tree fiddy.

{"body": "I'm a little late to this, but here I go.  When I was just a wee lad in elementary school, there was a lot of turmoil going on in my life.  I had a lot happen within a very short period of time.  The biggest thing was probably having to switch elementary schools in the third grade, and starting from almost complete scratch, friend's wise.  I remember going to this new and scary place before everyone else came in for school, to go around and meet the teachers who I would deal with for the upcoming school year.  This went okay; my parents went off to talk to the teachers and left me to mess around on the computer and whatnot.  There was only 1 other person who I knew going into this new school, and that was a good friend of mine from up the street.  So this was a very intimidating experience.\n\nSo comes the start of the new school year, and I'm sitting all alone in this classroom full of people, who I have no idea if they are cool, asshats, nice, outgoing, etc.  And my one friend is placed in a different class than mine, of course.  So it comes around before lunch and we were using white boards all morning, and for some reason I decided it was a great idea to draw some wonderful stick art all over the backs and, of course, an artist ALWAYS signs his work (at least in my little world).  These whiteboards, by the way, were shared between all the 3rd grade classes, because that's how shit worked.  So it comes around time for lunch, and I find my one friend from my street and we grab our lunch and go sit down together.  After a little bit, I told him about my awesome drawings on the back of the whiteboards.  This is the part I completely regret, because after telling him what I had done, he got this weird grin across his face, and said \"I'll show everyone how great your art is, but I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"  And that's when I realized that my friend of many years was really a 500 foot tall creature from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "I was always told that I wasn't allowed to watch married with children.  My mother absolutely hated the show... as an adult, I couldn't blame her, but as a kid...\n\nI was just sort of amazed by this family that was so much the opposite of my own.  My father took me out for sports days all the time and he worked very hard.  My mother loved me a great deal and never yelled or screamed.  So these people... they were such a contrast to me.  But I eventually was scared straight by the subsequent horrific events.\n\nAnyway, after awhile, I had found an excellent way to sneak the show in when nobody knew.  I found out there were re-runs in the middle of the night, at about 2am.  So I set an alarm in my bed to wake me up so I could watch it quietly.  The house was dark when I watched, and so I kept a blanket over myself and the TV, watching the usual hijinks and (I now recognize) terrible behavior when I heard a noise.  It was a scratching at the door, followed by a low moan.  So I went to the door and got my usual step stool to look out the peephole, and I heard a quick rustle, and then nothing.  So I went back to watching TV in my little tent.  Then it was there again, behind me.  I looked out and there was a small child standing there, whispering quetly.  I couldn't explain why, but I felt like I knew the child.  so I edged closer to hear what the child was whispering.

{"body": "These responses are frickin' lame. I'll tell you a story, OP.\n\nWhen I was a young boy, I took to exploring the woods behind my house (as young boys are wont to do) in search of mushrooms, interesting rocks, and all manner of juvenile adventures. With a walking stick and backpack full of sandwiches I would disappear for hours on end, causing my mother no small amount of worry, until I inevitably turned up with scratched-up knees and a green frog I'd taken a liking to. One day, on one my excursions, I delved further than was normal and came into a part of the forest where birch and stately pine gave way to a foreboding canopy of oak, with juniper and thorny bramble below. I proceeded, undaunted, until I chanced upon a rickety cabin that seemed to spring forth from the undergrowth itself. As the sky was fading to a heavy orange, I thought it prudent to orient myself and rapped thrice upon the wooden door.\n\n*knock knock knock*\n\nThe door creaked open to reveal the kindly face of an old man, with greying hair and tired eyes. He explained to me that he was in fact a wizard, and that he lived in such isolation not because it was his preference, but simply because he felt it was the wizarding thing to do, to maintain a lonely cabin in the woods. In his prime he had been a master of his dark art, turning adventurers into newts and whatnot, but age had mellowed him, he divulged, and in his infirmity he retained only one wish- to see his long lost son for a final time. The man was dying, and he knew it. His son had left him in a fit of rage some years past and the wizard begged me to help him in his quest. In a nearby cave rested an ancient mirror, with which the wizard could contact his son. As he was weak and feeble and I hale and hearty, I promised him that I would retrieve the mirror and turned to leave, but he stopped me with a withered hand on my shoulder. \"A terrible evil lurks within,\" he said \"but you must not be afraid.\" I considered turning away and heading back home, but, well, there wouldn't be a story if I had.\n\nI made my way to the cave's yawning entrance and peered inside. A foul stench hit me like a wave; it smelled as though a host of animals had crawled inside, failed to find a way out, and slowly rotted beneath the unforgiving stone. Nevertheless, against my better judgment I made my way inside. The corridor was black as pitch but with my hand against the cool limestone I soon detected a faint flickering from around a bend in the tunnel. The light grew brighter until I saw, projected clearly against the opposite wall, the outline of a horrible beast with wicked horns and ravenous teeth dripping with blood, an ominous noise cutting through the deafening silence. I steadied my breath, turned the corner only to find... a simple hand mirror inlaid with mother-of-pearl, leaning behind a jagged stalactite and reflecting a gentle shaft of sunlight beaming through a chink in the ceiling. I exhaled a palpable sigh of relief and exited the cave posthaste, blinking my eyes at the last rays of a setting sun. \n\nIt was nearly dark by the time I returned to the cabin. When I made to open the door it creaked wide of its own volition, admitting me to behold a dreadful sight. The old man lay prostrate on the floor, visibly aged in the mere hours I'd been away. His hair had turned to a snowy white, and the hollows of his eyes were sunken in to such an extent that he resembled a breathing corpse. I brandished the mirror and something flickered in his eyes, but his response was no more than a whispery rattle. I leaned in close to to catch his final words... \"I need...\" I brandished the mirror, held it up to his withered face, and spoke urgently \"here is what you asked for, what else do you need?\" With his lips to my ear I was barely able to make out his final words... \"I need... about tree fiddy.\" It was then that I realized the old man was actually a 300-foot-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

So hours upon hours went by with me just lying in bed motionless trying to sleep. I soon start hearing all of these faint noises.

When I finally got the courage to go back to my room, to my reluctance, the noises had all but gone away so I attempted to go back to sleep. Just before I was about to fall asleep I herd something fall and crash on my tile floor which immediately woke me up and startled me. I woke up to see was a dark silhouette of a man standing infront of my bed. Scared beyond belief, I half hid under my covers so only my eyes where showing. I then asked the dark silhouette in a frightened voice, \"uhhh...who are you, and... what do you want?!?!\". The dark silhouette replied with a slury of words in a deep dark voice that I will never forget, \"I need about tree fiddy\". Then suddenly my parents burst threw the door and turned the lights on and asked me what that loud crashing noise was, but by the time the lights turned on the dark silhouette had vanished never to be seen again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354530881", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

We would smile and make eye contact, and I would always blush and look away first.

I could tell she was really embarrassed so I stepped up, and in perhaps the most suave motion of my life, I bought the spaghetti special and then quietly asked her how much she was short.  She said $3.50.  I got a few dollars out to help her and then I realized...$3.50.  Tree Fiddy.  I put my money away and walked off in disgust.

He actually responded, but just started cussing me out calling a \"smart ass mother fucker\" and so on. Naturally it made my blood begin to boil because I was really trying to help the sub. But something gnawed at the back of my mind. Instead of retaliating, I decided to ask him what was wrong.\n\nIll be damned if the guy doesnt spill his life story to me. He talked about the pressures that (surprisingly) being a Mod of a major sub put on him. He went on to tell me about how his girlfriend had just dumped him and he was not taking it very well, and apologized for the rude message. He had no more friends after the nasty break up (most of them sided with the ex, unfortunately) and just sat at home, taking out his anger out on anonymous strangers on the internet.\n\nWe got to talking and found out he lived in a city about two hours from mine, and I knew what I had to do. I invited the guy to get some drinks that Friday with some close friends and help him get his mind off all of his troubles. Me and my friends piled into our car and took off for our weird road trip. I didnt know what the guy looked like, but we were supposed to meet him by a Wild Wings by his house.\n\nSo we finally get there and meet the guy; he was wearing a shirt with the Reddit alien so we could recognize him. Hes one of those skinny fat guys, and it looks like hes already 4 beers in. I thought it was going to be awkward but he was actually a charming guy and all my friends had something in common with him which I was REALLY happy about. We stay drinking and chatting until closing. My friends head to the car, but the mod pulls me aside to talk to me alone.\n\nHe thanks me for doing all this for him. Even though I was a stranger to him, it meant so much when he was in a really dark place. \n\n\"But can I get one more thing from you?\" he asked\n\n\"What?...\" I asked\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nThats about the time I realized this mod was actually 500 feet tall and a creature from the paleolithic era.\n\nTL;DR- I hate these types of stories in the comments\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354560088", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Actually you're not super far from the truth. When I was in middle school, we had to do a lot of running for PE. Certain students, such as myself, suffered from asthma, and would consistently lag behind the rest of the pack. We kind of became our own group of friends and used the running session as our hang out time. \n\nAt any rate, there was this one very strange kid who was in our group, and probably had the worst asthma of any of us. At one point, and here's where my story gets relevant, he actually got hit with a pretty bad asthma attack. Now, unlike the majority of us who had activity-induced asthma, his asthma was chronic and heavily tied to allergies, so he had apparently been building up a pretty dense mucus concentration for the entirety of the spring season. \n\nWhen the attack came on, he basically collapsed to the ground and started dry heaving. It seemed like he was suffocating, while at the same time wanted to throw up. When it was evident this was pretty serious we notified authority figures, who in turn called the paramedics. \n\nNote: If you were extremely grossed out by OP's photo, please don't continue reading. \n\nBy the time the paramedics arrived, the kid had utilized his inhaler and seemed to be out of the \"in-danger-of-dying-zone,\" but was still very obviously in need of real medical attention. They put on oxygen mask over his mouth and he seemed to be doing okay. Suddenly, he just started throwing up into the mask, which obviously didn't allow very much to come out, so streams of vomit came out his nose. He ripped off the mask and just projectile vomited onto the grass. I guess he hadn't eaten very much that day, since his vomit looked a lot like water, but there were noticeable whitish chunks that landed in the vomit puddle on the grass.  \n\nWhat happened was, as he was coughing into his oxygen mask, he had actually coughed up one of these \"casts\" into his mouth. Apparently the taste and texture in the back of his throat made him gag, and he accidentally bit into it. As he felt the sensation and taste of biting into a slimy clump of a month's worth of mucus build-up, he instantly vomited. \n\nTalking to him a few days after the event, he described the texture of \"the thing\" as being similar to warm peanut butter, but with a really salty taste. Apparently there was a noticeable membrane around it. \n\nThis is the moment that stuck with me the most, though. Right after my friend had barfed the pieces of this throat-baby onto the grass, I asked my other friend how much I'd have to give him for him to eat it (being middle school boys of the Jackass era).

{"body": "I love the Mario series. Having never played SMB2, 3 and World, my favourite one yet is the recent Super Mario Galaxy 1 that came out on the wii (just a question, who still plays wii?). The final battle was epic.\n\nBattling his way through the armadas of Bowser's army, Mario needs to save the Princess again. Jumping on Goombas? That's nothing. With Bowser coming back in full force, what can Mario do to save his Princess? And in time, he finds out that his princess is not the only one in danger.\n\nBullet Bills have gotten an upgrade. They now  mercilessly track down Mario. Mario survived the initial attack from Bowser. But he lost his princess. He wakes up on another planet. The situation is dire. There is no way in his power to stop Bowser now.\n\nOr is there? He picks up a friend called a \"luma\". A star shaped mystical creature that gives him the ability to spin. This spin can strike Goombas in the face and knock them out cold. This ability allows him to ride tornados. And in this ability, there is hope.\n\nHe meets Rosalina when he found the luma. Rosalina's starship is broken. It's out of gas. It gets energy from Grand Power Stars. Grand Power Stars. The same fuel that Bowser is using for whatever purpose.\n\nAnd this begins the journey to find his love one. Blasting his ways through various planets, he meets Bowser and Bowser Jr countless times. Defeating them every time. But then... Mario finds out what the Evil King is planning. The creation of his own universe. The destruction of everything that stands in his way.\n\nMario would not stop now. He would never stop. The final defeat of Bowser ended in the epic destruction of the Planet they were battling on. The planet was in fact, a star. As it goes supernova, it creates a black hole of epic proportions. Suddenly, the luma in Mario's hat flies out. It waves \"bye\" to Mario. It's last wave. It plunges itself into the depths of the black hole as multiple follow. This counters the formation of the black hole and patches the rupture in space and time. The energy produced was enough to create a new galaxy. Entirely new. What was is no longer. The universe is reborn. And thus it begins again. Super Mario Galaxy.\n\nBut Bowser will be back...\n\nTLDR: Tree Fiddy", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354640647", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Actually, I do have a story to tell.  I hadn't really thought about what happened much until this question, and I typically don't post on these AskReddit questions, but I think I have a story that might actually be a good read for you guys.\n\nSo, growing up my family and I had a pure German Shepherd named Milo (pronounced my-low).  We got him as a puppy for my 13th birthday, so he was a pretty special dog to me.  What I mean is that I was old enough to really remember him as a puppy and I was capable of being the one in charge of most of his training.  We've had dogs before, including one when I was born, as well as the other dog we had at the time that was a mutt named Skippy.  We got Skippy when I was six, so I don't really remember him much as a puppy, as I was essentially a puppy myself.\n\nMilo was different, though.  He really was my best friend, and I tried to do everything with him.  My parents and I even lived on the edge of a pretty large wooded area (we were in a budding city, so our suburb still had some wild areas around it) and my parents trusted Milo enough to allow me to go exploring in those woods by myself, so long as Milo went with me.  He would run around sniffing the world, and yet he would stay by my side at the same time.  I could always know when something was \"off\" or some other critter was nearby just by watching his behavior, and I know he'd protect me if he ever had to.\n\nWell, like I said earlier, we were in a budding city so it was still a pretty small town when I was about 16.  Milo had just turned three, so he was 90 pounds of fully grown German Shepherd, and had experienced enough of the world to know what I wanted of him and what was really happening.  I took him everywhere in the town with me, within reason.  Like I said before, I love exploring, so I would always walk or bike to the places I wanted to go to, and there Milo would be right by my side.  Even though I was 16, I still didn't have my license yet (I got it 7 months after my 16th birthday because I do what I want), so one day I had to bike to the store to grab some stuff for my mom.\n\nIt was going to be a short trip, so of course I took Milo with me, and so we headed off.  Well, there was this girl in high school with me, and we had the hots for each other.  We weren't \"dating\"...yet...and I hoped to change that.  Being a naive little sucker, I decided to swing by the small jewelry store on the way to the grocery store.  It wasn't even a true jewelry store, it was a goldsmith shop.  We went to church with the owner and craftsman of the store, so I had no reservations about waltzing on in and looking at what he had.  He knew me well enough that he let Milo come inside with me.\n\nWell I'm looking around trying to find something cheap and pretty, even though I have no flippin' idea what a girl might like, and Milo's off bee-bopping around behind the counter just sniffing the world.  All of a sudden, I hear these tires screech outside and this man slams through the front door of the store.  \n\nThat was my first experience as to what a robber really looks like.  In the movies, they have hoods and masks and guns, and I'm sure some of them do, but this guy was all about trying to fool the cameras rather than look the part.  He came in with a huge black wig on and sunglasses, with this baggy jacket and baggy track pants.  He's wielding a claw hammer in one hand and a bag in the other, and he's yelling his head off.  \n\n\"GET THE FUCK BACK, KID.\"  He turns to the owner and yells  \"I WANT EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT PUT INTO THIS BAG.\"  Obviously I'm paraphrasing, but you get the idea.  Although I can remember the first part pretty well.\n\nThe robber guy is storming around and wielding that fucking hammer, but the owner and I couldn't do a thing about it.  He was a big guy, and we knew that one swing from that hammer could potentially kill us, so I stayed back and the owner went to open the drawer.\n\nYou're remembering Milo now, right?  He vaulted the counter, and without even touching the ground first he latched on to that guy's arm with the hammer.  My dog fucking knew what was going on, and knew which arm to grab onto.  I knew he was a German Shepherd and they are popular police dogs, but still, DAMN.  He's had no attack training at all, no sort of self defense training, nothing.  I had never seen so much blood in my life.  He clamped through that guy's jacket like it was nothing, right into his forearm.  It had to have hurt like hell.\n\nWell the guy starts screaming and thrashing around, and there's my 90 pound dog still hanging, trying to pull him to the ground.  He had dropped the hammer, and so the owner and I saw it fit to jump on the guy as well and we managed to pull him to the ground.  The store owner took his belt off and used it to pretty much hog tie the guy, and then the owner did what any sensible person would do to hold someone down, he sat on the guy.  It looked ridiculous but it worked.\n\nThis was pre-cell phones, so after I see that Milo is fine (he was still glaring at the robber, and I knew if that guy moved an inch Milo would have been all over him again) I went and called 911 from the phone in the back.  It was a small town and was a bit different of a time, so I didn't have to stay on the phone with the dispatcher like they do today.  They sent some cop cars and I went out front to make sure they got to the right place.\n\nAll the police and legal stuff got taken care of, and the robber got fixed up by an ambulance before he got carted off to jail.  Milo, the store owner, and I were still hanging out in the store answering questions and getting things squared away, but we had some time to kill while the cops grabbed security tapes and all of that fun stuff.  So that's when the store owner tells me I can have whatever I want in the store for free, because without me and my dog, he would have been in an awful situation.  \n\nI was shocked.  It was the most generous thing anyone had ever done to me at that point.  I pick out a necklace (I still stayed on the cheap side of things) and was about to leave when the store owner pulled me to the side again.  He said \"I need one more thing before you go...\" I of course replied with \"Sure!  What do you need?\"  \n\nHe said \"I need about tree fiddy...\"  Now it was around this time that I noticed the store owner was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damn Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!  \"GOD DAMMIT MONSTA, I AIN'T GIVIN YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" I screamed as she swam into the distance.\n\nMilo and I ended up going home without running the errand for mom.  I felt kind of bad about that, but she obviously understood after we told her what happened.  Milo and I had even more freedoms in town after that, as every store owner and employee was more than happy to have him come into their store.  He ended up leading a normal doggie life for the next 10 years, and finally had to be put down.  He was the best dog I've ever had, and I would do anything to have another one like him.  I'm working on getting another German Shepherd right now, in fact, and his name is obviously going to be Milo.\n\n**TL;DR:  Had a German Shepherd named Milo.

{"body": "A few years back I was transitioning from male to female.  The estrojen was starting to kick in, I noticed my breasts beggining to form and my voice starting to change a bit.  I was feeling good about myself so i decided to go out for a drink at the bar.  My friend got to my place and we called a cab and it picked us up.  The smell inside the cab was terrible! It smelled wet, almost like a fish.  Just disgusting.  Of course us sitting in there, the smell seemed to attach to us like velcro.  We didn't notice until after we had gotten into the bar.  We sat down to order a few drinks, people were looking at us a bit strange, the guy we sat down next to left pretty quickly and sat at a table.  We knew we stunk like the cab but it was the first time out in awhile, figured we should just drink and have fun anyways.  Tried to freshen up in the bathroom a bit, but it was like that episode of Seinfeld, with the BO from the guy who dropped off his car.  Just terrible.  Fast foward and hour and a half, we were pretty drunk and decided to head out, called another cab.  Guess who fucking shows up?  Exact same cab, and we didn't realize it until we were already inside.  He pulled away from the bar and asked us where we wanted to go.  We told him to drop us off at a pool downtown.  It wasn't always locked up properly and you could easily get in.  We wanted to have fun and swim (probably not the best idea at the time, as we were quite drunk), we also figured that we could get the re-attached stench off of us.  So we get to the pool, ask the driver how much, and he replies, \"about tree-fiddy\".  It was about that time that I realized the cab driver was 8 stories tall and a creature from the paleolithic era. We jumped out of the cab and took off, realized I forgot my shoes but didn't care.  We just wanted out of there.  Found out later my friend felt bad, found the cab driver the next day and gave him the money.  Now he won't leave us alone!

I'd been skating for about 4.5 years by then but at that particular day I was a little stoned and had a few beers in me.  I was wearing my helmet, slide gloves, a t-shirt, and gym shorts.  Right after the fastest turn of the run, just before a nice long straight-away, a car pulls out ahead of me.  I need to slow down or I'm going to rear end it.  The car cannot speed up as my friends are ahead of it.\n\nI had faced this situation more than once before and had always come away unscathed.  I should have just slid out and stopped.  There were no boarders coming behind me, everyone was ahead of me down the hill.  What did I do?  I jumped off my board, landing initially on my right foot and then sliding on the pavement with the left side of my body.  I just laid there on the ground for a bit feeling the cool sensation of blood running down my arm.  I feel a crack in the back of my helmet and take it off, still lying on the pavement.  My right foot is throbbing.\n\nA pickup truck comes around the corner sees me on the ground and asks me if I'm okay through the window.  I pull my self off the ground, and wave him on with a smile and a thumbs up as I look to recover my board.  My left arm is covered in blood and I have gnarly roadrash on my left buttocks.  There is a deep wound on my left elbow (which later turned into a pretty wicked scar).  I stumble down the road towards where we had parked the car.  I limp a half mile down the rest of the hill and let them know that was the last run for me and get in the car ready to drive everyone home.  My foot is throbbing so bad at this point I take off my right shoe.  Never before have I seen so many colors on a piece of my own flesh.  Hues of green, purple, red, and blue, in a marble pattern from my big toe my inner ankle.  Damn was it swollen.  I later learned I had only fractured my big toe.\n\nNow my foot is hurting. . . bad.  That period of time after an injury when you don't feel any pain had just ended.  Knowing that I'm not able to drive at this point \"Can I ask you a favor?\" I say to my buddy as I'm cleaning the blood off my arm.  \"Yeah what do you need?\" he replies. \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that he realized I was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. \"Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again!\" He stood there screaming as I swam away in the distance.\n\ntldr: I got a gnarly scar on my elbow from doing something stupid while longboarding.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354738423", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Part IV: First Contact**\n\n\"Captain, there's nothing I can do. I'm pretty sure they can't see or hear us, so that brings the possible senses down to smell, taste, and touch. I have no idea how to create smells and tastes, and even if I did, I would have no idea what I would be saying to them. And as for touch: I don't think these things even realize how big we are. They've only ever touched our feet and legs; nothing higher. Maybe they think we're just moving sticks!\"\n\n\"Well they're clearly expecting us to do something,\" the Captain said unhelpfully.\n\nI turned back to the crab. It hadn't moved since its little performance. I didn't want to touch the crab itself, for fear of frightening it. Murray was right: a camouflaged animal meant an animal with predators. I knelt down in front of him and tapped the hard ground in front of him with two fingers, the same way that it had done. Hopefully that was just a greeting. The only way to know was to wait for the mob to swarm over me, in which case I would know that I was wrong. \n\nInstead, the crowd parted and the communicating crab skittered away toward the base of the cone. He stopped, maybe 50 yards away, and turned back to where we stood. The Captain starting following him, and Murray and I uncertainly followed. We hadn't explored this far up, yet; I began to get worried that we wouldn't find be able to find out way back to our ship. \n\nThe terrain began to grow bumpy and ridged. The bulges where we had found groups of crabs clustered began to grow larger and more common.   We began to see strange formations, including some that were clearly unnatural, with gleaming metal and moving parts. Although we could only speculate as to what they were for, we assumed that they must had something to do with flying the ship. Their technology seemed to be an odd mix of biological components, structures grown into a pre-planned shape, and clearly artificial materials. \n\nWe noticed specialized types of crab, too. The ones we had previously encountered were the most common, and seemed to be doing routine maintenance, repairs, and tending the growths of mold or fungus that they ate and used for light. But we caught glimpses of others; some that ran incredibly quickly, but were about half the size of the normal crabs. Some that moved very slowly on 6 stout legs, carrying rocks and other items on their flattened backs. \n\nFinally, our crab leader stopped in front of a giant bulge, about three stories high. The walls here seemed about twice as thick as the others. Inside, we saw the usual phosphorescent bacteria, but also large clumps of what must have been eggs on the walls. They were perfectly clear, with dark shapes floating inside. The light from the bacteria shone through them, illuminating the eggs eerily. From across the chamber, we saw a shape moving slowly down a wall. As our eyes adjusted, we saw yet another species of crab, different from the others. It was the largest by far (about the size of a human), and had no shells. It left a trail of eggs on its slow path, using its pincers to find the perfect niche in the porous walls in which to secure the eggs. \n\nIt seemed to sense our arrival as the maintenance crabs that had escorted us here scuttled away. It shuffled over, moving slowly and deliberately. \n\n\"Must be some sort of hive society\" Murray whispered into the mic. \"This is clearly the queen, and the fact that they brought us to her indicates some kind of leadership position as well. Fascinating that they would have a similar social structure to our own hive-like cultures, like ants and bees!\" \n\nShe (I guess we were referring to it as a \"she\", although that might not be the least bit accurate) came to a halt in front of us and tapped the ground as our previous escort had done. I tapped the ground in front of her, which seemed to set off a frenzy of activity; she flailed around, arms waving and pincers tapping. \n\n\"Shit, shit, shit!\" I yelled. \"What do I do? I have no idea what she needs!\"\n\nBut, before Captain or Murray could respond, a deep voice emanated from the Queen:\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" \n\n[Disclaimer: I had already written all of this for another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/FutureWhatIf/comments/11qdht/what_would_happen_if_we_made_contact_with_an/c6oulwz).

{"body": "I used to use OKCupid and when I was on it I met this really beautiful brunette girl named Amanda. We started talking and we hit things off instantly. Our messaging went back and forth for a couple weeks before we finally decided to meet for coffee that upcoming weekend. We went to this small cafe that was about midway between where we lived at around 11. I got there a little bit before she did and got myself a coffee and a danish and grabbed a seat by the window waiting for her. Finally I saw her walking down the street. She looked beautiful. She had a light gray peacoat on with a white scarf, her hair was up in a pony tail and she had these cute white earmuffs on (this was mid december), a pair of tight jeans and furry winter boots. She walked in and looked around and she spotted me. A big smile showed up on her face and she walked over and sat down. \n\nFast forward a few months and we've been dating for a while now. It's around this time I start to notice a few things about her personality that I don't particularly like. She is very clingy, wants to know where I am and what I'm doing at all times, and I think she is trying to drive me away from my friends. Fast forward again a couple weeks and I know for sure she is. She has been dragging me to come out with her friends, never lets me see mine, gets all pissy if I'm on the phone or texting someone; it's driving me fucking insane. I deal with it for a little while longer because the sex is amazing and I feel like maybe I can get her to come around. Stupid mistake. \n\nHer controlling personality has gotten horrendous to the point where she questions me about where I've been right after coming home from work. I can't take it anymore so I say fuck it and break up with her. It wasn't a pleasant experience for me. She loses her fucking mind! It took a while but I finally got her off my ass. Or at least I thought I did. A month later I've found another girl that I've taking a liking to and things are going smoothly. This new girl (Megan) and I are walking in the mall hand in hand when Amanda spots us. Her face instantly turns to rage. She turns heel and storms off. \n\nThat night I start getting mass texts from her asking who this new girl is, calling me an asshole, calling her a whore, blah blah blah, normal crazy ex-girlfriend shit so I just ignore them. She then starts calling me and it's driving me crazy so I finally answer and yell at her and tell her to leave me alone and I'm done with her. She won't have this. She starts stalking me and her and it's starting to scare Megan so I finally have enough of this and file a restraining order. Amanda finally snaps because of this and I think she is going to try to kill me and based on her past actions I wouldn't hold it past her to go through with it. \n\nThe following morning I get up to go to work and walk outside and find that my tires had been slashed. I know exactly who it was that did it too so I go back inside to call my boss (I was out of minutes on my phone, yeah I know I'm a savage still using pre-paid phones) and let him know what happened. I walk into the kitchen and who else is there but Amanda and she is holding a fucking massive kitchen knife with murder in her eyes. I back away slowly into my living room and grab my 9 mill out of a drawer I have in there. She didn't notice I grabbed it and she comes running at me so I hold the gun up to her and she stops dead in her tracks. I tell her if she leaves right now that it won't go any further so she puts the knife down and heads to the door because she doesn't want to get shot, who does. I'm holding the gun to her the whole time and when she gets to the front door she turns around. \"Before I go I have one thing to say\" I ask her what and she looks at me dead in the eye and says,\n\"Can I borrow tree fitty?\" At this time I realize Amanda isn't a girl, but a 300 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. \n\n**TLDR: Crazy ex-girlfriend tried to murder me.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354817219", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I finished work late during the summer last yr (work at a bar so don't finish till 2 at the earliest, I know there's a long wait for night buses as they come less and less the later it gets but it's in the middle of the woods (the place the rich do to get out of the 'hustle and bustle' of every day life) so I'm cool with waiting, it's always got a really dramatic feel to it. Anyways, I'm waiting for a good 20 minutes when this haggard old, dirty bus pulls up before me. I mean, this shit can't be regulation, it's got rust on it, the hobcaps are long gone, and i'm pretty sure that shit is moss on the windows. Maybe they've got a busy night and had to dig deep for this bus route, like I said, it is in the middle of nowhere. Anyways I get on, the door opens all slowly and cranky and shit, practically howling like a banshee and I just wanna get home, bus driver seems normal enough, got a big of a grump on but it's about half two in the morning and he's driving what looks like a Scooby Doo villains vehicle so what ever, i pay my fair and sit down slap my head phones in and figure ill get some sleep seeing as it's a good half hour, forty five minutes back to civilisation so i lean my head back and close my eyes. And then i feel it. I look up and the bus driver is standing over me, wheezing and shit like he's just run a marathon, his round belly gulping in lungfuls of dirty air. I pull a headphone out, with a confused face I say \"yeah?\" and he starts going off on how he needs some tartan paint for the tyres so they look pretty for the town, I was a bit hazey at this point because I just smoked a jay before i got on the bus so i was kinda hoping for a pretty event free journey home and i explained this to him, but he just kept mumering to himself. After about three minutes of this i got bored and just said 'what do you want??' and he looked at me dead in my fucking eye, and he said in the coldest voice; 'I need aboutta tree fiddy.' Well it was about this time that i realised that the bus driver was in fact a 40 ft beast from the paleolithic era, i said 'god damn you loch ness monster you aint getting my tree fiddy, you gotta earn you're own god damn tree fiddy' so i got off the bus and waited for the next one.

How are you? :)\n\n\nI was always fascinated by the slang and colloquialisms in England, general terms and even ones pertaining to specific dialects. I think an English Slang dictionary such as \"Knickers in a Twist\" is good entertainment to the American. It was for me! \n\n\nChocolate bars such as Yorkie, Whispa, Caramac, Lion bars, Aero, Bueno (I know Kinder Bueno isn't British but we don't have it over here), are all very fun to try and I hate American chocolate bars now. Very sad Kraft bought out Cadbury.\n\n\nThere are loads of little things that might seem weird or stupid, but I bought a calendar (and it is nearly a new year...) when I was in England last. It was all Yorkshire, which was where I was, and I love it, I love the photographs of the countryside.\n\n\nA box of your favorite tea perhaps??? With instructions on how to drink it the British way. ;) Not sure about shipping actual liquids, but we don't have Irn-Bru over here either, or Lilt. I miss Lilt. I got addicted to that shit.\n\n\nIs there something particularly historical near where you live? A castle? Ancient cathedral? Anything with a gift shop? I have a little Loch Ness monster that sits on my shelf my aunt bought for me when she visited. Perhaps something small like that? I got a tea towel with a map of old York on it for my mum and she framed it. :P Or perhaps a pencil sharpener that looks like the British red phone box? Or a TARDIS keychain? I think weird little dorky things like this are brilliant and fun but that's me.\n\n\n\nI'm assuming she hasn't visited you/your home? Maybe take a walk in our town and around your usual hang outs. Take photos of these places and even you in some of them. Put the photos on a flash drive. I loved seeing the home of my friends in photos, and when I finally visited and saw it in person, it was so cool, because I had all these stories in my head that went with the photos. Does that make sense?\n\n\nHm.... I'm trying to think of other things. Recipes for Yorkshire puddings and sticky toffee pudding and banoffee pie.... more things we live without here in America. Perhaps there should be a subcategory of First World Problems... American Problems... no Banoffee pie.... :(\n\n\nAnyways, I hope this helps a bit, or sparks your creativity at least :) Good luck xoxo", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354848016", "subreddit": "england", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

It's like a thief accusing another thief of being a thief.\n\nNo it really isn't. One side is actually right and one side is actually wrong. They really AREN'T guilty of the same things at all. Seriously examine the arguments and note which side uses logical fallacy after logical fallacy and which side goes where the evidence leads. If you saw two people arguing the existence of the Loch Ness Monster and one side was arguing it exists using fallacies, outright lies on occasion and the other side was saying \"I don't believe you until you come up with better evidence\" you'd be insane to accuse them of being as bad as each other.\n\n&gt; It's impossible to be certain of what awaits (or doesn't) after death. \n\nI reject certainty as a matter of course. I can't be certain that the seat I sit on every morning will always hold me up but I take a reasonable gamble that it will. Certainty is a Red Herring. I, personally, go where the preponderance of evidence leads me but I NEVER demand certainty. We may not know for certain but we can have a good idea of what happens after death based on the evidence of people that have suffered brain damage. That evidence suggests that if part of the brain is damaged what makes us, us is also damaged. This leads to a fairly reasonable conclusion that once the brain is destroyed then so are we. I'm not claiming certainty here and it sucks that this appears to be the case but that's just where the evidence leads.\n\n&gt; Can't we just live and let live?

The picture on the flyer was more of a photo-realistic sketch than an actual photograph, but it was clear enough that I could commit the picture to memory (I saved the flyer also). The strange thing was that the picture actually did seem familiar to me, which was strange since I was in another country. What would the chances actually be if I did see who was in the picture while on vacation?\n\nFast forward a few days. I had thought about the picture a couple more times, but I had still been unable to place it. Why did it seem so familiar to me? I had been thinking about it again when my family and I were about to leave to wander around town for a bit. Then it hit me. Earlier that week I had seen who was in the picture!

{"body": "Sorry this is a long story, but I can't think of a shorter way to tell it:\n\nWhen I was growing up, my best friend was a girl that lived down the street from me, we'll call her Jessica. Jessica and I went to different elementary schools (we both lived near the edge of two different districts), but otherwise we were inseparable. We spent probably 95% of our free time together, after school, weekends, summertime, winter/spring break, you name it. We even had an on-again/off-again childhood sweetheart thing going on, and even went as far as holding hands and giving each other a quick peck of a kiss (!).\n\nGradually though, as most things do during that age, our relationship started to change. We both started going to 7th grade together, at the same Jr. High School. She was starting to \"develop\" into a pretty young girl, and with her new looks came popularity and attention from boys that were much cooler than me. For all of the 7th grade and most of 8th, we maintained a strong friendship, but it naturally evolved into strictly at home or around the neighborhood. She existed in a different world at school than I did, and was never willing to cross that boundary.\n\nSometime during the 8th grade she started going to a lot of parties, where presumably she started experimenting with drugs, alcohol, and sex. She could be found huddled in a group of \"cool\" kids most mornings/afternoons outside of the school, all sharing some stolen cigarettes. As she became more and more known as a promiscuous party girl, she became less and less interested in even acknowledging my existence. Eventually came a time when we shared a class together, and you would never even know we had met, let alone had such a strong bond in the past.\n\nEven though this whole ordeal really damaged my confidence, and left me confused and hurt during such a formative time, I eventually got over it and moved on. I went through high school still not being \"popular,\" but I had tons of friends (mostly of the \"alternative\" type crowd) due to the shenanigans I was always pulling. Eventually, I started to overhear kids talk about Jessica in some of my classes, and some of the messed up stuff going on in her life. Rumors were widely circulating about how she was pretty deep into abusing meth and alcohol, and would basically sleep with any guy who paid her enough or provided enough of either substance. It became pretty widely known that she had to have an abortion at one point due to her promiscuity, which pretty much bottomed out her reputation. It hurt me to hear all this stuff about her, but at the same time in my immature head I had a sense of \"good, she had it coming, that's what she gets for dumping a good friend like me.\" I never really saw her again after the 10th grade, as she switched schools due to getting in so much trouble, and becoming such a distraction.\n\nFast forward to shortly before graduation, and I find myself invited to a huge party some kids were throwing in an empty house. The kind of party that is so big, it transcends any social cliques or groups, and all the kids there come together under the common banner of getting wasted and making bad decisions. I go with some friends, and get half-drunk and start pulling Jackass style stunts in the backyard (because hey, that's what you do when you're in high school and want attention). Eventually, our little gathering outside gets pulled inside by screams of \"FIGHT! GIRLS FIGHTING!\" Naturally we drop what we were doing and run inside the house to see what was going on. I step into the crowded kitchen, but I can't see anything because of the crowd, just a lot of screaming and cussing, with people cheering whoever was fighting on. I stepped on a chair and looked over everyone, and my heart sank as I see Jessica locked up with some trashy girl, pulling each others hair and screaming at the top of their lungs. I had no idea she was even at this party. Apparently Jessica had slept with this girls boyfriend (who was a known dealer), and the girl took exception to that. Jessica seemed like she was trying to escape, but kept getting pushed back into the fight by guys that were standing around, and people were throwing their cups at them while they were fighting, dousing her in cheap beer and crappy mixed drinks.\n\nTo this day, I don't know what came over me, but every emotion and special memory of our childhood friendship came flooding back in that instant. I pushed my way through the crowd, and pulled the girl off Jessica just long enough to grab her hand and push my way out the front door. I wasn't even that strong or physically imposing back then, I just think I took everyone by complete surprise so they just let it happen.\n\nI ended up driving Jessica back to my house, and the whole time she was sheepish and quiet, and my mind and heart were racing at a mile a minute, but I wasn't saying a word. I went inside and grabbed her a towel and one of my old sweatshirts, and we walked to a nearby patch of woods where we used to play all the time when we were younger. She thanked me, and I asked if she was alright, which she was.\n\nI didn't really know what else to say, so I just started by making small talk about what had happened. I asked, \"why did you sleep with that girl's boyfriend?\" She told me that I knew why, that it was for money, and that she knew I was judging her for it and she hated herself for doing it. I asked, \"if you hate yourself for doing it, why keep doing it? Is it really just about the money?\"\n\nShe replied, \"Actually no, that's the dumb thing. He didn't even give me that much at all.\" I asked her how much is \"not that much at all,\" and she answered \"tree fiddy.\" It's at this point that I realized that Jessica was in fact a 300 foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. I said \"you ain't gettin tree fiddy from me you damn Loch Ness Monster!!\" and walked away.

{"body": "I had to fire all three members of a love triangle.\n\nI ran the HR department for a large amusement park for a number of years. We hired a lot of teenagers/students to run the attractions out in the park. Working with large numbers of teenagers can create a lot of crazy drama among the employees, especially when there are relationships involved. We typically tried to discourage relationships among employees, but we were never particularly successful.\n\nSo, one fateful summer, we hired a young woman that I'll call Megan. Megan was nice enough, fairly attractive, had lots of friends, etc. Seemingly an average teenage girl having an average teenage summer.\n\nMegan began seeing a young man in her department that I'll call Jack. Jack was a thug. Nobody liked him, but he had a family connection to one of the other managers, so we were pressured to hire him (I certainly wouldn't have normally). In his first week, he was accused of stealing from another employee's locker, but nobody could pin it on him (cameras weren't working). I was displeased by Megan's choice (Jack wasn't the only one vying for her affection), but it wasn't my place to do anything about it.\n\nOne day, a month or so into the summer, Megan showed up to work with a fairly nasty bruise on her cheek. I pulled her aside and asked her what happened. She blushed and said she tripped. I knew that was bullshit and told her that if she ever needed to talk about something, I'm all ears. She thanked me and left.\n\nA few months went by. Megan and Jack remained together, but I could tell she wasn't entirely comfortable around him anymore.\n\nOne particularly hot night in August, Megan and Jack got into a screaming match in front of some customers. Jack said some pretty nasty things about her, accusing her of cheating. Another male employee, let's call him Sam, tried to get them to calm down, reminding them that there were customers around and that this was not appropriate. Jack shoved Sam and accused him of being the guy Megan had cheated on him with.\n\nSam, being a genius, punched Jack in the face. They got into a scuffle, but security arrived to break up the fight and escorted them to my office. I fired both of them.\n\nI brought Megan into my office to talk about the situation. Before I could begin, she started sobbing and wailing about how this was all her fault. As it turned out, she really had cheated on Jack with Sam and, here's the kicker, she was now pregnant with Sam's child.\n\nI was flabbergasted and told her that if there was anything she needed, just tell me.\n\nShe looked up, cleared away some of the tears and said, “I need about tree fiddy.”\n\nWell, it was about that time I realized Megan was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Mesozoic era. I said, “Dammit, monster, get outta my office!

He had some sick days left over, and I knew he was having some relationship problems, so I just told him to try and come back soon because the taxes needed to be done.\nFast forward a few days, he still hasn't come to work. I call him again, its the same deal, people are talking in the background, but he sounds kinda sick and worn-out. I tell him that I hope he gets better soon, but he insists that he come to work the next day and get the taxes done, he says he owes it to me for being so nice to him, (I loaned him some money a while back).\nSo the next day John comes to work, not in his normal attire of khakis, shirt, and tie, but in his *bathrobe*, and he has this really messy but short beard, as if he just hadn't been shaving at all during his time out. He has very noticeable bags under his eyes.\n I ask if he's okay, he says he is, and insists on getting to work on the taxes. He sits down at his desk and, well, starts working. I go up to him and ask if he's okay, (again), and if he needs anything. He turns to me in his little swivel-chair, looks at me right in the eyes, and says, \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was at about this time that I realized that John was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354979095", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

We were both very young and had no clue what death would be like for her. I loved her like a sister and never wanted her to go, but she knew that she had to. So every day, I made sure to get her a little gift. No matter what. A piece of gum, a doll from her house, anything. If she asked for it before I left, then she got it the next day. And I was there almost every day to make sure she had a friend to talk to in the big scary hospital.\n\nOne day, I went there and they said I couldn't visit her. Something happened, I later heard she had a bad reaction to some new medicine, and they needed to isolate her while she was so weak. So every day, I still came and sat outside her window. She always saw me and gave me a weak smile. We could never talk, but it was enough knowing that we were there for each other until the bitter end.\n\nOne day, the doctors tell me she's slipped beyond anything they can do. That I can finally reenter the room only because she'd probably be dead in the next day. So I went in there and held her hand and we cried. I told her how much I loved her and never wanted to let her go. She told me the same and asked for two favors. I said anything, even if it was the moon itself, I would bring it to her. She asked me first to be her first kiss. I obliged, and we both felt a spark like we were meant to be together. At this point, she started coughing violently for a few minutes and the nurses had to come in and hook her up to an oxygen tank. After a few terrifying minutes, I was finally able to talk to her again. She was so weak and frail in the bed, but she still had to ask me that second favor. So I leaned in, got right up next to her, and heard her whisper her final words before slipping into a coma.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it was about damn time that I noticed that she was actually a 10-story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "&gt; But you are contradicting yourself.\n\nNot even a little..\n\n&gt; They put it in the constitution because up until that point those rights were NOT recognized\n\nBeing recognized has absolutely *nothing* to do with who gives you your rights.  I am simply saying that you are born a free being.  There is nothing freer than simply existing.  You the world is your right.  Every action you perform is your right because you are a conscience, free, thinking human being.  No government grants you the ability to speak.  No government grants you the ability to defend yourself.  You are naturally born with the ability and the right to exercise your body and perform actions as you see fit.\n\nJust because a government stepped in a started violating us en masse, that doesn't mean that when they let up off the throttle that they are granting is rights.  That is insane.\n\n&gt; That's why they had to fight a revolution over it\n\nYes, our rights were being violated, so courageous men fought a war to stop that oppression.  What's your point?\n\n&gt;  and built a government structure to preserve it\n\nThe bill of rights was a list of things that we needed to protect from the government.  They were a list of things we are born with, given to us by our creator, and that we need to have them protected *from* the ultimate abuse of government.\n\nAs I stated before, I don't usually like to quote statist documentation.  I disagree with the founding fathers on a lot of issues and I think they had the perfect opportunity to not repeat the mistakes of their oppressors.  They could have not established a federal government at all, but they did, for one reason or another.  But they knew we should be weary of it.  They specifically said that we needed to have our rights protected from the government and that \"whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it\".\n\nThe bottom line is that the government does not grant rights.  Most statists wouldn't even argue that.  I belive it's ridiculous to try and assert that.  Would you have said that a human from the paleolithic era had the right to free speech?  Or was he unable to speak until a governmet came in a granted him the ability to speak?  Was he able to defend himself?  Or did he sit motionless until a government came in and granted him the ability to defend himself?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355195909", "subreddit": "economy", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My parent's do this, except I'm the youngest. I shared a car with my sister when I was in high school, but I used it the most (she was in college and used it over the summer to get to her job as a summer camp counselor a couple times a week, while I used it every day to get to practices, work, etc). I had to write my entire schedule on our calendar so that she would know if she had to figure something else out. Not a big deal, except that her schedule changed every week, and she never had to let me know when she needed it. In addition, she would randomly just take it to go do random stuff without letting me know, when she knew I had something going on. Still not a big deal, w/e. I can put up with a lot. What really pissed me off, was that she would always put on sunscreen when she left. She would lather it on, and there would be huge smears of sunscreen all over the handles, steering wheel, radio knobs, everything. The whole car would reek of sunscreen (it doesn't really smell that bad, but when it's caked everywhere in a car and is baking in the sun for weeks, it gets a very distinctive smell). I asked her to wash her hands or something before she got in the car, which was apparently a huge insult, and she went off on a rant about cancer and how I was stupid for telling her she shouldn't be wearing sunscreen (something I never said, I just asked her to clean off her hands). I asked my parents to talk to her about it, and they told me to quit being a baby. This went on for a couple months, then after a while, I got fed up, dragged my parents out to the car and made them look at it. They were amazed that we had painted the car white without telling them, and then finally told my sister to wash her hands before she used the car. I still can't stand the smell of sunscreen because of her, that is the one thing in the world that makes me gag. To top it off, they still make fun of me for being a baby about the sunscreen years later, even though they agreed with me.\n\nThat wasn't an isolated incident, they side with her on everything. Bit of backstory, when both my sisters were still living at home, they decided the bathroom needed to be organized. They designated 1 drawer for each of us, and told me to put everything in that drawer, nothing left out on the counters. They did it and told me after the fact, but I thought it was a good idea, since the bathroom was a mess. I had a bottle of contact solution, contact case, and a razor. There was no counter space since it was full of face scrubs, pimple cream, I don't even know there was so much stuff. One time I counted and there were 27 bottles of shampoo/conditioner in the shower for the 2 of them, almost all of them 3/4 empty. So they cleaned up the bathroom, got it all organized, and then a week later all their stuff was out on the counter with no space left. I asked them to clean their stuff up, and they looked at me like I had said hitler did nothing wrong. They started screaming at me, so I just walked away. I asked my mom to talk to them about it, and she told me to quit being a baby. So I started putting the mostly empty bottles under the sink. They never noticed until they went under the sink for something else, and would then proceed to yell at me. Then they started complaining about the hair from me shaving in the sink. W/e, I get it. I told them I would clean it up every time, and asked them to clean their hair out of the drain when they showered, since there were always clumps the size of a ping pong ball in the drain blocking it, and hair all over the side of the shower. Again, super offended at me politely asking them to do their part in keeping the bathroom clean since I was doing my part. My mom over heard them yelling at me, and asked what was going on. We explained the situation, and I subsequently got a lecture on how it's different for girls and I needed to respect them.\n\nRecently, I moved back in with my parents while looking for a new job, and my sister lives a couple hours away. She'll come home for a night every month or so. We went to my cousins wedding. My sister had to work 'early' the next morning (noon), so she asked me to drive her home (along with a lot of 'hints' from my mother). I didn't mind too much, would have liked to get drunk at the wedding, but w/e. She promised she would make me caramel on thanksgiving when she came to visit (her homemade caramel is amazing, that's what I ask for for bdays, xmas, etc). She comes home the next week, and flat out tells me I'm getting nothing unless I clean the bathroom. It wasn't particularly dirty, but she's very particular about some things. If she had said, 'hey the bathrooms dirty, can you clean it since you're the one living here?', I would have been fine with that. But she flat out told me I was cleaning it, without being polite in the slightest way. So I went and cleaned the bathroom, and then told her she could clean out all the hair from the drain before she left. She instantly started screaming at the top of her lungs about all the hair in the sink from me shaving (literally no way there was any, I've grown a beard so I don't shave anymore, and I trim it over the toilet. Also the hair in the drain clearly wasn't mine since I have short hair ~1 in long). I figured I'm in my mid 20s and I've been putting up with this shit my whole life, it's time for me to stand up for myself. I start yelling back for the first time in my life (never was a point before since I knew my parents would side with her and I would lose so I always just walked away). My mom hears us from the next room, yells at me to quit being a child, and tells us this argument is over. She has since apologized, along with an explanation of how I needed to keep the bathroom cleaner and I shouldn't try to blackmail people by doing something for them and then ask them to do something for me after...\n\nWhen I left for college, my parents started saying that they never realized back then how many arguments and fights were started by my sisters, and they were sorry they blamed me for everything (literally everything; I've been blamed for leaving a door unlocked when I was across the country backpacking through new mexico for 3 weeks). Little consolation now, especially when they still do it.\n\nMy favorite example of preferential treatment is when she went to college. When I left for college, my parents made me pay for the first semester myself and show good grades before they would help me. Makes sense, I like that, it's reasonable. I got a lot of scholarships, blew all my savings on it, took out loans, etc. I offered to pay them back what they had put forward for my education once I graduated, although they declined and told me it was a gift. I found out a couple years ago about her college adventure. They paid for her bills, got her ready, bought all the dorm stuff, etc. Then 2 days before she was ready to leave, she decided she didn't want to go. My mom was ready to let her drop out before she even left after they had dropped like 15k$ on it. My dad wasn't putting up with that shit though, and made her go. She tried to get them to let her drop out a couple more times later, until my dad told her if she did she was paying back every cent he had spent on her education. She got a job teaching music ed, was let go after a couple years due to cutbacks, and decided to go back to school for music therapy, despite still having 10s of thousands of dollars of debt and can look forward to a nice average salary of ~11$ (according to her) for her new chosen career with limited job opportunities. She is currently working her way through online classes and community college while babysitting and couchsurfing with relatives and friends and commuting between chicago and northern wisconsin several times a week for different minimum wage baby sitting jobs and classes, while my parents help out with the bills. I have been unemployed for a couple months after having a temporary year long position at a major pharmaceutical company and am looking for a job, and my parents are threatening to make me start paying rent (which wouldn't bother me if they weren't paying for everything for my sister)\n\nOn the topic of music, she would like to practice in the family room, especially when people were trying to watch tv and play over the tv. I would ask her to go practice in her room and she would rant about how this was how she was going to make her living, and all I was doing was wasting time watching tv. When I finally got her to practice in her room, she would have my mom make me turn off the tv since it was too distracting. It apparently wasn't too distracting when my dad watched it though, or when she practiced in front of it.\n\nHoly shit I just realized how long that post was. But what else is reddit for if not to rant? I don't even care if anyone reads this, felt good to get it all out. Ok, not even close to all of it. Obligatory tree fiddy. \n\ntl;dr youngest kids get fucked over by siblings throwing tantrums too.\n\nEdit: for the record I don't hate my sister.

{"body": "I used to work at a Grocery store for the graveyard shift, pretty basic stuff, nothing too crazy. The trucks would come in, we'd unload shit, take it inside, then start stocked the store shelves all morning till a bit before the store opened. But there was this one night I'll never forget.\n\nIt was about 11:00pm,and I was on my way to work. I ended up being a bit late because one of the streets was closed. The store was in a pretty bad part of town, so I wasn't surprised, probably another gang shooting or something. So my shift started, and the truck was 10 minutes late, probably because of the nearby street closures.\n\nWell once the driver arrived, me and 4 other guys start unloading, and once everything was off the truck, the truck driver started talking to us about the street closures. He told us there was a 3 car accident, and that it was pretty bad, they were still looking for bodies, which was why the street was closed. He was told by a policeman that they weren't leaving anytime soon, because the investigators were still looking for the body of a chick who was in the accident. It turns out that the chick who they were looking for worked at the store. She was pretty cool, but worked in the morning, so if i talked to her, it was always small talk, or a simple hello. I didn't believe him, so later that night, I asked the supervisor, and he confirmed it, they found her body, and she had a paper with the store's number on it. I started to feel pretty sick, but braved it out till I got my smoking break. \n\nSo my smoking break arrived, and while I was outside, I saw a silhouette in the morning fog. At first I thought I was seeing things, but I wasn't. It was coming closer and closer, till I could make out that it was the sillouette of a woman. Once it came closer, I realized who it was, it was her, the girl who had died in the crash near work. I wasn't  completely sure if it was her or not, so I called her name, and she replied back with mine. That's when the fear set in. \n\nHoly fuck, it was her. Once she came out of the fog, I could see her, she had her employee uniform, which consisted of a polo shirt, black pants, and a white apron, which was covered in blood, as was her shirt and pants.

{"body": "I dont think you understand what free speech is, it is not the ability to speek, its the ability to descent against the natural structure you find yourself in.   And no, in the paleolithic era you were not granted the right to free speech.  If the largest male did not want you to vocalize desire they were by right of power able to shut you up.  We dont know the exact nature of those tribes but we see this even in the natural world.  Take a wolf pack for example.  Not a one in that system is permitted anything w/o the consent of the alpha.   What the founders did was create a structure to defend EQUALITY in how rights were granted by governance not a recognition that the rights work w/o governance.  In fact thats obvious by the fact that they had to fight to obtain a structure that protected those rights b/c its was counter to natural social hierarchy.   \n\nIm not sure where you get your ideas about human nature and the ability of man to self govern but there are places all over the world that have little to no interference by government and for the most part they are the places that are exploited highly by corporations and are the places that have the highest levels of poverty and violence.   Humans are animals, we do not naturally behave on our own.  We never have and never will.  We do however for social structures that we care about, those structures are reasonable ways to manage our behavior for the betterment of everyone.  They always have been and it includes family or pairing but can be as large as government.\n\nYour arguments are interesting but ultimately very blind to the reality of human psychology, sociology and most importantly in todays terms economics, but thats a whole other ball of wax.

{"body": "We 'met' back in 2004. She used to read and comment on my blog, which led to me reading and commenting on hers. We then graduated to emails, IM, long, frequent phone conversations, and finally deciding it was time to meet. The only problem? I was in London, England, she was in Orange County, California.\n\nIn November of 2004, I flew out to meet her in person for the first time. I'd never even been to the States before. It was amazing. She was amazing. We had such an awesome week together that we both cried when it was time for me to go home, not knowing when we'd see each other again.\n\nIn January, she flew out to England. I proposed, she accepted. In April, we drove from LA to Vegas (and I checked 'Fear And Loathing road trip' off my bucket list), where we were married.\n\nThe next year was a tough one. I had to stay in England while I went through the visa application process. We saw each other several times, but not being able to be with my new wife or start my new life drove me crazy. Dealing with the USCIS was a nightmare, and the trail of paperwork and interviews felt as though it was never going to end.\n\nI stuck it out, though. We stuck it out. In February of 2006, I got my visa. Walking out of the American Embassy that day, I remember looking around at the city I'd grown up in, the city I was about to leave behind for good. I loved my wife so damn much, and I couldn't wait for my American adventure to begin.\n\nIt was a new life. I was in awe of the woman I'd married and in awe of the country I'd moved to. Sometimes I'd stop what I was doing and just think about where I was and who I was with and I'd feel like the luckiest motherfucker alive.\n\nDomestica set in. We both did well at our jobs, moving onward and upward and improving our home situation. In 2008, we bought a house. In 2010, we renewed our wedding vows on Maui with her family (who hadn't been able to be there for the original quickie ceremony) present. My wife was beautiful that day. She'd always wanted to be a proper bride, and she deserved to be. It was like being back in Vegas again, that same feeling that I'd rolled the dice with no idea what I was doing and somehow won it all.\n\nIn December of that same year, she discovered she was pregnant, and on the last day of August, 2011, gave birth to a baby boy. I cut the cord. When they moved him to the incubator to weigh and measure him, I stood beside it and marveled at this tiny creature we had created. I reached for his hand and he grabbed my little finger. I was overwhelmed. My wife's mother took a picture of that moment, and I can't even look it at without tearing up.\n\n2012 was the year things started to go wrong. The house had been a bad idea, and affording it was beginning to stress us both out. My career took a downturn when I took a job that turned out to be a whole lot different than I'd been promised, and ended up doing something I hated for less money than I needed. After six months of this, we decided that I should quit and be a stay-at-home dad to save money on childcare costs. In addition to that, I took a bartending job in the evenings so that I was contributing.\n\nBut the money was an issue. Not long after this arrangement began, my wife confessed to me that after I'd left the terrible job, she'd started saving money in a second account, in case I didn't find anything else. She'd given herself the option of taking our son and leaving me if things got too bad.\n\nI was stunned. It was the sheer *practicality* of it. My mind flashed back to who we were when we met, when we were in Vegas, when we were finally able to live together. I started to realize that the girl I'd married had grown and changed in ways I'd been blind to.\n\nStill, we hung on. We managed to sell the house and escape Orange County in July of this year, moving to Oregon, just a little south of Portland. She was able to transfer and I found a half-decent job. Our little boy, no longer an infant, was developing quite the personality.\n\nThen I came home one night and she said she wanted to talk to me, that we should spend some time apart. I understood the reasons. The last few years, with the house and baby and job situations, had been emotionally draining. We'd grown apart and started having petty arguments that were never there before. We both thought some time apart would help. I agreed to move out.\n\nHaving written all this, I'm half-tempted to end with a 'tree fiddy', but fuck it, here's the truth. I suspected she was being unfaithful. We were living apart on a trial basis and we still saw plenty of each other because of our son. We even went on dates. But I noticed an obvious change in her behavior and the way she suddenly started taking more care over her appearance and going out with friends from work.\n\nThe night my marriage ended, she asked if I could come over and watch our son for a few hours while she went to see a movie. I agreed. The little guy and I hung out for a while, and then I took him upstairs and rocked him to sleep. I sing him these bluesy, lullaby versions of Johnny Cash songs and he does this sleepy grin that just about stops my heart. That night, it was Folsom Prison Blues.\n\nMy wife came home a little while later, complaining that she felt sick and just wanted to go to bed. I left.\n\nBut I didn't go home. I drove to the adjacent street and I sat in my car and I waited. Sure enough, a car I'd never seen before drove in to the cul-de-sac where we lived and parked. I pulled my hood up over my head and crept up to the end of my street in time to see a man I didn't know going into my house.\n\nI don't have the words to describe the next hour of my life. My first instinct was murderous. I had a key. Walk in there, drag that motherfucker out into the street, and beat the mortal shit out of him. My wife, in my house, while my son slept in the room next door.\n\nMy son.\n\nThat stopped me dead in my tracks. His sleepy grin. Folsom Prison Blues. I couldn't do it. I couldn't bring the violence that was in my heart to a place where he was innocently sleeping. Being a dad means a lot of things, and one of them is protecting your kid, always.\n\nI did laps of the block, clenching and unclenching my fists, muttering to myself like a crazy person. Finally, I talked myself down and I went home, where I sat and stared at nothing at all until the next morning, when I called her and said I wanted a divorce.\n\nWe're building something else now. We're parents. Not quite friends, but we're civil. I'm renting a shitty room in suburbia, but I'm going to get my own place in Portland once the divorce is final. I like the city a lot, and I think I'd stay even if being a dad wasn't keeping me here.\n\nAnd my boy...you should see him. All he has to do is smile, and it was all worth it. Every minute.\n\nHope that answers your question.\n\nEdit: I wrote that in one cathartic session. I accidentally some words.\n\nEdit 2: When I started writing this in a post that was already 2 hours old and had 200+ comments in it, I didn't expect the story to get as long as it did. I certainly didn't expect this response. I've been at work all day, tracking the comments on my phone. It's a little overwhelming.

It's just a matter of getting people to talk about it.\n\nDriving though the Navajo reservation, no one would know the vast tribal land is thought by cryptozoologists to be home to so many outlandish species.\n\n\"Navajo stories go way back, for years,\" said Leonard Dan, a self-proclaimed cryptozoologist, someone who studies animals thought to be extinct.\n\n\"There have been sightings of Pegasus, and of Griffins,\" Dan said, referring to two creatures thought by most to come from Greek mythology.\n\nRecently, an unusual number of people on the reservation also have spotted Centaurs, another animal of Greek mythology that is human on top and equine on the bottom.\n\n\"I had more reports of Centaurs than Bigfoot this spring,\" said J.C. Johnson,\nAdvertisement\nDan's partner and fellow self-proclaimed cryptozoologist.\n\nMany people, however, fear talking about what they see because of the traditional taboos that surround many creatures.\n\nJust as many common animals have meaning in Navajo spirituality, so too do some of the atypical ones, Johnson said.\n\nSome believe that people who see Bigfoot will die a year later. People who see a miniature Tyrannosaurus Rex, also believed by some to be alive on the reservation, might turn to stone.\n\nEven those who don't believe in such superstitions struggle to bring up the topic.\n\nBrenda Harris, also of Upper Fruitland, said it took her a while to talk about her sightings of a pterodactyl, a winged Jurassic dinosaur, in the late 1990s because she was wary of the humiliation.\n\nAfter talking about it, though, she found many of her neighbors had similar experiences.\n\n\"A lot of people are opening up,\" she said.\n\nSo many people have opened up that members of the national media have zeroed in on many of the strange events that have occurred on the reservation.\n\nNational Geographic's show \"Navajo Cops\" featured an episode in which the police tried tracking the Newcomb \"Howler,\" thought perhaps to be a lonely Bigfoot or a skinwalker, an evil Navajo witch that changes form.\n\nStill, not all law enforcement officials are responsive when reports involve sightings of weird creatures, according to the people that have called on the police to investigate sightings.\n\n\"Different folks, different strokes,\" said one Navajo police criminal investigator from Shiprock. He did not want to be named.\n\n\"As far as looking for the Loch Ness monster in the San Juan River, we're not going to do that,\" he said, adding that he respected people's beliefs but did not often have time to entertain them.\n\nWhile some residents have grown used to the idea of the bizarre assortment of species on the reservation, others truly fear certain types.\n\nJust recently, one Upper Fruitland family spotted a red-eyed, three-clawed, winged creature comparable to the demonic being in the 2001 American horror film \"Jeepers Creepers.\" The family named it the \"Night Stalker.\"\n\nIt has left claw marks on their home, on their car, and even has managed to scratch their daughter during her sleep.\n\nJohnson has made it his mission to document these cases, especially when law enforcement fails to note them.\n\nAs Johnson and Dan walk near the river with a few of the Upper Fruitland residents that have seen some of the odd species that the two local cryptozoologists are so interested in, Johnson picks up the watermelon on the ground.\n\nJohnson looks at it, places his hand around it as he imagines Bigfoot might have and inspects some of the markings, which look like they are from some kind of animal.\n\n\"This might have been Squatchie,\" says Johnson.\n\nStill, he says, it may not have been. No track marks. No broken branches.\n\n\"I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything,\" Johnson says, noting that it is important not to have an agenda when pursuing evidence of the unknown.\n\n\"It's just the truth,\" says Harris.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355280556", "subreddit": "Navajo", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

There just wouldn't have been any point, you know?\n\nSo I knocked a few things of my bucket list - hired a hooker, spent a week in Spain - and I got ready to kill myself.  I decided I'd jump off a bridge - it was just simplest.  So I got up there, I looked at the water beneath, and contemplated life, mortality, and the total insignificance of any organism.\n\nThen I jumped.  I figured later the fall must have taken only a few seconds, but it felt longer.  It was actually kind of a cool feeling. freefall, though I was terrified out of my mind.  I hit the water, and it was like concrete, and I lost consciousness.  Next thing I know, I'm on the shore, coughing up water, half my bones broken and in agonizing pain.  System rebooting.\n\nThere's someone nearby, my rescuer.  I can't move to look at him, I just hear him moving.  My jaw was somehow in pretty good shape; after I cough up water I thank him, and say \"How can I ever repay you.\"\n\nHe moves into my field of view, and though my vision is blurry I can tell something is off.  He says \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nMy vision begin to clear, and its about that time that I realize he's a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

We'd gotten back in touch after connecting on facebook, and I was happy to re-establish our friendship, but hadn't seen in him person (he lives in Boston, me in WA state). So I was happy to be invited to his second wedding, which was fairly big for a second wedding (I thought)--maybe 120 people there. \n\nThe wedding was in the Old North Church in Boston, which was pretty cool, and my friend and his new wife were dressed in period costumes (he was a history major in college). People seemed to be in the spirit of the day, a beautiful June day. The minister proceeded throught he ceremony to the point at which she asked for objections. At that point there was a shuffling noise towards the back, and someone said \"Well...\". Everyone turns around, and sure enough, it's his ex. She's looking quite upset. She's got a kid with her, about 9 years old, and it strikes me that something not good was about to happen. And who is the kid? My friend's son? He never mentioned. Anyway, the ex is clearly upset. But what was really surprising was the reaction of my friend. From the alter, he said loudly \"What do YOU want?\" Dead silence in the church. Then his ex said \"I need about tree-fiddy.\" It was then that I realized that my friend's ex was an 8-story creature from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "I had met this girl online and we had a lot in common, we started to share our feelings for each other over IM and through e-mails.  For nearly two years we talked online, then I find out she has family in Washington state (where I was living at the time).  So she tells me one day that her aunt is very ill and is going to be flying out to Seattle to help take care of her and would like to meet me.  I agree and we set up a time and place to meet out in Everett (just north of Seattle).  \n\nSo, the day comes when we are supposed to meet and I drive about 2 hours north just barely missing the morning rush hour traffic and making pretty good time.  I get into the northern part of the city and along highway 99 (hwy 1 and 101 for those of you in California) there is a smallish bistro where we decided to get together for lunch.  We really hit it off, but I notice that she's a lot bigger than she seemed to be in her pictures and on web cam, but I'm not a shallow person so this doesn't really bother me.  I find her enchanting and sweet, in fact to this day she's the nicest person I've ever met.  We had a lot in common, both of us really liked playing video games, we enjoyed the same shows, had the same sarcastic type of humor, liked the same books, everything.  She seemed perfect, like it was too good to be true.  Finally, the meal is over and we part ways, but she informs me that she'll be out in Washington for the next three months during the end of her aunt's life to help take care of the final arrangements and that she would like to get together with me again.  We make a date to go out to some bars in Seattle the following Saturday and part ways.\n\nI go home, excited that I found the woman who seemed perfect for me at the time.  The next week and a half pass and we meet at a parking lot near 3rd and Cherry in Seattle (the downtown area near Pike's Place Market) and go to a small hole in the wall type of bar.  We get pretty drunk and decide that instead of trying to drive home we'd get a cab and split a hotel room.  We get back to the hotel room and nothing really happens, no sexy time or anything, since we had just met, but instead we stayed up watching some crappy kung-fu movie from the 80's before passing out.  The next morning we went to get our cars, had a breakfast at Denny's and I spent the day taking her around Seattle showing her all the typical touristy stuff like the Space Needle, the EMP, Pike's Place, the first Starbucks, the Smith Tower, all that.  As night approached we decided to get together again and we went our separate ways.\n\nIt went on like this for the next two months where we'd have a date, have a great time, then go to our respective homes.  So, as the end of her stay approached she informed me that she had been offered a job and was planning on moving out to Washington.  I was ecstatic about having her close by.  So, her brother and father pack her things for her and move them out in a C-Van, her father worked for Penske and had a class A CDL, he got the truck from his work and drove it to the location in Everett near the train station.  \n\nAfter another 6 months and her aunt's passing we decide that it was time to move in together.  For the next year and a half we lived together, we both made the other happy and really enjoyed our new lives together, so I go and buy the biggest ring I could afford for her, take her to the bistro in north Everett where we first met face to face and popped the question.  She agreed to marry me and we began preparations.   Another 8 months down the road we're standing at the altar when the priest asks, if anyone has any objections speak now or forever hold your peace.  My best friend from high school stands up and says, \"Ok, am I the one who has to say it?\"\n\nI turn around and shoot him a look of both anger and confusion wondering why he would speak up, because to be honest they seemed to get along so well.  Then he told everyone there the secret that she had been hiding all this time.  I turned to look at her and asked her why she would do this to me, what she hoped to gain from leading me on all this time and her reply was simply, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it was about this time that I realized my future wife was a 30 story tall creature from the paleolithic era.

That does not equal God.\n\nBecause you are incapable or unwilling to understand that something might have happened without God, you assume that it must have been God. And *your* God, to boot. Out of the many Gods created by humankind, how do you know that Zeus did not create the cosmos? How do you know that your God is the one true God and all other gods are invented nonsense?\n\nIdeas are not real objects. They exist in the understanding only. Ideas cannot create matter. Ideas cannot affect the material world. We are physical creatures with ideas, and we can use those ideas to guide our actions, but it is us affecting the world, not the idea itself.\n\n&gt;I just cannot come to a logical conclusion without some sort of being capable of breaking the rules of the universe.\n\nSo you only believe because you're incapable of believing anything else?\n\nI'm pretty sure rising from the dead, walking on water and healing the blind all break the rules of the universe.\n\nThere's something called the \"burden of proof\". The burden of proof states that when someone makes a claim (\"The sky is blue!\"), they must back it up with evidence, otherwise nobody has any reason to listen to them. Imagine you had lived in a cave your whole life and had never seen the sky. If I told you it was blue, what reason would you have to believe me? I would need to provide evidence. Remember that the question is not \"Why don't you believe in God?\" but instead \"Why *do* you believe in God?\" I don't go around asking people why they don't believe that I can fly. If I asked you that, you would probably say, \"Prove it!\" and so I'd have to if I wanted you to believe me.\n\nThat's the point of the burden of proof - you make the claim - God exists. I am not claiming that God does not exist - I'm just saying that there isn't a reason to believe because no evidence has been brought forth. A verdict of not guilty is much different from a verdict of guilty.\n\nSo, anyways, the claim is made that God exists. Well, that's great, but why should I believe that? What evidence is there for God's existence? If none, then why believe?\n\nWhat if I told you that the Loch Ness Monster was real, and furthermore, (s)he had a brother named Carl who was red and evil and fond of tigers? What if I then provided no evidence; I just asked you to accept it on faith?\n\nThis is why I do not believe.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355372001", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

They kind of rocked, as you'd expect from any pantheon whose gods had alternative names such as \"Lord of the Hanged\" or \"Gore Master.\" They hung out in forests and on mountains, wailing out awesome guitar solos against backdrops of lightning and dragons and shit. But as awesome as they were, they needed somewhere to live, somewhere to let buddies stay when they stopped over, somewhere to store their Bon Jovi CDs.\n\nNow the gods didn't have any money with which to buy homes, as the concept of money didn't exist yet, nor did homes, so they went to an  independent contractor who also happened to be a giant. Problem was, builders were complete cowboys back then, and giants were the worst. I mean, the gods generally hated giants, and Thor in particular went all HULK SMASH on sight, but he was off performing sweet drum solos on the skulls of his enemies with a hammer far away at the time, and nobody else seemed capable of noticing he was a giant, so the gods heard out this builder. His initial quote was as overblown as they are today, and to build the gods a mighty home with a vast wall around it, he asked for the Sun, the Moon, and the smoking hot badass goddess-of-love-and-death Freyja. Yeah, you thought you got overcharged having that boiler fitted.\n\nThe gods convene. They scrum down like they're about to make a football play, with Odin stating the obvious: \"Not happening.\" Unfortunately, Loki was present, and Loki is An Asshole™. He has an idea. \"We let him do it on the proviso that he finishes it within three seasons and with the help of no man nor giant.\"\n\nMost builders can't even finish the guttering on my house in that time, let alone building the HOME OF THE GODS, so they figure why not? Convinced, they agree on terms &amp; conditions, give the builder a handshake, and he returns the next day to start work.\n\nHe returns with a horse.\n\nNot just any horse, my friends. THE horse. Svadilfari, a horse the size of a juggernaut, a horse you DO NOT FUCK WITH.\n\nThe gods see this, and collectively realise they are screwed when it begins hauling truly massive boulders around for the builder, letting him get his Minecraft on at full tilt. A job that should have taken him a decade may, incredibly, get completed inside of nine months, provided no creepers attack. Panic ensues. The Sun, the Moon, and the smoking hot badass goddess-of-love-and-death Freyja are not really things they can do without. Three days before the deadline is about to be reached, it's clear the builder is going to finish in time.\n\nA plan is hatched. It's a good plan, summed up best as \"blame Loki.\" Satisfied that this is foolproof, the gods let Loki slink off. But wait! What's this? Another horse??!? Loki, you see, is a shapeshifter. Somehow motivated by the gods declaring they'll put Loki to a horrible, torturous death if the builder actually finishes on time, he finds the motivation to do something about it, running off to shift his form into that of a female horse. Not a pony. We do not need Loki MLP fanfic at this point. No, just no.\n\nSo Loki trots off to to where the builder is working, and waves his sweet mare tush at Svadilfari, who is as horny as an overworked stallion, due to being an overworked stallion. He gives chase as Loki runs off into the forest, some bow-chikka-wow-wow plays, and instead of getting rocks onto the build site, Svadilfari gets his rocks off inside Loki. The builder, without his horse, suddenly finds himself with no hope of completing the build on time. Loki, whose shapeshifting is apparently VERY anatomically correct, gets pregnant. Furries across the world rejoice as transgender mpreg bestiality is invented. The gods just rejoice that they have a bitchin' new home built for free.\n\nIt's about that time that Thor returned, and noticed the builder was asking for tree fiddy as recompense for his time. Thor instantly saw through this clever ploy and recognised him for a giant, grabbed his hammer, declared any contract null and void as it had been made not with a man but a giant, played out the better part of the sweet Rush tune YYZ on the giant's head and scrotum with Mjolnir, grabbed a beer and went to kick back in this asskicking new pad they dubbed Asgard.\n\nSome time later, Loki finally spreads his legs and drops a lot of weight. Of course, when a horse the size of an elephant gets it on with a transformed god, the kid isn't going to be some weedy little foal with shaky legs that can barely stand up, hell no. The horse he gives birth to is SLEIPNIR, an equine asskicker with eight legs to enable TWICE the asskicking of your common or garden horse. It is declared the horse to end all horses, and Loki gives the ultrahorse to Odin to make up for being a supreme dickbiter over the whole building-of-Asgard episode. Odin mounts this monster truck of a horse, pops a wheelie, and makes some sweet jumps over the walls of Asgard, before sitting down for the evening to figure out how in the hel he's going to afford his new horseshoe budget.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355407241", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

His best friends, Jane and Gerry, decided to take him on a trip because he was working hard to provide for his family. Asking his wife if this was okay she said yes, and with an affectionate kiss goodbye he left for his trip to California. The trip was fantastic. John, Jane, and Gerry all had a great time, but the whole trip all John could think about was his wife and children. This was the furthest he had ever been away from them. Concerned about his family and extremely home sick he asked Jane and Gerry if they could cut the trip short so he could get back to his family. They both exchanged uncertain glances, but finally told him that everything wasn't what it seemed and they were just trying to save him from his family. Not believing them, John made the first available flight back to New York. When he got back he made his way home as quickly as possible. When he got there he was overjoyed to see his family again. His wife asked how his trip was and he told her about what Jane and Gerry said. She laughed and told him that they were a little strange. The next day John went back to work. When he got home he saw Jane and Gerry. He told them that nothing bad happened and they just shook their head. They seemed distant, but John just shook it off as them being upset that he cut the trip short. He entered his house to see that all of furniture was gone. The only thing left was his family's clothes in the closet. He tried to run out, but was stopped by Jane and Gerry in the entryway. He asked them what had happened, but they just slowly shook their heads. They told him that not everything was as it seemed; they had warned him they said. Stupefied he asked if they could help him get his things back. They said sure but that they would only help for a reward. John asked how much money would it take for them to help him.

{"body": "Hi there, similar thing happened when I was in high school. In love with best friend, she had boyfriend. For 2 years she knew how I felt and said she loved me too but couldn't leave him. We went on dates together, had movie nights at my place with cuddling and such, took long drives in the car talking about our future together. Every time I began to doubt it would ever happen she would tell me she had a dream we were married and she wishes for that to happen or she would write me a love note until I had dozens (which I still have around here somewhere) we worked right across the street from each other after we graduated I started at 5 AM she started at 7 AM so I would always take my break at 6:50 so I could see her or if I missed her that day I would leave a note on her car. It was very confusing for me. Here I am a guy in the school band (which while not as nerdy as stereotypical, is not \"cool\") she was a solid 9.5/10 also in band with me (how we met) and her boyfriend is a varsity football player. Never would I have thought I would have had a chance. But there we were. After almost 3 years of sneaking around with this girl telling me she is crazy for me, another girl tells me that the boyfriend has been bragging to her how many times he banged his girlfriend. That was when I died.\nShe told me they never even touch anymore and she can't leave him because her dad was abusive and mean to her and he is the only constant she has to hold on to, but she doesn't even like him.\nWhen I heard they were pretty active in great detail. It felt like I was the one being cheated on. I confronted her about it and she flipped. I just couldn't even function for a while after that. Ended up deleting everything about this girl from my life and quit cold turkey. Didn't think about her for years after. Then recently saw her again. Caught up with her (she was single at the time but I'm don't with it all) and re friended her on facebook. Long story short. If she is not single, she is taken. If you keep it that simple you will save yourself a lot of heart ache and a best friend. You can try and convince yourself this is an exception like I did but it cost me 3 years of no love life in the best possible dating time except college. And it cost me 5 years of no best friend. Just wait and wait. If they break up, hey, go for it. If not, hey you dodged a bullet.\nGood luck man.\nTL;DR and that's how I got the Loch Ness monster to stop asking for $3.50.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355685044", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, it seems to me that you've built yourself quite the house of cards.\n\nIt has not been demonstrated in any way that there's a supernatural. At all. Like, in any way. There's absolutely zero reason to believe that there is anything beyond the natural world. And plenty to believe there is not.\n\nThe notion of an \"afterlife\" is not in any way established. The existence of a \"soul\" merits little or no discussion.\n\nThere is further not any particular reason to believe that there is any conscious will that resides in that supernatural \"realm\".\n\nAdditionally, there is no reason to believe that any will would be all-powerful, and fill any definition to qualify as a \"god\".\n\nFurther, there is no basis to assume that any god found there would be Jehovah, Yahweh, the God of Abraham, etc.\n\nContinuing, there is no reason to conclude that he had a son, and sent him down to Earth.\n\nFinally, there is nothing to suggest that there is a hell of any kind.\n\nSo if you will excuse me, it seems that discussion of the details of this particular hell seem oddly like arguing about the toenails of the Loch Ness Monster.\n\nStill, even if the point is conceded, and the discussion is done purely from an academic point of view...\n\nDiscussions of Hell and the afterlife are extremely difficult. Hell is a hybrid concept, built up by thousands of years of mistranslation, agendas, and general misconception.\n\nThe popularised notion of Hell is one drawn largely from two sources - Dante Alighieri's epic poem the Divine Comedy written around 1315, but more widely published 100 years later, and the painting that is now known as The Garden of Earthly Delights, by Heironymus Bosch, finished around 1500.\n\nThese images and impressions of Hell date back as far as the Apocalypse of Peter, an early Christian text from the second century.\n\nBut whether the bible itself has a basis for \"Hell\" is debatable.\n\nMany places in the bible the concept \"Hell\" could well be referencing something else. Specifically the word sheol has been translated to hell, but more accurately refers to \"the grave\" or death itself. It's more of a neutral \"underworld\" than the eternal punishment. \n\nWhen Jesus died he kicked down the doors of death. Rather than some sort of fiery torture pit. If Jesus is taken as the path to eternal life, many verses and references fit neatly with the notion that Jesus offers an alternative to death itself, rather than \"hell\". \n\nAnother term is \"Gehenna\". Gehenna is a specific location, a valley outside Jerusalem. It has (biblically, anyway) a savage history, including human sacrifices by followers of dark gods such as Baal and Moloch.\n\nWhether there was a real place and where exactly it is... hard to tell. But by Jesus' time it had become a place of Jewish folklore. A pit of fire where corpses and rubbish were burned and destroyed. An evil place to scourge the soul and destroy the body.\n\nThis place is what we associate with the \"Lake of Fire\" referenced in Revelations and elsewhere.\n\nRegardless... It seems pretty clear to me that Hell is not a real place. It's a mix of Jewish Folklore and influential medieval art, combined with moralism and fear mongering. A pure and needless superstition.\n\nOf course, I think the same of God and Heaven, so...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355754588", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Witnesses are so unreliable that even in our imperfect legal system you cannot convict somebody on eye witness testimony alone. Even if someone, or multiple people, claim that they witnessed the defendant committing the crime that is not enough for conviction, for good reason.\n\n&gt;positivism, the very idea that everything can be scientifically proven, cannot be scientifically proven.\n\nFirst of all, NOTHING can be scientifically proven... you claim you are a scientist and make this fundamental mistake? I'm going to have to call bullshit until I see some evidence of your claims, and even then you should learn a bit about the philosophy of science and epistemology if you think that anything can actually be proven.\n\nSecond, this argument is sophistry. If something exists in any meaningful way then it interacts with reality. If something interacts with reality then it is subject to investigation by the scientific method.\n\n&gt;What would a scientific proof of God look like?\n\nGod makes many claims in the bible, and all of them are subject to scientific inquiry, and none of them have passed the test. Conveniently, god also tells you not to test him... doesn't that seem a bit too convenient to you as a \"trained scientist\"?\n\n&gt;If a million people all saw a teapot in the sky, if people from across the world, no matter how remote, all understood that there was cookware orbiting above the world--well, it might not be enough to get me to believe, but I wouldn't actually begrudge it either.\n\nYou're not a scientist, or you are the worst one I have ever spoken with.\n\nEvery single person in the world once thought that the world was flat.

{"body": "&gt;I meant evidence of your assertion that you are a \"trained scientist\"... \n\nWhat evidence do you even want?   You are not getting anything else personal.\n\n&gt;Witness evidence is anecdotal, it is the WEAKEST form of evidence.\n\nWhat is the second weakest form, if you don't mind my asking?   \n\n In any case, you can never look at billions of witnesses and say \"there's *no* evidence!\"\n\n&gt;First of all, NOTHING can be scientifically proven... you claim you are a scientist and make this fundamental mistake? \n\nProof is a loaded term with a lot of mathematical connotations, but in the colloquial sense (ie synonymous with 'sufficient evidence to argue it is the truth'), yes, it can be 'scientifically proven'.   If you want to say that the Hershey+Chase experiment helped to prove DNA as the genetic material you won't get a single raised eyebrow.\n\n&gt;If something exists in any meaningful way then it interacts with reality.  If something interacts with reality then it is subject to investigation by the scientific method.\n\nOnly if it 'interacts with reality' in some systematic manner.   Again, I could not scientifically show evidence that I wrote this post, either.  All I have is my own witness, much less than that of God.  \n\n&gt;God makes many claims in the bible, and all of them are subject to scientific inquiry, and none of them have passed the test. \n\nReally?  I call bs on this one in particular.   They aren't *all* subject to scientific inquiry, the most I have ever seen is some botching of Jesus' statements on prayer.\n\n&gt;You're not a scientist, or you are the worst one I have ever spoken with.\n\nI promise you that I am.  I have to even wonder how many scientists you have spoken with.\n\n&gt;Every single person in the world once thought that the world was flat. \n\nThis is wrong.  So, so wrong.\n\n&gt;Millions of people believed in Zeus, Thor, Aphrodite, Amun, Anubis, on and on and on... \n\nSure, but that goes back to my original point, doesn't it?\n\n&gt;Millions of people see UFO's, \n\nYep.  UFO just means 'unidentified flying object'.\n\n&gt;thousands of people see big foot and the loch ness monster... \n\nI don't know if I'd say thousands, but again, its worth looking into--to see if they really did see some new animal or they misidentified another animal.  Though this one in particular doesn't permeate the most remote cultures, in the same way that theism does.\n\n&gt;What people think is real is MEANINGLESS, that is why science exists, to INVESTIGATE these claims and to learn the truth, because what most people think is almost always wrong. \n\nNo, it is very meaningful and serves as an excellent starting point in which we can use scientific tools to better understand these claims. If a million people see bigfoot in some given area--I want to know more.  Was it a real bipedal ape-like creature?  Is it some animal they mistake for a bigfoot, such as a mangey bear (which has been found to be the case)?  A really hairy dude?  Mass halucination?  Its meaningful eiher way.\n\nAlso, again, there is no evidence of positivism either.  \n\n&gt;I weep for the piss poor state of our scientific education in this country... someone getting a graduate degree in a physical science should understand basic epistemology and the philosophy of science and not make the mistake of thinking that anything can be proven...\n\nAhahahaha, yeah...its not that *you* have been brainwashed by one too many atheist youtube videos about the nature of science, I just must be a faker.\n\nThough no, I will admit that I don't know of any PhD program in my field which requires a course on 'the philosophy of science' (we were required to attend seminars on general research ethics) and looking around it seems more of a staple of philosophy programs than science programs.  Wikipedia has this cute quote,  I guess:\n\n&gt;Philosophy of science has historically been met with mixed response from the scientific community. Though scientists often contribute to the field, many prominent scientists have felt that the practical effect on their work is limited; a popular quote attributed to physicist Richard Feynman goes, \"Philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.\" \n\nIn either case, I can design experiments and produce results and get published (not to mention getting grant $$), so yeah.  'Trained scientist'.  It seems as though some philosophers agree with you (if I am understanding your points correctly--wrt scientific results being seen as truth, and of course there is the infamous school of positivism which naturally excludes God) and some of them don't--philosophy isn't really an exact science, after all.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355780009", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You know, people always joke that it only happens in pornos, but I had a similar experience when I delivered pizza.\n\nThere was this girl that ordered in at least once a week. I honestly don't know how she kept her body the way she did, with the amount of pizza she ordered. Anyways, we got to know each other pretty well. We only ever talked for a few minutes at a time, but she was tall, funny-- one of the best parts of that job. I usually flirted with her a little, waiting for the debit machine, and she'd always leave a great tip.\n\nAnyways, this one time, she seemed a little tipsy-- moving around, very chatty, standing close, just taking up all kinds of space. She asked me a few questions about how my love life was going (it wasn't), but I didn't think much of it.\n\nThe next time I was called over there, she answers the door completely naked. \n\nShe wasn't pulling any punches, either. She beckoned me in (we usually talked at the door), and motioned for me to set the pizza down on the table. It was a studio apartment, so the kitchen and bedroom were pretty much the same space. She sat down on the bed, crossed her legs and asked me how much it was going to be. Actually, I think her exact words were \"what do I need to give you?\"\n\nI stammered out that it would fifteen dollars. She handed me a twenty (I'm still not sure where she got it from), and just stared at me. I wasn't sure what to do and I couldn't stand the silence. Finally, I just asked:\n\n\"Would you like any change?\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes at me. \n\nThen she said \"Sure. How about tree fitty?\"\n\nAt that point I noticed that she was about 500 feel tall and from the paleolithic era.\n\nI pretty much got right out of there. God damned undertipping Loch Ness Monster.

{"body": "When I was nineteen I worked a job painting homes one summer. It wasn't one of those college pro scams, where no experience is necessary and you buy your own paint and all that, it was a company with a lot of contracts and a lot of experienced painters. Anyway, my dad knew one of the owners, and that's the only reason I was able to get a gig there. \n\nWhen I first started out I got trained by Jason, a short haired guy in his late 20s, who didn't take much pride in his work. He told me openly that he was looking for better gigs, and instead of training me properly, would let me mess up, and then do small patch jobs with a \"good enough\" sort of attitude.\n\nSoon enough I became a better painter, but my attitude began to match Jason's. We fudged the hours to make it seem like we were putting in longer days, stretched the lunch break, and would skip the extra coat of paint on some of the shittier parts of the house. Meanwhile, even though the pay wasn't all that great, I was liking the job more and more. I had finally found a job where I could put in easy days and never had a boss on my case. I could even blaze in the mornings and it was never an issue.\n\nAnyway, sooner or later I was reassigned to work with a new partner, an old Russian guy with a thick accent. I can't even recall the guy's name, but I'll never forget his face. He looked a lot like Mr. Kruger, one of George's bosses from Seinfeld. Anyway Krugs (let's call him Krugs) was a quiet guy, but in the first week we were together he showed me how to paint, and he taught me how to work. I was a pretty impressionable guy - still am, truth be told - and I often feed off the energy of those around me. With Jason I would slack off, but with Krugs, I couldn't help but want to keep up with his steady, methodical work ethic. \n\nTime passed, and Krugs and I would talk more. Turns out he was born in Russia during the Cold War, and when he turned 18 he was drafted into the army. At age 18, he had to sign a declaration that he was willing to die for soviet russia. Then he and his batch of fresh recruits were put in helicopters and each dropped at undisclosed locations in the Serbian bush. They were given their co-ordinates, a compass, 3 day's food and water, and a rifle with 180 bullets. They each had 10 days to make it the 200-300km back to camp. Of the 12 teenagers in Krugs' group, only 10 made it back to camp.\n\nKrugs had other equally crazy stories. And if anyone else had told them that's all they would have seemed to me - crazy stories. But something about the way he told them, steady and methodical, not trying to rush through things, just like he painted, I could tell he was the real deal. Near the end of the summer he brought his old illegal \"yearbook\" from his first year in the army. Krugs non-challantly pointed his friends out to him, those that had died, those that hadn't. \n\nIn the end, Krugs openly told me what he was making, and it was only a couple bucks more than I was. He had a wife, and kids too. He wasn't complaining though, he said he loved the freedom of being a painter, and being allowed to take a rest and eat an apple whenever he wanted to. I guess that's what I loved about that job too. But I had still been looking at it twisted. For me I was only thinking about how some other folks I knew were making much better cash for what I imagined couldn't be any more difficult work. I wasn't thinking of how I could be conscripted someplace, and forced to fight for some politics I'm too young to even understand. \n\nAnyway, this has been a long story and if you're waiting for comedic payoff, you're not going to find one. There's no loch ness monster asking for $3.50. Just a story of an old Russian who's name I can't remember, and how he taught me the meaning of work ethic, and how to appreciate the opportunities I had been given.

{"body": "&gt;This seems like generalizing to me, and from history you would know that men and women who defied the status quo\n\nYeah, people can go against the status quo and be right, or be wrong. The poster is completely correct in saying that simply going against the mainstream isn't in any way evidence of the truth of the claim. You know what Galileo and Copernicus had? Evidence. Not just testimony that a dream they had was totally real.\n\n&gt;There are many studies that were done on NDEs and there are scientific reports out there, even published in very respectable journals such as The Lancet. \n\nThat's because NDE's are real. No one is disputing that. What's not real, is claims that the visions experienced reflect some supernatural realm, or provide evidence not explainable through the ordinary (if still remarkable) functions of the brain.

Totally unconfirmed accounts of witness testimony exist for any fiction you care to imagine, including Harry Potter and a living Elvis.\n\n&gt;One simple fact, that was not mentioned by Dr. Alexander personally but other NDErs experienced, was the ability to recall what happens within their vicinity and beyond it during clinical death. How is it so?\n\nBecause in every case, they either describe what they could have heard or deduced, or what they could have been told. Despite many test, no one has ever been able to observe something otherwise undetectable in OBE conditions.\n\n&gt;This specific point is usually left out by scientists who try to debunk NDEs.\n\nFor the same reason accounts of the Loch Ness Monster are left out. Because it's not evidence when everything rests on trusting the truth or reliability of a person, but ignoring similar evidence from Scientologists that Lord Xenu is real and has placed tortured alien souls within us all.\n\n&gt;This is a subjective comment and I will ignore it.\n\nNope. You're ignoring it because it doesn't fit with what you'd rather be true. The facts that the guy claimed to be a passive Christian, followed by investigation showing he is a devout affirmed believer in the heart of the creationist Bible Belt, and the fact that he swears it's confirmed he had the dream while his delta waves didn't happen, when he's got no basis at all for asserting that other than \"I'm a doctor, trust my subjective and easily countered memory which I'm not lying about for money\", proves him an unscrupulous liar. Because even if he believes it, he knows he's got no basis for his claim that it's confirmed.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356029611", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My wife is Japanese and we had our daughter in a Japanese women's clinic. On the day she went into labor, I called out sick for work because I just didn't feel like going in that day. Her water broke a few hours later. So, I drive her over to the clinic around 12pm and the doctor said she won't have the baby until later that evening. My wife tells me to go grab some lunch. While I'm at lunch I get a phone call from her to hurry up and get back, that she is having the baby now. The doctor had given her a shot that we think sped up the dilation or something. Well, I get there and go up to the delivery room area. Now, in Japan it is not the custom for the father to be in the room during delivery, but the doctor knew I wanted to be there. So I go up to the nurses station and ask her where my wife is. She tells me to wait and I assume she is going to come out and escort me to the delivery room. After a minute of waiting, and listening to a couple of women screaming in labor, I go and ask again.  Again she tells me to wait, where I then inform her that I am done with waiting and I am going in. She comes out from behind her window and intercepts me at the door to the delivery room asking me to wait again while she asks the doctor. I follow her right inside ignoring her protests. There was no way this little four foot Japanese nurse was going to be able to stop me. At this point she was really flustered and trying to talk to the doctor at the same time she is berating me for wearing shoes past the door. The doctor said something to the effect of just let him in. After getting the scrubs, hair net, and slippers on, I finally am allowed entry into the room with my wife. She is in a lot of pain because they also don't provide epidural shots in Japan. She is gripping this handlebar type thing on each side, so I just put my hand over top of hers. I'm watching what is going on below and admit I'm slightly nauseated by the sight of all the blood. Then I see the doctor take these scissors and cut something and see this huge gush of liquid like a water balloon bursting. After that, I see her head start coming out, and she is facing my wife's left thigh. After getting her all the way out, the nurses start cleaning my daughter up and call me over. Now, I get the full view of my wife's wrecked vagina. I'm always reminded of that picture of the guy with his jaw blown off and just a mess of red gore when I think of it. As the nurses continue to clean her up and check her measurements, the doctor starts sewing my wife up. Again, it is painful and my wife asks him how long it will take. He says a couple of minutes. She says good, because it hurts. He changes his estimate to ten minutes. Lol, we got the doc with a sense of humor. I was sorely tempted to ask him to sew her up tighter, thought he would get a good laugh out of it, but my wife had already warned me of what she would do to me if I did. By now, the nurses have our daughter cleaned up and they hand her to me. She was so beautiful. As I was holding her, she opened her eyes a little bit, looked at me, and asked me for three fitty. It was that dang old loch ness monster. (LOL, sorry, couldn't help myself). Here is a picture of my little angel. http://imgur.com/QWZCt\n\n\n\nTLDR: push past a four foot Japanese nurse to attend my wife during labor while she bitches about me wearing shoes.

{"body": "Or anyone else for that matter. Marshall would still keep the clip framed because of Nessie!\n\nAlso, lawyers can go in and out of the judiciary. It's fairly common for a judge to go back to being a lawyer, as not all judiciary appointments are lifetime. I don't recall if the episode actually specified what court he was applying to, but it was likely the NY Supreme Court. (The name is confusing- in New York, the lower/trial court is called the Supreme Court, which is the opposite of how every other state and federal is set up.)\n\n[In NY, trial court judges are elected, and have fixed terms](http://www.nycourts.gov/vote/). So if a judge is not reelected, he is no longer a judge and goes back to being a lawyer. This is a very common thing. The longest judicial term is 14 years, for state Supreme Court judges. New York City judges are elected for a term of ten years.  After the term, he could lose reelection, or step down, or retire. Many judges return to private practice where the fact that they were previously a judge makes them *highly* marketable. An ex-judge can take in a huge salary at a private firm without having to put in the hours; in fact he could be a \"silent partner\" and work minimally while contributing to the firm's reputation and marketability. \n\nSo, if Marshall is elected to the judiciary in the fall of 2013, then he could be out of the judiciary in 2023, with plenty of time to find Nessie. \n\nAlso, while the writers of this show are thorough, they aren't perfect. They make mistakes. They also include whimsical future events that are unlikely or impossible, such as the lightsaber turkey carving incident \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356046609", "subreddit": "HIMYM", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, myself and a couple of friends were waking down the street. It was a bridge that was about 15 feet above another street. Both of these streets were relatively quiet and weren't very busy. As we're walking, one of my friends points out that the car up ahead is going unusually fast, and there's a guy leaning out the passenger window and yelling while holding something brown. We then realized that he had a bottle of whiskey or something. As he drove by he screamed at my Puerto Rican friend Miguel \"Go home, wetback!\" (For non-Americans, its a term that refers to Mexicans who come into the US illegally by crossing the Rio Grande) and threw the bottle at him. He ducked and it hit the railing of the bridge and shattered. We were all standing around with looks of confusion, but then decided to continue walking. About 10 seconds later, I looked back and saw the same car driving on the wrong side of the road in our direction. He had to be going at least 40 or 50 mph. Everyone tried to run to the end of the bridge, except Miguel, who was and still is quite athletic. Anyway, he stood his ground and the car started to steer towards him. He then jumped off of the bridge right before the car hit him. He later told me that the thought process behind this was \"They just called me a wetback and threw a bottle at me. They're obviously trying to hit me. If I run with my friends, the driver will hit all of them, injuring them if not killing them. If I jump off of the bridge, I'll hurt myself, but they'll be fine.\" Anyway, the car went partially through the metal railing, and the way the railing bent got the car wedged and about half of the car was hanging off of the side above Miguel. I was looking over the edge and saw him hit the ground on his feet. He immediately collapsed and grabbed his upper right thigh while screaming in pain. Turns out, he hit the ground so hard that the it jammed his femur through the joint connecting it to his pelvis. Ouch. anyway, we ran for him while I was dialing 911 to get an ambulance, and my friend Brian was the first to reach him. He dropped to his knees and was trying to calm him down. Now, Miguel is a tough son of a bitch. I have seen him take some pretty hard hits, but this was bad. He was crying and screaming in pain, both of which are things I've never seen him do him before. \"Miguel... I called an ambulance, you're gonna be fine. but we have to pull you to the side of the road. That car up there might fall at any minute, and if it does we'll all be crushed.\" I tried to say that as calmly as I could, but my voice must have sounded shaky as hell. The truth is, I was worried. I was 15 and I didn't want to be killed by a falling car driven by some drunk assholes who decided to try to kill my friend. He nodded and screamed \"Just do it!\" We pulled him towards the sidewalk so he was no longer under the car. I asked him if there was anything he needed while we waited for the ambulance. He looked at me, and struggling to form words he groaned out \"P-please... Call my p-parents... T-tell them w-what happened...\" \"Anything else?\" I asked as I pulled out my phone. \"Yeah... I n-need... I'mma need about tree fiddy.\" It was at that point that I realized my friend Miguel was actually an eight story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. \"Damn you, Loch Ness Monstah!\" I yelled, \"I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!\" I ended up calling his parents and walking away from the situation, and that was that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356137802", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Names have been changed. \n\nOn about day three of being (before fat platoon) there we realized that one of the guys in our platoon was former spetznaz very highly decorated, defected in the 80s, joined as an NCM doing some random trade and just wanted to switch to officer for a better pension, he was in his late 50s. We were getting a lecture from our Sgt about how the skills we were going to learn in basic would save our lives when we were put in combat situations. This guy snickers in the back of the class. The Sgt looses it on him \"You got something to say there russian?\" he just smirks and says (in a very heavy Russian accent) \"Is luck. Live, die, come home is luck\" The Sgt yelled for a bit more until it came out that the guy is very highly decorated and we speculated that he had an order of the red star. We never found out what he had. \n\nSame guy from the above story had gotten yelled at for lacing his boots incorrectly, we found him lacing his boots properly and asked him about it. He said \"Is bullshit, lace boot make garrote\" and we were naturally confused so we asked him and he told us to come back in a couple of minutes. We came back and he said \"Now I lace boot for garrote, you ask why stop? I say I have tie\" he bent over and within seconds had the largest guy in our group on the ground with the bootlace around his neck and he said \"Like 30 seconds... is dead\"\n\nOnce I was getting an inspection and it had come down the night before that we all needed to have personal pictures in our picture frame, but I forgot/didn't care so I still had that baby with the duck in my picture frame.

{"body": "This is a bit NSFW, btw.\n\nThis happened about 7 years ago when I was in college. There was this one girl in my Psych class that I really liked a lot. She was incredibly beautiful, smart, and funny. She was also a huge tease. She physically flirted with me a LOT in my class (massages, grabbing my hand, playing with my hair) and she always ambushed me for a hug in the halls. Every Friday she asked me if I had plans for the night, and every time I said \"not yet\", she tells me that she's already doing something. Such a tease. But then one day, she suddenly said that was free and we arranged for her to come to my house when my parents weren't home.  \nShe arrived that night around 7ish, and my parents wouldn't be getting home til 12 or later, so we had plenty of time to fool around. I put in a movie (Shawshank Redemption FTW), and we watched the first 30ish minutes cuddling together. Then she went in for the kiss. We made out for about 15 minutes before things escalated. She had her hand on my clothes and I had my hand on hers. After all of this it was only 9:20, and she was planning to stay over til at least 11, so we finished Shawshank with some make out action in between scenes. She left and I was feeling great about myself because she told me how much fun she had/how good I am at kissing, etc.  \nThe next day she didn't return my call, and me being the non-clinger that I am, I just decided to hang out with the boys for the day. We played some intense football, etc etc. Not really part of the story. On Sunday she told me that she wasn't sure if she wanted to be more than friends, and I was pretty bummed. Come Monday, however, she was back to her old flirty ways. She was being WAY more handsy than usual though, which was awesome. Today, she rode home with me (parents again aren't home), and we made out for a while and she stuck her hand on my clothes, only to take her hand out and tell me she had to leave. We stopped at a gas station on the way home and she asked me for some money for a soda.  \"How much you need?\" I asked. She looks at me and she says \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  \nWell it was about that time I noticed this \"girl\" was about eight stories tall and from the Paleolithic Era.  I said \"Dangit monster! Get out of my car! I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"  \nIt said \"How bout just two fiddy?\"  \n\"Now it's only two fiddy?

{"body": "Actually, I was going to Loch Ness two years ago. I wanted to see the lake, but I was sure the monster was imaginary. \n\nI rented a room at a nice, but old hotel. Just after I had moved into my room and taken a shower, the telephone rang and I was asked to come to the lobby. I went down to the front desk, and was met by a local person. He had heard I was coming to Scotland from a common friend, and offered to show me the lake. I like getting the local touch on sightseeing, rather than the tourist guide version, so I accepted his offer. \n\nThe tour was great, but that is beside the point here. After he took me back to the hotel, I thanked him and told him I was really thankful, and asked if here was anything I could do for him. Hi looked down, and said \"Actually, I need about tree fiddy!\" It was about this time I realized that the guy was actually 55 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. All in all, I felt his services was worth more, and gave him ten bucks. He proceeded to eat the ten bucks, including their antlers and all. \n\nTl;dr: once, at a party, I made out with that hot chick from Greys Anatomy ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356282699", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A few years ago on my 19th birthday, me and my buddies decided to celebrate by going to the bars at my college campus (minimum age was 19). I usually don't drink too much, but, since it was a special occasion, I decided to get really fucking wasted. We pregramed a lot before the bar, since it's difficult to obtain alcohol in a bar when none of us are 21, plus it's really expensive so I wasn't trying too hard to get my friends with fake IDs to buy me some. I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my fucking mind.\n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this really sexy chick dancing by herself. Being drunk as shit, I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance sexy? Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up grinding hard/making out a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes.\n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated. We were making out a lot on my bed, and we took off each others shirts and things were really escalating. I had her panties off, and I was starting to think me losing my virginity was a sure thing. I could tell she was really into it. She said \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". I figured she meant me going down on her, and me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\". Then the question came: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"I aint givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!

Anyway this one day she shows up right after I get home from work and has a a couple of friends with her. I invite them in and am wondering how I'm going to finesse the situation when she gets up and leaves, but doesn't take her friends with her. I'm kinda shocked cause I don't know these friends very well, and they don't really have any way to get home from my house. We quickly ran out of things to talk about so I turn the TV on while I go to get some snacks. Honey I Shrunk the kids is on. It's a lame movie that I'm sure we've all seen a bunch of times, but I'm hoping that it's shitty enough to convince them to leave soon. As I was getting salsa out of the refrigerator one of these friends follows me into the kitchen and starts complaining about how they're broke and can't get any money. I started to ask if I could help, but it was around this time I realized that this friend was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "A long time I was ago I was good friends with this girl and in hindsight there was obviously some sexual tension below the surface between us, but it was stymied because both of us were in committed relationships and would never cheat on the people we were dating at the time.   \n\nAs more time passed we both came to each other with family issues, personal issues, and issues with our spouses.  We would sit together for hours in dark parking lots late at night just spilling our guts out to each other and venting about our lives. We finally told each other our darkest secrets and the things that we had never told anyone else. \n\nAfter we knew each other for about a year, my girlfriend at the time broke up with me, this girl held me as I cried and stayed with me every hour that she was not at work or school and helped me get through the rough times and sort out my new life. We continued to remain close, but chaste friends .\n\n After another 3 months or so she got into a fight with the overbearing boyfriend and that was finally the straw that broke the camels back, and they broke up. She was very upset and I did the same thing for her that she had done for me, I kept her company and helped her sort out her thoughts . \n\nAbout a month and a half later I began casually seeing another girl, this lasted for about 3 months until the first girl and I sat down and had a talk, we finally expressed our previously unsaid attraction to each other. She said that things were getting serious enough between myself and the new girl that I would have to make a choice between them. I sat for a minute and gave it a good thought and I finally decided that this amazing girl who had helped me through so much was the one that I wanted to spend my time with. After I had expressed this to her I asked what she would need from me to start off this relationship. She leaned forward and whispered into my ear, her hot breath against my cheek and the faint yet tasteful scent of her perfume filling my nostrils, and she said \"I need about tree fiddy\".\n\nI leaned back, horrified, and finally realized that this intelligent, smart, attractive, and just all around amazing girl that I had fallen in love with with was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era! I got to my feet and yelled \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy, you god damn Loch Ness monster, get your own god damn money!\". With that I walked out and never looked back.\n\n\n\n\n**TLDR: Realized that the girl of my dreams that I had fallen in love with over about a year existed only in my hopes and dreams, and was in actuality a cold blooded, gold-digging pathological liar.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356507897", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A lot of people believe the term \"war\" is used for a few different reasons - the sense of patriotism war instills, the look of \"toughness\" that the politician gets (tough on crime, tough on drugs, etc). It has gone down in the public lexicon as a very effective propaganda tool.\n\nThese people are retards. I'm a veteran of the war on poverty. I was deployed to the South Bronx and Harlem from 88-93 and participated in many famous battles of the era, including the Battle of Kennedy's Fried Chicken, the Battle of the Lexington Ave Skell Hotel, and the Lenox Ave Death March. We'd mow down entire welfare offices and take pictures of us wallowing in their blood, which was sent directly to Ronald Reagan, who reportedly used them for sexual pleasure.\n\nOne day, I came across a kid wearing torn up jeans splashed with paint, a 2LiveCrew T-shirt. I got that kid in the crosshairs of my M16 and pulled the trigger - another notch on the old scorecard. However, when I went to scour my kill for any signs of the enemies plans, I noticed his address - Park Ave South. This kid was loaded.\n\nI broke down. I couldn't handle it. I came into this war to do one thing - violently massacre the poor. But not rich kids. Not like this. The lines in the battle blurred, and it was hard to tell who was on our side and who wasn't. I left the war in 1993, disgusted.\n\nSeveral years later, after cashing in some favors from some private eye friends of mine, I tracked down the parents of the boy I killed. The real one, the one with money. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, and my legs nearly gave out from under me as I slowly climbed up the stairs. My arms screamed not to move as I rang the doorbell. The boys father, a spitting image of what the kid might have looked like at a distinguished age 50, answered the door. He led me into the living and sat me down. His wife had passed some years before. My lips trembled as I told him what I had done, the mistake I had made, how I couldn't assuage the guilt after all these years.

{"body": "There is extremely good evidence to support the existence of a number of creatures as yet unknown to zoology. The study of them - and creatures that have genetically mutated in strange ways - is called \"cryptozoology\" and is quite an interesting area of research.\n\nThe animals with the best anecdotal evidence that has yet to turn into scientific evidence are probably familiar to you: Bigfoot; large cats; and some sea animals from ancient mariner myth.\n\nFirst, I want to deal with the \"if they existed, we'd know for sure\" argument. We are finding new species in new territories every single day. Last time I checked we were finding more new species each day than were being made extinct. Our knowledge of the natural World - particularly the oceans - is much smaller than we think. A decade ago we didn't even know there were animals living around deep ocean hydrothermal vents, and we're still discovering new crabs, sea cucumbers, etc. around them today.\n\nAlso, science has famously avoided the mainstream for centuries. Charles Fort started to study the weird and wonderful (including ghosts, ESP, etc. and his successors have extended the study to UFOs, etc.), because scientists were unable to do so - studying some areas would have been the end of their careers. It shouldn't be, but it is. As such it is mostly amateurs who have successfully decoded that most UFO sightings are metrological phenomena, etc.\n\nAnd so it is with cryptozoology. There are some experts involved, but most of the work in the area seems to be people with very strong amateur interest in the area, some zoological training and a bit of spare time. Professionals won't go \"monster hunting\" because a) they can't get the funding and b) it would end their careers\n\nNow, onto the animals.\n\n***Bigfoot*** has so much evidence to support its existence, it is harder to believe it doesn't exist. Matching footprints from independent sites across North America, numerous first-hand sightings, some from people who were well placed to make an assessment on height, distance and speed of movement (hunters). There are entire towns of natives in Canada who accept it as fact that such a beast exists, everybody has seen it at least once, and so on.\n\nWhere the evidence is lacking is droppings, carcasses and questions about how a population could exist that is large enough to be sustainable but small enough to avoid detection. All of these can be explained by the fact that the area where the animal is believed to exist is *huge*, and all of this could easily have avoided detection.\n\n***Large cats*** have had plenty of sightings across remote rural areas all over Europe in the last 50 years. Panthers, Lynx, etc. are not native to these areas and so reports of them are met with incredulity, however there is enough evidence to suggest some have escaped from private zoos.\n\nAgain, there are questions about how a population might sustain itself and why droppings and carcasses are not clearly apparent and why they have limited their attacks to non-human targets, but there is plenty of photographic and anecdotal evidence, and enough explanations to cover the doubts that I think it's likely there is at least one black panther roaming wild in the South West of England.\n\nAnd finally, ***weird and wonderful sea creatures***. I'm not talking about mermaids here, I'm talking about animals that have attacked shipping and have been sighted by many generations of sailor but never captured. There is so much diversity in the oceans, their size so vast for us to comprehend, that I think we can take it for granted that there is at least one large species of creature out there that is totally unknown to science and that once we discover it we're going to be shocked we never saw it before.\n\nTo my mind all the other animals out there being discusses - dragons, fairies, elves, the Loch Ness monster, etc. - have so little anecdotal evidence to support them, its hard to see how the stories are anything more than attention-seeking/tourist-attracting nonsense.

A gnostic person believes something with absolute certainty, an agnostic merely believes there can be no proof either way.\n\n\nCalling yourself a weak agnostic, I would interpret as you don't believe, and don't claim to be aware of the positions and strengths of the evidence or lack thereof, or the theoretic possibility of proving or disproving the existence of a god.\n\n\nA very sensible position, that shows you haven't wasted a lot of time and personal resources on a futile question.\n\n\nYou are 100% right that the term atheist has little meaning or even relevance to your position. Being atheist is the default position, just as it is the default position to not believe Big foot or Loch Ness monsters exist, unless there is reliable evidence.\n\n\nIt makes little sense to have words for superstitions we don't have, and the only example we have of actually using such a term is the word atheist.\n\n\nStill the term does have meaning, because the specific superstition that a god exist is so widespread, and is even an integral part of many cultures.\n\n\nIf you believe a god exists you are religious, otherwise you are an atheist. There is no in between, if you don't believe in a god, you are an atheist. If you believe a god MAY exist, it means you don't actually believe it does, but it would make you an agnostic atheist.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356636810", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Back when I was in college I used to sleep around a lot, I was a player, a ladies man, a manslut, whatever you want to call it. I slept with just about anything that moved, I had no morals and loved every second of it, but there's one story that ill never forget, and it haunts me to this day.\n\nI was at one of the local bars talking to this girl my friend had set me up with, she was a cute girl and pretty nice too. We talked about all sorts of things, which was odd as I usually tried to get in and out of there as soon as I can, but the night went on and on I started to find myself liking her. This was odd, in fact It was unbelievable, I'd never liked a girl this much before, it was overwhelming.\n\nShe offered to go back to her place and I jumped at the chance to do so, we stepped outside to walk and suddenly it started snowing, it was a crisp night, and the stars were on show, it was almost like a fairy tale. Anyway we walked all the way to hers and she was making all the usual signals I'd seen from girls over the years, she liked me too, but this time it was different, I liked her, this was really big for me. We got to her flat and she invited me in.\n\nWe didn't wait for one second, she grabbed my hand and rushed me up the stairs to her bedroom, she tears my shirt off whilst kissing me ferociously, I was so pumped up and ready to go that I almost lost it right there. I started to kiss her on the neck, then the chest, slowly working my way down her body, I noticed her start to struggle so I immediately stopped, \"What's wrong?!\" I said to her as she sat down on the bed, her face lost all colour and she looked like shed seen a ghost, she looked me in the eyes and said, \"I need about Tree Fiddy\". It was around this time I realized that this pretty girl was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had gotten me again! \"Goddamnit monster I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I screamed.\n\nAnd I've never attempted to go down on a girl ever again.\n\nTL;DR: Started to like a girl and went down on her.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356644635", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have seen 2 \"ufo's\" that I have zero explanation for. In my eyes, they were true blue alien craft. One didn't stand out enough for me to say it couldn't possibly be man-made, but the other I refuse to believe it wasn't alien.\n\n\nFew years back I was with my gf and another couple out at the other girl's family farmhouse (Kendall area in WI). Lots of bluffs and valleys if you know the area. Very secluded and quiet. \n\n\nSo sitting around the campfire, and I see something \"float\" out of the valley. I'd say 200-250 yards away. Best I could describe is a typical Star-Wars like craft. Sleek, glowing in the back from whatever propulsion it uses. It's perfectly level to the ground, say tree top level. I get my buddies attention but not the girls and he sees it too. We watch for a second as it turns away from us. It gets brighter in the back and sits there for a second. And just like the movies it just arc's up and takes off at an incredible speed like it was going to warp. I swear on a stack of bibles. We kind of stared for a bit until the girls figured something was up. we just said we saw a deer or something. Little bit later we're still out there and I hear something in the woods. Not abnormal as we are in the middle of nowhere. We all quiet down and it keeps coming. So the girls are scared and truth be know my buddy and I are kind of nervously laughing at this point. We still didn't way what we saw. I decided to get up and just walk towards whatever it was. usually deer just take off but there are coyotes and wolves in this area. It certainly wasn't a small forest critter. I got to the edge of the house and all of the sudden this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era, comes out of the woods. I yelled, I said, \"What do you want from us, monster?\" And the monster bent down, and said, \"I need about tree-fitty.\"  I said, \"I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut truth be known, no bullshit about the \"craft\" part. That all happened and I cannot explain it.

{"body": "My story closely resembles a film-like horror story. It haunts my days and my nights to this very moment…\n\nMy family and a couple of friends went camping in a thick forest for a few days. We like to observe the environment, and a few of my family members are biologists, specializing in ecology, so it seemed like a pretty good idea. I don’t know jack-squat about forests, so I apologize if my descriptions aren’t accurate.\n\nAnyway, we walked fairly deep into the forest on the first day. We camped out in an area that received a decent amount of sunlight during the day, so we didn’t even have to use our equipment to help us see. However, we did bring a couple of flashlights to help us look underneath large tree roots for those awesome little niches full of tiny animals, insects, and all other varieties of life.\n\nAfter a fun and enlightening day, we returned to our campsite to have a snack and go to sleep. We found that our GPS and maps were missing; of course, this would make it tougher for us, but we’d made it out of situations like this before. There was no shock because we assumed that some small animals had taken them elsewhere.\n\nThe next day, we had similar little adventures; this time, my little brother stuck around the campsite to make sure nothing else went missing. Thankfully, nothing was gone; however, he had heard some strange rustling sounds not reminiscent of small animals. Not knowing much about our environment, however, he assumed that nothing was amiss.\n\nThat evening, we had our regular snacks and went to sleep. It was a normal evening, and the next day we went a bit deeper into a forest – it was to be our last day of camping, and we wanted to experience the deepest areas of the forest.\n\nNo sunlight came through in that area; we would rely heavily on our tools. Each of us kept a small flashlight handy. Our exploration went completely normally, and we returned, had snacks, and went to sleep once again. We heard some strange rustling (my brother identified the noises as being identical to those he had heard the previous day), but it receded rather quickly. We didn’t mind it.\n\nWe slept peacefully for a few hours. Then, we were all awoken by a brief blood-curling scream. It was so brief, however, that each of thought it was just a noise made by some bird. A few of us turned on our flashlight in the direction of the noise, but found nothing strange.\n\nWe all went back to sleep. Shortly after, another loud noise. The same situation, nothing appeared amiss.\n\nThe next time this happened, we were beginning to get scared. This was not normal! We went to observe the situation and to check whether everyone was all right. We found that three people were *missing.*\n\nThis could not have been a coincidence. Imagine our horror as we understood that something was out there, looking for us in this dense forest. Could it have been some animal? Some madman? We had no way to know. All we knew was that we had to *get out.*\n\nWe packed up and decided where we had to run. My older brother knew how to get out of the forest due to his studies and training. I can’t really recall how he figured it out; something to do with searching for the cracks of sunlight somewhere? In any case, we followed him. We ran. We ran fast.\n\nAlong the way, we heard another blood-curdling scream. This was unmistakable. We had no time to panic or to grieve. We had to run.\n\nNo matter what direction we ran or how fast we ran, we kept losing them. One by one. Within one evening, our group of 8 people had turned into 2: my brother and myself. But we still had no time to grieve. We were getting closer to the outskirts of the forest and had to finish. It was our only chance.\n\nThey got to my brother. I stopped running. With my flashlight in hand, I saw his body being dragged behind a tree. It’s an image that was burned into my mind. I still don’t go a day without seeing it. I can’t go a day without hearing his pleads for help as I limply fall onto my knees and watch his body disappear from sight. His screams of agony as I realize that my close ones have lost their lives. All the questions of life flew at me as I realized that I had lost all that is important to me in life.\nWhy them? Why not me? Why must people die so brutally after a life of peace? Why is life so fragile? What is my life really worth? What do I do now? What do I do if I survive? What value will my life hold if I live to tell this story?\n\nAll great questions, all at the brink of death. The lives of my close ones flashed before my eyes. The agony I felt was terrible, the sadness I felt drowned my ambition to live. On my knees, I had given up on life. All in a matter of seconds.\n\nI saw him approach me. I knew that he had killed all of them. I looked up at him with pleading eyes. Pleading, not to live, but to understand. Why had he done this?\n\nMy mouth could barely move: “Why?”\n\n“I needed something from you, but you never gave it to me.”\n\nNeedless to say, I was very confused. But I still had to understand. I knew that my life would be entirely worthless unless I, at the very least, could just *understand.* My lips barely made out the words…\n\n“What did you need?”\n\n“I needed a particular type of tree.”\n\n“What type of tree did you need?”\n\n“I need… tree fiddy.”\n\nIt was then that I realized that the Lochness Monster, along with his small army of Happy Tree Friends, had been killing my close ones the entire time. All of my questions had been answered. As the Lochness Monster pointed at me and the Happy Tree Friend proceeded to dismember me, I briefly understood the meaning of life. All was clear. I then heard some gunshots and fell into a coma that lasted for about a year.\n\nIt turns out that Dr. George Frankenstein, one of the great-great grandsons of the original Dr. Frankenstein, had shot the Happy Tree Friends, while the Lochness Monster escaped. He had rebuilt me. I was alive again, but all of my memories except that of the camping had disappeared. I could not function as a member of society. I was alone; I could not connect with the rest of humanity. I needed to understand my identity again. I was the Monster of Frankenstein.\n\nI was also extremely horny.\n\n**TL;DR:** I want Dr. Frankenstein to gimme a wife or imma kill the villagers and his family.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356749100", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First, on the topic of justification for belief. For every other conceivable entity, disbelief is more justified than belief. Does it make sense to believe in unicorns? Leprechauns? Bigfoot? The Loch Ness monster? Do you go around saying, \"I'm undecided about leprechauns. Maybe we should consider the possibility that there's gold to be found at the ends of rainbows?\"\n\nThe answer is: no. At least sane people do not believe random things that come to mind. They don't start to consider such notions until they're given reason to. If you find cat shit in your garden you will consider that a cat frequents it.\n\nThere are two reasons people believe in God (or any gods): Social inertia and a mistaken assumption about the so-called First Cause.\n\nThe \"social inertia\" thing is the easier to explain: your parents believed in God and brought you up to do the same. All your friends believe in God. It would be socially uncool not to. Atheists smell funny! So many people believe in God, there must be something to it. That kinda argument.\n\nThis glides back to the assumed causative power of gods. Our ancient forebears were faced with a world full of inexplicable events: rain, thunder, lightning, moving heavenly bodies and so forth. Lacking our scientific knowledge, they pulled explanations from their butts. Most often, those explanations were based on [a presumption of agency](https://nukeexcathedra.jottit.com/2011-12-14%3A_the_presumption_of_agency).\n\nToday, thousands of years later, most of those phenomena have natural explanations. We know the mechanisms behind most of that stuff. Having solved most of the easy problems, we're left with a trio of more difficult ones:\n\n* human consciousness;\n* the origin of life from non-living matter (abiogenesis); and\n* the origin of our universe.\n\nGood progress is actually being made on the first two, so the \"god believer association\" is concentrating on the last one. They appeal to the imagination of simple humans in trying to claim that \"if something happened, there must have been somebody to make it happen.\" Another foundation of this kind of thinking is that \"something cannot come from nothing.\" This last comes from Aristotle, who made this generalization from his observation of world events in ancient Greece. Mind you, this is the same guy who said that women have fewer teeth than men - he never once had the bright idea to look and count for himself. Even if his observation were true *inside this universe* - and it can be argued it's not - he has no basis for generalizing to \"outside\" the universe. Nobody's ever observed that.\n\nIn fact, it makes a lot more sense to generalize from something we *do* observe in the universe, at all scales and all times: every observed phenomenon has a natural explanation. And everything that happens makes sense without a presumption of conscious interference.\n\nWhy should this consistently observed aspect of reality suffer a sudden discontinuity at the upper end of the cosmos? And how would a sentient being be an explanation for this if you then had to follow it up with an explanation for the existence of a universe-creating sentient being? People are motivated to think this kind of stuff by their romantic fascination with tales of mystery and the supernatural. No event in human history has ever provided credible grounds for belief in the supernatural.\n\nYou can consider the possibility of supernatural, universe-creating entities if you want to. Just don't try to claim there's any justification, apart from wishful thinking.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356865535", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Her beautiful slender exterior and brown top dabbed in white more background now as the light dimmed late in the evening. It was on winter nights like this I needed a little something to keep me alive. Her eyes pierced as if sharpened for a purpose and wouldn't let me be. I had to make my move before I lost the courage to do so and thus lose my potential prize. Her nose the broadest arch I'd ever adored on such a slim and conservative face. Her robust lips, painted red with a studded piercing are what caught me, dragged me into her realm.\n\n\nUnable to escape my fate, I knocked. A long silence drew over the place. Now, I'm not the most social butterfly and I rarely come out of my home in the first place. I thought to myself, \"Why am I even here? I know this wont accomplish anything and Shiela will be so ashamed of me of she finds out.\" I couldn't help myself though. They were such desperate times. \n\nAn unexpected answer in return.

{"body": "I have a story about this. My friends and I were hanging out one day and bored out of our skulls, driving down streets, each of us looking at various stores and querying the others if they wanted to pop into such-and-such, usually mattress stores or statuary workshops (seriously, there are like 5 shops near here that make classical statues for gardens and shit) and after driving around for about 15 minutes, we saw a Goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is a magical place; it's like the Giving Tree in Neopets. Everything is nearly free, sometimes free if the cashier likes you (this one guy let me walk out with a panda tie) and most of it is crap, except for a few gold nuggets scattered around the store. We saw an old working xbox for $13, a fantastic blazer that fit me brilliantly (well-fitting clothing is impossible to find there), a mint condition hardback copy of The Hobbit, and a monstrous pair of purple panties with yellow polka-dots. Used, of course.\n\nWe pointed this out and laughed, asking 'who the hell would buy that?', each of us secretly wishing we had brought money, noticing that the panties looked a bit... discolored in places, and then moving on. We kept browsing the store, wandering around, looking at all of the terrible and not-so-terrible merchandise, and we slowly worked our way back to the front of the store, about to leave, when we saw a large(*large*) african-american woman heading into the dressing rooms with... the panties. We quickly and quietly sat down, wide-eyed, in some stained beanie bags in front of the windows and watched the dressing room doors to the right of the store. Stars wheeled overhead and every second was as long as a life-age of the earth... and then, the doors opened, and the jiggling mass wobbled out gloriously and triumphantly, vile undergarments in hand. She walked up to the checkout, put them on the counter, and asked how much they were. The Cashier said they were $4.35, but the woman protested, saying that she only had 85 cents. The guy didn't like the woman, clearly, and said he could not bring the price down, so the woman waddled over to us, put her curtained arms around our three bodies, and croaked: \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356938549", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When my son was growing up he had quite the imagination. He was a cowboy one day, a firefighter the next, and an astronaut after that. Doctors think he may have had Asperger's, because his social skills were underdeveloped. Sadly, this caused him to be picked on, and he escaped into his own imaginary world. My wife and I were worried, but kept supporting him.\n\nBut, at age five or so, he decided that he wanted to be a chef. We'd play in his room with his stuffed animals, and cooked them some magnificent meals. He came up with some weird dishes, like apple steaks (he'd cut pieces of apple and cook them on his toy griddle), and dinosaur sandwiches (dinosaur figures in between two pieces of bread). It got a little weird for me because I wanted him to make friends and play with kids his age, but my wife assured this that this was normal.\n\nSo, one day, he comes downstairs in his chef's hat, as excited as can be. \"Daddy, daddy, I've got a new friend! He's in my room!\" I look at my wife and she nods assuringly, so I play along. \"Awesome, kid.\" He runs upstairs as excited as can be. I ask my wife what's going on, but she tells me that children like him can feel upset that they're not living up to their parents' expectations, and that having an imaginary friend is a step in the right direction. I shrug and go back into my workshop.\n\nAn hour later, my son walks downstairs. He shucks his chef's hat to the side and starts crying. I've never seen him this upset in my life, and even his mother is giving him hugs and kisses. I ask him what's wrong. He says his new friend is in danger and that we need to help him with some money, or else he'll starve to death. By this point I'm beginning to get fed up with this nonsense. But, again, the wife tells me to be supportive and give him whatever he asks for. \n\"How much do you need?\" I say.\n\n\"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time when I went into his room and saw my son's imaginary friend: a seven-story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. The damn Loch Ness monster, with his beady eyes and greedy face staring at me. I yell at him and tell him to leave my son alone as I chase him out of the house. My wife yells at me and tells me to calm down. Turns out *she* gave him a dollar before, which made my blood boil, and Loch Ness monster has been bothering us since. My son moved to Colorado and worked in a school cafeteria. Good little kids, they've helped us tremendously. My son, sadly, was mauled to death after joining the Super Adventure Club.
