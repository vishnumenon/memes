{"body": "Iraqi American here.\n\nGrowing up in Baghdad, I lived across the street from a beautiful girl. Tall, straight black hair, sensuous black eyes that made you want to lay your soul bare to her. I loved this girl and I wanted to marry her. The only problem was, my family was Christian and her's was Muslim. Her family didn't seem to mind me (they were very educated and open-minded), but mine wanted me to have nothing to do with her. So I'd sneak out of my house to drink Turkish coffee and have sweets with her family, and one day they flirted with the idea of arranging us to be wed. This, of course, meant that I would have to convert to Islam, which would *literally* meant death for me.\n\nI had a very difficult life growing up as a minority in Baghdad, and my own family was trying to get out. Then, Saddam decided to attack Iran, and a long, horrific battle ensued. Unfortunately, my parents' home was hit by Iranian shells and they passed away. This girl's family was readying to flee the country, and, in the goodness of their hearts, offered to take me with them. I left behind my country and home, performed a hasty conversion to Islam (which is pretty easy), and we were married.\n\nWe drove to the Syrian border and snuck across. During these times, my new wife and I \"consummated\" our marriage. It was the most exhilirating time of my life. Making beautiful, passionate love to the woman of your dreams, not knowing if you're going to live or die...it really teaches you the value of love.\n\nSo, we made it to Syria, and from there we went to Lebanon, Greece, Spain, and then, finally, the US. Immediately, I enroll in college and get a master's degree in English Literature (we also studied English in secondary school), and she enrolls in medical school.\n\nEventually, after everything we've been through, we grew apart. Though we both had great careers and became very successful, I began to have doubts. Watching the news coverage of the later Gulf Wars, my conscience dwelled on the cousins, aunts, and culture I left behind. Inshallah they were safe, but after the guilt I felt about my actions, I knew there was no way I could know. That, coupled with the fact that my wife didn't understand what I was going through caused our relationship to fall apart. Plus, the years hadn't been so kind to her, and my eyes soon began to wander.\n\nAfter 25 years of marriage, we had an amicable divorce. After many nights of arguing and pouring my heart out to her, she understold what I was going through. I remember spending our last night \"together\" in bed. We had already signed the papers, and everything was finalized. I gave her anything she wanted, without question. After caressing that beautiful black hair for the last time, she asked for one last favor. Not willing to refuse her, after all we'd been through, I asked what she needed.\n\n\"I--I need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time that I realized that the love of my life was eight stories tall, and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. The Loch Ness Monster. I said, \"I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I chased him out of my house, and spent the rest of my days wallowing in guilt over leaving my home just to be almost duped into giving him tree-fiddy.\n\n**TL; DR**: I had sex with the Loch Ness monster for 25 years.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357068392", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Quite a heated debate in here over Crop Circles. This is one subject I had quite a bit of skepticism over because as others have pointed out here..\n\n* Why would Aliens communicate with us in this manner. Surely there are more modern methods of communication. Send us an e-mail, text message, radio broadcast, a fucking tweet. Why leave the message in a crop circle? To fuck with us? Is it a faith thing? You have to be a believer and leave room for skepticism?\n\n* Just like with UFOs, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster and Ghosts, there are going to be fakers. It's certainly possible to fake a crop circle and people have come forward claiming they made them. And I'm not buying the two old men that claim they made them all. They are faking that they made fake crop circles.\n\nBut after reading into the subject a little more and watching a few vwry good documentaries on the subject, I am convinced that some of the crop circles could not have been made by man. They are too complex and there is evidence of radiation, electromagnetism and biological changes to the planta that could not be done by humans. \n\nExtensive testing has been done on plants inside and outside of certain crop circles and the plants inside the circle have been bent without breaking the stems and the nodes have been blown out as if they were super heated. The plants and seeds have also been taken back to a lab and replanted and they exhibit super growth characteristics as if they have been genetically altered (GMO).\n\nCertain crop circles have been shown to have very high levels of radiation, similiar to microwave radiation.\n\nCertain crop circles have very high levels of electromagnetism. Batteries drain in cameras and other equipment, equipment malfunctions, cel phones don't work and even the instruments in planes and helicopters malfunction just from flying over the crop circles.\n\nCertain crop circles have small, perfectly formed iron spheres in the soil that does not exist outside of the crop circle.\n\nIf you know anything about algebra and geometry (I don't but the guy in the documentary explained it pretty clearly) certain patterns can not be drawn without showing your work. In other words to arrive at certain patterns, you qould first have to draw A, B and C to arrive at pattern D and then you would erase AB and C. You can't do that when you're working with a field of corn or wheat.\n\nCertain crop circles are just too massive and complex to be created in the short amount of time some of these crop circles are created. No one has ever been caught in the act. People may come forward and claim responsibility but I find it rather odd that no one has been caught in the middle of creating one of the more complex designs considering how much attention is focused on these things.\n\nI'm not saying it's aliens, I don't know what it is. Maybe it's an intelligent entity that is from Earth that we can't see. Another unrelated theory are these spheres that are often seen around crop circles. Spirits maybe? Some kind of intelligence that can not physically interact with us but has the ability to exert some kind of energy field similiar to the movie Ghost with Patrick Swayze. It can't pick up a phone but it can knock things over or do other things like a Poltergeist. \n\nI don't know who's doing it or why but there is enough evidence to show that some sort of aupernatural force is creating these things.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357105429", "subreddit": "UFOs", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Yes I have, and let me tell you: it was an interesting experience. \n\nSo, after posting a string of photos onto gonewild, always making it to the front page, I received a message from a porn producer. He offered to fly me out to L.A.\n\nAfter extensive research, I came to the conclusion that this guy was left. Who would have thought that amongst hundreds of creepy PMs, here was my golden ticket out of a New Jersey suburb and a shitty community college. \n\nSo, I'm flown out there, and head to this producer's place of work. I'm put in a waiting room with tons of other girls. \n\nAfter a good long time, the producer calls me into his office, and has me sit down on a familiar coach. That legendary black couch. I knew what this would come to-- but I was a young college student who was in desperate need for cash. \n\nHe wasn't the most attractive man, nor was he an ugly man. He was that \"porn\" attractive we're all familiar with.  I didn't want to seem reluctant, so I didn't ask to many questions. I acted eager. He has a camera, and we get started. \n\nIt was great. With those hard, rhythmic thrusts I moaned like I never have before. He went a good long while before finishing. \n\nNot knowing much, I asked him if I would me paid for this.\n\nHe says \"Yeah, of course. You're gonna be a star.\"\n\nI smiled, and asked how much. \n\n\"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time I realized this producer was a 500 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "I believe the problem lies in that \"black\" people of African descent have a harder time of tracking down historical documents of where they come from. If you are a black person able to track down the history of your heritage, it usually comes to a halt at the years of slavery because documentation of where the slave actually came from or what tribe they belong to wasn't important. What was important to document was their \"given\" name and to what slave owner they belonged to. So I believe that's why presently (African American here... at least that's what the Census and every school standardized test has told me) blacks or African American (whichever you prefer) identify as such because we know we came from Africa but that's really all we know. Majority of us don't know what tribe our ancestors belonged to, what part of Africa we came from, who our great-grandfatherX7 sat next to in chains on the naval fleets and we can never truly find out as no specific documentation was ever taken down because it wasn't necessary. That's why the general idea that something is a \"black\" or \"urban\" staple exists. Believe me, if we all had a way of deciphering who's family was Hutu, Tutsi or whatever kind of tribe we would be identifying each other as such. Together we're all culturally one black mass. Didn't really mean to go off on such a tangent but your comment really got me thinking and I just had to share my thoughts. Thanks\n\nEdit- Awesome username by the way.

{"body": "Glad to get this off my chest. I'll give you some context before I start writing about what happened. I just turned 16 years old a few weeks ago. I shall not name my girlfriend, for I would not like to reveal her identity. My parents are conservative, and naive to be honest. I am neither of these things. They never approved of any relationships I have had with girls. My parents and I went to Bangkok for ten days, during my winter break. Today, I left Bangkok, and the day before that… I made a huge mistake.\n\nThe hotel I stayed at was the Millennium Hilton, situated at the edge of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok. While waiting in line to book a room, I couldn't help but notice a breathtakingly beautiful girl. Her long, brown hair was tucked beneath a hoody, and her light blue eyes stared into the distance. I watched her, thoroughly attracted by her beauty. As I entered the elevator, and made my way up to my room, I couldn't stop thinking of her. Over the next five days, I noticed her many more times; during meals, in the lobby, and in the pool. By that time, it would have been safe to say I had a crush on her.\n\nOn the 6th day of my stay in Bangkok, my parents accepted an invitation to stay overnight at a friend's hotel room. I wasn't allowed to come, so my parents gave me thirty dollars worth of the local currency (Baht) and said I could do whatever I wanted with it. They told me to be careful, be aware of pickpockets, and to spend the money wisely. Even though I was 16, my parents had never given me such freedom, even temporarily.\nI hopped on a subway train, without any particular destination. When I boarded, I couldn't believe my eyes: the same gorgeous girl I had been looking at for days was right in front of me. Although I had never approached a girl I had liked before, I confidently asked her if she could recommend me some destinations. Her head turned sideways, and she helped me as best she could. As she spoke, I noticed that she had a lisp; nevertheless, she was confident and sure of herself. I found this oddly endearing. When she finished giving me advice, I decided to strike up a conversation.\n\nI heard that she was stopping off at the MBK Shopping Center, so I seized the opportunity to be with her a little longer. I got off at her stop, and let her leave. However, I made sure not to lose sight of her as I mingled with the crowd. I followed her for a long time, until I decided it was time to reveal myself. I pretended that our reunion was an accident; however, she obviously saw through this and gave me a wide smile. I boldly asked her if she would mind watching a film with me. I could see she was hesitant, but she eventually accepted the offer. I am sure she was compliant only because she was afraid to be otherwise. This made me guilty; she was obviously nervous about my invitation. We watched the afternoon showing of \"Life of Pi\" together, and I used the cold air-conditioning as an excuse to embrace her. I wondered how my parents would react if they saw what I was doing.\n\nWhen I left the theater, I thought we would leave and never see each other again; however, she asked me if I would like to eat an early dinner in a local restaurant which, according to others, was excellent. I said yes with no hesitation. I talked with her for what must have been hours, and I tried to learn as much as I could about her. I did my best to ask all of the questions, and I showed genuine interest in her. She was an American living in South Korea. Her mother was a teacher, and her father was a missionary; she took classes from a catholic private school. Her parents were conservative, and expected her to follow their example. I laughed with her, sympathized with her, and talked with her. She turned out to be more than just physically beautiful; her personality was beautiful, too. When it was time for us to leave, we shared contact information so we could stay in touch. I was tempted to kiss her right there, but I wasn't sure what she would think.\n\nThe next morning, my parents returned to the hotel room. They asked me what I did that day, and I told them everything, but I did not mention the girl for fear of their reaction. My father told me that a missionary, a teacher, and their daughter were going to visit later this morning. I knew who they were. \"The girl told her parents and they are coming to meet me?\" I was worried. If my parents realized that I was actually dating a girl yesterday, they would inflict a harsh punishment and make sure I never associated myself with her again. When they arrived at my hotel room, I wasn't surprised: my girlfriend was with her conservative, Catholic parents. My mother and father started talking with my girlfriend's parents, obviously impressed with how they raised their daughter. My girlfriend wore a blazer, a cross necklace, a long dress, and dark shoes. Judging from her discontent eyes, the attire she was wearing did not please her. To my surprise, the girlfriend's parents did not pay any attention to me. Fortunately, it seems as if they were not told about my experiences the day before with their daughter. After an hour of waiting while our parents talked, my girlfriend stood up and asked them if she could visit the Grand Palace and the Reclining Buddha. She added that \"the boy\" could come if he wanted. My parents believed that I was losing my \"touch with God\", and that a \"pious young girl\" could help teach me \"the way\". In other words, my parents were being naive as all hell. My girlfriend's parents were no less compliant.\n\nWe took a small ferry, and cruised along the Chao Phraya river until we reached our destination. After admiring the Reclining Buddha, also known as \"Wat Pho\", we walked to the Grand Palace, a complex of buildings constructed in 1782 by a Siamese king. We spent two hours at the Grand Palace, and bought some lunch from a teashop afterwards. This is getting long so I'll get straight to the point; she kissed me. I could smell her hair, and strong lavender perfume on her neck. I mustered up the courage to tell her that I loved her, which earned me another kiss. Eventually, we returned to the docks and boarded another ferry. The boat was crowded like you couldn't imagine. People were pushing and jostling to get on and off the boat at stops, and everybody seemed to be breathing down your neck. I held my girlfriend's hand for the whole ride.\n\nWhen we returned to the hotel room, it was 3 P.M. I was surprised to see that the parents weren't there. I looked on the table, and found a note that my parents left. \"We're out for dinner. See you at 8 or 9 PM\". It was awkward. I was with a beautiful girl, we had just kissed, and we were alone. And there was a bed. To avoid this awkwardness, I asked if she would like to watch a film. She said yes, and we chose one to watch. We both sat on the bed, because there was only one chair, and it was uncomfortable anyways. Halfway through the movie, two teenagers our own ages married, don't ask me why at such an age. At first, we were just kissing; but then, she started taking her blazer off.\n\nImmediately, my dick became as hard as a rock in my pants. She obviously noticed, and continued to take off her shirt and pants. Now she was wearing only her panties and bra. At this point I was filled with such great lust that I ripped off her bra and panties with my teeth like an animal. I desperately ate her out like a bear licking a honey pot, and she moaned. At this point I felt like my dick was going to explode, it was so hard. Together we ripped off my clothes. For a few moments, I did not know what to do, and it was awkward. However, a primal instinct compelled me forward. I shoved my penis into her womanhood, and she groaned. It only took a few seconds before I ejaculated, and for one second we were united in a bond that was intense and primal. Then the moment was gone.\n\nTwo days later, I was able to talk to her for one last time before I left Bangkok. I still remember it clearly. We were holding hands on a couch in the lobby, and I told her that I had to leave. I asked her mournfully, \"Can I do anything at all for you before I leave?\" She held my hand and looked deep into my eyes, and said \"I need you…\". “I know, but I have to go” I said sadly, and my eyes started to well up with tears. “No! You mustn’t go!” she said, her beautiful eyes staring into mine. “I have to. But is there anything more I can do for you?”. She looked at me and said “…Yes I do. I need… I need about tree fiddy.”\nAnd that is when I realized that my girlfriend was a 500 foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357210114", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

When it was time for us to leave, we shared contact information so we could stay in touch. I was tempted to kiss her right there, but I wasn't sure what she would think.\n\nThe next morning, my parents returned to the hotel room. They asked me what I did that day, and I told them everything, but I did not mention the girl for fear of their reaction. My father told me that a missionary, a teacher, and their daughter were going to visit later this morning. I knew who they were. \"The girl told her parents and they are coming to meet me?\" I was worried. If my parents realized that I was actually dating a girl yesterday, they would inflict a harsh punishment and make sure I never associated myself with her again. When they arrived at my hotel room, I wasn't surprised: my girlfriend was with her conservative, Catholic parents. My mother and father started talking with my girlfriend's parents, obviously impressed with how they raised their daughter. My girlfriend wore a blazer, a cross necklace, a long dress, and dark shoes. Judging from her discontent eyes, the attire she was wearing did not please her. To my surprise, the girlfriend's parents did not pay any attention to me. Fortunately, it seems as if they were not told about my experiences the day before with their daughter. After an hour of waiting while our parents talked, my girlfriend stood up and asked them if she could visit the Grand Palace and the Reclining Buddha. She added that \"the boy\" could come if he wanted. My parents believed that I was losing my \"touch with God\", and that a \"pious young girl\" could help teach me \"the way\". In other words, my parents were being naive as all hell. My girlfriend's parents were no less compliant.\n\nWe took a small ferry, and cruised along the Chao Phraya river until we reached our destination. After admiring the Reclining Buddha, also known as \"Wat Pho\", we walked to the Grand Palace, a complex of buildings constructed in 1782 by a Siamese king. We spent two hours at the Grand Palace, and bought some lunch from a teashop afterwards. This is getting long so I'll get straight to the point; she kissed me. I could smell her hair, and strong lavender perfume on her neck. I mustered up the courage to tell her that I loved her, which earned me another kiss. Eventually, we returned to the docks and boarded another ferry. The boat was crowded like you couldn't imagine. People were pushing and jostling to get on and off the boat at stops, and everybody seemed to be breathing down your neck. I held my girlfriend's hand for the whole ride.\n\nWhen we returned to the hotel room, it was 3 P.M. I was surprised to see that the parents weren't there. I looked on the table, and found a note that my parents left. \"We're out for dinner. See you at 8 or 9 PM\". It was awkward. I was with a beautiful girl, we had just kissed, and we were alone. And there was a bed. To avoid this awkwardness, I asked if she would like to watch a film. She said yes, and we chose one to watch. We both sat on the bed, because there was only one chair, and it was uncomfortable anyways. Halfway through the movie, two teenagers our own ages married, don't ask me why at such an age. At first, we were just kissing; but then, she started taking her blazer off.\n\nImmediately, my dick became as hard as a rock in my pants. She obviously noticed, and continued to take off her shirt and pants. Now she was wearing only her panties and bra. At this point I was filled with such great lust that I ripped off her bra and panties with my teeth like an animal. I desperately ate her out like a bear licking a honey pot, and she moaned. At this point I felt like my dick was going to explode, it was so hard. Together we ripped off my clothes. For a few moments, I did not know what to do, and it was awkward. However, a primal instinct compelled me forward. I shoved my penis into her womanhood, and she groaned. It only took a few seconds before I ejaculated, and for one second we were united in a bond that was intense and primal. Then the moment was gone.\n\nTwo days later, I was able to talk to her for one last time before I left Bangkok. I still remember it clearly. We were holding hands on a couch in the lobby, and I told her that I had to leave. I asked her mournfully, \"Can I do anything at all for you before I leave?\" She held my hand and looked deep into my eyes, and said \"I need you…\". “I know, but I have to go” I said sadly, and my eyes started to well up with tears. “No! You mustn’t go!” she said, her beautiful eyes staring into mine. “I have to. But is there anything more I can do for you?”. She looked at me and said “…Yes I do. I need… I need about tree fiddy.”\nAnd that is when I realized that my girlfriend was a 500 foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era.\n\n\nTL;DR How I lost my virginity", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357213642", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; atheism has no regard or care for how the universe started?\n\nSince you seem genuinely interested, I hope you'll pardon me jumping in while attempting to be helpful.\n\nAtheism as such only responds (with failure to accept belief) to claims about the existence of gods. I suspect there are many atheists who don't give a dang about where the universe came from. I for one have a mild intellectual interest and enjoy following the announcements of cosmology, but it's not something that keeps me up at night. My gut feeling is that the universe and I play out at far too different scales for one to matter to the other. Also, I *know* that mankind doesn't have a finished, satisfying answer to this question, so I'm not going to discover one by insisting on loudly asking. I don't have the hubris of thinking I'll be the one to solve this major puzzle. If I'm lucky, I'll hear in my lifetime that we've made some more progress on finding the answer, and that's something to look forward to.\n\nAlso, there are zillions of \"natural\" atheists, i.e. people whose parents didn't inculcate them in some religious beliefs, so they continued living with no belief in gods. These people *stayed* atheists rather than *became* atheists through some active thought process, so the so-called Big Questions may have been completely irrelevant to their thinking on this topic.\n\nHOWEVER, many atheists, especially the more-or-less intellectual college student types you run into a lot here on Reddit, are atheists as part of a more comprehensive world view called naturalism. This isn't the formal definition, but to me naturalism means accepting that there's a natural explanation for everything that happens (though we obviously don't know all of them yet), and particularly that there are no supernatural events. When I was younger I was enthusiastically interested in ESP, clairvoyance, telekinesis, poltergeists, the Loch Ness monster and other stuff that goes bump in the night. Eventually, after years of following such concepts in the news, and seeing a consistent pattern of these claims about the supernatural being debunked as fraud or error, I came to the conclusion that all of supernaturalism shares the property that, if looked at closely, it turns out to be false. Never in the history of humankind has an actual miracle ever been credibly substantiated. Never. Thus: No flying human beings, no raising from the dead, no wandering souls... no God, no heaven, no hell. Because theism rests on the idea of a supernatural being, atheism is a logical consequence -or subset- of naturalism.\n\nEDIT: I just noticed there seems to be a contradiction here. Everybody's telling you that atheism means simply not believing, yet here's naturalism actively denying the supernatural - and hence theism. That doesn't mean, though, that atheism means actively denying, just that a naturalist is an atheist with a little more conviction behind him. i.e. \"believing there is not\" is an *extension* of \"not believing.\" We sometimes call that \"strong atheism.\" I suppose this means that naturalists are obligated to be strong atheists, yet most of us claim to be \"weak\" or agnostic atheists. My little lecture has forced me to give this some more thought; please excuse my  little soliloquy here!\n\nPersonally, I find it very pleasing that the world around us behaves in ways that come down to essentially simple rules. Where you have enough knowledge, the world is predictable. It also means that when bad things happen, it was either a collusion of events I don't know or something I could have done better; not divine punishment or some other hocus-pocus. It also means I'm responsible for my own actions and my own life. Once I got over a brief period of feeling a bit intimidated by the responsibility, I must say this felt uplifting and freeing. I feel very OK about being my own being in a world that's essentially non-mysterious.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357253030", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

The analogy does not work.\n\nI thought it was somewhat hypocritical and contradictory (doublethink) to preach open-mindedness and to admonish those who don't believe what hasn't been proven, when these are the same methods theists use to defend their beliefs.  \n\nI really see no reason not to label most examples of gods as ET visitors.

It was a nice sunny autumn afternoon so we decided to first go for a ride in our friend's car (non pot smoker).  He knew the drill, windows down, tunes up.  We would drive around town  enjoying the nice autumn breeze accompanied by the sounds of incubus and 311.  It was a great chance to just relax and settle into a groove.  \n\nAt last we would arrive at the local corner store.  I'm very particular about what I eat and I tend to be a creature of habit, this day would be no exception.

I gave him 3 dollars which was exactly what I had paid every other time I made my trip to the store.  I asked the cashier if everything was okay and that's when he motioned for me to come closer. I walked back over to the counter and asked him what he needed.  He told me that \"The manager had to raise the price on Arizona and now I'm gonna need about tree Fiddy\".  Well it was about that time that I noticed that cashier was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"loch ness monster!

{"body": "I think that every atheist should be familiar with Plantinga's work and with the philosophical responses that other philosophers have made to his work, simply because more intelligent theists often idolize Plantinga (and to a lesser extent William Lane Craig) and rely heavily upon his work for their arguments.\n\nPlantinga's argument here makes a good point about respect, but ultimately fails to show that belief in a god does not require evidence.  It is true that atheists should not assume that theists are stupid or irrational simply because they believe in a god.  We should respect our opponents enough to understand their arguments and develop strong rebuttals.\n\nWhat Plantinga, and philosophers more generally, fail to account for is what we know from neuroscience and psychology; that is, that people *simply are* frequently, predictably, and at times incorrigibly, irrational.  First, it is possible for someone to be irrational with respect to one question or in a given situation, but to be intelligent and rational most of the time.  We all experience moments when our reasoning fails.  Therefore, it is not necessarily an insult to say that theistic belief is irrational.  \n\nSecond, someone could be justified in believing in a god based on the evidence that they have observed.  For example, someone who was raised in a religious household and was never exposed to skeptical thought could be justified, given what they know, in believing in a god.  However--and this is a crucial point--if that person were exposed to additional evidence that falsifies their belief in a god, but continued to maintain that belief, perhaps due to emotional attachment, [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias), or [motivated reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning), then it is proper (but admittedly unlikely to make the theist want to listen to what you have to say), to call them irrational.  \n\nPlantinga's argument also proves too much if we accept his conclusion for the sake of argument.  If what follows from Plantinga's argument is that evidence is irrelevant to belief in a god, then what prevents believers in Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, or ESP from making similar claims?  If all that is necessary for someone to hold a belief without evidence is for them to be insulted by charges of irrationality, then we will have to throw out the question of evidence entirely, for all claims.\n\nIt is also important to understand why, in his overarching [epistemology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_epistemology#Ideas), Plantinga holds that belief in a god is \"properly basic.\"  Plantinga argues that belief in a god is properly basic, because a god has designed our cognitive faculties to lead to a belief in a god when they are functioning properly.  Plantinga also believes that belief in a god arises from the \"[internal instigation of the holy spirit](http://books.google.com/books?id=34FKFPB0TtkC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=internal+instigation+of+the+holy+spirit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fEtv9cfmvW&amp;sig=XRw7ir0FKKL3AAY1yDdMJRbXDLA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EUroUIiiJIf89QS-k4D4DA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=internal%20instigation%20of%20the%20holy%20spirit&amp;f=false),\" whereby a god essentially implants faith in the mind of a theist prior to their conversion.  So Plantinga must first give positive arguments that a) our brains are designed by a god to lead to belief in a god, and b) that the \"holy spirit\" exists.

He walked though the crack, and to his surprise, there was a huge room. It was absolutely massive in size, so gigantic that he couldn't see the end of the room. Then, after a couple moments of joy, he heard the roar again. He ran a little further and stoop on top of a ledge that overlooked the area. He saw a head slowly rise... until the body of a giga-beast stared upon him. The beast itself was bigger than the room. Malcuss's first instinct was to run away, but he was paralyzed with fear. He looked back, and the group wasn't there... he realized that they had probably ditched him, and left him to die. He looked back at the beast, and it was staring straight into his eyes. Malcuss started praying for his life. He had no weapons or form of defense. The beast opened it's mouth... it was then that Malcuss realized that the beast was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era! The monster asked him for about tree fiddy. Malcuss screamed back \"dammit monster I aint givin you no tree fiddy!\". The monster slowly backed into his room, and Malcuss walked back home. The town praised him for his work, saying that the monster had been pestering them for the money for centuries and centuries.

{"body": "It's the most surreal, terrifying yet spiritual experience you will ever go through. It teaches you who you are as a human being and how little that can really mean (human being) while simultaneously how important the strive to push for basic 'human dignity' for all is important. It challenges your baser instincts for survival with our concepts of what is ethical or moral.\n\nIt was so long ago, yet still so clear in my mind. The day started as any other, waking up to a sticky insufferable heat, the inescapable kind that binds to the flesh, fuses to to you like a leech draining you leaving you vapid and void of life. It was day 42 of my 2 month excursion to find myself and see the world, its amazing to think how foolish I was back then, how I had it all figured out, I thought I was a world traveler, I thought I've seen the worst of humanity. I thought I'm not a tourist, tourist are yuppies who cling to 'safe places', they never experience the culture of the places they go to not like me, I take the road less traveled, I forge my own path I am the modern renaissance man, I was delusional to all fuck.\n\nI was on my way to the market right before lunch, I loved the markets always have always will. There is something to be said about being in amongst the people doing what they would do regardless of whether you are there or not. The market was always alive with a cacophony of noises, the clitter clatter of wares, the clucking of chickens, the songs of exotic birds, the timeless dance of merchants haggling for a measly few extra cents, aromatic smells both putrid and fragrant dance and meld as they waft through the air bringing a new life to every breeze and the sights, how much more different can you get from the familiarity of the North American shopping experience than to go to a market in a developing country, scenes unfathomable if not witnessed, there is something about the market that makes you feel at one with your fellow man.\n\nIt was getting into the late part of the afternoon and an ominous cloud was approaching, I had bought too much and was in too much of a rush to return to my hotel room quickly. I hailed a cab without taking the proper precautions, it was a private cab, I opened the door and heedlessly threw in my treasures from my day at the market. I told the driver the name of my hotel 'ok boss' and we were on our way. Perhaps I was just too preoccupied with my daily activities or I was just simply naive but I didn't notice we were no where near our hotel, until I had no idea where I was, nervously I asked the driver to which I got the reply 'no worry boss, shortcut', I felt nervous my spidey senses were telling me GET THE FUCK OUT NOW! I told him to stop and that I wanted to get out he abruptly interrupted and said 'NO boss, not safe place, you go out' and he motioned the slit your neck motion. I was terrified, I didn't know what to do, my life was in this strangers hand I could demand he stop and take my chances with the street or I could put my life in the hands of this man that I had met just moments prior. I made the wrong decision I put my trust in my fellow man, instead of putting my trust in my fellow men. We continued to weave through the streets of what was now getting to be the scary part of town, the parts where foreigners seldom see, and even more seldom return from. When he had locked the doors I did not notice but when I did he told me 'for safety'. By now we both knew that the game was up. The cab sped up until we reached our destination, it was the middle of the city, yet the middle of nowhere. 'time to meet Boss' he said, two men armed with large guns AK's to the best of my guess came and escorted me out the door, and by escort I mean hit me in the stomach with the butt of their gun and punch me in the face. FUCK FUCK FUCK, what the FUCK is going on what the fuck is happening, what the fuck is going to happen to me.  'I don't have much' I tried to mutter as they kicked me in my face, 'No talking'. The amount of fear I felt in this moment was insurmountable, it is one of those things that words only diminish. They dragged me in to see the 'boss' it was dark, he was noticeably larger than the other men, the fear they felt around him was palpable I could see it in their faces, I could tell in just how their bodies shrank as we entered the room. They threw me on the floor in front of him. 'Please sir' I begged in a cracked voice 'I don't have much money, I am not the son of a politician or even a wealthy man, there isn't much I can offer in return for my life' he stopped me looked me dead in the eyes with a piercing glare from the coldest eyes I have had the misfortune of gazing upon 'Not even tree fitty' 'God damn it lock Ness I ain't got no Tree fitty'.

See, my brother was the classic \"good son\". He was two years older and better at everything. He could play coach-pitch baseball, he had more belt loops than me on cub scouts, and he could run really fast. \nThis was my chance to be like my older brother, to make my pa proud. So when my coach said he wanted to give me \"extra help\" I was thrilled. Surely I would get moved out of deep, deep left field if the coach took an interest in me. At first it started innocently. Every week during practice while his wife worked with the rest of the kids on running the bases, he would take me back around the concession building and give me batting stance help, or little motivational speeches. Soon though, he started doing things I didn't realize were wrong until years later. Once e leaned in close and said \"I want you to do something for me Gravy...\", I told him I'd do anything, \"I need you to give me something..\". I asked him what, getting nervous now. He said, \"I need tree fiddy\". That's when I noticed that my kindly coach was really 500 foot tall monster from the paleozoic era. \"Goddamnit! Nessie, I ain't  giving you no tree fidy!\" I cursed, knowing now that I had lost any chance of pleasing my father. \n\nTL;DR never trust a man with glasses, even f he seems nice.

He said to me, \"Dubes, you are the star here, without you I would not be successful, I would be just another nerd.

We discovered that we only lived a couple miles from each other, and often frequented the same town with friends. So we set up abit of a date. I went into town with some friends, as did she. We both headed to the park. And at a pre-decided time, we both walked away from our groups nervously and to the small snack bar, promising ice creams for our friends. She got there a moment before. So I just said loudly...\"Jeez, when's 9her username) gonna get here.\" She span round and hugged me..I was happy as a thirteen year old boy, getting hugged by a girl. Big for me. So we started chatting, and after she ordered her Ice creams, she exclaimed\n\n\"Ahh damn! I'm short of money!\" She sighed, but my charm kicked in.\n\n\"How much do you need?\" Smiling, flashign a wink her way. \n\n\"Oh, about tree fiddy?\" She asked. And that was when I realised, that this girl I'd been talking to was actually a 18 foot tall crustacean from the paletholic era! \n\n\"Damn it Nessy!

{"body": "I was working behind the bar on a slow night and there was only one guy sitting all alone by the well.  I struck up a conversation with him since I was filling drink orders for the servers in the restaurant and he was sitting right across from me, and also because I fancy myself a decent bartender.  He seems pretty downtrodden; I had seen him in here before, but he looked pretty drab on this night.  He tells me that he and his old lady had split up the night before and that he had no place to go.  He says that she was cheating on him with his best friend and that his best friend was going to be staying in his own home, leaving him out on his ass.  His biggest concern was his 4 year old son though.  He told me about his cheating wife’s drug usage.  People were always coming in and out of the house to use and deal drugs and whatnot.  Meth, the drug of choice in this fine city of Riverside was hers as well.  He said that he had to get his kid out of that environment and they needed to find a place to stay.  He had been in my bar for the last 3 or 4 hours and I asked him if he had plans on getting his kid from the house and finding a place to stay for the night.  He tells me that he already had the kid, and he’d been out in the truck playing with his Gameboy the whole time.  I was outraged.  No matter how bad I felt for this guy, I still thought it was a piece of shit move to leave a 4 year old out in the parking lot for hours while he drank away his misery.  I told him that he needed to get his son, get a hotel room and get his life in order.  He says “nah, can’t stay in a hotel room, my wife has all my credit cards and I don’t have enough for a room.  I’ll probably stay in the camper shell tonight”.  Before I attempt to kick him out, I ask if he needs any numbers for temporary shelters, YMCA, anything of the sort.  He turns to me and says “I could use about tree fiddy”.  It was at this time I realized this down on his luck man was actually a crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "Well, first of all, if we assume your cut-throat game theory prisoner's dilemma approach (which luckily doesn't hold in the real world, for reasons I can address later) then this point would become an unavoidable weakness to collusion:\n\n&gt; There is no risk for majority of miners until it ceases to be majority. If somebody tries to go against this policy his mining will simply be lost in vain.\n\nThere is no way for miners to easily confirm that they are still \"a majority\". Any miners who want to publicly say they are for threshold X, but then they covertly countercollude (or just enough of them do it) to covertly mine blocks at lower thresholds and publish those looking like new third parties, could undermine any weak majority quite suddenly and individually profit instead of supporting their newly unionized industry.\n\nI don't think every rational actor has a realistic expectation to race all the way to the bottom though, I believe they have individual factors which lead them to aggregate, aided and abetted by human psychology by way of the cultural precept of \"dignity\".\n\nI predict that miners will tend towards a formula such as \"I need to earn XBTC per block in order to cover my expenses, including soft expenses like opportunity cost. XBTC - subsidy reward leaves YBTC transaction fees I need to rake in. Thus, I'm shutting the gear down until YBTC of fees are available to reap, and then I'll turn it back on.\"\n\nOne of the beauties of the mining lottery is that your revenue is a normal probability of your share of the rewards divided by your share of the hash rate per second you have your gear *actually switched on*. Shut your gear off, and you're maybe paying to amortize your capital and maybe paying for opportunity cost (or maybe you're [vanity address mining](https://vanitypool.appspot.com/)!) but you're not consuming electricity and you're not in danger of \"winning\" an anemic block. The instant you switch your gear on, you are convering electricity for an even money chance at getting the current block at it's current level of juiciness. :3\n\nThis means that when transaction volume is down, and thus the fees are down, individual blocks will slow to a lot longer than 10 minutes apiece. Once people start piling in or magnifying their txn rates, miners start switching on and the clock moves faster. You might even have web apps estimating a \"suggested\" txn rate for this time of day, to help keep things running smoothly.\n\nAnother factor is that all miners are liable to take on their own \"change\" threshold. Assuming we're nowhere near filling the blocks yet, it makes as much sense for a miner to throw away single satoshis as it does a hotel to turn away guests who are offering discarded bubblegum wrappers in exchange for a room. Yes, that room may go unoccupied otherwise, and yes a competitor of yours might score that bubblegum wrapper if you turn it away. It might be a whole tourbus full of bubblegum wrappers. But how many *million* wrappers would it take to surpass a change threshold whereby you can begin to register this as real money?\n\nZeno has the right idea, here. Infinite sums of infinitesimals do not necessarily diverge to infinity, nor do they converge onto princely sums of cash. They can easily converge into tree fiddy. A million txn supplicants (assuming your block could even hold that) each offering a satoshi are combined only worth a bitcent. Even if your expense is so close to zero that it's hard to measure, so is the revenue. Plus you're bloating the blockchain you'll have to maintain forever with these microtransactions, and you're setting a precident to harm your own dignity: you're advertising that you'll give out hotel rooms for gum wrappers rather than stand up for yourself and let them go unoccupied.\n\nAnd look at the hotel industry? Most hotel rooms go unoccupied on most non-peak travel days in almost every country, yet hotels still set their own thresholds for what they'll accept to rent out a room at quite a bit higher than their combined costs for the room, just to keep some air in their combined margin. This does not benefit them in the ultra short term, they turn away handfuls of singles of profit every day they stick to these guns, but it does profit them individually in the long term. By maintaining the expectation that the price is X, they groom the market to bear that cost and maintain profits higher by hundreds of dollars every day than they would if they sold out to short term gains.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357594059", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let's say you walk away from that shady street dealer and walk into a verizon or sprint store to buy an iPhone. The phone was made by sweatshop laborers who work in factories where suicide is so common that nets are placed under windows to catch people jumping off the roofs.\n\nMaybe you don't care about that, and maybe the guy who sold you the phone and got one sale closer to his monthly quota and bonus commission doesn't care either. After all, that mobile phone salesman has bills to pay and kids to feed and you want in iphone.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe you put that iPhone back on the counter, thank the salesman for his time and walk out of that sprint store telling yourself that that reliable yet unimpressive samsung model you have is good enough. \n\nSo you go about your merry way walking home and encounter a guy with a hotdog cart who sells you a couple foot longs and a soda. This hotdog vendor (who's name is Frank by the way) doesn't really care about where the meat he's making his hot dogs come from. For all he knows it could come from a factory farm where animals are horribly abused and treat inhumanely. Fortunately this is not the case. The meat comes from a free range farm upstate, but that wouldn't make any difference to Frank either way. He's got bills to pay, including alimony and child support to his shrew of an ex-wife so don't even get him started.\n\nAfter eating your hotdogs and washing them down with soda you head home and the on the way you run into an old co-worker (named Roy) who's moved onto another job. You guys get to talking and he asks about your underwear. You tell him that your is made of pancakes and that you believe it with all your heart despite any evidence to the contrary. Roy tries to poke holes in your belief, but you remain steadfast and even tell him that if he believes with all his heart his underwear will turn into pancakes too.\n\nAfter awhile, Roy comes around to your way of thinking, and he believes his underwear is made of pancakes. So once a week he puts syrup down his pants. After awhile, that's not enough for Roy so he decides that his son Todd needs to start doing the syrup cleansing ritual. Despite what his father tells him, Tod refuses to believe that his underwear is made of pancakes and refuses to put syrup down his pants. So Roy kicks Tod out of the house and cuts off his college fund. Helen (Roys second wife who gets along really well with her stepson Tod) flips the fuck out when she finds out about all of this and divorces Roy. \n\nRoy feels very sad and depressed to lose Helen, but feels it's part of the burden of having magical pancake underwear and goes forward with his life. After 3 months of living alone he starts to feel a pain in his crotch. It eventually gets so severe that he goes to the emergency room to find out what's wrong. The ER doctor tells Roy that he's got a serious skin infection brought on from months of not changing his underwear and filling them with syrup every few days. Roy says that it would be ridiculous to change his underwear, because the pancake material is self cleaning.\n\nThe doctor speaks at great length to explain to Roy that having pancake underwear doesn't protect a man from crotch rot (at this point Doctor Bill Mossly has long since given up trying to convince Roy that his underwear is made from syrup soaked cotton rather than pancakes). After showing Roy pictures of his nasty crotch and xrays of the infection spreading inside him, he says that he can perform an operation that will take care of the crotch rot, but it's gonna be expensive.\n\n\"How much is this gonna cost me Doctor Mossly?\" Roy asks\n\nDoctor Mossly looks him square in the eye and says \"I'm gonna need about Tree Fiddy.\"\n\nIt's at that moment that Roy realizes that Dr. Mossly is actually the Lochness Monster and shout \"You go away you stupid lochness monster! I aint givin you no tree fiddy!\" Roy leaves the hospital in a huff, goes home and pours a whole bottle of maple syrup down his pants. \n\nThree weeks later he's found dead in his home of crotch rot. At the funeral Helen and Tod glare at you icily and everyone else is whispering and glancing in your direction.\n\nThe point is, that just as not caring where ones money comes from can (but won't always) lead to someone profitting off the misery of others, not caring if what you believe is true can (but does not have to) lead to causing harm to oneself or others through ignorance.\n\nTL;DR Roy should have listened to the Lochness Monster instead of pouring more syrup down pants.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357637347", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

We got back to the car and I fiddled with the cd player and noticed a cop was watching me. I turned on the car and started driving off. The cop started following me. We were in the high traffic part. I stayed in one lane hoping he would turn off. Nope. Turned on those lights and pulled into a hotel area.\n\n Next thing I knew there 4 DAMN COP CARS pulling up behind him. Me and my friend were like WTF. They surround with at least 1 cop at each side of the car. The officer at my window asked for registration and license. I handed it over and he said he pulled me over because the tags didn't come up. I told him we had just gotten it from the dealer. He said fine and I thought it was over....\n\nThen he asked \"what's been burning in here?\" I played it dumb and asked what do you mean. \"Smells like something has been burning.\" I said my friend smoke cigarettes and handed him the pack. He smashed him and said \"no it aint cigarettes.\"  Now I acted kinda annoyed. \"Are you trying imply something officer?\" \n\nHe gave me the whole spill now that  I have heard about. Answer a bunch of questions no like do you have drugs, weapons, \"so don't mind me searching your car?\" Thinking I would say no. \"I'm sorry officer I don't feel comfortable giving you permission to search my car.\"   officer \" you know I can if I want to.\"  Me \"I know you can but I'm not gonna give you permission to.\"  This went on for about 10-15 minutes him threatening about what would happen when they found drugs and that I better let him search to make it easy. I just kept saying no I can't give that permission till a little old lady came out bitching about how they are blocking her hotel. \n\nThe cop then looks at me and reaches in (illegally I assume) and says he gonna pat my pockets. There is something squishy in my right pocket. He asks what is this. My heart races, I couldn't of been that stupid, I couldn't even remember where I put the weed I was so nervous. He pulls outs........ about tree fiddy...... fuck no I just had to say that.

It probably won't kill you but end up leaving you in a semi-catonic state and in the hospital for the next month in much pain. So please, if you're going to do it, DON'T do it this way. I strongly advise you to google \"failed aspirin suicide attempts\", and hopefully this will scare you enough to never try it again.\n\n\nCrazy to hear about the deafness you experienced. That would have bothered me to no end. The fact that you ended up just popping aspirin lets me know that deep down you don't want to die.  You're just in a confused state and looking for answers but finding none. I perused your profile a bit and saw that you post to /r/Athiesm, and especially your post about coaching Christians and even attending service with them.  I know you can't force yourself to believe in something (I'm the most skeptical person on the planet, I will never spend a dime on the lotto and I would never believe in the Loch Ness Monster unless he swallowed me up himself.  Ghosts, aliens, I believe it's all BS) but I encourage you to just give it a shot. \n\nLike I said I don't believe in anything metaphysical, yet I'm a fairly devout Christian working on improving myself.  And if anything, Christianity is the best stress reliever.  No point in stressing over big decisions when you believe God will be there to guide you, yknow? It lets me live my life with no reservations, and I'm able to forgive people immediately and nothing ever gets me down for too long.  That being said that doesn't mean I just sit on the couch and watch episodes of Pawn Stars back to back and expect God to just plant money in my fireplace for me.  I still have to get out there and bust my hump and make an honest living, &amp; I'm fine with that.  I look at God as more like the airbags and windshield wipers on a rainy swervy road.

{"body": "Femur fractures are sometimes treated with a rod that goes down the inside of the bone, termed an [intramedullary nail](http://www.hss.edu/images/articles/rigid-intramedullary-nail-femur-fracture.jpg). The rod is then locked into place with screws at the top and bottom of the rod. The screws are drilled through the bone, into the rod, and out the other side of the bone. Routine surgery for an orthopedic surgeon. \n\nSometimes the rod has to be removed, as was the case for Mrs. Smith, To remove the rod, an incision is made down to the very top of the rod, a [special handle](http://www.judd-medical.co.uk/images/shukla/Winquist%20III%20Universal%20Nail%20Extraction%20System.jpg) is screwed into the top so that a hammer can be used to \"back slap\" the rod out. Before removing the rod, however, all the screws have to be taken out first, obviously.\n\nObviously.\n\nExcept they weren't. \n\nIt turned out that Mrs. Smith's rod was a little harder to remove than normal. It took quite a bit of force hammering that rod extraction device. Slowly, bit by bit, blow by blow, the rod was removed from Mrs. Smith's femur. When it was about halfway out, it should have just slipped on out, but it wouldn't. So it was decided to check things out under x-ray.\n\nThat was the \"Oh Shit\" moment. The screws at the end of the rod had been dragged up through the bone with every hit. The femur had been split down the middle. \n\nWords were said. Gestures were made. The screws and rod were removed. Everything was fixed. When she finally awoke from surgery, it was realized she was about 500 ft tall and from the paleolithic era. She went on to sue the surgeon, the implant manufacturer, and the hospital for three dollars and fifty cents apiece, all of whom vehemently refused to pay.

As far as I knew everything was perfect (at least as much as it can be) and we dated for about a year before this happened. She asked me if I would like to have a threesome with another girl and I was intrigued but a bit worried that it would mess stuff up for us.  I made sure to tell her about a million times that if it bothered her in any way that I woul totally be fine with not doing it but he reassured me that it would be fine. So we started looking for a third an we ha a lot of trouble but eventually found this girl we will call Vanessa. So we decide that we will do it at Mary's moms house (parents are divorced). We get there and everything starts up great and we eventually take our clothes off. That's when we see that Vanessa has all sorts of scars on her inner thighs and I immediately am like holy shit this girls a cutter. She wasn't somebody we knew well so I was a bit worried already but I figured it would all be fine an that wed never see her again. So I don't say anything and we start banging and it progresses normally for a while when al the sudden Vanessa just throws my girlfriend down and starts shoving fingers in her and before I even know what's happening my girl is just yelling for her to stop but Vanessa pulled a surprise fisting and I rush over and try to get her to stop but I didn't want to just yank her hand out since that would hurt Mary so I hold her still and then we her the door starting to open an Mary's moms voice say, \"Mary are you alright? I thought I heard some screaming!\"  Then we start to freak and we try to get dressed but obviously her mom finds us and starts yelling about how we are heathens and shouldn't ever behave this way.

{"body": "My opinion is that there has not been evidence brought to my attention that would imply that there is a god, so I do not believe that any exist.  I would never try to say that I can prove that no gods exist, because the god concepts that have survived are (mostly) non-disprovable claims, which are worthless when it comes to matters of truth.  Personally, I don't think any gods exist, but I don't assert that as knowledge.  Much like Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and Russel's teapot, the most I will say is \"There is probably no god.\"  The more we learn about the universe, the more it seems to function perfectly well without any deities, and we are yet to come across a discovery that demands the existence of one.  Keep in mind that my saying \"there is probably no god\" is not part of what makes me an atheist.  The only thing that makes me one is the fact that I don't believe in any gods.\n\n\nThere are two definitions of atheism.  One is the lack of belief in any god being.  The other is the positive claim that there is no god.  The first definition is present in the second, but the second is NOT present in the first.  It would therefore follow that you would use the first to avoid confusion.  Always define your parameters for what you're saying.  If you ask me if I'm an atheist, and then explain that you are talking about the kind that asserts that there is no god, I will say \"No.\"  If you ask me if I'm an atheist in without any explanation, I will say \"Yes\", because it's accurate.  The only constant between the two definitions are that there is no belief in any god.  One of the definitions of atheism applies to me, just as it applies to you.  The function of language is to communicate ideas, so I make a point of taking the route with the smallest chance of misrepresentation.\n\nI realize that I've had to re-state the same thing repeatedly, but that's because you appear to be incapable of grasping the concept.  So, what is your opinion?  Because by your own words, you MUST have one.

{"body": "Well, my one is very meaningful to my personal life. And my regrets in it. And it's a **long** story.\n\nI met a girl on my second year in university. At first I didn't interact with her except for the polite hello and such but from the moment I laid eyes on her I wanted her. She was beautiful, and it didn't take me long to find out that she was smart,  funny, kind and the best person anyone could be. So I did finally ask her out, nothing amazing, just awkwardly asked if she wanted to go out for a meal sometimes, and we ended up dating for over 2 years. I would've proposed to her and I know she would've said yes but after our college life ended, she just said that she wanted to cut the cord. *everything*. She got a new number, she moved out of our apartment. It hurt me. It was the worst summer of my life.\n\nFast forward to 3 years later, 1996, my uni roommate from 1st year invited me to a house party and lo and behold *she* was there. With another guy. They'd been with each other for about 2 months by this stage. All the first feelings flooded back. I got talking to her and found that she was getting a train back with her guy home the next night at 10. I could see it in her that she had the same feelings returning but didn't say anything. The next day I went to the train station anyway, after hours of me convincing myself it was over. She saw me before he did. And before I gave up and left the station unnoticed (I thought). Well, she must've made up some excuse because she ran out seconds after I left the station,. We embraced and tenderly kissed. She whispered \"this day next year, this time. Ok?\". \n\nSo on the 26th January every year without fail for 6 years. We made weekends out of locking ourselves in a hotel room or going out to the fancy restaurants and such. She told me on the fourth year that she was married (different guy from the party). This took me by surprise but I ignored it on the the most part knowing that one day she'll leave him and we'd be together but when i mentioned this to her (year 6, 2002) she just stayed quiet. Year 7 came. She didn't come. I went to the station every day and waited the whole weekend. I had never tried to contact her -or her, me- aside from those weekends so I had no number but it wasn't that difficult to find it. I rang, maybe expecting to be told that she was in an accident, but it was her voice that picked up- sounding healthy and *content*. \n\nI blew it. I spent that whole following year going over and over what and when I should have done to get her, to **keep** her, my regrets. When I first saw her- it was about **THAT** time that I should've told her how I felt, asked her out. When we had reached our 2nd anniversary- it was about **THAT** time that I should've proposed. When she ran out of the station- it was about **THAT** time that I should've convinced her to stay and we'd be together forever.\n\nBut the real significance to my username came in 2012, June 16th. She came to my house - still the same house as all those years ago. She'd been crying. Her hair had blond in it. She didn't even need to say anything, I knew. But then those feelings of want and longing changed to hatred and in a split second I thought about the time I first saw her- it was about **THAT** time that I should've ran and not looked back. I thought about the time she moved out- it was about **THAT** time I should've moved far away, forgot about her and lived my life. \n\n*But then* the other feelings of love came back. How could I mess this up again?! So I held her and said \"Anything. I'll give you everything and anything\". She sobbed into my chest \"anything?\" \"anything.\" I confirmed. \nShe looked up at me dead in the eyes with those stunning green eyes and said \"well in that case, I'll take 'bout tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was *about* that time that I realised that that lil' love-o-mah-life was about 6 storeys tall and a giant crustacean from the Palaeolithic Era. And I said \"Damn Monstah, Get outta mah life! I ain't givin' you mah heart so you damn well ain't getting no tree fiddy!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357948986", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in the 7th grade, I would write erotic stories and show them to people. It started one day when me and a couple of my friends all had computer lab passes. We were in there without a teacher, and I decided to write one. They all read it, and laughed about it. I thought it'd be fun to write more. I wrote a bunch more at home and in my free time at school. It became a hobby. \n\nJust recently, I had read The Diary of Anne Frank. It was my favorite book. So, when I was done with all my work in Science class, I decided to use it as inspiration for my next short story. It started with Anne getting found in the attic. she got transported to the camp, where she found her old friend, Jacqueline. They were both desperate for sex, and decided to have some fun. I used my best handwriting while I wrote it. By recess, I was finished.\n\nMy friend Julie and I walked over to a table, and I showed it to her. She was reading it, when the recess monitor came over. \"What are you reading?\" he said. \"Nothing!\" Julie replied. Only, she said it with a voice that said, \"Yes, it is something you should read.\" He said, \"Let me see it!\" and took it from her hands. He read the first sentence and walked away. \"Holy crap!\" I exclaimed. A group of popular girls behind us saw what happened. and they knew what I had wrote. They were asking me about what type of stuff was in it, pleasuring themselves with the fact that I, the girl nobody liked, was getting in trouble for an erotic story. I walked over to play 4-square with some people. I finally got into square 2, which is hard for me, considering people like to gang up on me and get me out, when the monitor came back. He pulled me out and said, \"I read that.\" \"Don't get me in trouble. Please!\" \"I'll tell you what. As long as you promise me never to write anything like that at school again, I won't tell on you. Deal?\" \"Deal!\" I was shaking, but at least I was safe. \n\nNow, the bad news was that the monitor lived on my street, just 4 houses down from me. And when I went home, his 7 and 9 year old kids came to my door. \"Can you come outside and play?\" I already didn't like playing with them. For some reason, they still liked me, and I had no choice but to do it, so I did. We were riding our bikes up and down the block, throwing a ball around, when the oldest came up to me and said, \"My dad wants to talk to you.\" \n\nI was scared now. He was totally going to tell my parents. I walked over to him. \"Yes?\" \"I only skimmed it when I was at school, but I read the whole thing when I got back home. You probably think I'm going to tell your parents, right?\" I nodded. \"Here's the deal. I know at your age you're really interested in this stuff, and you write about it to express your feelings inside, but you can't be writing that at school. Soem people can make *millions* of dollars writing things like this. You could be one of those people! Just write it in the private of your own room. And I won't tell your parents on one condition.\" \"Yes?\" \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nThis was when I noticed that he was a 7 foot tall creature from the paleolithic era. That god damn loch ness monster ha got me again. \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I said, and walked away to enjoy my bike.

He walked up to us and asked “do any of you have 75 cents so I can make a phone call?”. We all searched our pockets but unfortunately came up empty handed. “Sorry man, none of us have any change”.  We walked into the store and I felt bad for not being able to help the guy out. I already gave him the right of way to pass me and I couldn’t even spare any change.  We spend some time in the market and I eventually forget that he was outside. Upon exiting, I see him again in the corner of my eye; he’s standing against the wall asking others for change and getting the same response.  I make it to my car and I felt bad that not one person could help the guy out. I scrounge around my car looking for change and found $2 in quarters. I drive up to the guy and get out of my car. He looks a bit worry-some. “Hey, do you still need that 75 cents? Here’s two bucks in quarters”. He looks me in the eyes and says \"...I need about tree-fiddy\". Now it was about that time that I realized I was actually talking to a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. I yelled, \"god dammed loch ness monster I ain't givin' you no tree-fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357975932", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "This reminds me of a story that happned to me before,\n\nI had this orange pet dragon when I was 6, I loved him, he and I were best friends I named him Willy after my grandpa who had just recently passed. Any who, willy and I were never apart he and I shared a friendship that saw both of us through dark days and we understood each other, ,well I understood him I could never tell if he understood me he was an orange dragon after all, it was when I turned 13 that I realize I was drifting apart from Willy because I found girls more interesting then my pet dragon whom I spent most of my life with. So like all teenage boys I forgot about Willy and slowly became seperated from him. After months of never really acknowledging him whenever I saw him he started to become ill,  this went on for several more months but because I never talked to him he never said anything about his illness  and because I knew that I couldnt stare into his deep hazel eyes again without immediately regretting the past months I never said anything again this went on for several months until one day Willy wasn't there when I went upstairs to my room he wasn't in his cage when I glanced over to it, All I saw was an open window and the cage door open. I knew that Willy was tired of waiting for me so he left and I never got a chance to say good bye. I did receive a post card from him last christmas he had met a woman, i forgot her name but it started with an n, nancy i think i'm not sure; and they started a nice little family he works construction and her for some tour guide company , they have about three kids so far and half a house that they share with an old couple . I never got to to say good bye to Willy I wish I would have so that I could apologize for the being a selfish teen and finally get some closure. Oh yeah her name was nessie she seemed nice in the picture a little tall, anyways what I'm trying to say is never forget the little people in your life because they can make a huge impact.

The fish part is from when i was a kid. \n\nWhen i was a kid i wouldnt stop talking, and being a child it starts off as cute but is mostly just annoying. So my dad, his friends, my brother, and I were on a boat fishing. being about 5 I really wasnt doing any fishing but rather running up and down the boat. Eventually i got really annoying, because they found a childs rod and put me at the other end of the boat. I got really bored of this and was really just looking around. I kept talking but no one was paying attention. No one was catching anything so it became even worse that i wouldnt shut up. I had to do something to get peoples attention so i yelled \"Fish, fish, i caught a fish.\" Everyone got really excited and ran back to see and help and then realized i lied. So everyone went back to what they were doing. About ten minutes later I did the same thing yelling \"Fish, fish, I caught a fish!\" They ran back and saw i caught nothing got even more annoyed and walked back to what they were doing. You can see where this is going, boy who cried wolf type thing. Third time caught something. Got excited and started yelling fish, but no one is coming. So I reach my hand in and it chomped on my hand as well. As im yelling i lift my hand and the fish out of the water. No one comes over. Fish is still gumming my fist. The fish while having its jaws around my fist asks me for about tree fiddy.

{"body": "&gt; Why would you believe any of that stuff when they keep changing their mind?\n\nThis point has been raised by a few well-known creationists and is irksome. (Not that you're a creationist, but it's what comes to mind.)  An example of \"science changing its mind\" is that of the estimate of the age of the Earth. There was a time when scientists had evidence that indicated that the Earth could not be any younger than millions of years. Later, that estimate was *billions* of years. Today, refinements continue to be made using a variety of independent dating methods. The current best estimate is 4.54 ± 0.05 Gyr. This means that scientists are statistically confident that the age is somewhere between 4.49 and 4.59 billion years old. So while it might look like science keeps changing its mind, what it's really doing is getting more accurate information using better evidence or better methods. \n\nSure, sometimes scientific ideas are wrong before they are corrected - but would you have it any other way? The *whole point of the scientific method is to systematically weed out incorrect ideas about how the universe works*.\n\nConsider also that even ideas that are not completely correct are still hugely useful. NASA put 12 astronauts on the moon, and it was Newtonian physics equations that they used. Einstein's relativity equations are of course far more accurate in more cases, but Newtonian physics was *good enough*. Newton, in the strictest sense, was wrong (or at least, was right under certain, limited conditions) but that doesn't matter for most kinds of physics problems.\n\n&gt; My answer: scientific materialism is just one more worldview. It will have its day and then humanity will get interested in something else.\n\nIf there would be something in the future that does a better job than the scientific method, then sure, I can agree with that. But, possibly due to a failure of imagination on my part, I can't see anything better coming along. \n\nAs for materialism: how would you propose we determine if something other than a purely materialistic universe existed? Such a universe could exist, I suppose, but in the absence of any evidence for it, why hold the view that it exists? As an analogy, consider that an invisible, odourless, silent, immaterial, and otherwise undetectable dragon is indistinguishable from a *non-existent* one.\n\n&gt; Ok, there are really two different questions in here. One about atheism (which some say is not a belief but the absence of a belief.. and one about the scientific process and the validity of theories.\n\nSpeaking only for myself, I'm an atheist simply because I feel theists have yet to meet their burden of proof. If I am to accept something as being true (within reason) I should have *some* credible evidence to go on. So far, I've not seen any. This kind of skepticism is a major component of the scientific method, so skepticism is your link, if you're looking for one. Not all atheists are skeptical this way - indeed, some atheists believe in ghosts and UFO abductions and bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358144863", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

She said she was the one who called. She introduced herself as Annie. I felt very lucky, for once I didn't have to help an old hag reach orgasm, I had a beautiful young girl. I clicked at once with her. She started talking to me and we had a surprisingly good conversation. She said that she had gotten involved in some bad people and the reason she was calling a male escort service was she just wanted some male company for a night. She knew she'd get a decent looking young man, and she hadn't had sex in awhile.\n\n\n&gt;Annie said was afraid to leave her apartment because the \"bad people\" was her exboyfriend. Apparently, he was involved in some gangsters and she broke up with him because she didn't like that. She told me the gangsters weren't normal hoodrats, they were pretty organized. She'd gotten death threats and was afraid to even call the police. So she stayed home. She'd been in her house for months, only going out to get some food from a grocery store a block down.\nShe feared for her life, basically.\n\n\n&gt;I felt bad for her and desperately wanted to comfort her. But I knew my place. I was a male hooker. So we started. Long story short, unlike my other clients I genuinely enjoyed this one. I liked the work for once.\nWe finished and layed in bed cuddling (even though that technically didn't come with what she paid for). After an hour or so I asked Annie if I could use her restroom. She said that would be OK so I got up and went piss. As I was shaking my penis to get the last drops of urine out, I heard a loud BANG and heard some glass shatter.\n\n\n&gt;I ran out to see what had happened, I assumed she had slipped or something but when I came in I was shocked at what I saw.\nShe was on the ground lying in her own blood. I saw a bullet wound on her neck. I ran to her and said,\n\n\n&gt;\"Annie Are You OK? So, Annie Are You OK Are You OK, Annie Annie Are You OK So, Annie Are You OK Are You OK, Annie Annie Are You OK So, Annie Are You OK Are You OK, Annie Annie Are You OK So, Annie Are You OK, Are You OK, Annie? You've Been Hit By, You've Been Struck By A Smooth Criminal\"\n\n\n&gt;So there's that.\n\n\n&gt;I quit shortly after this happened, you never know what's going to happen in that business. I'm happier now, anyways.\n\n\n&gt;TL;DR: Was hooker, saw client get shot.\nWhoever gave me Reddit gold.

{"body": "So it's late (I want to say about four in the morning or so), and my friends and I are leaving a bar in NYC. Usually we'd just take the subway since it was a pretty direct line from the station by bar to my friend's apartment, but we were with this one kid who liked to buy people shit when he was drunk, so we let him buy a cab for us. We figured it would've been easier... boy, were we wrong.\nA cab pulls over, and everything seems normal enough. I forget what he said his name was, but he was really chatty at first and seemed pleasant enough. We told him the fastest way to get home would probably be down Broadway, and he was just like, \"No, shortcut, shortcut!\"\nSo he's going up some street I didn't recognize and he's continually trying to make small talk even though we're starting to doubt his \"shortcut\" was even a real thing. Eventually, my one friend who lives in the city just yells at him and says, \"Sir, this isn't the way back to my apartment building. You're going in the wrong direction.\"\nThe guy apologizes and makes a turn down a sketchier street. We're all starting to get really uncomfortable. This is where shit hit the fan. He makes another turn and there's a cop car parked along the side of the street.\nImmediately upon seeing the cop car, he BOLTS. He accelerates and goes straight through a stop sign and gets the fuck outta there. The cop car immediately puts on his lights and follows us. We're freaking out in the back, screaming at this dude to stop. He's having a pseudo-panic attack and yelling at us, saying \"It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok!\"\nBut it's clearly not... he's zooming up and down back alleyways, going up the wrong way of a couple one-way streets, and just driving like an all-around maniac. The cop is continuing to chase us, but we are gradually getting away.\nObviously, we're freaking out in the back of the cab. Why the fuck did this taxi driver just go insane? All I knew was that he just panicked when he saw the cop car, so something was very, very wrong. For all I knew, we were going to be taken hostage or some shit. Basically everyone was in the back pissing their pants.\nSo he drives extremely crazy for another fifteen minutes, and luckily there's not much going on in the street since it's 4:30am. After not much longer, we can no longer see the cop car, and surprisingly, no other cops came (I was expecting a full-out chase with multiple cops).\nWe are all speechlessly freaked out at this point. He turns down this HELLA SKETCHY alley and my friends whispers we are in Spanish Harlem. The taxi driver turned off all his lights and goes \"keep it down and don't move.\" I actually tried to go for the door to get out and he goes, \"DON'T YOU DARE!\" So I folded my hands and shut the fuck up, not sure if he had a gun or some other kind of weapon.\nThere we are, three drunk guys and an insane cab driver sitting in a dark alley of Spanish Harlem. About a minute later, we watch as the cop car literally speeds past the road we just got off of - as if it is right out of a car chase in a movie or some shit. We're all sweating bullets and freaking out still. After a few more moments of us sitting there in silence, the cab driver turns around and says, \"Ok, you guys can get out now. Sorry, you're going to have to find another way home.\"\nWe just mutter something like \"Ok\" because we want to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. I go to open the door to leave and before I can get out, the driver yells, \"WAIT!\" I nervously turned to him, half expecting him to pull out a gun on me or something. He looks me straight in the eye and says, \"Your fare'll be about tree fiddy.\"\nIt was at that exact moment that I realized our cab driver was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era!

{"body": "I've seen responses to these posts worded a lot like this getting huge upvotes, so let's see how this works for me.\n\nFor me, it's kind of like when you dream you're at work.  Not much fun, right?  Except that your job was digging up recent corpses and picking out all of the maggots and eating them.  You have this dream almost every night, and sometimes you wake up and start crying because you had that dream yet again, and you know it's never going to stop.  Sometimes you just rage in frustration.  You know it's over when you're awake, but when you're asleep, you dont.  Whatever you do, you're not going back to sleep.  Again.\n\nYou avoid going out because seeing funeral homes or cemeteries, or a funeral procession brings back all those memories of all those maggots you ate.  You avoid people because they get a little weirded out when you drive sixteen blocks out of your way to avoid a street with a business that has a sign that looks a little bit like a maggot in the right light.  (assuming you can drive at all)  You cant even look at a plate of rice.  So you cant eat out very often.  Sometimes just random stuff you see reminds you of that really nasty nasty stuff, and you might remember that horrible fat guy with all those extra-chewy maggots.  You pound your temples with your fists trying to get that memory out.  You try thinking about anything else, but it's like trying not to read text under a picture of Morgan Freeman in his voice.  Good luck with that.  Meanwhile, you're screaming inside 'Oh god, not again!'\n\nHmmmm, let's see - yeah, relationships are hard.  Not many people spent years eating corpse maggots.  They only vaguely understand how they might feel if they had to.  They dont really know what the texture of maggot is like, or the taste, or how hard it was to get those little suckers that hid inside the joints.  And they dont like what you do to stop the memories.  So you're likely to be a lonely Redditor up all hours day and night reading anything that can distract you.  Kewl.\n\nYou hate your brain with a passion.  You hate almost everything about yourself.  You feel too different.  You dont get to laugh at jokes everyone else gets to.  Most times, you cant even pretend to.  You can try smiling and jiggling around in your seat like you're laughing inside and hope nobody else notices with all the noise they're making.  And you know you're lying to your friends.  Assuming you have any left.\n\nYou get really good at controlling yourself.  You spend so much time hiding what's going on inside you that nothing at all gets out.  So there's ancillary problems galore.  You're likely to speak very very softly.  You know very well all of the physical sensations of being excited or angry because you're so busy clamping that stuff down fast before it gets out of control.\n\nNot much else matters in your life.  What does it matter if you have blueberry syrup on your waffles or regular maple syrup?  Who the hell cares about what color your couch is?  As long as it's not an organic tint, you're fine with whatever.  Your home reflects this.  It's either an unholy mess, or there's nothing at all in it besides a bed, table, chair, and distraction equipment.  You're likely to use the distraction equipment an unhealthy amount of time, with special intensity.\n\nYou're probably going to be pretty negative as a rule.  Your first response to new situations is unlikely to be happy curiosity.  You are going to approach it with an extreme caution born of long experience with nasty surprises.\n\nThere's other stuff too, but my finger hurts now.\n\nTL;DR:  Never give a Loch Ness monster tree fiddy.\n\nEDIT:  Ok, sorry for that last line, I just dont like mentioning 'it', and I've been looking for a chance to use that bit from South Park anyway.  I feel kind of hopeless about the whole thing - my psych's official assessment prognosis, word-for-word, is \"Generally, individuals who respond in this way have had chronic psychological problems, are expected to be difficult to treat, have a depressive or anxious outlook, and may engage in irrational thought processes when stressed.\"  I'll leave the 'Responses to what' part in the dark, as well as more colorful responses.

It was unusually hot that day, but we didn't care because it was Friday. My friends and I head home on our usual walk. We were supposed to take the bus, but we walked home a lot so we could hang out and smoke cigarettes. \n\nOn our travels, we stopped at a friends house who had long since dropped out. He stayed at home all day, looking for ways to score drugs. We would stop over to smoke pot, since his parents were never home, and he would usually con us somehow so he could score pills. Not really sure why we did it, but we were kids, ya' know? \n\nWe packed a bowl, his name was Jimmy BTW, and he started giggling before it was even lit. \"Jimmy, what the hell is wrong with you?\" I asked. He pulled out a bag of the most foul smelling things I've ever placed my nose near. I was instructed to eat them, and we'd be on the same plane as Jimmy. \n\nMind you this is 3 o'clock, still early. We ate them, thinking mushrooms only lasted as long as weed. Boy, were we wrong. All night, Jimmy, my friend and I caused mischief around our town. We stole over 50 \"For Sale\" signs, about 15 graduation banners, and constructed a pirate ship in the nearby creek. We were in the paper and everything, it was a miracle we didn't get arrested.\n\nThe next day Jimmy knocked up at my house. He looked pale, and terrified as if something was on his mind. I asked him, \"what's up Jimmy?\" He replied \"dude, I got caught. I was wondering if you could help with my legal fees.\" I instantly felt guilty, I knew I had a large part to do with what had transpired. \"Sure Jimmy, what do you need?\" He leaned in close and paused for a second before saying \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time that I noticed Jimmy was 8-stories high and was a crustacean from the Palezoic Era. I said, \"damnit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree fiddy.\" It said, \"how about just two fiddy?\" I said, \"oh now it's only two fiddy! What is there?

{"body": "&gt; Ah! So you mean that despite being no evidence that explains creationism, dinosaurs or nessie in the bible\n\nWell no, there is plenty of evidence to support creationism in the bible.  The first book in fact, Genesis, describes exactly how it happened.  So that's what is believed by creationists.\n\n&gt; the lack of evidence to disapprove Christianity in creationism is enough for people to believe it?\n\nIt's worth noting that many people (Chrstians included) don't consider \"disproving\" creationism to be possible (scientists would say it's \"unfalsifiable\"), and even if it were possible it wouldn't \"disprove\" Christianity, as the latter is argued to not be dependent on creationism.\n\n&gt; Is there a named authority behind creationism? A branch of some church or such?\n\nIt's rooted in a more literal interpretation of the bible which is more common among protestant churches (not as much catholic churches), and in the US most common among baptist churches although they aren't compeltely centralized in their beliefs and structure like the catholic church is so not every baptist and not every baptist church would preach this.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358343270", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Funny you should say that. I read a Times article last year that implied that some then-untranslatable code was found amongst the ruins of the Tunguska Event of 1908, encoded in the exposed bedrock. Russian scientists from the Krasnoyarsk Scientific Institute (not sure of the official cyrillic abbreviation) excavated various samples from the site and discovered the code on a large, eerily flat piece of exposed rock. The code was written in the polarisations of the metals in the rock. If you're geologically-minded you'd know that, when rock is in a molten state, its metal content tends to point towards magnetic north, solidifying in that position when the magma cools into a regular old rock. The metallic fragmants in this specimen appeared to be in a binary code - some pointing north, others (seemingly impossibly for one flat piece of rock) pointing east-west.\n\nNaturally, it was kept in the laboratory under safekeeping for a number of years, kept away from public or government eyes for obvious reasons, only to be uncovered by a student in the early seventies, who recognised some of the patterns as being reminscent of 70s computer software. Some years of testing and codebreaking made few revelations - the cypher was simply too hard to decrypt, until the eighties whereby an early Commodore 64 unit seemed able to translate parts of the code. Work began again on deciphering it, and the scientists finally found success in 1994 when they got the program running on an IBM computer. The program appeared to be that of a arcade game, one that featured strange, futuristic guns and a number of sprites that resembled the above Pog. The game played like a strange cross between the game Cannon Fodder - a popular game in 1994, 'coincidentally' the time that home computing became advanced enough to run the program - and Halo as we know it today, albeit without the first person shooter elements for obvious reasons. The ancient code also appeared to predict the nature of 90s arcade machines, with a regular prompt for the user to insert coins in order to continue to play the game, albeit in an odd language. When the researchers checked the game's subroutines, they found that the program appeared to require 'about tree fiddy' and that, on further inspection, was infact 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. The Russian scientists, in a statement on a Moscow scientific journal, stated that 'Бог черт возьми Лох-Несс чудовище Я не даю вам никаких деревьев пятьдесят'.\n\nThe matter was, as you'd expect, swept under the carpet quite quickly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358385954", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 187, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was a young boy, I spent a lot of time with my grandfather. He was a contractor, and my grandmother was a stay at home mom. He didn't really get to see my father grow up, and he deeply regretted it.\nSo when he saw the same thing happening with me and my father (we lived in a duplex or whatever you call it, a two family house), he almost took over that role in my life. He was retired, so he had the time. \nI was always very close to him for this reason...\nHe taught me how to fish.\nHe taught me how to fight.\nHe taught me how to talk to girls (or, tried to at least).\nAnd he was a HUGE, huge huge huge believer in urban legends. ufo's and aliens, the Loch Ness Monster, bigfoot etc etc. He always told me stories of these urban legends instead of reading me a bed time story.\nHe really was my father figure, moreso than my father who worked a lot to support us. \nHe wasn't in very good shape as I got to my mid teenage years, and after my grandma suddenly passed, he got exponentially worse. Towards the end of his life, he started to develop alzheimers and schitzophrenia, as some do unfortunately. \n\nHe honestly believed that people would try to break into his house while he was asleep, or that people were following him as he walked to the gas station (200 feet down the road).\n\nI, of course, was devestated. It took a huge toll on me to see him like that. I wished that he would just pass in his sleep like my grandmother did. Instead, he just steadily declined to the point where he was on hospice\n\nIt got worse and worse, to the point where he barely recognized his son, I was COMPLETELY forgotten. \n\nThen, on his death bed (the nurse said they didn't expect him to make it through the night), it was like his head just magically cleared up. He looked around at all of us, and cried.\n\nMy parents went over and talked to him softly for a little while, and then stepped aside and he beckoned me over. He gave me a little note and told me I'd know when to open it. then he gave me vhs, and told me he loved me. I told him I loved him to, and went to my bed and cried, all night. When I woke up, my parents told me he had passed, and I stayed home from school. Towards the middle of the day, I popped in the vhs. It was one of those Tales of Loch Ness shows that we would always watch together. Of course I watched it, and at the end, it was a little recording of him. Apparently, in one of his clearer moments, he had used the end of the tape and my fathers video camera to leave me a message. \n\nThe message was about how much he loved me, and how proud of me he was, and to always listen to my father. The typical thing you would expect. Just as he got silent and started to look like he was done, and just as I was reaching to eject it, he cleared his throat. He looked right at me and said,\n\n\"Nathan, just one more thing.\"\n\nI felt like, moreso than in the rest of the video, he was actually talking to me. \n\nHe said to me-\n\n\"Nathan,\nI know we haven't been able to give you the best life here,\nand I also know you appreciate everything we HAVE done, your mother, father, grandmother and I. There's just something I need from you.\nNathan....\n\nI need about tree fiddy.\"\n\n\nJust then, he burst out da tv and I yelled \nGOD DAMN LOCH NESS MONSTA I TELL YOU I AINT GIVEN YOU NO TREE FIDDY!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358490630", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I noticed on the bottom of the pile that we had an Ouija board, and it caught my attention.\n\nWhen everyone went to bed all huddled up, I stole the board and went into the basement. Now keep in mind, my Dad kept a LOT of fish tanks, and had just about every fish imaginable at the fish store. There it is, the board just sitting in front of me, with the cursor just staring back at me with my reflection. I grab my silver spoon, and start using the board.\n\n\"T\" starts to pop in, and the next \"r\", \"e\",\"e\",\"f\",\"i\",\"d\",\"d\",\"y,\"...

If you had been brought up and told another man (assuming you're male) touching you or kissing you or showing any sign of affection was bad, and if it happened told repeatedly you were a victim and how -brave- you were for telling people what happened so they could take the bad man away, pretty soon homosexuals would cause psychological harm to anyone they found attractive.\n\nIt's exactly the same principle. Children are sexually experimental from the age of five or younger, and are more than capable of physically consenting to sex, what is sex? it's nothing *special*, we've just labelled it as much. The psychological harm comes because a child is constantly *treated* as a victim and told they had been abused and the adult was bad. Eventually they'll start to believe it, and society has us telling them that from birth. Couple that with the fact paedophilia is inherently illegal, which means that regular, none criminal paedophiles will go out of their way to try and keep an affair secret, tell the child it's a scret and they mustn't tell anyone or else something bad'll happen. Or even keep the child quiet through force. They're not things the paedophile *wants* to do, it's done in need of self preservation.\n\n\nthere are criminals, and monsters in this world.

{"body": "Well, I went once and I can give you a detailed explanation of what happened to me.  \nIt was after watching an episode of Pawn Stars that I got inspired to see if I could game the system at my local pawn shop.  \nYou see, when I was a little boy, my grandfather had an old Smith &amp; Wesson model 1 that he let the kids play with.  Now, he had filled the barrel with cement, so it would never be able to fire a shot, but we could still play cowboys and Indians with it. My grandparents passed about ten years ago, and I asked my mother if I could have the old gun.  It was just sitting in a box, and after a little research I found that a good condition model 1 could get $800-$1200 at auction.  Easy $500 at a pawn shop I figured.  I try to clean up the gun as best I can, scraping off dirt and spots of rust, and I wrap it in a fancy handkerchief I found.  \nI've never actually been to a pawn shop before, so I was a little nervous about how to sell something, so I just wandered around the store for a bit, trying to slyly see if anyone else was selling to the shop.  It was pretty quiet, only a couple of other customers browsing and the left soon enough.  Mustering up some courage, I pulled the handkerchief wrapped antique from my pocket as I walked up to the counter.  Not thinking quite straight, still nervous, I revealed the gun and said, \"I have a gun I'd like to sell.\"  \n\"OK\" said the man at the counter, Is it registered?  \nNot even thinking that I might need some legal documents to sell a gun, I had never asked my mom about it.  I told the guy that it was just an old antique I got from my grandfather.  \n\"Wait here,\" he said. \"I'll get the owner.\"  The guy then walks off into the back, and in a minute, he comes out with a skinny old guy.  \n\"Hi, lets see this gun.\" says the old man.  I hand it over.  “Well, it's in pretty rough shape and I'll have to check my books for an exact price, but I think I can easily offer you three hundred dollars.\"  \nNow, I had seen much better prices online, but I knew this guy would try to low-ball me, so I quickly countered. \"I saw these listed at $800, but I figured I could get at least $600 cash to pawn it.\"  \nThe old guy gave a sly smile, now getting into the game. \"This isn't an antique store kid, If the books show a good price, I might be able to go up to $400.\"  \nI was rushing with adrenaline now, \"This is a family heirloom, surely you can do better than $400?\"  \nHe stands there looking at the gun, shifting it side to side and humming to himself for a few seconds. \"Well, I suppose, HEY!  The barrel is full of cement, I can't sell this!\"  \nI was taken aback.  \"What?  What’s wrong with the cement? Can’t you just clean it out?\" \nHe shook his head, “The guns gonna be damaged no matter what now, I can't sell this as an antique, It's just a paperweight now.\"  \nHeartbroken, I stammered out a desperate reply, \"Can you give me $100 for it?\" \nHe looked at me with a surprised and questioning gaze.  \n\"Fifty bucks?  I'm sure you can find someone to buy it from you!\"  \nHe placed the gun on the counter and said \"It's not worth our time to try to sell this junk, sorry.\" \n\"Well,\" I said, \"how about tree fiddy?\" It was at this time the pawn shop owner noticed I was about 500 feet tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. \"Get outta my store!  I aint gonna give you tree fiddy, you damn Loch Ness Monster!\"  \nSo I grab my gun, and leave the store. I can't believe they wouldn't give me anything for that old gun. It's still got some sentimental value to me, so I keep it on a shelf in my room.  Sometimes when I look at it, thinking of my grandfather, I pick up the phone and give that pawn shop a call and ask if they have Battletoads.\n\n\n**TL;DR - Tried to nervously sell a gun at a pawnshop, they got the wrong idea and I almost got in a lot of trouble.**\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358577229", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I actually was able to glitch into the core one time!!\n\nIt was about a year ago, when SK was buggy was hell, and I was spamming Vanaduke fights. Well, on one particular time, I decided I would go to the core, instead of skipping it. Now anyone who has been to the core, must know that the lag increases. I see it not lag, but it is in game pressure, gravity. Think about it, you're waaaaay below, THE CORE, so yeah.\n\nAnyways, I was walking up, andd my lag was HORRIBLE. I was flying and zipping and it was just bad on a Stick. All of the sudden I was walking above where the closed core was! Suddenly, the core opened up! Apprerently that's all it takes! I was so excited! It was just like an elevator, so I took it down.\n\nOnce down there, a cute innocent Spiral Guide greeted me, and took me through the core. Its 3 depths and then the boss. Once at the boss floor, the Spiral Guide says \"Hold and Behold brave knight! The monster, the foul beast that has caused disorder in the world! Are you ready?\" Eager with anticipation, and sweaty from being Snes, I was ready. But for whatever reason, I couldn't get in. What?\n\nFinally, I decided to talk to the Spiral Guide again. \"What's Wrong Snesknight?\" He asked, \"can't you get in?\" No, that's why I'm talking to you, I though. \"You must know the secret of the core, before you enter\". Well what's the secret? \"I can't tell you. You must first give me something.\" I was upset. Fine, I thought. Ill give you whatever you want, name it. \"Really?, he asked. I was ready. What would he ask for? All SL items? My 5* weapon? What?! I asked him again, \"what do you need?\" He said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about this time I noticed that this Spiral Guide was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era! He was the Lock Snes Monster.\n\nI says \"Damit monster! There is no core!

When i went to school my friends rarely talked about it and when they did i was kind of shy about it because i had nothing to contribute. When i was 16 my periods did not start yet. My interest in boys grew and i fantasized about pleasuring myself. I was always afraid my mom could tell or something so i never did i (o god i wish i would have). So this one weekend my parent where out of town and i decided to discover myself. I was very afraid to put a finger in ( i had never used tampons ofc), i tried but i hit something that felt different. I grabbed a mirror and looked down there. What is saw what like a little bump that has different color and texture of the tissue around it. I decided to poke it and suddenly it started to move came out of there, i saw tow little eyes looking at me and it said, I need about tree fiddy.

Just like how the book Animal Farm may be about a farm governed by animals if you read it as a child but it is also about communist Russia under the leadership of Stalin if you understand it as an intelligent adult.\n\nYou can't read these texts with the mentality of a child and understand them, this is the mistake that most biblical literalists make, they simply aren't intelligent enough to see beyond the most obvious components of the story.\n\nThe story of Adam and Eve is an allegory referring to human kind and it's adjustment from the paleolithic era of hunter-gatherer societies into the neolithic era of subsistence farming and increasing population density which lead to widespread disease and conflict. Take a history of science and technology course sometime and you will understand this. Our rampant procreation lead to ballooning population sizes which necessitated the development of agriculture. This increased knowledge of the natural world (symbolized by the eating of the fruit) caused our society to change in ways that are very similar to being thrown out of the symbolic garden and into a life of hardship. As we began settling into towns and cities our close proximity to each other coupled with our general uncleanliness and lack of modern medical knowledge caused massive plagues. In addition we began forming armies and warring with neighboring city-states. One of my professors in college stated that the paleolithic era was like a paradise compared to this era of human history and that prior to that there were no plagues, no wars, and little hardship until we started procreating beyond the ability for nature to sustain us.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358716506", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The Miller-Urey experiment was an attempt to recreate the conditions of the early Earth, to simulate spontaneous reactions that could have happened under those circumstances. Obviously, the researchers had to consciously devise the experiment, since they didn't exactly have the option of *visiting* the early Earth to make direct observations. I'm sure that if you have a time machine available for scientific research, plenty of universities would be happy to contract you for its use, provided all the Doc Brown-style paradoxes are considered in advance. The experiment has no relation to the fraud of \"intelligent design,\" as used to describe the attempt to shroud Christian mythology in pseudoscience and sneak it into school curricula, so don't conflate the two.\n\nI am quite tired of this nonsense as well. First of all, you continue to misconstrue scientific research in a manner that's quickly become apparent as willful ignorance. The Bada-Cleaves research *solved* a problem in abiogenetic theory, rather than *creating* one, in proposing a pathway by which terrestrial amino acids could survive nitrite destruction. Secondly, none of what you've provided constitutes evidence. There is no archaeological evidence, for instance, that the Israelites were ever even *in* Egypt, so vague allegations that a \"farmer... led a nation to freedom\" isn't doing anything to help your case. Neither is your similarly vague statement that \"Moses had many claims well before his time.\" Like what? Something that's scientifically defensible? Would you care to provide an example of some piece of scientific knowledge to which he was privy, before his time?\n\nYou know why there isn't a Moses in the modern day? Because we have cameras. Because when someone claims to see something incredible, like Bigfoot, or the Loch Ness monster, or someone walking on water, or rivers turning to blood, we ask them, \"Where's the proof?\" There is none.

{"body": "There was this girl I really liked back in high school and I think she was pretty into me too at the time.  We would spend hours together after school let out; doing homework, hanging out, playing games, and watching movie.  So, in other words, teenager stuff. \n\n\nBeing a very shy, socially awkward penguin as a kid, I never had the nerve to sack up and just tell her how I felt, even though I desperately wanted to.  It was compounded by the fact that her father absolutely hated me (he thought I was a bad influence, for some reason) and would always grill her after we were together.  He was a big man, too, about 6’3” and 230 lbs, broad-shouldered, intimidating as fuck.\n\n\nWell, one night, while drunk, I decided the best course of action was to call her and confess my feelings to her, despite the fact I may very well lose my best friend in the process.  When I called, I ended up getting her father (yay landlines) and very clumsily and drunkenly tried to, first, ask for his daughter and then, second, disengage myself from the situation.  After about ten minutes of rambling and stammering, and making what was essentially a drunken ass out of myself he screamed at me that he never wanted me to see his daughter again and slammed the phone down on so hard I almost felt it on my end.  My heart sunk and I spent the rest of the night crying my eyes out.\n\n\nI didn’t see my girl for about 3 months outside of our classes and even then things were tense and awkward but I felt like if I could do something big to show her how I felt it would work out.  What can I say, I was a dumb kid raised on stupid teen movies and rom-coms.  I decided that I’d do it at homecoming because I certainly hadn’t moved on by that time and I knew that neither had she.\n\n\nThe night comes, I dress up in the best suit you can buy from Good Will and go to the dance that was being held in the gym, we were classy, and decorated with a plethora of faded paper streamers and recycled Christmas lights.  It was pretty lame, even for mid-western standards.  Anyway, I digress.  I’m sweating bullets and my social anxiety didn’t make it any better.  She was there, beautiful as always, but I couldn’t do anything more than stare across the gym at her.  I just couldn’t sack up.\n\n\nNaturally, the conclusion I came to was to take a couple shots.  Courage in a jar, right?  Well…a couple lead to several and several lead to me being absolutely shit-faced.   It did make me courageous though and I stumbled onto the stage the band was playing on, mid song, took that micro-phone and drunkenly shouted that I loved her.  Everyone absolutely stopped.  Dead.  Even thinking about it 11 years later makes me cringe, it was that bad.  I look at her, only her, the other people didn’t even register and she looked so uncomfortable.  Then she looked away and shook her head.  It was around then that everyone started chuckling and laughing.  I wanted to die again.  The girl of my dreams turns to walk out and in my haste to chase after her, I fall off the stage.  Going great here.  I finally catch up to her, grab her arm to stop her.  I can’t let it end like this…\n\n\n…But alas, she turns around, looks me in the eyes, her own big blues wet, and says very softly, “I might be able to love you back if you could borrow me three fiddy.”  Goddamnit!  It was about that time that I realized the girl of my dreams was a 30 foot tall monster from the late Cretaceous period in a dress!  That goddamn Loch Ness monster had gotten me again!  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358895209", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Granted, they're commonly discussed topics amongst people interested in the singularity - but saying that, placed in this order, they constitute a definition of the singularity is like saying “time travel is the hypothesis that researchers can be transported back to the paleolithic era, where they'll have to avoid stepping on butterflies, lest they be slowly erased both from reality and from their own photographs.”  No, that is NOT time travel, lazy article writer - that is a mashup of various ideas associated with time travel, like some youtube remix that fails to give proper accreditation to the original artists and separate the very different hypotheses involved.  \n\nSo I'll do it for you:\n\n1. One popular definition of the singularity is “the emergence of greater than human superintelligence”.  This could perfectly well involve normal, biological people upgrading their native intelligence by external, mechanical means - like an exoskeleton for thinking.  No AI, no uploading, still a singularity.  Therefore hypothesis 1 is cut off from 2 and 3.\n\n2. AI wouldn't produce a singularity unless it upgraded itself to be superhumanly intelligent (granted, as commonly understood, there wouldn't be much barrier to its doing this, so I'll agree that 1 and 2 share the strongest link between these three concepts - but it's still sloppy to equate the two).  Further, AI could perfectly well exist without enabling mental uploading: maybe it would run on a fundamentally different hardware than whatever it is that human brains run (VHS vs betamax?), so we could create an artificial mind that thinks *as well as* a human (or better) but not *like* a human - think of how a mechanical motor can lift more than human muscle, doing some of the tasks human muscle often used to be used for, without ever being mistakable for human muscle.  Therefore, AI is synonymous with neither the singularity nor with uploading, and option 2 is cut free from 1 and 3.  And, finally,\n\n3. Uploading could exist without AI and without a singularity.  Think of how we can, now, take a more realistic video of a human face than we can produce from scratch by digital means (think of the scene where rubber-Shia gets tossed over Starscream's head in transformers 3 ... spoilers) - even though the resulting video of a real human face can then be altered digitally, uploaded to digital mediums, etc.  What if uploading starts like that - we can copy personality-profiles to digital mediums and semi-convincingly alter them (though not to the point of superintelligence), but not convincingly produce them from scratch?  Then we'd have uploading without AGI, and without singularity.\n\nQED - the definition of the singularity as “AI enabled mental uploading” is false in 9 ways - it fails to differentiate between 3 ideas that exist separately.  \n\n3 X 3 = wrong X 9.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359073754", "subreddit": "singularity", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms. She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet. His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name. Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.\nJoe didn't give a shit. He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either. Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom. His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\". His name was now legally Adam Adams. Why? All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe, my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it. He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember. But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage. The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me. Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son. This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on. She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does. My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story. She does. Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words). While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out.\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved. After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad. I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story. When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her. She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy\"\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again. But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one.\n\ntldr: Friends mom being an overprotective bitch, i yell at her for it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359091508", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 27, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Back in 1992 I was working on an expedition in the lower Nile region when we came across an anomaly in our radar shoots. Further investigation seemed to confirm that there was a structure underground. We began digging, and did in fact discover a small tomb-like structure buried under a few meters of sand. You may recall reading about this in the papers.\n\nFunding for our project was in danger of being cut, so we threw all our money into this project like there was no tomorrow. After days of safety checks, we were clear the proceed into the structure. It took some forcing, but the door eventually opened. Surprisingly, the smell was not bad at all. We entered the tomb and immediately noticed that, somehow, this tomb was built over a small stream. The structure seemed purposefully built in that way, because the stream had been coerced into running through a duct structure, filled with sealed pots. A small sarcophagus lay on the opposite of the room, hieroglyphs seemed to tell a story across the wall. We immediately began to secure the area and wire our higher-ups.\n\nWanting to know what was in the pots, the woman who assigned us ordered us to open one up. I objected, but she assured me we'd be cut if we didn't. So, we went ahead. Inside of the pots was a small apparatus that allowed water to wet sand, which covered another pot. The second pot was unbearably hard to open. We wired our higher up, and the moron told us to break open the pot. We had an Egyptologist from Yale on our team who almost shit herself out of anger.\n\nNevertheless, we did it. We grabbed a hammer and made a crack in the pot, which broke a seal. The lid came right off. Inside was the most surprising thing I'd seen in my life. Three small pastry-like things. Surprised as hell, we had them sent back to HQ in Cairo ASAP for testing. While we continued excavating, we later discovered that we had found a pastry made from rough grain, coated in hardened honey, and even filled with a berry mixture. Apparently keeping the sand wet and cold allowed the pastries to be \"canned\". The pot, as we later found out, had been heated and placed in the larger one, allowing for that \"canned\" effect.\n\nThis was a big media event back then, and CNN even covered an event we had during which we cut up one of the pastries and each had a bite (as our physician had pronounced them safe to eat). Still, our happiest accomplishment was finally opening the sarcophagus. Our physician and his team had sterilized the room and invited us in, and as the opened the ancient box we were overwhelmed with the odd feeling of seeing the man who created those pastries.\n\nBecause, you see, the story on the walls of the tomb had been translated. A rough translation told a story of a man who was \"of the pastries\" (Egyptologist's quote, not mine). His wife, jealous, murdered him with poison. To memorialize him, he was buried with those pots of pastries (only about 5 of the 13 were safe to consume). Still, it was odd eating something canned thousands of years ago.\n\nAs a gesture of goodwill towards \"the spirits\", one of the Iraqi physicians working with ours wanted us to pay thanks to the man. So, in a rather macabre display, we all leaned over and simply said, \"thank you\". \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy,\" he replied. That was when I noticed he was actually 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "I've been on the receiving end of this from a student who was clearly trying to improve their grade. I was working in Philadelphia at the time as a substitute teacher for a college history class. Their original teacher had been diagnosed with cancer and was taking the time off to focus on his chemo treatment and spend more time with his family. The whole class had a sombre look to them, you could tell they really looked up to this guy and were sad to know he wouldn't be teaching them anymore so I tried my hardest to keep them interested in the subject and take their minds off their teacher.\n\nIt was going pretty well as I tend to take a more relaxed approach to teaching. We'd do quite a bit of practical assignments, getting students involved and moving and really trying to bring the class to life. A lot of them responded well and managed to stay on target with their grades but there was one girl who just seemed to be struggling and something seemed off about her.\n\nWhen class was dismissed and the students were heading home, she approached me at my desk and said that she wanted to talk to me. I obliged and waited until the rest of the students had left and closed the door behind the last one to leave. I could feel her eyes on me as I did so. I walked back to my desk, sat down and asked her what's up.\n\nHer eyes kind of glanced up and down at me before she answered. \"I know my grades have been dropping.\" she admits. \"I took the news pretty badly about Mr. Roberts (the guy I was subbing for) and I've had trouble focusing since. I was wondering if you could...\" she paused for a second, looking at me deeply in the eyes and smacked her lips softly. \"...help me focus?\" she continued.\n\nI knew what she wanted at this point but it was totally against my ethics. I'd be lying if I said I didn't want it though, she was a pretty girl. She placed both her palms on my desk and leaned over at me. I blanked for a second and didn't really know how to react. I stuttered \"Wh-what do you n-need?\" She leaned ever closer and put her lips next to my ear. She whispered \"I need about tree fiddy...\"\n\nWell it was about that time that I notice that student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. The Loch Ness monster had tricked me again! I said \"Dammit monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I rushed out of the room, got into my car and drove home. I didn't talk about it to anyone.\n\nI turned up for class the next day and she wasn't there anymore. I think I embarrassed the poor girl and she switched classes. Soon after that event, their original teacher got better and came back to teaching and I was on my way to the next teaching job. I'll always remember her though.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359146896", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm not trying to to be the kind of asshole that OP is complaining about.\n\nBut, it irks me when agnostics try to take the high ground by acting like it's \"hilarious\" that one person could believe one way or the other. This seems to imply that, in the absence of evidence, the truth or falsity of a claim are both on equal footing.\n\nBut, that's just not true. If I told you there were fairies, or gnomes, or mole people, or spaghetti monsters, or leprechauns, or mermaids, or loch ness monsters, or ghosts, or yetis or dragons or witches, without giving you any evidence for their existence, would you say \"Well, it could go either way\"? I suspect that you'd say \"That's bullshit man, I'm pretty sure those things don't exist\". \n\nAnd, if you're \"atheistic\" towards all of those things, how does it make sense to say that we can't know whether or not God exists, even though the evidence for God is no stronger than any of the things I mentioned above?\n\nAnd, while you can't disprove that any kind of God exists if you use the word in a very vague way, you can sure as shit disprove the existence of certain Gods, like the Christian one. It is a contradiction to say that an all knowing God would get the age of the earth wrong, or for that God to say that all species were created at the same time, when this has been proven false. It's also a contradiction to say that an all PKG God can exist in a world with as much terrible shit in it as ours (the problem of evil). \n\nThere are an infinite number of things that might exist, but which we have no evidence for. And the fact is that, you can imagine an infinite number of contradictory beings for each of them. So, for example, there might be a giant turtle which shit out the universe, which would contradict God by almost any definition of the word, since, with exceedingly rare exception, \"God\" usually implies a creator with a plan. Or maybe it was a falcon that laid an egg that turned into the universe. Or perhaps our universe is just one cell of a giant fungus. We can do this without end. You could also imagine an infinite number of things that are able to instantly seek out and eat anything we might consider a God. At the end of the day, when it comes to any belief unsupported by evidence, there is an infinitely small chance that that belief is correct.

{"body": "You started out saying:\n\n&gt; Atheism has a very specific meaning in the field of the philosophy of religion. It means the belief that God does not (or probably does not) exist.\n\nYou were talking the context of religion, but using the non-contextual definition of the word belief, ok (I suggest avoiding that in the future). So what you are describing is the lack of belief in the religious sense, but arguing that 'atheist' pragmatically describes people who have belief by the other definition - as in confidence that something is true - about the non-existence of something.\n\nExcept, lacking belief in gods and santa clause and ufo abductions and invisible friends and fairies and the loch ness monster and atlantis is not the assertion that these things definitely don't exist. It's fully possible to not believe them, yet not claim that they definitely don't exist, saying that the evidence is just too weak to consider them remotely believable.  For example, I don't believe UFO abduction stories, the claims are extremely weak. However, I don't believe that UFOs *definitely* do not abduct people, how on Earth could I invest in that any more than I could invest in that Atlantis *definitely* never existed? Or that somehow, Santa Clause *definitely* doesn't live at the north pole. I think that the evidence against is pretty damning, but I'm not going to waste my time \"believing\" - I have no faith, no reason to take such forced positions. Your definition doesn't leave any room for this, and instead seems to be stuck in the priest mindset (\"everybody has competing 'beliefs' to me\").\n\nFor the legions of people who are called atheists, without commandments via faith leading to confidence that something is true, people have no equivalent motivation to invest in such scientifically unsound positions, when they could just say \"I don't believe\", like \"I'm not a golf player\", not \"I actively don't play golf\" in a world where - shock horror - many people's lives don't revolve around those people's golf, and such definitions are pointlessly egotistical for the golf players.\n\nLack of belief != belief that something isn't, that is an entirely secondary belief which people have no reason to spend their time on, no equivalent motivation to reach such a point as those working via faith do. It seems to be something which would be convenient for those trying to take some sort of moral highground or to make it seem a scarier prospect for those wishing to leave a belief (they'd have to \"convert\"), but the more important question is - who does it describe? Why have a definition which describes nobody real?\n\nBy your definition of atheist, every religious person is an atheist, only about thousands of other gods.\n\n&gt; So bower have \"agnostic\" or \"weak\" atheist which means \"I am not a theist, but I am unsure if that is a justified thing to be.\" This is plainly an irrational position (it amounts to little more than evasion of the burden of proof in practice), but you'll see many an atheist defend it vigorously.\n\nWhy on Earth is the burden of proof on people who aren't making any claims? There are aliens called xenobs on the planet xorlax who are psychically communicating with me - you must accept this, the burden of proof is on you, all I had to do was say whatever I felt like and people must accept it as true without proof.\n\nIt's only an irrational position because you've created stupid positions which people must take. By your reckoning, not accepting something amazing witnessed and passed on through several re-tellings is \"irrational\" if one doesn't say \"That is definitely true\" or \"That is definitely not true\" or \"There is absolutely no way to estimate how true this is.\"\n\nNo professional scientist operates on anything being absolutely true or not true, it's entirely estimations.

I'm less sure about ufo abductions, but I believe that those are probably not real. I don't merely *lack* belief in these things, I have positive beliefs about them. Atheists do not merely lack belief in God, they hold positive beliefs about the non-existence of God.

Belief is *only* the mental acceptance that something is true (or probably true).\n\n&gt;Lack of belief != belief that something isn't\n\nNo (rational) atheist merely has a lack of belief because a mere lack of belief is irrational. It cannot be the case that one lacks belief unless one is 1) ignorant of the topic or 2) disinterested in the topic. Atheists like the ones that will be found in here or that label themselves atheists in here or elsewhere are neither ignorant of the topic nor disinterested in it. Hence, atheists do not merely lack belief. Such a claim is used to evade the burden of proof for their beliefs.\n\n&gt;It seems to be something which would be convenient for those trying to take some sort of moral highground or to make it seem a scarier prospect for those wishing to leave a belief (they'd have to \"convert\"), \n\nYou're off in left field again. This has nothing to do with moral high ground or scaring people out of converting from religion.\n\n&gt;but the more important question is - who does it describe? Why have a definition which describes nobody real?\n\nNobody? *Nobody?* Here is a list of some of the most prominent living (or recently deceased) atheist philosophers of religion. These people actively make arguments about the non-existence of God. They do not make the irrational claim that they merely lack belief in God.

It was a science fiction novel written back in the 50's about a man called Charlie Gordon who has an IQ of 68, but is a lovable and tenacious individual who only wants to be smarter so he can \"have lots of friends\".\n\nThe story is told through a series of progress reports written by Charlie. You get to know about him and his life and his past, how his mother disowned him because she couldn't stand him being retarded and how his father and mother split up. He volunteers for an experimental surgical procedure to increase his intelligence. Over the course of months, he becomes smarter and educated in all different kinds of fields. His IQ triples and he can absorb the written contents of a page in a second - he learns to speak 20 languages and play the piano in days.\n\nOne day, he decides to see his father, who he hasn't seen in over 17 years since he was kicked out and forced to live in a care centre for the mentally handicapped. His father owns a barber's shop in the Bronx, but as Charlie enters his father doesn't realise that this man is his son. Charlie gets a haircut, but despite everything he remains torn about revealing his identity to his father - his intellect has made him cold and cynical and would just lead him to alienate his father as he had everyone else. As his father finishes up, he decides to at least give it a chance:\n\n&gt; \"Now that you've got the hair off my face, maybe you'll know me,\" I said as I stood up, waiting for a sign of recognition.\n\n&gt; He frowned. \"What is this? A gag?\"\n\n&gt; I assured him it was not a gag, and if he looked and thought hard enough he would know me. He shrugged and turned to put his combs and scissors away. \"I got no time for guessing games. Got to close up. That'll be three-fifty.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time Charlie noticed that his father was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era!\n\nHe said \"God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy.\" and stormed out, never to return to that barbershop again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359246109", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

He is a white guy in his mid 40's with long scraggly hair and beard and a beat up pair of overalls. He proceeds to start fucking with the cigarette receptacle until it starts coming apart. He looks straight at me, still grinning, and says \"I just got outta prison for manufacturing crystal methamphetamine\". The thing eventually comes apart creating a huge mess of cigarettes and ash made worse by the mixture of water the clerk had added; the plastic was still on fire. The clerk still stood at the door looking on with an unconcerned expression as we, the five by standers, continued to watch the fascinating scene unfold. He speaks again \"My daddy was a firefighter\" before he starts toward the gas pump dragging the burning piece of plastic behind him and spreading the mess he had made. Several people yelled at him not to drag the fire near the gas pump but by then he was right next to it. He turned a nozzle on the side of the post to release water and douse the flames. When he arrived back at the window with the extinguished cigarette receptacle, the clerk looked at him and said \"I know you gonna clean that shit up.\" He replied \"I'll do it for about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359271342", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think my odd masturbatory habits when I first learned how to do it fucked up my urinary tract.\n\nI was a weird kid, I was always aroused (And still am) by women wrestling and women boxing. So, when my family went out, I took my sister's dolls and made them wrestle. \n\nWhile that was going on, I felt the turgidity of my erection, and started what was essentially fucking the floor while they wrestled. The first time I ever ejaculated was that time, and it was pretty fucking weird. Now it's just like \"Fuuuck, clean up time.\"\n\nBut my ejaculate is not the focal point. I did this a few more times before I learned to use my hand. Little did I know that the method I had used would cause damage to my goods.\n\nFast forward to age 14, and I try this method again. It feels great not using your hand, but here's the kicker, every time I tried to pee after that it burned like a bitch. Couple that with 5+ times masturbating a day, and I would urinate blood with that.\n\nI found out nearly a year later I had a urethral stricture, a buildup of tissue in my urethra that would block the rush of urine when I pee (I pee like a race horse, without the awkward boner.) The constant ejaculation only helped to wear on my systems, but that never hurt like peeing, and there was no blood.\n\nI have gotten a cystoscopy, a catheter, and, even better, a prostate exam because of it. Yes, a man reached into my ass (I giggled the entire time, and had Taco Bell before so I was afraid I would blast ass in his face.) He found nothing. That was awful. They were trying to find the source of my problem, before you ask what that has to do with anything.\n\nUnfortunately, the society n which we live in made my parents run in circles trying to find help for me, and they paid a TON of money just for the cystoscopy, so we didn't ever follow up after that because they couldn't pay anymore. So now I know what is fucking me up, and I can't do anything about it but feel the burn.\n\nAnd that's why masturbation has fucked with my life.

{"body": "I dated a guy called Lachlan for just over a year. We got on pretty well and were students at the time at the local university. It was about 23 miles or so southwest of Inverness (we live in Scotland). We were studying geology there and we both had a particular interest in marine geology, like, underwater stuff. We were both good students and during our course we gained the trust of our professor that we were reliable people.\n\nOne day, we were sent out to the local lake to do some surveying and to map the lake bottom so we could draw up a model of what it looked like. To do that, we needed some sonar equipment so we took a scanner from the storage room. The other students were busy carrying out some other work, so it was just us. We drove to the edge of the town and then walked on foot to the edge of the lake.\n\nWe had to carry all our equipment to where we would take our boat onto the lake from. On our way in the car, Lachlan sounded a bit drunk but I didn't think much of it at the time. On our walk which took us about forty minutes, he made me carry all the gear which I was a bit annoyed about as I thought he should at least carry some stuff because some of it was quite heavy. Maybe on the way back he could carry all of it. Anyway, we got there a bit earlier than we expected. We had agreed to meet a boatman who would take us out while we did our surveying. We were standing there admiring the scenery and setting up our equipment and making sure it was in working order. While I was gazing across the lake, he turned to me and said he needed to ask me something. I turned round and he was on one knee holding up a ring and asked if I would marry him. I loved him but I wasn't quite ready for it so I told him not now. It wasn't exactly the best time to pop the question. I told him we should wait till we got back then we could discuss things. He looked a bit dejected but he seemed happy that I might accept. Anyway, the boatman arrived and Lachlan went over to talk to him and tell him that we were the ones he would be taking out. Lachlan came back after a short while and told me that the boatman was a bit superstitious and wouldn't take us onto the lake without a prior payment because he felt it was dangerous. He told me he had some money but it wasn't enough to pay the man so he wanted to borrow some from me. I asked him how much he needed and he said: \"I need about tree fiddy\". I went to get my wallet and got the money out for him but when I returned I discovered he had turned into a 7 ft paleolithic cryptid.

Such reasons are not convincing to me.\n\n&gt;Why don't you believe in a supernatural creator?\n\nThere is only a subtle difference between this question and the first.

Would that be correct?\n\nI disagree with this statement for the following reason: Just because something's existence cannot be definitively proven or disproven based on the available evidence, does not mean that the chances of its existence or nonexistence are 50/50.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence, at this time, for me to prove whether or not there are invisible fairies that live at the bottom of my garden. I can't prove that they are there, but neither can I prove that they are not....however, in the absence of any evidence to suggest either that they are there, or that fairies exist at all, the possibility that they are not there is vastly more likely than the possibility that they are. It is therefore logically acceptable to discard claims of their existence *until* evidence appears for them....you do not need to reserve judgement, and nobody would expect you to.\n\nAnything that can be posited without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Currently, there is no evidence for God and there is therefore no reason whatsoever to entertain the possibility of its existence.\n\nDo you believe in werewolves? Unicorns? Bigfoot? The Loch Ness Monster? Dragons? Ghosts? Lizard people that secretly rule the world? I would *hope* that the answer is \"no\". And, if it is no, why do you consider it alright to dismiss them, yet you wish to reserve judgement when it comes to God?\n\nIsn't that special pleading?\n\nAnd empirical mind set does **not** state that you must reserve judgement on everything without evidence. What it does state is that something must present evidence for itself in order to be rendered true. I honestly think that you are either misunderstanding empiricism, or you are misunderstanding the atheist mind set: atheism is not a positive assertion that God exists, it is a rejection of the *claim* that God exists, due to it not having met its burden of proof.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359377913", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Why am I an atheist?\n\nI am an atheist because I see no good reason to be a theist. My atheism is firmly rooted in doubt and disbelief, not an assertion in the non-existence of every \ngod ever imagined or, as some theist have put it a faith based belief in 'no god'...whatever that means.  \n\nEver reason or claim of evidence ever present to me by a theist boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which a good reasons \nto believe extraordinary claims. \n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or \ninaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \n\"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular \nreasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, \nfaith can be used to justify anything; I have faith the Odin exists, I have faith in the Loch Ness monster, I have faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to \njustify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true or false using faith?\n\nWhen it come to theist &amp; atheism, you can be gnostic or agnostic about either of these positions or in regards to a specific definition of god. I usually refer to \nmyself as an agnostic-atheist. While I do not believe in any gods due to a lack of evidence, I am not asserting that no gods could possibly exist. I am \ngnostic-atheist in regards to Greek gods living on top of Mount Olympus or lightning being created by Thor's hammer. I could assert that Zeus does not exist if \nhe is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nIf god were redefined into something immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to \nprove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be \n100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct.\n\nBesides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that could prove the non-existence of an immaterial god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359418464", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The college in question forces first year students who are living in on-campus housing to purchase a meal plan.

Well one week I was out with a pretty bad case of strep throat(hospitalized and everything) so I couldn't work as much. As a result, I ended up going without food for a day and a half. After the two, I approach my roommate, and the following interaction occurs:\n\n\"I'm short on cash and I need to eat. Can you help me out?\"\n\n\"Goddamit, man.

Myself and my sister had spent the weekend there, but she had fallen incredibly ill.\n\nWe rushed to a hospital and found a doctor who spoke English. He told us that she had a parasite growing in her stomach. It had latched itself to the walls and was beginning to burrow its way out of the stomach and through the rest of her body, as evidenced by the whimpers of pain she'd give off as she clutched her stomach from time to time.\n\nHe prescribed to her some medicine, and we were making our way to the pharmacy. Well apparently the pharmacy was out of this particular drug, and we had to go to a different hospital a few miles south. Unfortunately, we had used the last of our cash making it to the hospital (luckily our insurance had worked getting into the hospital, and would even cover the drugs) and we would have to find bus fare to make our way to that particular hospital. So a little bit of googling on my phone and I've deduced we need about 2.61 euros along with the remainder of what we have to get onto the bus. Worse yet, my sister had fainted from the pain, and I had to carry her while I attempted to secure money.\n\nSo I approach the nearest passerby and the following interaction occurred:\n\"Can I get some help, sir?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" The other spoke in a very thick German accent.\n\n\"I need bus fare if you could help. I'm only short 2.61 Euros.\"\n\nIt was about that time he realized I was a 500 ft tall monster from the Paleolithic era. He suddenly got enraged, and shouted at me in German:\n\"Sheißen, Monster, ich willst nicht geben dich tree fiddy!\"\n\n(Roughly. This is a story from memory, so forgive me if I misremember.)\nI don't know what he said, but I can only assume he was angry that I didn't know the language.\n\nOthers seemed to think that I was a hobo begging for money at that point, or some such.

You're whoring out someone else's jokes way beyond when it was funny. Trey Parker and Matt Stone would hate you.\n\nIn that vein, any time people just post quotes from a show or movie that was mentioned, it's idiotic. If I wanted to just see quotes, I'd go to fucking IMDB. It has the added benefit of having actual quotes and not what some moron half remembered. We all know the Joker said ”Why so serious?” Posting it because someone mentioned Batman adds nothing.\n\nBasically, Reddit, get some fresh material. Redditors hate Carlos Mencia and Dane Cook, yet when Redditors are self congratulating joke thieves who think a reference itself constitutes a joke, it gets a thousand upvotes. Your bullshit is exactly like the comedians you hate and the comedians you like would hate you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359521861", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Had a similar situation once. I used to live in a small town with a lot of suburban neighborhoods branching out. Well each neighborhood has an ice cream truck that makes the rounds daily ( roughly, anyways. Obviously they take days off, but it varies from driver to driver. ).\n\nSo that day I ended up staying late at work on a project, and found myself leaving a little later than normal. Consequently, all the good places around town were completely full up, no tables in less than an hour. Lucky me, I finally find a place with no line out the door. I go in for the kill only to find, lo and behold, an armada of ice cream trucks, parked like a bunch of asshats.\n\nStill, I hadn't packed my lunch that day, so there was nothing to be done of it. It was either eat there or get chewed out by my boss for staying to late at lunch.\n\nKeep in mind this was at the height of the recession, so prices for just about everything was jacked up. This included the parking meter I found myself at. I end up going into the resturant, fuming about these asshole drivers, and paying ludicrous amounts just to get out of my car for an extended period of time.\n\nI go to the nearest ice cream truck driver, and I go off on him. The following interaction occurs:\n\n\"Jesus Christ, how hard is it to park your goddam trucks?!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" He's more than a little surprised. Flabbergasted, I point out the window at the shitty parking jobs.\n\n\"That! That is what I mean! No parking space left over! I had to go and park at a meter just for a ten minute lunch!\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ, kid, fine! How much was the damn meter: I'll pay you back.\"\n\nThis caught me off guard. Not willing to turn it down, though, I tell him: \"It's about $3.50.\"\n\nNow it was about this time that he noticed I was a 500 foot tall monster from the Paleolithic era, and he starts to shout, \"GODDAMIT, monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359522360", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This guy I roomed with was a bit of a slob. Now, I'm no neat freak. Before I went to college, I always had a messy room. But once I found myself contained to a tiny dorm room, I recognized the value of order and tidiness. My roommate, however, did not.\n\nWhenever you walked into our room, there was a perfect line down the middle of it with one half filled with clothes, papers, and pizza boxes while the other half was bare carpet. He amassed a pile of dirty clothes in his closet roughly the size of a Prius. I honestly don't know how he managed since I only saw him do laundry twice all year. \n\nMy girlfriend went to another school so she couldn't visit often. When she did, I'd like to have the room somewhat clean. My roommate was always fine with a little tidying up. One time when she came to visit, we walked into the room and he hadn't done anything with his half yet. He said, \"I'm sorry, I forgot to clean,\" and proceeded to shove everything under his bed.\n\nI remember one time, I wanted to watch my Forgetting Sarah Marshall DVD, but it was nowhere to be found. We both searched the room and he assured me that it wasn't under his bed, that he had checked three times. A couple months later, when we were moving out, he paid a friend to help him clean up his stuff. He actually had to lift up his bed to clean out from underneath it. You could see the layers formed by \"cleaning\" his half of the room. About three layers in, he dug out my movie.\n\nMy roommate also had less than perfect hygiene. His name was Taylor, but amongst our friends he was known as Staylor since he had a stale air about him. When he would go home, his mom would write BYT on his toes while he was sleeping as a reminder to \"brush your teeth.\" He would lay on the couch at our friends' house in nothing but his underwear and stumble for hours (this was before reddit). Then he got impetigo and was kind enough to share it with others.\n\nMy final story about my roommate is from the day we moved out of the dorms. We were staying for the summer, but our summer place wouldn't be available for a week. So he was packing up his stuff and preparing to move it into storage. He drove to the storage facility and then called me. He said he forgot his wallet and asked if I could spot him some money. I said sure and asked how much. He said, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" And that's when I realized my roommate was a twenty foot tall mythological lake monster.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359559501", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

However, with this news article being posted, I figure that I'll share this here because it sums up my thoughts on this idiocy.\n\nI like to believe that I am a fairly tolerant person. Whether it be religion, culture, nationalism, and politics to a certain extent, I get along with most types and keep a lot of things personal. One thing I have an intolerance for is ignorance; especially ignorance of science.\n\nLucky for me today,  I received the following e-mail in my inbox:\n\n&gt;Subject: \tFrom Carl Katz\n\n&gt;Date: \tMon, 5 Nov 2012 19:28:35 \n\n&gt;From: \tCarl Katz &lt;carlosgatos@gmail.com&gt;\n\n&gt;Reply-To: \tcarlosgatos@gmail.com\n\n&gt;To: \tgeneral+rvancouver@afreak.ca\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi Colin,\n&gt;\n&gt;I'm the person who was featured in an article in The Province a few years ago regarding my concern about wi-fi in schools.\n&gt;\n&gt;I've been wanting to contact you for some time.\n&gt;\n&gt;Just wanted to know if you were willing to have an unbiased, serious look at this issue? Please know that I have no beef with you - just want to educate as this issue is getting more serious as time goes on.\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gisvfVeRpr0\n&gt;\n&gt;Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;Carl Katz\n\nNow, this guy does not ring a bell to me right off of the bat but the video immediately makes me [search for his name on Google](https://www.google.ca/search?btnG=1&amp;pws=0&amp;q=%22carl+katz%22+wireless). Immediately I find a [news article that I do remember](http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=cb0376e5-ea75-4b84-ae73-53fea7bd656e) from September 28, 2008. I do remember having sent a letter to the newspaper the day of that stupid article and the very next day it was published. This means it took Mr. Katz over four years to reply back to me on this matter--or if for some bizarre reason we want to be be exact: four years, one month, and eight days.\n\nNormally I don't use ad hominems especially when it comes to those relating to mental disorders, but him, the woman (Dr. Erica Mallery-Blythe) in his video, and everyone else who practices this belief are complete lunatics and are doing a disservice to science, children, adults, and those who have these things called \"brains\".\n\nIn addition, I really wanted to refrain from replying, but what sort of idiot thinks I am important enough to remember my e-mail address for so long and then comes out and attempts to send me a video from an account of a seemingly dumb physician?\n\n&gt;Subject: Re: From Carl Katz\n\n&gt;Date: Mon, 05 Nov 2012 22:58:00\n\n&gt;From: general+rvancouver@afreak.ca\n\n&gt;To: carlosgatos@gmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi Carl,\n&gt;\n&gt;You know, it's a bit absurd to be contacting me almost four years after a newspaper article came out; let alone suggest for a moment that a YouTube video is going to be enough to persuade me that everything that the (sane) scientific community has been stating for years is all bunk.\n&gt;\n&gt;But hey, since I seem to have your attention for whatever reason, I guess I should take a crack at the points you made in your Province article from September 2008, right?\n&gt;\n&gt;I believe that this was the article in question:\n&gt;http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=cb0376e5-ea75-4b84-ae73-53fea7bd656e\n&gt;\n&gt;Here's the point in question where I believe you decide to spout off some inane tripe:\n&gt;&gt;\"The industry-sponsored studies say Wi-Fi is no problem but the independent research in the U.S. and Britain has shown that electromagnetic radiation of the level emitted by laptops with a wireless connection should cause a great deal of concern, especially with children whose bodies are much more sensitive. I'm very concerned.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;Usually when I see \"independent research\" from your types, I immediately think of \"not peer-reviewed\" and \"loch ness monster\". But since you've had me watch this video, I figure you should hear me out about why you're still wrong and will continue to be until you understand why your psychosomatic problems have nothing to do with non-ionising radiation.\n&gt;\n&gt;The maximum power output of a laptop, desktop, or access point is no more than 250 mW at a frequency of 2400 MHz as per Industry Canada regulations. Because of the fact that the 2400 MHz range falls within what is known as the ISM band (industry, scientific, medical), the distance ends up being very short due to the power limits and the fact that the band has to be shared with other instruments. Most access points can only achieve 32 metres of range indoors at most and up to 200 metres outdoors.\n&gt;\n&gt;Let's contrast this to one of our local radio stations, CKNW, which has a frequency of 980 KHz and a power output of 50,000 W--which is 200,000 times the power of your typical access point and has its transmitter sitting on top of Mount Seymour. At 980 KHz, the station has the ability to penetrate rather well into large concrete buildings such as Simon Fraser University, the basement in my parents' home, and a possibly familiar place to you: River View Hospital. It also goes as deep into Seattle and up through the Fraser Canyon to Boston Bar. You cannot escape its signal and even if you do, other signals are just going to bombard you.\n&gt;\n&gt;Lowly wifi at its 2400 MHz frequency can barely make it to the third floor of my parents' house and had to fight with their neighbours for who is the ultimate network. I'd be more worried about CKNW and other radio stations before I'd get worried about some wireless.\n&gt;\n&gt;I advise you that if you feel that wireless networks are the devil that you find yourself an island in the South Pacific, dig a huge hole downward (maybe a few hundred metres), hollow out a cavern, and live in it.

In fact, there was a large group of people from her church that would outright shun me / ignore me.\n\n- I can't hold public office in my state (or in a lot of states for that matter).\n\n- Politicians in my state, and surrounding state, find the concept of \"critical thinking\" a **bad thing** because it leads to \"challenging the students fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority\". Granted this is a small stretch from \"religious oppression\", but the ideals here stem from the politicians religious beliefs.\n\n- There are school in nearby states that **get government funding** and teach that evolution is a lie, and that the existence of the loch ness monster is proof.\n\nNow, I could go on, but hopefully you can see now why we have such a problem with religion.

{"body": " My example of cryptozoology was more meant to convey things like the Loch Ness Monster and bigfoot. I failed to account for other animals that were actually found.\n\nYou're right, though. The indication it doesn't exist has nothing to do with choice to study it, but inability to study it. There are real things previously unmeasurable. However, *everything* that doesn't exist cannot be measured or confirmed in experiment because of lack of existence. That is the reason science ignores God. There's no scientific experiments that can be done for God, and theists make excuses for that, when they know damn well if scientific data supported God, we'd never hear the end of it.\n\nDebates about God's existence come down to the fact that you can't disprove it, that this and that don't mean it doesn't exist. Do you hear those for evolution? No, you hear about observable, objective evidence that supports the idea. Supporting God is being backed into a corner from the start because of lack of evidence. If there were no emotional reward for a theist for believing in God, it would be cast away as superstition like Zeus and Tlaloc.\n\nEdit: We believe things because they're supported, and cling onto them because they can't be refuted. Nothing can be refuted, but not everything can be supported. God is one of those things that can't be supported, and theists, in debate, will wallow in the lack of total refutation, because, lacking support, it's all they have.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359655878", "subreddit": "QuotesPorn", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
