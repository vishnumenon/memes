{"body": "Keeping religion out of public schools is a very important issue, unfortunately there are many other issues that are realistically more important.\n\nI'm not sure that we have the same definition for fundamentalist. Fundamentalism by definition calls for reactionary action against advancing social customs for the sake of maintaining old morality. The acceptability of evolution and homosexuality is still a very new phenomena in the United States. Just because the Catholic church has recently changed its stance doesn't mean that sticking to its decision makes you a fundamentalist, it just makes you a devoted Catholic. There are a lot of devoted Catholics and Christians that are fine with homosexuality and evolution. However, there is a large section of Christians, and probably Catholics, that do not consider those things to be acceptable at all, and they doubt the devotion of anyone that agrees, and they militantly oppose any action that would advance the US in these areas. Sticking to creationism damages the credibility of science, reason, and study in the minds of the children who are exposed to it.\n\nI was raised in a conservative Christian home, and I learned creationism (technically 'intelligent design'). I learned that there was no conclusive evidence for the theory of evolution, that Noah's Flood created the Grand Canyon, and the Loch Ness Monster is a real descendant of plesiosaurs. This, of course, is all bullshit, as I realized when I became an adult. However, these claims serve to intentionally mislead people into feeling comfortable that there is a logical basis for a 6000 year old earth. Lying to people and intellectually stunting their children in exchange for their money is disgusting. Telling people that homosexuality is an abomination and that gays are destroying the institution of marriage is disgusting. Refusing young adults proper sex education to prevent the spread of diseases like AIDS and unwanted pregnancies in the name of 'purity' is disgusting. All of this comes from the literal interpretation of the Bible, the holy text that all Christian denominations turn to for their doctrine and source of belief. Don't you see why people get frustrated with Christians quickly?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359677763", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

My atheism is firmly rooted in doubt and disbelief. I am not making an assertion about the non-existence of every god ever imagined or, as some theist have put it a subscribing to a faith based belief in 'no god'...whatever that means. I simply do not believe.\n\nEver reason or claim of evidence ever present to me by a theist boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which a good reasons to believe extraordinary claims.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or I faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it?

{"body": "When I was in senior year of high school, I lived in a small town about an hour north of London, ON.  My girlfriend was friends with some people in Kitchener, which was a lot larger than our town but was still only 200K or so.  They seemed a lot cooler than any of us, though, especially Patricia, who had funky dyed hair, designed her own clothes, and had a lot to say about fine literature.  My gf would invite Patricia and her other Kitchener friends down and we would all go to local parties, which usually involved booze, weed, and loud 90s hip hop in sketchy apartments owned by the people who blew in and out of town like autumn leaves.  At one of these parties, Patricia had an encounter with the eldest of the Gallagher brothers, Adam.\n\nNow, if anyone has ever seen the movie *Gummo*, then you may remember the two kids who bike around, kill cats, and sell the corpses.  That was the Gallagher brothers, as sure as anything in this world.  For anyone who hasn't seen *Gummo* (and you should, if you're in the mood to be creeped out), imagine a couple of skinny rural white kids with maybe an entire brain between them, spending their time catching chickens, attending school occasionally, and listening to death metal.  They were weird, but they were alright enough to hang out with, since they were into everything we were into.  Now and then, though, they would do something stupid.\n\nThe Gallagher brothers showed up to a party when Patricia had come down to visit.  Adam Gallagher had tried to pick her up, but the chance of her being into it had been about 1 in X, where X is the total volume of the universe.  Two days later, after Patricia had returned to Kitchener, Adam began to tell people that he had gotten a handjob from her.  He told *everyone* this, for weeks afterwards.  My gf was murderously angry with him for this, and the rest of us weren't very pleased either.  So we decided to get even with him.\n\nThe next time there was a big party, we came as a group, plan in hand.  The apartment that the party was in had an empty bedroom, kept apart as a room in which couples could fornicate.  Three of us hid ourselves in various places throughout the room.  I hid in a wardrobe, one person hid under the bed, and another sequestered themselves in a pile of clothes.  Meanwhile, my gf was drinking her usual vodka-and-Pepsi and acting more drunk than she really was.  She found Adam and began flirting with him.  Hard.  She was a well-endowed woman, and fond of showing off her assets as much as she could get away with under the rule of rural morality laws.  Adam didn't get laid a lot (or at all, I suspect) and the idea of a lithe, busty blonde girl coming on to him probably blew his mind.  He asked weakly at one point what was going on (since her and I were inseparable at the time) and she replied with some bullshit about how we were having a big fight, and that she was rethinking our entire relationship.  After about ten-fifteen minutes of this, she managed to lead him back to the darkened bedroom.\n\nThey sat down on the bed and he sat slightly apart from her, awkwardly eyeing her up.  She took off her top so that she was just in her black, lacy bra, and grabbed his hand.  He got to feel up her breast and leaned into kiss her.  She avoided it, turning her head away and rubbing her hand on his leg.  She leaned into and whispered \"this is a big thing for you,\" breathily in his ear.\n\nThis was our cue.  At once we all leap out from our hiding spots.  \"You're busted, motherfucker!\" the one hiding in the clothes yelled as he jumped to his feet and flicked the lights on.  I jumped out and yelled \"SURPRISE BITCH!\".  The one under the bed didn't end up saying anything as he got stuck partway out.  Regardless, the look on Adam's face was priceless, a startling exact mask of horrified surprise.  My gf stood up and crossed her arms across her ample chest.\n\n\"Guess you'll think next time before you make up stories about people, huh?\" she said.  He just hung his head.  I think he might have been crying.  We all laughed and told him what an asshole he was, and he asked sullenly if everyone would just leave.  This made us laugh harder and he ran out of the room.  My gf then kicked the other two out of the room and closed the door.  I asked her what she wanted, and she smiled mysteriously.  She undid her bra, hefted those beautiful mammaries, and said \"I need about tree fiddy\".  It was then that I realized that the gorgeous, maddening woman I'd fallen in love with was actually 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.  \n\n(Nah, we did it.

{"body": "Okay I just HAD to make an account for this because its so interesting that i have stumbled upon this with what has recently been going on in my life. All my life I hopped around from one person to the next when it came to any sort of relationship. I never really had a friend or family member who would 100% be by my side and on my side. After years of terrible relationships I was in a really shitty place. I then realized what the problem was. I wasn't running to something, I was running from things. There was always this bible in my house it was there since i recently moved. I pulled it out one night and never really reading anything or knowimg much about the religion other then what most nonbeliever say.. I skimmed it. And now I won't say that i believe the book is a literal translation, but the anecdotes and historic precedences it lays down can't be just looked over. It really all came together when discussing this with a coworker about how i was dabbling with the idea. (She is a hardcore believer but definitely doesn't shove it in anyones face). She finally divulged and discussed her path to God and how she thinks that if I just went with her to this \"megachurch\" couple miles away I would really be able to understand and appreciate it. So here I lay now and i can just say that in some form or another there is somebody looking out for people willing to believe. \n\nIt is really weird knowing my mom isn't totally a believer i have known her as an agnostic all my life and we are super duper close and even share an apartment. and i don't shove it down her throat or even try to convince her of anything, but one night she was having a little get together with a few friends from work and me and my brother were there. I would say there was about 7 or 8 people including me were there and i heard everybody from the kitchen talking about religion which i thought was weird for a get together knowing religion has never been brought  up this much in my life. it seemed like just another sign that showed me i was on the right path. Everybody seemed to have a firm idea of agnostism. I couldn't believe it because when i was younger i knew most of these people and actually went to church (for like christmas and easter a handful of time). I knew they were like how i was. Lost. So I did something that my character has never let me do before. I was vocal with my point. At this point i am walking through the door from kitchen to the living room area and I said everybody get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur. It was at this time I saw that my 7 or 8 family friends were fifteen foot tall sea monsters from the crustacean era. And all looked at me at once and said if you  want me to believe in god I am going to need about tree fiddy. I was complete taken back and never realized how terrible everyone was. I knew at that point i couldnt be around them any more. So yeah. I love god. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359955968", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You're taking on a somewhat difficult position when you say \"god does not exist\" versus the easier to justify \"I do not believe in god\".\n\nI do not believe in gods because I have neither seen nor heard of a good reason to be a theist. \n\nI do not have a burden of proof with my position because I am not making a claim, rather, I am merely stating my position that I don't believe theists claims, therefor I am not a theist, making me  an *a*theist.\n\nEver reason or claim of evidence ever present to me by a theist boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which a good reasons to believe extraordinary claims.\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or I faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true or false using faith?\n\nAs for proving the non-exist of gods, that can be trick, but, it actually depends on the god in question. Some gods can, in fact be dis-proven.\n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct.\nBesides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360030868", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

We'd produce more than we need, and revenue collected from selling the rest would boost the Scottish economy. England would probably still be our biggest customer, but that's no problem, the pipelines are already in place. Exact numbers change as the price of oil goes up and down, and with this being a hot issue, it's hard to find solid numbers on Google, there's so much noise and opinion. Even supposed \"fact check\" websites seem to either struggle to give a figure, or disagree with one another. We're talking about tens of billions of pounds here, and Alex Salmond (SNP leader, an economist by trade) claims it would be £30billion over 20 years, which seems to be a sort of average of lots of different arguments. That's £30billion straight into public spending just through tax and government investment, that doesn't cover revenue recovered privately. And as with any independence issue, there are many who [refute this claim](http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9697000/9697096.stm).\n\nUnionists on the other hand have argued that a new economy relying on oil is a bad idea. As a net exporter of oil, it would be in the Scottish interest to join [OPEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opec). To do so would make us the new guy in a club that consisted of Iran, Venezuela, Nigeria, and other friendlies. So as well as remaining a member of the UN, NATO and the EU (probably), what exactly would we be gaining independence from? Also, that oil isn't going to last forever. It's probably not going to run out in my lifetime, but it's almost certainly going to start running out in my grandchildren's lifetime.  \n\nThere is a fringe nationalist argument that we wouldn't even need to export oil to support ourselves. When you listed the stuff that is free in Scotland but not in England, you left out a biggie: water. Scottish Water, although a private company, is entirely subsidised by the public purse and industrial clients. It rains a lot here, and there are a lot of mountains, which by extension means there are a lot of rivers and freshwater lochs. It's so easy to gather water in Scotland that no person in Scotland receives a water bill. Meanwhile, just today, [water bills are going up in England](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21334044). We have an abundance of some resource that the rest of the UK does not, so it makes sense for us to sell it to you. As I say, that's a fringe argument, you won't find it in any SNP literature.\n\nTourism is also a bigger deal for us than you think. Scotland actually gets as many tourists per year as London does, and them coming over and staying in our hotels and buying stuffed Nessie toys would continue to be a major part of our economy after independence.\n\nThe Europe situation seems to be that an independent Scotland would have to rejoin the EU as a new member. As such, we'd have to adopt the Euro as our currency. Nationalists think that as a former member of the UK, we'd be able to automatically remain a member of the EU, and continue to enjoy the special privileges the UK enjoys. Which of those positions is true is up for legal debate at the moment. \n\nIn any case, the Queen would remain our head of state. Scottish republicans are the minority, even within the larger nationalist group, so it's very unlikely that you'll see a President of the Republic of Scotland. We'd remain a constitutional monarchy with an elected Prime Minister, just as in Canada and Australia. Whether have end up using Euros or Sterling, the Queen will probably still be on our banknotes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360094955", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Am I absolutely certain? No. Never claimed to be. \n\nThat said, I am certain that I don't believe in any gods.\n\nWhy? Every reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which a good reasons to believe an extraordinary claim. \n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or I faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true or false using faith?\n\nAs for proving the non-exist of gods, that can be tricky as you are trying to 'prove a negative', but, it actually depends on the god in question. Some gods can in fact be dis-proven.\n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360119118", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hi atheist, Christian here.\n\nYour standard comment will probably be deleted, it violates our forum rules for constructive topical conversation. but since it's here now, I'll just give my standard answer.\n\nI want to be clear that this is an answer to your objection to my belief (How I resolve the problem you raised) since you raised a hypothetical about my belief, I'll be using my beliefs to answer it. I won't be proving each and every one of my beliefs this morning, only patching up what you see as contradictions\n\nThere exist 2 theories on how time works. [A theory and B Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-series_and_B-series) I hold to the former, and am additionally, a presentist. Meaning that I believe, strictly speaking, that only the present exists, the past was the present at one time, but it's gone now, and the future is nothing at all.\n\nWhen I say God is omniscient I mean that he has all knowledge that exists to be had (that is, all knowledge about the present). God doesn't know how much the Loch Ness Monster weighs, because she doesn't exist. in the same way God does not know whether or not \"colorless green ideas sleep furiously\" because that statement is nonsense.\n\nLikewise when I say God is Omnipotent, I mean that God possesses all power that exists to be had. That does not include the ability to make square circles, or the ability to make p=-p because doing so is actually impossible, it's not just impossible for you and me, it's a nonsense statement.\n\nOne more definition of a terms if I may... Free will, if it is to be a meaningful statement, cannot mean the ability to apparently choose a thing (that is, feel as if you have chosen) it must entail the ability to actually choose, meaning to do something that is not contingent on another person, action, or state of affairs. Free will means the ability to act independently.\n\nGod therefore though he is omniscient, does not know the future (it doesn't exist) he does not know what you will freely choose (It's not been chosen) and he is omnipotent but he cannot make you freely choose what he wants you to choose (to make you freely do something is a contradiction in terms like a square circle)\n\nWhat he can do is continue to put people in your life like me who will answer your questions. But you alone have the power to freely disregard the answers and repost the question on another page where there are fewer people who are prepared to take you seriously.

Also I carried around a big ass tuba. After a while some scots got offended, but I just took a deep breath, and sucked them in to the tuba.

{"body": "Why am I an atheist? I am an atheist because I know of no good reason to be a theist.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or I faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nAs for the common rebuttal of 'where is you proof of the non-existence of god?', while it could be considered a fallacy to require proof of a negative, it really depends on the god in question. Some gods can in fact be dis-proven.\n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360360461", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I believe my 10% would be better used by a charity. \n\nAbsolutely. The spreading of a given religion's message and the operating cost of the church is an inefficient surcharge that is completely unnecessary. \n&gt; But recently I have been really studying religion in general...Suddenly, for the first time, all of it seems ridiculous. \n\nThis is actually a big part of why I never really believed in the first place. I was a huge history buff when I was young and could never reconcile the fact that there were the entire civilizations that rose and fell in complete ignorance of the existence of my religion.\n\n&gt; I know that the nonexistence of God cannot be definitely proven, but I am asking you to give me the next closest thing. What convinced you?\n\nI am an atheist because I know of no good reason to be a theist.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or I faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nAs for the common rebuttal of 'where is you proof of the non-existence of god?', while it could be considered a fallacy to require proof of a negative, it really depends on the god in question. Some gods can in fact be dis-proven.\n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360595343", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Secrets just tear relationships apart. This is my fucked up story.\n\n\"K\" and I grew up together.  We were friends for about a year before we started kindergarten and once school started, we become really close.  It was awesome seeing her every day at school.  Unfortunately I had to move at the end of 4th grade.  \n\nI wouldn't see her again until high school when I moved back to my home town.  At first I didn't recognize her, but she ran up to me and gave me the biggest bear hug and it all the warm memories came rushing back to me.  K and I were really close for about two years afterwards and then we started dating.  We were high school sweethearts, did all the dances, prom, etc.  We got 2 great years of dating in until school was over.\n\nCollege came around and she got into a better school than I did.  She moved away while I stayed in our hometown to go to CC.  We tried to do the whole long distance thing but it just didn't work out and we ended it mutual terms.\n\nYears would go by and I developed this huge drug habit.  Money ran out quick and I did everything I could to score my next fix.  I did some really fucked up shit and hit rock-bottom.  I never finished CC and just ended doing some mundane shit jobs while getting high every chance I got.  K finished college and came home to visit her family in the summers.  She called me up and asked to see me every time.  I was so ashamed and made up lies about being too busy or was out of town. Years go by and she would call me a couple times a year when she visited her family and I would always make up some excuse not to see her.  \n\nI finally got fed up with my shit life and I took the steps in order to clean up.  By this time a huge part of my income was dealing drugs and I knew I had to do something drastic, otherwise I would never get clean.  My dealer and I were pretty cool and I would always be over his place chilling and getting high.  I knew he had a gun in one of his cabinets and one day when were were hanging out, I excused myself to go to the bathroom.  I walked in the kitchen and grabbed the gun from the cabinet, made sure it was loaded and I came back and pulled it on him.  I then tied him up.  I couldn't even look him in the eye or say much, I was so ashamed.  I left the drugs, but I robbed him of everything he had, including all his cash.\n\nI moved away and got clean with the money I stole.  I even went and got my AA from school and was now working an OK job. I wanted to believe I did it mostly for myself, but it was really K.  It had been over 10 years since we graduated, but I still thought about her often.  I found out through my parents that she got married a couple years back, had a little girl and was living back at our hometown.  She stopped calling me after I blew her off so many times in those earlier years.  \n\nI had my shit all together when I find out one day that she was now divorced.  So I flew back home to visit my parents and was intending to call her and catch up.  At this time, I've been clean over 5 years, the same amount of time I've been gone from home.  So I call her up and it's like nothing had changed.  We meet at the local mall and she greets me with this huge bear hug, just like high school.  I shoot the shit and before you know it, all the stores start to close.  She takes me home to meet her daughter.  It make me feel so sad and angry.  I think deep down I knew that K and I should've been together and her daughter should've been our daughter.\n\nAnyways, I didn't want it to end so I made up some story about moving back home for job and wanting to see her again.  I remember she was so happy and she started already making plans on what we all could do together.  I move back home with my parents for a couple weeks and then I found a nice little place of my own.  K and I started dating again and it was perfect.  We move in together and I love her and her kid.\n\nBut one day my drug dealer friend who I fucked over sees me pumping gas and approaches me, threatening to kill me, as K and her daughter watches from the car.  He sees them and feigns a smile.  He tells me he wants the money I took, plus juice, otherwise he's make our lives a living hell. I think I was pretty lucky we met again in an open area with witnesses, otherwise it probably would've gone differently.  K gets worried and comes out of the car just as he's leaving and demands to know what's going on.  I'm so tired of hiding my past, so I tell her the whole story about the drugs, but not about robbing him.  I just tell her that I owed him money because I was an addict.  She's furious and starts yelling at me about putting her and her daughter's life in danger. She starts saying other bullshit, berating me, I don't remember, I don't want to.\n\nWe get home and it's complete silence.  Without a word they leave right when the car parks.  I don't even bother to fight for her.  I get a call from her parents that night telling me not to try to contract her and I obliged.  A couple days pass and I had been trying to gather up the money to pay back the dealer.  I come home from work and she's on the couch looking dazed, like she's been crying the whole time.  She tells me she loves me and wants us to be together and that she got money from her dad to pay the drug dealer. She said the fucking dealer found her and told her what I did.  She said she forgives me but she wanted to know if it was true that I robbed him.  I plead with her and tell her I'll pay her back every penny.  She got up and started walking out, disappointed.  I begged her to stay.  I felt like I lost her way too many times and I just wanted her to stay.  I asked her how much she got from her father, how much I owed her.  I'll pay whatever, give whatever, do whatever it took. \"Just tell me how much it was?\" I demanded. She turns around, wipes her eyes and gives me the nastiest look and says, \"tree fiddy\" and that's when I realized K was a 8-story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\ntl:dr - Don't keep secrets, they always blow up in your face.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360670377", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; The earliest settlers to Prehistoric Europe came during the paleolithic era. The arrival of agriculture around 7000 BC ushered in the neolithic age. Neolithic Europe lasted for 4000 years, overlapping with metal-using cultures that gradually spread throughout the continent. Technological advances during the prehistoric age tended to arrive from the Middle East, spreading gradually to the northwest. Some of the best-known civilizations of prehistoric Europe were Minoan and Mycenaean, which flourished during the Bronze Age until they collapsed in a short period of time around 1200 BC.\n\n&gt;The period known as classical antiquity began with the rise of the city-states of Ancient Greece. Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of Alexander the Great, spreading throughout Asia. Northern and western Europe were dominated by the La Tène culture, a precursor to the Celts. Rome, a small city-state traditionally founded in 753 BC, would grow to become the Roman Republic in 509 BC, and would succeed Greek culture as the dominant Mediterranean civilization. The events of the rule of Julius Caesar led to reorganization of the Republic into the Roman Empire. The empire was later divided by the emperor Diocletian into the Western and Eastern empires. During the later years of the Roman Empire, the Germanic peoples of northern Europe grew in strength and repeated attacks led to the Fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476, a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period, and the start of the Middle Ages.\n\n&gt;During the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern historians refer to this state as the Byzantine Empire. In Western Europe, Germanic peoples moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own. Of all of the Germanic peoples, the Franks would rise to a position of Hegemony over western Europe, the Frankish Empire reaching its peak under Charlemagne around AD 800. Francia was divided into several parts, West Francia would evolve into the Kingdom of France, while East Francia would evolve into the Holy Roman Empire, a precursor to modern Germany. The British Isles were the site of several large-scale migrations. Native Celtic peoples had been marginalized during the period of Roman Britain, and when the Romans abandoned the British Isles during the 400s, waves of Germanic Anglo-Saxons migrated to southern Britain and established a series of petty kingdoms in what would eventually develop into the Kingdom of England by AD 927. During this period, the Kingdom of Poland and Kingdom of Hungary (1000-1945) were organized as well.\n\n\n\n\n\ntldr;  ENGINEERING WINS!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360688527", "subreddit": "funny", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Dubious picures, third-party testimony, and personal experiences do not count as *evidence* in any meaningful use of the term. As I said, those who claim these non-evidentiary assertions are *evidence* are conflating the term with *intuition*, *feeling*, or some form of *desire*. If you would insist on a colloquial reading of 'evidence,' then I suppose one could say that the aforementioned assertions may count as evidence in *that* sense, but they are not properly considered *evidence*.\n\nPerhaps we're splitting hairs here, but as a general rule, when we speak of meaningful evidence, we're usually talking about *empirical* evidence, and as I noted, there is **zero** [empirical] evidence that any of the meaningful claims regarding Christianity (or any other religion) is remotely true -- specifically, those claims which require a supernatural explanation.\n\nTo wit, if you insist that pictures of Nessie count as evidence that Nessie lives, then you must accept *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (US title: *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*) as evidence that there is a magical rock which changes metals to gold and grants its owner the power to brew an elixir which provides immortality -- yet that is clearly preposterous. Perhaps you mean to say that if someone judges some written, oral, or sensory 'testimony' to be *true*, then it counts at least minimally as *evidence*, but again, if that is true, then there is apparently *evidence* that alien species routinely visit trailer parks in Arkansas and abduct functionally literate persons on whom to run experiments invariably involving the abductee's anus.\n\nIf we're adopting a purely subjective definition of what counts as 'evidence,' then all bets are off. I grant without reservation that different persons view different information (or misinformation, as the case may be) as 'evidence,' but the fact that they *believe* a datum to be evidence does not *make* it evidence. At most, it counts as some persuasive element in their personal experience.\n\nMy point is that the existence of color-blind humans does not mean there is *evidence* that the colors red and green are identical. Insofar as any given datum does indeed qualify to be *evidence*, the question arises as to just what it is evidence ***of***; 'Pictures' of Nessie are not evidence of Nessie's existence, but of charlatans and opportunists. The perception that all which is green is identical in color to all which is red is not evidence of red-green equality, but of color-blindedness. That someone might believe that there is in fact a magical stone which turns metals into gold counts not as evidence that there is a Philosopher's Stone, but as evidence that there are credulous boors running amok.\n\nThe now-Christian ex-atheist who declares that she has converted to Christianity based on some amount of 'evidence' is interpreting evidence that certain people in a technologically simple era wrote fantastical stories about an executed cult-leader as 'evidence' that *HE IS RIZEN!!!1!eleventy-one!!*\n\nI do indeed welcome any current Christian -- be she an ex-atheist or not -- to detail some *bona fide* evidence which aided in her conversion or the founding of her beliefs (as a Christian), and I guarantee you that it is in fact either a clear conflation of *evidence* with *intuition*, *feeling*, or *desire*, else it is an appeal to these or to personal experience. None of this, of course, truly counts as **evidence**.\n\n(I hasten to note that certain Christians I know -- some of whom I might even call friends -- would appeal all day to personal experiences involving 'miraculous' events, including improbable cures, efficacy of prayer, and one particular charlatan has insisted that he observed a man raised from the dead -- in Africa, of course, without so much as a crappy cell phone camera to document the incident, much less any verifiable medical assessment of the man's condition before or after the event, and of course, the man is completely anonymous. In spite of the *potential* for these to count as empirical evidence, they at best count as hearsay, and in most cases also count as examples of confirmation bias. That is, they are *not* evidence in favor of the claims made, but instead they are evidence of charlatanry and credulity.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360799569", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

That someone might believe that there is in fact a magical stone which turns metals into gold counts not as evidence that there is a Philosopher's Stone, but as evidence that there are credulous boors running amok.\n\nBut hey, you keep squeezing your anus.\n\n&gt; The whole point of faith is having faith about *[sic]* the things that don't matter, or are unknowable, and focusing on what's important.\n\nIncoherent statement is incoherent. \"The whole point of faith is having faith [. . .]\"? I should have faith in \"the things that don't matter\"? I should have faith concerning the \"unknowable\"? Faith somehow helps me \"[focus] on what's important\"?\n\nAre you high?\n\n&gt; You could use more goodwill and less vitriol.\n\nHeh. I have \"empirical\" subjective evidence that spewing vitriol is therapeutic. Egads! Now we have \"evidence\" of conflicting things!

With her still unaware of my plans for the date, we drove off into the serpentine highways leading into Grand Rapids.\nI lead her into the heart of the city where [ArtPrize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artprize) was going on. One of the exhibits had the possibility to be the makings of a most magical first date: as soon as we walked onto Monroe ave, thousands of multicolor planes came soaring from many a building. the streets were filled with people and joy was surrounding us. \n\nAnd with the love of a breeze, Sigur Rós's Olsen Olsen spread through our lungs and eyes. The planes had musical staves on them that had the melody for Olsen Olsen on them. People knew that this was going to happen so a bunch of people brought instruments or sang along. Even the Grand Rapids Symphony director was in on it. [Video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXxJ9i91vfE)\n\n\nUnfortunately, the planes didn't last too long, but the joy was not short-lived. We continued walking around the city, looking at other exhibits and talking all the while. After twenty minutes or so, we found a stump on the edge of the river and looked out at a wooden Loch Ness monster that was part of ArtPrize. Here we stayed and talked for quite some time.\nI couldn't believe how well we were getting along!\n\nSmiles were wide and eyes were bright.\n\nwe drove back to my house where i proffered some pasta. she excitedly accepted and we listened to Ratatat  while we ate.

We had packed up a cheap, easily collapsible rod in my bag, and we had picked up some brews in the last little village we went through.  I'd say it was about 4:30, but it was in the summer, so we had plenty of time before sunset.  Besides, we had some nuts and granola bars and jerky and shit.  But we'd gone a while without a hot meal, and some fresh cooked fish would have satisfied the bellies mightily.\n\nWe dug up some worms and set to casting and waiting.  After about a half hour of nothing, we finally got to catching, like, 3 nice fat fish in the span of about fifteen minutes.  \n\nMy mate was about ready to pack up and start a fire, but I wanted to get another so we'd both have two.  But he had a fair point; it was time to make a fire.  So he set forth on that, while I waited on the last little bugger to make my dinner.  \n\nI was sitting for about 20 minutes, occasionally stealing sips of his beer, when I get this MASSIVE pull on the line.  I start reeling the fucker in, but he's fighting hard.  My buddy comes over and helps me.\n\nAfter about 3 minutes of fighting, the bugger starts becoming visible under the water.  Boy was this a biggie.  Mine tonight, for sure!\n\nIt starts cresting above the water, when all the sudden I hear some giant noise.  It was shouting, and it was coming from the direction of the fish.   It bellowed, \"IF YOU LET ME GO, I'LL GIVE YOU ABOUT TREE FIDDY.\"\n\nIt was just about then when I realised that the thing on the end of my line was not a delicious fish, but a massive reptilian giant from the paleozoic era.  My buddy was so scared, but I just chucked one of my beer cans at him and I was like, \"Hell, no! I ain't givin' you no goddamn tree fiddy!\"  \n\nEventually, we bargained that if he would come up with us and take a picture, we would let him go.

{"body": "Well, this is without a doubt getting buried, but it's one of my favorite stories.\n\nI was up at scout camp, like I do every year. This one camp is broken into two camps, who both think they are better than each other, and are separated by about a mile of woods, with a small road running down the middle. Now I am attending camp A, which has a tradition of going to camp B, and stealing their bird statue, which is like their camp mascot. And if course, while stealing the bird earns you \"mad street cred\", you can't tell anyone because its against the rules.\n\nSo a group if my friends and we all decide that we would take the bird, since it was some of our last years at camp. We meet at a picnic table and just chill out while playing music. Another guy, who none of us know, starts talking to us. We decide to ask him to help us steal the bird, and that we would meet back at the picnic table at 1:00 AM\n\nWe all go back to our camp sites and change into all black. Soon enough, 1:00 comes around, and we set off. We first had to sneak past the staff site, which required us crawling on our stomachs for about 20 minutes, while we are no more than twenty feet away from some staff members. \n\nAfter we had passed our first obstacle, we finally reached the road. Normally, being 1:00 in the morning it would have been quiet, except that it was the day when half the staff was allowed to leave, and would all go out. So we begin walking along the tree line, keeping our eyes peeled for the faintest sound of an engine, or the subtle glow of approaching headlights.\n\nThen we see our first car. We all dive off the side if the road. One if us goes into a ditch, and throws leaves over his head. The other two run into the trees, and hide just behind the first row, while I dive off as well ... Right into a briar patch.\n\nThe car passes by, and I get myself unstuck from the thorns. Over the next mile, we had to repeat this about a dozen times.\n\nFinally, we get to the other camp,  And look up to where the bird is perched. And then a car comes. We are right in the open. We all make a dash for the cars that line the roads. Then the car stops. We all had gathered near a camp bus, and were about 50 feet from the car. We get ready to run, thinking that we were caught, when one of the guys notices that the bus door isn't locked. We all scramble inside, and pull the door shut, just as one of the guy walks by. After looking around, he left. We looked out the windows of the bus, and at our prize, perched on top of a large rock.\n\nAnd then the lights in the office behind it flick on, as someone walks in. We quickly decide to go through with the plan. We run up to the side of the building. Then one if them crawls over to the small rock, where the stand for the bird is.\n\nHe turns his head to us, and shakes his head. The bird had been replaced by a branch, which meant that someone had beaten us there. We returned to our camp, and were about to part ways with the guy who had joined us.\n\n\"Well, sorry it was a busy\" we said.\n\n\"Yeah, it's no problem\", he replied, \"but I have to ask you guys one thing\"\n\n\"Sure, what is it?\"\n\nHe looked at us and said, \"I'm going to need about tree fitty\"\n\nIt was at this time that we realized that we realized that he was a 500 foot tall monster from the Paleolithic era\"\n\n\"Damnit Nessie, we ain't given you no tree fitty\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361042439", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I opened the thread, I was listening to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqd-EG8p64k), and it is so hilariously relevant.\n\nTo answer your questions, that first example you posted seems like a dude with a somewhat high testosterone level experiencing a need for physical contact (I'm inferring from his post that he doesn't get much). Have you ever gone a really long time without any meaningful physical human contact? I'm not talking about handshakes, I mean like a long, loving embrace? There have been times where I've probably gone months without experiencing it, and it without fail leaves me feeling empty. People like physical affection enough to crave it, and the cravings typically get worse the longer you go without it. The more aggressive your nature, the more aggressive you'll feel about wanting that affection. The second example you posted is ridiculous. I don't get savage when I'm fucking no matter how good or bad the sex is.\n\nI'd say I always feel animalistic, since that's all we really are. I feel a drive to fuck, but isn't that normal? I wouldn't call it primitive, I'd call it possessing functioning genitals. I don't buy into that alpha male evopsyche/biotruth bullshit, I've taken beatings from guys who would be considered betas and beaten the fuck out of guys who would be considered alphas. I don't get a drive to fight or be competitive in any way because I literally fight at least twice a week in a controlled environment and vent tons of aggression 4-6 other times in a weight room. Fuck cavemen, I feel infinitely closer to men like Einstein or even bastions of modern masculinity like Hemingway than some ancient cave dwellers. I can explain to you how to unseat a GPU, I couldn't care less about the Paleolithic era. \n\nIf I were to describe what it feels like when I'm fighting or lifting (or doing anything athletic and competitive), I wouldn't compare it to anger. When I get mad, I do irrational things and am constantly tempering an urge to lash out in some way. I've gotten so good at controlling anger that it's probably the weakest emotion I experience. When I'm doing something that I use as an outlet for aggression or to be physically competitive, I basically dissociate from my thoughts. I'm entirely lost in the action of the moment. I can't string together thoughts because there aren't really any thoughts to string together. If my thoughts/feelings were transcribed it would look like: Dodge left hook. Step inside guard. Knee to liver. Or: Unrack weight. Feet shoulder width. Look straight ahead. Begin repetition. Chest and back stationary. Hit parallel. Explode upward. Do not lock knees. Next repetition. \n\nOnce you get used to this state, you can start thinking ahead to essentially strategize on the fly. It's hard to describe. I think it's depicted pretty well in the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes movies when Sherlock plans all of his actions in the matter of a few split seconds. At least that's how I started to feel once I got better at fighting and it's also how you correct your form at heavier weights/keep your form during longer sets. I think it starts out as a primarily subconscious sensation, and part of it always will be (it's not like I can just jump into this mode at will), but you can consciously manipulate it. Personally I think it comes from a release of adrenaline and extreme exertion - your body is basically in kill or be killed mode, and sick people like me get excited about that kind of shit. It doesn't make me \"feel strong,\" I just kind of act without taking things like strength into consideration. There's never a moment when I have 500+ lbs on my shoulders where I think \"this is like the weight of the world on my back, I'm strong as fuck,\" it's more like \"stand up. Now. Or die.\" I can't not finish the rep in that situation because my body/mind don't acknowledge the option to not immediately react. Yes, it is constant, until the match/workout/set is over and I collapse from exhaustion. It's not a matter of how \"strong\" I feel it, it's something that just happens automatically. Resistance isn't an option, which is why I do it in a controlled environment. \n\nSorry if I rambled there, but those were some great questions and I wanted to address them all. I hope it makes at least some sense. \n\nTL;DR: It's a vestigial survival instinct that kicks in when you face extreme danger/exertion.

{"body": "&gt; I'm talking about the marketing of a program that we will most certainly see disappear in our modern culture within the next few years.\n\nYou actually might be right on that.  There's that blatant evolutionary fallacy that needs to be dealt with.  Part of dealing with it is educating people.  Eliminating grains and sugar goes a long way to increasing the nutrient density of the diet.\n\n&gt; I must remind you that the paleo diet draws its influence from the paleolithic era, when human adults consumed no dairy whatsoever.\n\nIf I went out and killed a cow for food, you better believe I'm eating the udder, which would have milk in it.  I said, we didn't have much dairy.  Paleo also recommends eliminating dairy, but many people aren't full paleo.  Dairy has some nasty things like casein and IGF-1, which are allergenic and promote growth &amp; aging respectively.\n\n&gt; It was quite literally the stone age, with technologies for fishing (and cooking!) largely undeveloped until the Upper Paleolithic/Mesolithic Era.\n\nDepends on the technologies you need.  They probably didn't have nets early on.  They certainly had spears to kill a fish or they could have collected crabs/muscles living in tide pools.  Omega 3s are largely found in the ocean, whereas omega 6s are largely found on land.  Both are required for proper human brain development.  Inland animals tend to have smaller brains, which is likely due to low omega 3 (DHA) consumption.\n\n&gt; So with scattered populations varying in progress and biology, eating vastly different diets (and many still eating raw meat) why does the Paleo diet get to pick-and-choose where and when its fruits and veggies and animals came from and how they were prepared?  Why don't you hear of people eating termites and caterpillars to drop 20lbs?\n\nWe live in a society that is afraid of insects and bacteria.  There are too many people on the planet today, and grain-fed meat is clearly unsustainable.  We maybe have 50 years of topsoil left in the US thanks to poor agricultural choices that have been made for hundreds of years.  Insects will likely be back on the menu in the US in the next 50-100 years.  \n\nThere are also benefits to eating raw meat.  Raw fish is higher in omega 3s (omega 3s break down at high temperatures) and burning meat (really browning anything, but meat is worse) creates some nasty byproducts.  We have engineered our food to taste good, not necessarily be healthy.\n\n&gt; Any self-help book or trendy website that claims to organize data that is still being collected, is misleading people who failed with the South Beach diet and will find themselves adopting any number of these new programs within the year.\n\nDid you ever wonder why so many people need to diet?  Obesity rates started rising around 1975-1980.  What changed and how can we undo what happened?  Two major things happened to our diet in that time frame.  In 1975, HFCS was introduced and in 1977 low fat became mainstream.  I'm not saying I know what the cause was (or even that there aren't many causes), but sugar is certainly not helping.\n\nPaleo's belief is that eating low nutrient foods is the major cause of obesity and chronic disease.  Excessive intake (and thus weight gain) is thus byproduct of eating a low nutrient diet.\n\nObesity over the last 50 years http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/USObesityRate1960-2004.svg/350px-USObesityRate1960-2004.svg.png\n\n&gt; There has never been a \"perfect\" human diet and there never will be.\n\nI agree.  There's too many variations in genetics, epigenetics, and even performance requirements (e.g. an athlete) for there to be one diet.  I think a vegan diet can be healthy, but that you need to eat whole foods.  I think it's just a lot easier to get certain nutrients (e.g. DHA, saturated fat, monunsaturated fat) by eating meat, which I believe are necessary to our health.  I survived for 30 years before paleo, but I had many chronic diseases.  When I eat my old diet for one day, I feel terrible.  That's not health.

I can decide to believe in Zeus, the Tooth Fairy, Loch Ness Monster, or even believe that I have meaningful conversations with invisible people. There is no proof nor can there ever be any proof. It's just my belief and I created the belief. \n\nIt is true that some beliefs seem to be innate. Such is the belief in the Christian God for example. However, it only feels innate because we were raised in a Western Culture. Had I been born in India, a belief in Shiva would have been ingrained in my upbringing and I would feel like there was no choice in holding that belief.  \n\nFor the most part, many of the things that we \"believe in\" are cultural and social artifacts.  We have a cultural connection to the story of Jesus but that doesn't make it real. It just makes it feel like a more acceptable god to believe in. This is why using the belief in Zeus  seems strange, but if I had said Jesus, there would be less objection even though they are both exactly the same thing... Storybook characters. \n\nThe difference here is that claiming a belief in things like gods, fairies and monsters is up for grabs. They originate in stories and have no factual basis. I select the the things that I wish to believe in and dismiss those that I do not. \n\nIn contrast, claiming that you believe in Evolution is just unnecessary. It's like saying \"I believe that birds can fly\".... So what? The fact that someone has this belief adds nothing and is not required to validate or qualify the fact that birds can indeed fly.

{"body": "So about two years ago I was with some of my best friends I've known just about my entire life, visiting my cousin in Boston. We were all piled into my buddies van and looking for something to do. So we took some bong hits and decided to venture downtown. It was a clear , warm evening in July, the sun was setting , the sky was orange. So we parked in a lot and got out of the van. Then walked to the Boston Cemetery to look at Paul Reveres grave among others. One of my friends i'll call him Steve was getting a bit paranoid , it was most definitely the pot ( he is a heavy smoker) and kept saying he's seeing things and that he just wanted to go get some munchies . I was fine with going but our other friend i'll call her Eve who's majoring in phycology asked Steve what he saw. Steve said he saw his dad. His dad had been dead for 4 years. ( died in a car accident ) \n\nSo at this moment we were all kind of sketched out . We decided we'd go get some Chinese food and talk this over , Steve was upset. So we walked into the eerie night checking corners looking over our shoulders until we got to the restaraunt. We walked in and were greeted , then placed our orders.  The total came out to Tree fiddy. And that's when Shaggy cracked! He bolted out of the place. Velma was perplexed , the order couldn't possibly of come to the total of tree fiddy! She thought for a moment while we all stared blankly and then reached her hand over to the Chinese girls neck and slowly pulled off a mask. I was shocked I hadn't noticed before , the Chinese girl who was taking our order was staring down at us from about 8 feet up and had a 12 foot long tail thrashing about . So my friend Fred says \" NO LOCHNESS MONSTER YOU A'INT GETTIN NO TREE FIDDY!\" We left and went to find Shaggy. What a strange night indeed.

{"body": "Back in 1992 I was working on an expedition in the lower Nile region when we came across an anomaly in our radar shoots. Further investigation seemed to confirm that there was a structure underground. We began digging, and did in fact discover a small tomb-like structure buried under a few meters of sand. You may recall reading about this in the papers.\n\nFunding for our project was in danger of being cut, so we threw all our money into this project like there was no tomorrow. After days of safety checks, we were clear the proceed into the structure. It took some forcing, but the door eventually opened. Surprisingly, the smell was not bad at all. We entered the tomb and immediately noticed that, somehow, this tomb was built over a small stream. The structure seemed purposefully built in that way, because the stream had been coerced into running through a duct structure, filled with sealed pots. A small sarcophagus lay on the opposite of the room, hieroglyphs seemed to tell a story across the wall. We immediately began to secure the area and wire our higher-ups.\n\nWanting to know what was in the pots, the woman who assigned us ordered us to open one up. I objected, but she assured me we'd be cut if we didn't. So, we went ahead. Inside of the pots was a small apparatus that allowed water to wet sand, which covered another pot. The second pot was unbearably hard to open. We wired our higher up, and the moron told us to break open the pot. We had an Egyptologist from Yale on our team who almost shit herself out of anger.\n\nNevertheless, we did it. We grabbed a hammer and made a crack in the pot, which broke a seal. The lid came right off. Inside was the most surprising thing I'd seen in my life. Three small pastry-like things. Surprised as hell, we had them sent back to HQ in Cairo ASAP for testing. While we continued excavating, we later discovered that we had found a pastry made from rough grain, coated in hardened honey, and even filled with a berry mixture. Apparently keeping the sand wet and cold allowed the pastries to be \"canned\". The pot, as we later found out, had been heated and placed in the larger one, allowing for that \"canned\" effect.\n\nThis was a big media event back then, and CNN even covered an event we had during which we cut up one of the pastries and each had a bite (as our physician had pronounced them safe to eat). Still, our happiest accomplishment was finally opening the sarcophagus. Our physician and his team had sterilized the room and invited us in, and as the opened the ancient box we were overwhelmed with the odd feeling of seeing the man who created those pastries.\n\nBecause, you see, the story on the walls of the tomb had been translated. A rough translation told a story of a man who was \"of the pastries\" (Egyptologist's quote, not mine). His wife, jealous, murdered him with poison. To memorialize him, he was buried with those pots of pastries (only about 5 of the 13 were safe to consume). Still, it was odd eating something canned thousands of years ago.\n\nAs a gesture of goodwill towards \"the spirits\", one of the Iraqi physicians working with ours wanted us to pay thanks to the man. So, in a rather macabre display, we all leaned over and simply said, \"thank you\". \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy,\" he replied.

{"body": "I *nearly* did a few years ago. This may take a while to type out but here goes:\n\nBasically, I was at a house party for New Years Eve (this was 2005, the next day would be '06) and it was my best friend hosting. It was a fun party, I had quite a few beers but I was never properly drunk, my best friend, he's called Tom, on the other hand was completely smashed, and a while before midnight.\n\nI had tried all night to get with a girl but failed multiple times. About ten minutes before midnight, I needed to pee so I went upstairs to the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs Tom's mum was there to greet me. \"Oh, um, hello\" I said, or something similar, I don't remember. She smiled and said \"Oh hey boredlike, how's the party?\" \"Oh it's great, sorry if it's a bit loud for you.\" She laughed and said, \"Well that's not your fault, is it?\" I blushed. \"So,\" she said \"do you have anyone to kiss at midnight?\" Now not only was I blushing but I was also sweating (and maybe shaking - memory is fuzzy). \"Er, no-\" \"Well how about you kiss me?\" I weirdly squeaked in surprise and before I could actually say anything she took my hand and brought me to her bedroom.\n\nOnce we were in there she starts undressing and saying things like \"I want you inside me, boredlike\" and \"I've always had a thing for you\", all the while I'm standing there awkwardly. She pulled me down on to the bed with her and tried taking off my shirt, but I resisted. \"What's the matter?\" she said \"You know I'm divorced [*she was*], don't you like me?\" I said, \"Er, no, it's just, um... I don't have a condom!\" She smiled and took off her bra, \"I'm on the pill.\"\n\nIt was around this point that I was saved. Saved by her son, my best friend. Tom staggered in with some drunk girl I didn't know. He immediately looked up and screamed, \"MUM?! BOREDLIKE?!\" I was too shocked to say anything but his mum, my would be virginity-taker, got up and slammed the door on him and his confused drunk companion. Tom (suddenly sober), tried and failed to knock down the door and then could be heard shouting to his guests, \"GET OUT! EVERYONE OUT NOW!\", clearly wanting to be alone when he got the chance to beat me up. His mum turned to me and said, \"Boredlike, you have to go out the window, he'll get his golf club or something and attack you.\" I nodded and opened up the second-floor window and looked down to the bush which would (hopefully) break my fall. As I prepared to jump, Tom's mum said, \"Wait boredlike, not just yet.\" \"What, why?\" \"I... I need one more thing from you.\" \"Ok, what is it?\" \"...I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realised that Tom's mum was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the palaeolithic era. That goddamned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monstah I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I screamed as she swam away into the distance.\n\nSo that's it. Since then I've patched it up with Tom and haven't talked to his Mum since. Thanks for reading, sorry if it was too long.\n\n**Tl;dr Nearly had sex with best friend's mother, something unexpected gets me out of it.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361302851", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So this is basically the highlight of my life. My sophomore year in high school I had a friend that I was pretty tight with, I hung out at his place pretty much every weekend. \n\nHe had an older sister who was a senior at our school who to put it simply was rather attractive. She was pretty cool too whenever I was over there she and one of her friends would hang with us if we were playing ping pong or swimming or something.\n\nDuring the spring he played lacrosse and I didn't play a spring sport so whenever he had a game on a weekend I'd usually head over there about two hours after the game would start. One time when I had gotten there early his sister answered the door and let me in for me to wait which wasn't really a big deal. \n\nI was just sitting there watching tv passing the time when I heard her say that they were running late because the game before them went late. I looked up and saw my friends sister but all she had on was a towel. Me being the awkward kid I was I just kinda sat there not sure what to do. I didn't really consider myself a super attractive person so I didn't think she would come on to me or anything.\n\nI was wrong. She came over and sat next to me on the couch still in her towel. She kept casual conversation going for a while before leaning into me with the towel coming undone just a tad. I got really nervous and asked what she was doing and without hesitation she kissed me. Needless to say I was surprised but pretty fuckin pumped. She gave me a look that was amazing and asked me if I had ever been with a girl before and I said no. \n\nFrom there she took me up into her room where I went on to have my first time which was pretty fuckin great. She knew what she was doing. After she was done I was feelin great and kinda greedy. I asked her if we might do that again sometime. \nShe said \"Of course, but I'm gonna need tree fiddy.\"\nIt was at that point I realized my friends sister was a 500 foot tall monster from the Paleolithic era. I shouted I ain't givin you no tree fiddy you god damn monster and went on home.\n\nAnyways that's my story hope you enjoyed it.\n\nTL;DR Sex with friends sister.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361331797", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 486, "controversiality": 0}

Couldn't be that bad, right? \nGuy moves in three days later. He says that he'll keep to himself mostly, but he might bring back a lady friend or two, if that was okay. I said that it would be fine, provided they keep any and all \"activity\" confined to the top floor. We had a laugh, and he headed upstairs. \nWe never really saw much of each other; he got up at 5:30 each morning to take a run with his dog, and I didn't get up to leave for work until about 7:00. I normally got home around 8:00, by which time he'd be out with buddies from Afghanistan or something like that. We went out drinking once or twice and had a few awesome game sessions, but no real major interaction outside of the platitudes like \"Hey\", or \"How's it goin'\", etc.\nAbout three months into his stay, I started hearing some odd thumping like noises in his room at night. First time I thought he just might've been getting rough with one of his lady friends.  I asked him about it jokingly, but he said he'd gotten an early night with no company. It happens the next night at almost exactly the same time. \nAnd the next. And the next. And the next.\nBy this point, I was really suspicious. On the fifth night, after the thumping had stopped (it was in a rhythmic pattern of about one every two seconds, lasting about three or four minutes), I went up to his door and knocked. No answer. I used my key and opened the door. In the center of his room was his beagle. It looked at me and happily stuck out its tongue, and yipped at me playfully. \nThen, suddenly, it opens its mouth, and out pops a giant, two hundred foot long crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Its big red eyes bored directly into my soul.\nI said \"Goddammit monster, what do you want from me?!?\"\nMonster leans close and says, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361425400", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I said there was and gave examples of what constitutes atheist fundamentalism, of which you can google by starting with 'atheist convention'.\n\nThe results show atheist conventions from groups like the American Atheists. If you know anything about these groups at all whatsoever then you know that they do not match your description of 'atheist fundamentalists'. The American Atheists (the first result) in particular simply stand for making atheists more comfortable being atheists in society, promoting secularism, and fighting discrimination. They aren't out to preach to anyone.\n\n&gt; Please note, to me a fundamentalist is someone that has very strong beliefs about something\n\nWikipedia: \"Fundamentalism is the demand for a strict adherence to specific theological doctrines\"\n\nThefreedictionary.com: \"A usually religious movement or point of view characterized by a return to fundamental principles, by rigid adherence to those principles, and often by intolerance of other views and opposition to secularism.\"\n\nmerriam-webster: \"a movement in 20th century Protestantism emphasizing the literally interpreted Bible as fundamental to Christian life and teaching\"\n\nWiktionary: \"One who reduces religion to strict interpretation of core or original texts.\"\n\nDictionary-reference: \"a movement in American Protestantism that arose in the early part of the 20th century in reaction to modernism and that stresses the infallibility of the Bible not only in matters of faith and morals but also as a literal historical record, holding as essential to Christian faith belief in such doctrines as the creation of the world, the virgin birth, physical resurrection, atonement by the sacrificial death of Christ, and the Second Coming.\"\n\nThese results are the top 5 relevant results when you google \"fundamentalism\". They all contradict your definition.\n\n&gt; If you fail to see how that might describe a large portion of the crowd on that subreddit, we're going to have to stop right there.\n\nWe'll have to stop right here? Because you're too much of a coward to see where reasoning gets you or because you are absolutely infallible and all other opinions are flat in the wave of your omniscience? \n\n&gt; They usually feel anyone that doesn't believe as they to be not only wrong, but by and large morally wrong and deserving of scorn.\n\nThere are some groups which are deserving of scorn for their beliefs. For example I would scorn at anyone who discriminates against someone for being gay and I would scorn at anyone who feels justified in beating women. I think that most people on r/atheism (as well as anywhere else) would agree with me on that sentiment. However, I don't think that a belief in God would be enough for many of the r/atheism subscribers to think someone is deserving of scorn.\n\n&gt; I think you just have a problem with the word fundamentalist because the connotation for you is most frequently attached to some religious sects that you are strongly averse.\n\nFirstly, I don't think you are one to judge where my problem with the word comes from. It comes from its inaccuracy and that is enough for me to reject it. Secondly, it doesn't matter at all where my rejection of the word comes from because I have responded logically and not out of my gut feelings. \n\n&gt;  Do you believe in ghosts? Bigfoot? Nessie? I bet you don't either and I also bet like me you don't spend any significant amount of time concerned with that. Why don't people form groups and identify themselves strongly as aghostites existing to counter those that believe in ghosts? That would be foolishness.\n\nSee here's the thing. It's not about feeling superior to people or about judging others as stupid. Some may or may not do this, but it isn't the point. The point is that religious beliefs effect us in ways which those beliefs don't. While not all (or maybe even most) theists don't discriminate against gays, the reason that they can't get married is largely religious discrimination. Despite living in a secular nation, our politics are insanely effected by religion. Some kids or teens are even thrown out of their homes due to religion (/r/atheisthavens). Many atheists face discrimination every single day at work, at home, at school, etc., because they don't believe in God. Not believing in god [is literally enough to make atheists less trusted than rapists](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/story/2011-12-10/religion-atheism/51777612/1). Many have their lives ruined because they can't get abortions past a certain point in pregnancy due mostly to religion. There are shit loads of ways which belief in God effects us atheists every day. Beliefs in ghosts, bigfoot, nessie, or any of that other shit doesn't do that. If groups like r/atheism or AA were about feeling superior to others or judging people then maybe we'd latch onto that.  \n\n&gt; Its very strange to me that people become so engrossed in becoming anti something they believe doesn't exist.\n\nI'm not anti-god. I'm anti-religion. If you could separate God from religion, I wouldn't care since he doesn't exist. \n\n&gt; It seems so obvious to be a placeholder for a spiritual or religious life in an inverted way.\n\nIn the same way that being against discrimination against gays or gay marriage is a placeholder for traditional values in an inverted way. \n\n&gt; I don't get hard core fundamentalist atheism.\n\nNeither do I since there is no such thing.\n\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361487772", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "About tree fiddy.\n\nHonestly, though, I have no idea.  The cost would be enormous.  Just looking at the [cost of the Apollo program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program#Program_cost) compared to [the current NASA budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA) shows that we'd need about twice our current budget *just* for that program.  We'd have to abandon literally every other thing that we spend pennies on.\n\nBeyond that, you'd think/hope/assume that launch vehicles have gotten more efficient and better with advancements in fuel and materials technologies.  Sorry to say, but we use damn close to the exact same fuel in large launches that we did 50 years ago.  There are many reasons, chief of which being that it's actually pretty efficient, and it's clean (liquid fuel rocket byproduct is largely water).  Materials have improved, so you can get a bit more bang for your buck, but not enough that you're going to see drastic differences in payload capabilities particularly when it's a manned mission.\n\nFinally you get to the scope of actually building a lunar base.  There were 6 Apollo missions to actually land on the moon, the last three of which took lunar buggies with them.  Just for giggles, we'll say that the buggy space can be entirely occupied by building materials.  We've been able to do some pretty miraculous things with origami techniques, so I'll be generous and say that with maybe 4 landings we can get something marginally habitable built.\n\n\nSo we get down to the end: we'd need to double our budget and do nothing else for anyone for the entire duration of rebuilding and revetting a lunar manned space program.  A lunar base erector set would have to be provided to us for free (because we can't spend any other money), and we'd have to have 4 successful landings and build sessions before we'd have anything remotely usable.\n\nI'd say triple our budget and give us 12 years with no oversight committee", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361568501", "subreddit": "nasa", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "What's really interesting is that a *real* paleo diet would be great for you- scientists/anthropologists have determined that our healthiest point in our history is the past 75 years of our history....and the paleolithic era.\n\nWhy?\n\nWe totally fucked ourselves over with agriculture. Before it, we wandered. We ate seasonally, and always fresh. We exercised, and not in a monotonous way like today, or even over the past few thousand years toiling over our farming tools. We had more leisure time during the paleolithic era too- scientists estimate we only spent a few hours a day on food sourcing unless there was some catastrophic event.\n\nThen we discovered agriculture. Sure, it gave us cities, which gave us structure, civilization, the momentum we needed to have artisans, philosophers, inventors, etc. We truly couldn't be where we are today without it. But it also introduced us to diseases. Becoming pastoral (domesticating animals) introduced all that fatty protein to our diet, giving us cholesterol, something we'd never had a problem with before. It also cut the variety in our diets to almost nothing- grain, grain, grain, shitty cuts of grisly meat (because only the wealthy could afford the good stuff). It introduced us to many of the viruses we have today, which *used* to only live in animals, but now our animals lived among us, so we caught them too.  Cancer is the biggie these days- there have never been traces of cancer found among any of the remains of our pre-agrarian ancestors. This is all things we did to ourselves when we fucked with the natural order of things.\n\nAlso, agriculture introduced the patriarchal society structure, wherein males dominate the group. This *was not the case before this period*, unlike many myths about cavemen bullying women in the groups. We can prove this not just through archaic records but also through looking at cultures that did *not* develop agriculture, which maintained a balance between the sexes or even switched to a matriarchy, like the Pueblo people of the Americas in approximately 1500 B.C.E. People who continued to be hunter/gatherers, or who only went so far as horticulture (a rough version of agriculture) maintained respect for women. \n\nSorry, I'm rambling, I find the subject fascinating :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361585844", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am an atheist because I know of no good reason to be a theist.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or I faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nAs for the common rebuttal of 'where is you proof of the non-existence of god?', while it could be considered a fallacy to require proof of a negative, it really depends on the god in question. Some gods can in fact be dis-proven.\n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361600015", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I took a quick peek out the door to make sure no one else was around, and all I saw was Rowan getting freaky with Sofia Vergara.  I didn't have time to wonder where the fuck she came from, because as soon as I turned around Woody fucking Harrelson starting attacking me and telling me to see Rampart.  I turned and ran, but since I wasn't really looking where I was going I ended up running straight into what felt like a brick wall.  When I stood up, I was greeted with the most evil Jack Nicholson grin you could imagine.  He started babbling some gibberish, so I just ended up walking away.\n\nSo anyway I eventually wised up and started to try and track down Sarah and Isla.  I got a few feet into the woods when Arnold Schwarzenegger calls me an ugly motherfucker and kicks me so far into the air that Richard Branson hits me with his plane.  He brings me inside using his Virgin Mobile magic and, after hearing how I ran out on Sarah and Isla, just stared at me and said \"u wot m8.\"  He then figured that I should be getting back to the ground soon, so he brought out Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp to break me up into light particles and send me back.  \n\nI finally got back down to ground level, where I was greeted by Will Smith when he said \"Welcome to Earth!\"  His son was there too, but he was too busy messing around with Ralph Macchio to notice me.

I told Mr. Freeman that I just wanted to go home after this crazy day, told him where I lived, and he took me.  So he and I made small talk for a while, and when I was about he get out he said he needed about $3.50 for cab fare.  I reached into my pocket to get it, and that's when I noticed that Morgan Freeman was a 50-foot tall Loch Ness Monster.\n\nHe was about to curb stomp me when out of nowhere a shadowy figure tackled me into safety.

{"body": "I *nearly* hooked up with my best friend's mother a few years ago. This may take a while to type out but here goes:\n\nBasically, I was at a house party for New Years Eve (this was 2005, the next day would be '06) and it was my best friend hosting. It was a fun party, I had quite a few beers but I was never properly drunk, my best friend, he's called Tom, on the other hand was completely smashed, and a while before midnight.\n\nI had tried all night to get with a girl but failed multiple times. About ten minutes before midnight, I needed to pee so I went upstairs to the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs Tom's mum was there to greet me. \"Oh, um, hello\" I said, or something similar, I don't remember. She smiled and said \"Oh hey boredlike, how's the party?\" \"Oh it's great, sorry if it's a bit loud for you.\" She laughed and said, \"Well that's not your fault, is it?\" I blushed. \"So,\" she said \"do you have anyone to kiss at midnight?\" Now not only was I blushing but I was also sweating (and maybe shaking - memory is fuzzy). \"Er, no-\" \"Well how about you kiss me?\" I weirdly squeaked in surprise and before I could actually say anything she took my hand and brought me to her bedroom.\n\nOnce we were in there she starts undressing and saying things like \"I want you inside me, boredlike\" and \"I've always had a thing for you\", all the while I'm standing there awkwardly. She pulled me down on to the bed with her and tried taking off my shirt, but I resisted. \"What's the matter?\" she said \"You know I'm divorced [*she was*], don't you like me?\" I said, \"Er, no, it's just, um... I don't have a condom!\" She smiled and took off her bra, \"I'm on the pill.\"\n\nIt was around this point that I was saved. Saved by her son, my best friend. Tom staggered in with some drunk girl I didn't know. He immediately looked up and screamed, \"MUM?! BOREDLIKE?!\" I was too shocked to say anything but his mum, my would be virginity-taker, got up and slammed the door on him and his confused drunk companion. Tom (suddenly sober), tried and failed to knock down the door and then could be heard shouting to his guests, \"GET OUT! EVERYONE OUT NOW!\", clearly wanting to be alone when he got the chance to beat me up. His mum turned to me and said, \"Boredlike, you have to go out the window, he'll get his golf club or something and attack you.\" I nodded and opened up the second-floor window and looked down to the bush which would (hopefully) break my fall. As I prepared to jump, Tom's mum said, \"Wait boredlike, not just yet.\" \"What, why?\" \"I... I need one more thing from you.\" \"Ok, what is it?\" \"...I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realised that Tom's mum was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the palaeolithic era. That goddamned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monstah I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I screamed as she swam away into the distance.\n\nSo that's it. Since then I've patched it up with Tom and haven't talked to his Mum since. Thanks for reading, sorry if it was too long.\n\n**Tl;dr Nearly had sex with best friend's mother, something unexpected gets me out of it.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361732499", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -22, "controversiality": 0}

Friday and Saturday nights (12 AM to 4 AM) we have late night service basically getting people from campus to the bars and frats downtown. \n\nOur buses have a certain number of seats and after 12 we have a policy that all the passengers must be seated so no one is allowed to stand. ( I don't have an exact reason why this rule exists but I'm glad it does). \n\nSo I was driving one run which goes from campus to an apartment complex to downtown. I left campus with 3 seats available. I pulled up to the apartment complex and a horde of ravenous cattle er . . .students runs up to the front doors of my bus. \n\nFor late night service the drivers have a monitor which is just a helper to deal with the crowds and check ID's to make sure they are students. \n\nSo I opened the doors and my monitor was yelling out 3 seats, that's it. About three girls get in the doorway. I get out of my seat to help deal with crowd control. One of the girls grabs my arm all seductively and shit and says, \"please, let us on\" all puppy dog eyed and drunk. I said \"get off my bus, we have seats for 3 only\". I threatened to call the cops on my radio and pretended to do it. They were still there. \n\nThen I jokingly said, \"suck my dick\" and I will let you on my bus if you sit on someone's lap or the floor. So without even thinking about it she starts unzipping my pants. Halfway through it she starts growing into a giant monster and screams out, \"give me tree fiddy\".

You've beat me and proven almost two hundred years of philosophy wrong with that one statement. We should elect you dictator of the Earth. People will be greedy, government or no. People will take more than they need and more than they deserve because they \"worked\" for it. If you want to fix this, grab a firearm and go oligarch hunting with me. \n\nThe \"Personal Responsibility\" trite gets quite old, very quickly. Somehow, you assume that everyone who feels that we should have government only wishes for one because we have something to gain from it.\n\nThe whole of modernized society functions due to the division of labor. Some men pave roads, some farm, some engineer, some teach. If your claim is that this is the cause of our society's ills, you're barking up the wrong tree.\n\nYou did not create the network you're using to type this.

You didn't engineer the silicon in your computer or smartphone. You didn't sew the clothes you're wearing. \n\nIf you're a sovereign individual, leave the society and form your own collective. Remain in the paleolithic era of hunter-gatherer societies yourself and quit attempting to drag the entirety of human civilization with you. \n\nWe'll have true freedom for how long? Five, six years? If we don't all start out equal, we won't remain equal. Return to a barter system? So, we replace the government with Nestle, Kraft, Monsanto, and Tyson. Brilliant scheme. You know, you need food to survive.\n\nOr, are you talking about simply burning it all and requiring everyone to revert to a paleolithic hunter-gatherer level of existence? Wonderful way to kill billions of people.\n\nWho would ensure that you have your human rights in this wonderful society? You? The guy with the most food so, conversely, the guy with the biggest army? Might makes right, correct? Sounds an awful fucking lot like feudalism, to me.\n\nConsidering that there is a vast swath of wealth concentrated in very few people, it will remain this way. Unless, you're talking about seizing corporate property and redistributing it to the public, which is pretty much against your backwards ideology in the first place.\n\nYour \"True Freedom\" will be pursuant to whatever your *betters* believe you deserve.

{"body": "I did a stint in a prison in New Jersey. I was sentenced for 2 years only ended up doing 14 months of it but in those 14 months I heard some of the worst stories from the most despicable people this human race has ever offered to my experience. I was in for an armed robbery that I did when I was desperate and dumb. My cell-mate though was in for murder one but was so anal about everything that he exchanged protection and just general non-aggression for me keeping myself and our area clean. You'd be surprised how many people just make themselves as filthy as possible, shitting themselves and refusing to take showers, just so that people don't bother them. I didn't meet many people that were raped though I did meet a lot of people receiving anal sex. \n\nAnyway so the story I heard was from a guy who was in for aggrivated assault. He only had a couple years left so that means that this guy is out on the street right now, likely somewhere in Newark, likely back to the same shit, and likely to soon be right back in jail. He's a 6'4 black guy with muscles the size of my head and he was 6'4 in 7th grade so he's always been a target going to public schools in Jersey with 1500 people per graduating class, which means 2000 kids in a Freshman class before 500 of them drop out. So he got into some dirty shit young because he was always fighting, and he was always a good person to have on your side of the fight. He starts telling me the story about one night when some addict owes his boy upwards of five grand from some H that he was slinging for him. They show up at his apartment with him and his boy and two other dudes. Two of them have sawed off shotguns, one with a tech 9, and his boy with just a 9. So they knock on the door basically as a pretense to see how this guy will react and whether he might just try jumping out of the 3rd floor window, but he opens the door after they say who it is, he must've thought he could talk his way out of an asswhooping. Little do they know, though, that as soon as they walk in the guys two kids are sitting there watching fucking spongebob squarepants. Meanwhile a bunch of gangstas are walking in non-chalantly with shotguns to their father's gut. The guy, being the great father he is, gets his kids to go into the bathroom. As soon as he does this the guys get to work. The one who's money it is that's owed to him immediately cocks him closed fist, and then quietly asks for his money. The addict gets up and starts to talk but the same guy just pushes him back down on to the couch he landed on the first time. He starts talking. \"There's money underneath the mattress, all of it's there.\" So they go to this guy's mattress and there's about 10 grand, they take that and bring it into the kitchen, at which point the main guy goes \"Yeah this is all good, but I'm still short, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was the god damn loch ness mosnter! The addict goes \"GOD DAMN Loch Ness Monster!

{"body": "Every reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nAs for the common rebuttal of 'where is you proof of the non-existence of god?', while it could be considered a fallacy to require proof of a negative, it really depends on the god in question. Some gods can in fact be dis-proven.\n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361827031", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; This is a common cry from the so called New Atheists\n\nI'd argue that it's a \"common cry\" from any atheist ... \"new\" or \"old,\" as it should be. Claims of the supernatural are almost exclusively anecdotal (I'd say the rest are fabricated), and *never* documented in a way that's accurately verifiable. \n\nIt sounds an awful lot like claims of Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. Many people have \"seen\" them with their own eyes, and heard about them from people who have also \"seen\" them, but in the end, it's all nonsense.\n\nIt's a fairly reasonable stance. Never have I seen the laws of physics suspended. Never in person, never in video, never in a lab, nothing. Sure, you hear anecdotes (a friend of a friend was at this thing a few years back ...), but then again you hear anecdotes for all kinds of things (eg alien abduction, I totally had sex with this girl, ghosts, etc). But that's not how we know things to be true. \n\nAfter a few years into my psychology degree I really began to see how unreliable religious claims were. I fought hard (mentally) to defend religion to make myself more comfortable, but in the end I just couldn't make the facts fit anymore. The amount of things that religious people cling to as hard evidence that can be explained away rather easily from a psychological standpoint is really surprising. \n\nNot only that, but everything we use on a daily basis is a result of thinking *naturally* as opposed to *supernaturally.* We didn't pray satellites into space, and we don't trust God to make sure our houses aren't going to cave in tomorrow. There is literally no reason to think the supernatural is anything more than wishful thinking and malleable memories. Until I see any reason to believe the supernatural is at all, in any way correct, I'm sticking with the natural explanations that have gotten us this far. \n\n&gt; The subject of science is the natural world. But the supernatural is by definition not natural. How then is this a serious demand?\n\nBecause you claim the supernatural makes an impact on the natural world. Therefore, it should be measurable. Until now, it just seems like random and arbitrary ... things ... that appear only to people that want to see them (funny how Allah or Vishnu or Mormon Jesus never appear to Christians, isn't it? But they have no problem appearing to the adherents of their own religions). \n\n&gt; The Theist might as well reply: \"Until the study of the supernatural world proves that the natural world exists I refuse to believe it!\" The statement would make as much sense as the former.\n\nNo, this statement literally makes no sense, unless the person making the claim denies the existence of the natural world (which is ludicrous). There is no study of the supernatural world, only speculation and assertions. There need not be proof that the natural world exists, since, well, if it didn't, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

After a really long saturday night we decided to get wasted drunk because our off day was the next day.  Five pints in and my friend passes out.  Im pretty drunk at this point too.  This short dude comes by and props up my friend against the bar stool and says something along the lines of \" Dya need a ride home?\"  I don't know what I said but I accepted it.  Another one of his friends comes and helps pick up \"Larry\"  (not his real name)  and we go outside.  Suddenly I feel this really dull, throbbing pain on my head and I start seeing black spots.  I wake up in this concrete room with my hands tied together.  The short dude comes in with a hammer and I start to cry.  At that point I pissed my pants, and he just started to laugh.  After like five minutes he says that this is a ransom for the company i worked for (a computer parts distributor)\nand I started to freak the fuck out  because I wasnt even a manager at that point.  He says something about the Irish republican army and I pass out again.  When I come to, my friend is sitting across from me absolutely covered in blood.  So the other dude walks in with these massive almost seven foot tall dudes, and he starts screaming and pistol whipping my friend.  He yells \"this is what you get when you dont cooperate\"  Im crying and he comes over to me.  He starts yelling at me and i say OKOK ill cooperate.  This is when he says he wants all the stuff on me that could reach the authorities.  I say I dont have a cellphone on me,  so he screams at me for anything i have thats worth a shit.  So I pull out my wallet and ask how much he wants.

If we found a big scaly reptile in Loch Ness that people had been thinking was the Loch Ness monster all these years, by definition it wouldn't be the Loch Ness monster.\n\nThat's a very jumbled version of it, here's the wikipedia article detailing other problems with existence-as-a-quality.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaunilo_of_Marmoutiers#The_.22Lost_Island.22_refutation", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362020190", "subreddit": "infj", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You asked.\n\nI was locked in the bathroom, sitting on the commode when I started playing with my foreskin, moving it off and then back on to the head of my erection. It was such a beautiful feeling that it made me shiver; I repeated the motion over and over again, with the tips of my fingers grasping the foreskin like one of those claw machines you see at the mall. I could feel a warm sensation rising up my cock like the mercury in a thermometer and I backed off, letting it settle down and then started rubbing it again. Even though I had listened a few times to boys at school describing how they jacked off I really didn't associate it with what I was doing.\n\nBut the last time I manipulated the foreskin, the feeling became more intense and I quickly pulled my hand away; now it was throbbing without my touching it at all, and waves of sensation were coursing down my ball sack and thighs. Suddenly my stiff penis began erupting like a small volcano, sending what seemed like torrents of hot white lava pouring out of the opening and running down the shaft. For the first time my body seemed to be out of control, and I asked God not to punish me for what I had done. When it was over I was a gummy mess, and so was the toilet seat and the pants and underwear around my ankles, and my legs were weak with pleasure, the head of my penis sensitive to the touch. I heard God speak to me, and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was about this time where I noticed my penis was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362020527", "subreddit": "pics", "score": -10, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Atheism does nothing for me, per se. There is no dogma, world view, or teachings of 'atheism' and I get nothing from. It's no more than a label to denote that I am not a theist. \n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims of theist unconvincing. Every reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nAs for the common rebuttal of 'where is you proof of the non-existence of god?', while it could be considered a fallacy to require proof of a negative, it really depends on the god in question. Some gods can in fact be dis-proven.\n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362026205", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

They shouldn't be indoctrinated and proselytized, but they have a right to be exposed to every aspect of life that has had a major impact on society. Religion, sex, drugs, music, sexuality, etc. These things are not science based (with the exception of the reproduction process) but are imperative for to teach. \n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that for as much as we would like, we cannot completely disregard religion. It should not be discussed as an absolute truth, rather a theory that should be open to discussion. I don't believe that any topic of discussion should be tabooed; nothing good can come from that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362085096", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
