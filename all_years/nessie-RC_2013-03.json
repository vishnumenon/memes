{"body": "In Japanese, as in Chinese, family name is written and spoken first, then given name. There generally are no middle names for ethnic Japanese. \n\n* J: Suzuki Taro = Suzuki-san\n\n* E: Taro Suzuki = Mr. Suzuki\n\nFor foreigners, the name order is the same as in the original language. Katakana phoneticization is used. \n\n* J: Don Jonson\n\n* E: Don Johnson\n\nThere can be more than one possible phoneticization, because the foreign phoneme can be in between two Japanese phonemes.\n\n* J: Sessu/Sesu Kurigan/Kuriigan/Kurigen/Kuriigen\n\n* E: Seth Creagen\n\nI think for Chinese names, the name is usually read according to the Japanese reading of the characters, but it can be read phonetically according to the original Chinese. But it's easier for Japanese to remember when they can tie it to kanji. It also tends to be easier for Japanese to pronounce in the familiar Japanese phoneme combinations. So Mao becomes...  \n\n* J: Mo Taku To\n\n* E/Ch: Mao Zedong\n\nInterestingly, Japanese, unlike many other Asians, are not that resistant to changing the name order to conform to English/European conventions.

When I give my name at the doctor or a government office, it's written in the order of given name and family name, following my official ID.

Turns out I have a total crush on the sister of my best mate and tend to get raging hardons when she's near, but she doesn't seem to care. One night I was at his house, his mum and dad were at their school reunion (they both met in school). Me and my mate sat down watching T.V. while his sister was upstairs doing whatever. Out of no where, my buddy got a phone call from his parents and he needed to leave, he said they had been in a crash. Im thinking to myself 'oh shit, what am i supposed to do?'. He says he has to leave, but tells me to stay at the house with his sister (but not tell her what had happened) until he gets back. He leaves, im still trying to process what has happened. Meanwhile, his sister comes into the living room wearing barely anything. I got so fucking hard. She sits next to me, my boner showing no signs of stopping. I can't help it and keep staring at her boobs, they're so fucking huge. So I talk to her about her day and, just casual . When out of nowhere she rests her shoulder on me and strokes my hand. I stare at her in the eyes and smile. She smiles back. Very confused with everything now, I try and make a move. Funnily enough she fucking let's me. I begin groping her boobs and I swear - I'm about to cum in my fucking pants. She pulls away and says she can't. I ask her if it's because im friends with her brother. She says no, because she needs something first. \"Anything,\" I say grabbing both of her hands.

{"body": "Ahh, I was just about to go to bed, but I have an experience that applies specifically to this question.\n\nA bit of background first.\n\nWhen I was in university studying Law, I used to walk past a High school whenever I walked home. Almost everyday I'd walk home there was the same smug kid, about 17 (maybe 18 I could really tell at the time), who would lean up against the fence during lunch and even after school and just watch me walk past on my way home, It was pretty damn strange, but I never let is phase me.\n\nOne day however, when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in that university up the road right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\n\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and now I was starting to wonder just what his deal was. After a few seconds  he said, \"Graet, great, I want some drugs.\" I was really confused, apparently to him all older uni students are druggies? I have to admit, I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to mess with him (and hopefully scare him away from drugs so he would end up getting in trouble with the law), I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little plastic bag. The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free. So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence. I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\nNope.\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little gangsta wannabe voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends (at this time, my plan had pretty much backfired), regardless this was hilarious. I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I had a little smirk, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling. He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars. Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out (especially considering that my uni had pretty high standards of its students, and even more so that I was studying law) so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\n\nFast forward 10 years. I'm making my way into court for a fairly high profile case (there was plenty of cameras and media outside trying to interview anyone and anything) and what are the odds,  I see the same kid out the front of the courhouse in cuffs being escorted in by police(he looked a bit older, but his facial features were fairly recognizable, so I knew it was him).\n\n I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he started making gestures and shouting towards me. Making a massive scene, and subsequently many of the cameras turned to my direction. I have no idea what the police escorting him were doing, as they walked him right up to me.\n\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\n\nShit. He's going to shame me (and possibly damage my career and reputation) and in front of the media and professionals from mine and rival firms. \n\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back, and that I was responsible for his life of crime and supplying him drugs (and considering he was a minor at the time, shit is starting to get real in my head). \n\nBut, he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" All the media had a stunned look on their faces, as did the police, and professionals in the vicinity. Who knows what questions they now have for me,  I decided it was time to GTFO.\n\nWe started walking towards the doors of the courthouse and he says, \"Wait,\" My body seizes up, and heart starts beating 100x faster. \n\nBefore he says anything I say to him (hopefully in a last ditch attempt to make him not say anything). I say \"I can help you, free representation, we can work through this\" He turns down my offer, he says he doesnt need my help.\n\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\n\"What?\" I asked. He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I realized this guy that I once sold smarties to in drug form was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again! I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\nSo yeah, that kid was completely guilty of hiding his natural form from the World.

{"body": "I'm going to step *way* back here; sorry for all the words.\n\nAll the food we eat is made up of five families of chemicals (less water of course.) Those types are: amino acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Anything and everything we eat is a recombination of these four things in different amounts. Milk, for instance, has more fatty acids than orange juice while orange juice has more vitamins. This also explains why human beings can drink beer and eat birthday cakes without having to evolve the ability to; it's all made up of similar chemicals in various amounts.\n\nNow, you'll notice that only two of these categories provide calories. Fatty acids and carbohydrates (okay, okay, amino acids *can* but stick with me on this). Humans need calories. Every time you walk, run, jump, breath, etc. you are burning calories. A calorie is a unit of energy. Which is readily converted into a Joule. It's the exact same unit your electric company charges you by, and because energy is a conserved physical quantity, we can make thermodynamic statements regarding the energy contained in food.\n\nThe carbohydrates and fatty acids groups provide the bulk of your energy. Carbohydrates can be readily turned into glucose (blood sugar) for cells to burn or be stored as fatty acids for later. Cells can also burn fatty acids and they release a lot of energy! This is how your body turns the chemical energy in food into heat or mechanical work.\n\nNext comes the vitamins which are organic molecules that your body cannot synthesize on it's own. Not eating enough of these leads to what is known as a *vitamin deficiency*. You might be familiar with scurvy, which is a vitamin c deficiency. What makes vitamin deficiencies hazardous to health is that your body is no longer able to build the proteins it needs to. Imagine you're trying to build a series of houses with only 1 box of nails. Eventually you're going to run out, and that means trouble. Vitamin deficiencies in the western world are uncommon but they do happen and are readily treated. So long as your diet isn't crazy, like eating popcorn every day :), you should be fine. Though if you suspect you might have a vitamin deficiency you could always go to a dietican and get checked out. Chances are if you don't have any symptoms you're fine.\n\nMinerals are inorganic molecules that your body needs, such as iron and magnesium. Just like vitamins, being deficient in one can mean trouble!\n\nOkay now that we're up to speed on that. I'd like to address your popcorn scenario. One could absolutely eat 2000 calories of popcorn and burn 2500 calories and be perfectly healthy, let me explain. While popcorn certainly lacks the vitamin and mineral content of most other foods it does have a lot of carbohydrates and fatty acids in it. The storehouse of your body is your liver. If you need some extra vitamins one day it's got your back. Being 500 calories deficient for the day means your body had to burn some stored fatty acids to make up the deficit. Now, certainly eating nothing but popcorn all day erryday is going to get you into trouble as the vitamins and minerals you need to avoid a deficiency are not present. But you certainly do not need to eat large amounts of vitamins every day to stay healthy. That would be so hard to manage nobody would have made it out of the paleolithic era! Luckily, if you miss some vitamin A one day your liver has some stored up for you. You'll put it back when you eat more than your fair share of vitamin A in the future. So, while nobody would recommend eating nothing but popcorn it's not necessarily detrimental to your health so long as your body has enough of the nutrients it needs to avoid a deficiency.\n\nAs for the thermodynamic argument the equation should look more like this: STORED &lt;= IN - OUT\nI use an inequality here because not 100% of the calories you eat get absorbed, there's some left over in your poop! This absolutely holds though. Barring any extenuating health condition, the only way a person loses weight is by eating less calories than they burn. The inverse of this also holds. The only way someone gains weight is by eating more calories than they burn. Quality of the food doesn't matter; eating fatty foods doesn't make you fat! If you eat 2800 calories of fruits and vegetables but only burn 2000 calories, you're going to gain weight there tubby. Of course with the fruits and vegetables you'll get more vitamins and minerals, but you could always take a multivitamin if you're at risk of getting a deficiency!\n\nNow shifting gears to soil quality. Your position that soil quality or cultivation methods affect nutrition is misguided. A plant's nutritional content is determined by it's genetics; yield is determined by soil quality. If you and I grow the same variety of tomato on equally sized patches of land you and I will produce the same yield of tomatoes (all else being equal) which will contain, gram for gram, the same amount of nutrients. Now suppose that I don't use fertilizer (which all farms of course use to replenish the soil with minerals and nutrients.) My yield will be reduced, but gram for gram the nutritional quality of my tomatoes will be the same as yours.\n\nYour wood ash statement is also curious. Wood ash isn't often used as fertilizer. However, the point is moot so long as whatever fertilizer you are using delivers the right chemicals to the soils that plants need to grow. If a fertilizer doesn't deliver those chemicals then it won't work! Maybe wood ash is a great fertilizer, but so are peat moss and fish heads.\n\nI hope this cleared things up for you.\nAs a side note; there are, of course, nuances to the statements I have made above and this reply certainly isn't a substitute for a text book on diet and nutrition. I didn't talk about cholesterol or insulin for instance. This does however lay a basic foundation on which your understanding of food and your health should stem from.\n\nCheers.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362168931", "subreddit": "Health", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

It was a gourmet breakfast everything fresh made from scratch and I was damn good at being a cook.\nIn order to save money the hotel manager not only had me cook the breakfast, but also be the host, the server, the busboy, and the dishwasher. Daily I would make and serve food for 25-150 guests daily. It sucked.\n(I was ultimately fired because the manager said I had complaints of not spending enough time interacting with guests. No shit I was fucking busy, also complaints were on days I didn't work but oh well.)\nSo one day towards the end of the shift I see a hotel guest GOING THROUGH MY TIP JAR.\nusually if someone does that it is because they want to break a large bill but this guy was obviously stealing from me. I go over and ask the guest if I can help him and he turns bright red. He apologizes profusely about it and it turns out the guy wasn't even a guest he was just some local guy who wandered into the place to get a free meal and money.\nI didn't want to get the police involved because the guy obviously was having a rough time if he was stealing from a teenagers tip jar. I told him to just leave, he kept going on and on about how he had nowhere to go and he was starving. As a kid who had a comfortable paycheck I figured I could help the guy out and do a good deed. I asked him how much he needed to get by. And he turned to me and said \"I need about tree fitty.\" Tree. Fitty. Now, it was about this time I noticed that this guy was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era, the Loch Ness monster. I said dammit monster, get out of my hotel I ain't giving you no tree fitty! And he said well how about two fitty, and I said oh now it's only two fitty, what is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something? I kicked him about and never let him back in and this text right here is just to create space between the joke and the end of the paragraph so people skipping to the bottom to see if its a joke don't notice the above joke so now I will go back to an ending of the story that sounds legit. So basically I ended up having to call the police because the guy was throwing chairs and shit around I mean if you are going to steal and then get offered money  land not accept it I don't feel bad for you or for calling the cops.\n\nTL:DR guy steals from my tip jar, I feel bad and offer money, guy turns crazy and I kick his ass to the curb.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362197223", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -11, "controversiality": 1}

My job was to find out what they were and to stop them. During the course of the events of the dream, I even navigated the inside of one of them avoiding saws and gears to come out the other side. Eventually, they stopped happening and me and all my detective budding were standing on a bridge talking about how we didn't have to worry about them anymore, and I said \"I wonder where they came form in the first place\", and from the stream under the bridge  the Loch Ness Monster came up and admitted to being the one who made the machines.

{"body": "People have been looking at naked people, and watching other people perform sex acts for thousands of years and getting off on it.  It was only turned into something taboo by the church telling people nudity is evil.  \n\nPorn isn't weird, or even a 'new' phenomena.  Erotic art has been discovered as far back as the Paleolithic era.  That's over 2 million years ago, fyi.  \n\nNudity is not evil, it's not shameful, and it only holds connotation because of what the people in charge of any given society thinks of it and tells other people to think about it.  Further, opinions on the subject are likely related to your upbringing and how nudity was treated in your family.  Go to Europe and you'll see an entirely different reality.  America was founded by prudes.\n\nFurther, it was 'never' only something intimate between couples.  I'm sure if people have always treated it that way around you, then yes that's your understanding of it.  But that's barely a societal norm in the grand scheme of things, and as the world falls away from the religious strangehold that has dominated it for the past century or so, then you will watch as people stop giving as much of a fuck.\n\nI notice how you're quick to judge the rest of society, as if something is wrong with everyone else for being so casual about it.  The rest of us are weird for having such a casual stance on something which we feel isn't a big deal.  You're making it a big deal by pushing your insecurities on other people.  Please don't do that, the rest of us are tired of close mindedness making others uptight.  Because really, why bother getting so uptight about it?  Why does it make you uncomfortable?  We come into the world naked, and we probably spent a LONG time on this planet wearing either nothing or a few strips of leather to cover our genitals.  People STILL on this very planet, walk around in tribes wearing absolutely nothing, or very minimal coverings.  Because in their society, it means absolutely nothing.\n\nIt's sort of along the lines of swearing.  I swear all the fucking time, because I don't care about the negative connotation we've put on swear words.  Sure, I'll hold my tongue in a business or professional setting.  Societal norms be damned, but I'll still lose the respect of my superiors and maybe my job if I let an f-bomb drop.  Such is life.\n\nBut when I'm out around my friends and other people, I don't care what people hear come out of my mouth.  I'm not saying it to offend them, I'm saying it because it has no offensive meaning to me.  I don't get bothered by fuck, shit, cock.  Other people might, but why?  They're only offended because they've been taught to be offended since they were kids.  Offended over NOTHING.  Words that WE gave meaning to by taking offense to them.  When you were a kid discovering swear words, it was a taboo.. Ooooo, we just said 'shit', we'd be in such big trouble if our parents heard us.  But it has no meaning to us as kids.  It's just a funny word we've never been allowed to say.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I'll get downvoted.  But I just don't see the point in being so uptight about something so damned natural.  Nudity should be fun, sex should be fun, and you damn well shouldn't be offended by your boyfriend jerking it to naked women.

{"body": "We were driving back up to Memphis from Mobile one night. Must've been July or August because it was some kind of hot and humid. The kind of air where you just step outside and start sweating. We'd just finished up a little show at some dive downtown. Stayed a while after to have some drinks with the patrons. Our friend Barney was driving, and he'd had a few to drink, but he always drove better with a couple in him anyway. Fella played a mean harmonica. And wouldn't you know we weren't fifteen miles out of town before Barney goes \"watch out boys, we got lights on our tails.\" And sure enough, there they were. State trooper, too, so you know he was serious. Barney eases on over to the side of the road, and he turns to us and says \"boys, I can't get into no more trouble in Mississippi. We going to have to high-tail it on out of here.\" Now, me and the other fellas were a dozen kinds of nervous, but we knew better than to get between Barney and the wheel of a car. He waited til that officer was right up at the window looking in and punched it. We took off like shit through a mule, tearing down that old highway with the trooper getting smaller in the rearview. Of course it wasn't long til those blue and red lights was right back up on us. A couple of us were hollerin out to Barney to turn us all in, but he wasn't having a bit of it. We flew through another 5 miles of rural highway, and then we noticed a second car coming up on us fast. Barney turned to us and said \"hold on boys, I'm gonna try somethin.\" He slammed on the brakes, the car veering to the left, then the right. One patrol car flew past us, skidded fifty feet, turned on its side and rolled off into the ditch by the side of the road. The other car slammed into the rear of our car, bringing everything to a jarring halt. From under the seat Barney brought out a six-shooter. He turned to me and said \"don't worry boss, I'll get us out of this one yet.\" He climbed out of the car through the driver-side window. The rest of us clambered out as quickly as we could, but it was only a second before we heard gunshots. The rest of the fellas hunkered down in the back, but I lept on out and hit the ground rolling. I looked up just in time to see Barney fall in a heap, a trail of blooding running from his thigh to the ground. He cried out in pain, reaching out for his six-shooter lying just a few inches away. Out from behind the patrol car stepped a long, lanky officer. He was shrouded in shadows, a dark and sinister look on his face. \"Boys!\" he said, looking from Barney to me, \"Now just what have we got here?\" Oh I was scared somethin fierce. Barney was just lyin there whimperin and the officer was coming right at us. He stepped on Barney's gun, then kicked it away. \"It's always been my policy to kill anybody ever shot a gun at me,\" he said. Barney broke out into a cold sweat. He looked up at me, like some pitiful old huntin dog caught in a trap. \"Oh no, officer,\" I said, keeping my eyes at the man's feet \"please don't go killin nobody. Ain't nobody need to die tonight.\" The man took another step towards me, keeping his gun pointed at Barney. \"Perhaps a bargain then, my friend?\" he said to me, a smile creeping across his face, a menacing spark in his eyes. \"Oh sir, name your price\" I said to him. The officer turned his back on me, walked away a few steps, and seemed to take in the starry night that lay before him. After a few seconds he turned back to me, and these are the words he said: \"Well, I reckon I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time that I noticed this police officer was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "A few years back I played in a basketball league up in Dayton, OH. There were just 6 of us on the team, but we'd get together in play with some other guys from time to time. At the end of the year we had a little tournament, not real competitive but a lot of fun. So one year this tournament comes along and there's a new team with a bunch of guys that are way more serious than the rest of us. I wish I could say we put them in their place, but they went to school on us. There was this one guy in particular, had to be about 6'6 or 6'7. Dude could ball. Dunks, 3s, ridiculous moves I've only seen watching NBA games before. So anyway, we're all getting our ass kicked by this team, and in between games one of my buddies I see every year tells me to stick around after the final game is over. He said that one of the guys on his team was friends with someone that I would want a chance to get to see, and that this guy would be coming down to the gym in a while. About an hour later it gets out LeBron James was going to come down and shoot for a while. This was around his 4th year in the league, so he was still playing with Cleveland. Obviously everyone was psyched. The final game finished and everyone just hung around, waiting to see if LeBron really showed up. I remember looking around and seeing everyone just hanging out, generally having a good time, except for one dude. The hardcore dude. The dude that wrecked everyone so hard in the tournament. He was sitting by himself, elbows resting on his knees, staring intently at the ground in front of him. He sat like that for the next fifteen minutes, until a few people came into the gym with LeBron walking in behind them. There were cheers from all of us, and LeBron smiled and waved and told us that he wanted to come see some hometown people who were enjoying the game. He did a few dunks for us, and everybody oohed and ahhed, and began to sign some autographs. I was back to talking with some friends when I noticed the dude from earlier get in the autograph line. He wasn't holding a sharpie or shirt or shoes or anything; he was just staring down at the ground. I watched until he got to the front. He looked Lebron in the eye and said \"one on one, lets go.\" LeBron smiled and laughed and took it as a joke. He clapped the guy on the shoulder and said \"maybe another time man\" but the guy shrugged off his hand. \"Come on, man, lets throw down right now, man\" the dude said. LeBron stopped smiling. I could tell he was a little pissed off, but I would have never guessed what happened next. LeBron stepped away from the dude and took off his t-shirt, revealing a black wife-beater underneath. \"Fine, lets ball\" he said. He turned his back on the dude, picked up a ball, and walked towards a hoop. We were all silent. We looked at the dude, who was still standing in the same spot, staring at the ground. He walked over to the top of the key, and received the ball from LeBron. I couldn't believe what I was watching. This random ass dude was about to play King James! We all speechless, just standing around in a semicircle to the side of the court. The dude checked the ball with LeBron, and LeBron passed it back, flashing a smile to the rest of us. The dude held the ball and just stood there, staring down at the ground. He stayed like that for a few seconds, not moving a muscle. \"Come on, kid, we gonna do this?\" LeBron asked. The dude looked up, put the ball in his right hand and started dribbling. LeBron stood across from him two feet away, dropped down into a defensive stance. The dude took a step to the right, crossed over to his left, and then took another step back. LeBron raised his hands at him, acting bored. And then something happened that I'll never, ever forget. The dude dribbled twice between his legs, and then started his move. He dribbled twice hard towards the lane, bumping up against LeBron's chest, and then swirled the ball around his back, *and Lebron*. Everyone gasped; the dude ran past LeBron and snatched the ball off the bounce, an inch away from LeBron's outstretched hand. The dude took another dribble, elevated, and through it down with one of the most spectacular two-hand tomahawk jams I've ever seen. It was spectacular. Sensational. We stood in silence. The dude landed back on the ground and didn't say a word. He didn't even look at LeBron or the rest of us. LeBron gave a little laugh, as if it had been no big deal, but we knew: the king just got schooled. The dude walked away from the court and out of the gym through a side door. The guys I was standing with all started talking amongst themselves, but I took off immediately after the dude. I found him standing in the parking lot, staring at the ground. \"Dude\" I said \"what the hell just happened in there?\" He looked up at me with a sad look in his eyes. \"I always knew I could make it man\" he said to me \"some things just don't work out, huh?\" I put my hand on his back. \"What you did in there was pretty amazing shit.\" \"It's vindication, man\" he said \"I won't never be a star. I used to think I would be, but I know I won't now. But that's all okay, man. Now I'm vindicated.\" He looked at me with a small smile on his face, a couple tears welling up in his eyes. \"Anything I can do for you, man?\" I asked. The dude looked me in the eye, sighed, and said \"I could use about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time that I noticed the dude was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "I used to work with an old man down at the saw mill outside of town. There would be around 20 of us at the mill at any given time, so we got to know each other pretty well. But old man Seamus, that was his name, he never used to fraternize with the rest of us. He was tough as a boot though, and he cursed like a sailor, mostly to himself. Old man Seamus lived in a big old house on the other side of town. It was a massive thing, 7 or 8 bedrooms. We'd always heard he inherited it. Well, for a number of years the mill was having a hard time staying open, and one winter we all finally got the word we were shutting down. There wasn't much to the town we lived in, and a lot of the guys from the mill had a hell of a time finding work. Some of the men with families were falling on real hard times, losing their houses and such. And then one day we get word that old man Seamus was moving away, and that he wanted to leave the house to the fellas from the mill. I was slow getting word about it, and by the time I drove up to old man Seamus's place there were a bunch of guys were there. A couple of the families of men from the mill were there too; it turns out old man Seamus had told them ahead of time. It was his wish that, if they wanted, they could live together in his house. Well, I tracked down old man Seamus to hear it for myself. \"I won't be needin this no more\" he told me. It was just him and me standing on the porch. \"Why Mr. Seamus?\" I asked him \"you never cared much for any of us.\" He turned away from me and gazed out towards the horizon, pausing before saying \"Son, I wouldn't wish the life I've had on anybody. Sometimes I even feel like I got cheated somehow. But all I know is that you and your buddies were just about the closest thing I've had to friends for a long time now, and I just assume see you'ns well off as much as anyone else.\" He took a step away from the balcony and turned to face me. \"Listen son,\" he said \"I've got cancer. It's gonna kill me, but I figured I'd at least give it hell before it does. I'm headed off for treatment in the morning up in Nashville.\" He paused, then said \"I'm glad I got to see ya before I left, kid.\" He started to walk away. As he reached the doorway I called out \"Wait! Mr. Seamus!\" He turned to me, tears welling up in his eyes. \"Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. Seamus?\" I asked him. \"How can we repay this kindness you have shown us?\" He looked down at the ground, brow furrowed, and then looked me eye to eye. \"Well\" he said \"I reckon I could use about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time that I noticed old man Seamus was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "I still remember the moment I realised I was a dick when I'm drunk. It was New Years Eve 2007, I was young, socially awkward, didn't really know how to hold a normal conversation, and I was at this house party of some guy I didn't really know but thought was cool (we'll call him \"Jack\"), so I got drunk. Now, I was in Australia, so New Years Eve is in the middle of summer, and it was a very warm night, around 30 degrees Celcius as late as 10, maybe 25 degrees when the clock struck 12. This is important, cos everybody was in t-shirts and shorts, except me. I was a little bit self-conscious about my body back then (still am, in fact), so I was wearing a baggy jumper and jeans. I was hot, irritable, lonely, and to make matters worse, people were jumping in the pool and having a great time. I LOVE swimming, I feel completely at home when I'm in the water, but even drunk, I didn't have the confidence to strip down in front of all these other people. Instead, I just started singing along to whatever music was playing and being generally loud and obnoxious to hide how uncomfortable I was feeling.\n\nEventually, after several failed attempts at conversation, I decided to just go home. It wasn't even midnight yet, but I was just feeling depressed, anxious, and completely out of my element. I finished my what must have been roughly my 50th beer (I'm very large, I can drink A LOT), and sought out Jack, the host. I told him I was leaving, and to my utter humiliation, he said, \"Yeah dude, I don't really know you, but whatever.\" Fuck. I turned and walked away, searching groggily through my wallet to scrape together the cab fare to get home. It was usually about $10 to get to my place, and I was just short, from memory having about $7.50. Just when I thought my night couldn't get any worse, Jack called back to me, laughing, and said, \"Haven't you gone yet?\" I replied truthfully, since I was beyond trying to be cool, \"I don't quite have enough money for the cab fare.\" He said, \"How much do you need?\". I replied, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" It was at that moment that Jack realised I was a 500 foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. He yelled, \"I aint giving you no tree-fiddy you god-damned Loch Ness monster!\" which just made me feel even worse about myself. Everybody else at the party noticed the conflict, and started yelling and screaming, so I jumped into the pool and started flailing, crushing a few people and soaking the entire house. Eventually the cops were called, but I fled back to Scotland by the time they came.\n\nFrom that point on, I've been much more careful with how much I drink, as I know I can go a bit over the top.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362437493", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 10, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I formerly worked in a college town grocery store and supervised a department of the store. Being a college town most of the employees were younger and many of the girls were pretty good looking. It also seemed the prettier they were the lazier. Anyways, there was this smoking hot blonde who worked in the bakery that I had always had my eye on since I had hired her. She had a boyfriend so I never made a move, it would have been risky enough being her superior. She was pretty good at her job(mostly baking cookies and simple birthday cake decorations) but she never went above and beyond on anything. One day I was sitting in my office going over the week's payroll and she knocked on my door, peeked her head in and asked to talk. She came in and sat down and started making small talk, I instantly noticed something was a little strange only because we usually didn't carry on long conversations and it definitely had a flirtatious feel to it. Eventually the conversation turned back to work and she came out with it. She wanted a raise. I kindly explained to her that I was pleased with how she did her job but that it wasn't a highly skilled position and she never really went out of her way to impress anyone. While I was talking she got up out of her chair and moved around my desk towards me. I was trying to stay calm but in my head I was thinking \"holy shit, is this really happening?\" Once I finished talking she immediately leaned forward over my chair and put her hands on my shoulders, intentionally letting me look down her shirt(she had some amazing, firm breasts) and asked \"surely, there is something I can do to impress you.\" Before I could even reply she stood up and began to take her shirt off. As she was undressing, trying to be as smooth as possible, I asked, \"So what kind of raise are we talking about?\" As she pulled off her shirt she replied, \"I'm gonna need about 3.50.\" That's when I noticed that her work uniform was hiding the body of a green sea creature from the paleolithic era. \n\n\nTL/DR: Offered sex for a raise. got more than I bargained for. \n\nedit: Hot damn!

{"body": "I formerly worked in a college town grocery store and supervised a department of the store. Being a college town most of the employees were younger and many of the girls were pretty good looking. It also seemed the prettier they were the lazier. Anyways, there was this smoking hot blonde who worked in the bakery that I had always had my eye on since I had hired her. She had a boyfriend so I never made a move, it would have been risky enough being her superior. She was pretty good at her job(mostly baking cookies and simple birthday cake decorations) but she never went above and beyond on anything. One day I was sitting in my office going over the week's payroll and she knocked on my door, peaked her head in and asked to talk. She came in and sat down and started making small talk, I instantly noticed something was a little strange only because we usually didn't carry on long conversations and it definitely had a flirtatious feel to it. Eventually the conversation turned back to work and she came out with it. She wanted a raise. I kindly explained to her that I was pleased with how she did her job but that it wasn't a highly skilled position and she never really went out of her way to impress anyone. While I was talking she got up out of her chair and moved around my desk towards me. I was trying to stay calm but in my head I was thinking \"holy shit, is this really happening?\" Once I finished talking she immediately leaned forward over my chair and put her hands on my shoulders, intentionally letting me look down her shirt(she had some amazing, firm breasts) and asked \"surely, there is something I can do to impress you.\" Before I could even reply she stood up and began to take her shirt off. As she was undressing, trying to be as smooth as possible, I asked, \"So what kind of raise are we talking about?\" As she pulled off her shirt she replied, \"I'm gonna need about 3.50.\" That's when I noticed that her work uniform was hiding the body of a green sea creature from the paleolithic era.\nTL/DR: Offered sex for a raise. got more than I bargained for.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362457268", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Now there was this one girl growing up that all the boys in school thought must've been the prettiest thing that ever walked this earth. Margaret was her name, beautiful curly brown hair and a twinkle in her eyes. The biggest thing to come to town every year was the county fair, and everyone at school paired up to go. All the boys would ask the girls for dates, and it was just about the most nerve-racking event of the year for fellas like me. But for some reason I got the notion in my head to ask Margaret out to the fair. It was a long shot for sure, and my buddies all thought I was crazy, but I had my mind set. I asked her after school one day, and to my astonishment, she told me yes. When the fair came around I drove her up to the fairgrounds. We did all the normal things, played a couple games, saw all the animals, and then we headed for the Ferris wheel. We sat there, just the two of us, as our little bucket rose higher and higher into the night sky. \"Ya know, I've always thought you were just the nicest boy\" she said to me. Boy I could've floated right on out of my seat. \"Oh Margaret, I'd really like to kiss you now\" I said, butterflies just flappin around my stomach. She blushed, smiled, and turned away. \"I'd like that, really\" she said \"it's just...\" She looked off into the distance. \"There's just something I kind of need from you\" she said. I took her hand, looked her in the eye, and said \"anything, Margaret.\" Sheet my gaze and, in the sweetest, most angelic voice, said \"Well, I'm gonna need bout tree fiddy.\" \n\nIt was about this time that I noticed Margaret was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

Multiple family members who may never get the chance to marry because \"homosexuality is a sin\".\n\n2. The longest relationship of my life was plagued by constant criticism from church members because \"A christian should not date an atheist\".\n\n3. In high school, being 1 of 2 open atheists, I was outright **shunned** by many of the other students. People were almost afraid of me.\n\n4.

My big discovery came before most of my friends, so I hadn't talked to anybody about it. Back then I had a huge crush on the girl that lived next door to me. Cliche, I know, but she was in my grade and drop dead gorgeous, how could I help myself. My room was on the second floor of my house with a perfect view of their backyard, and their pool. Which sets the stage for a most unfortunate July afternoon. My neighbor, Betsy, had been swimming for a while, but now she was laying out by the pool. Boy did she look good. I remember peeping over the ledge at my window, feeling mischievous and excited at the same time. And then I got a familiar feeling.. I thought, What could it hurt? Dad was downstairs taking a nap, and the rest of the house was empty. So I got down to business. Then, mid-business, I heard a \"Oh shit, I'm sorry!\" from behind me. I whirled around, pants down, johnson flapping around, to see to my greatest horror Betsy's dad staring straight at me. \"Jeez, I'm sorry, I had no idea you were up here. I was bringing over some old baseball cards, I mentioned it to your mom a couple days ago. Your dad told me to just drop them off in your room, I had no idea y......\" He caught sight of what I was looking at through my window. There she was, his bikini-clad daughter, tanning by the side of their pool. The color drained from my face, and my flag fell exceptionally below half mast. He looked at me and said \"Son, you've got a lot of explaining to do.\" I wanted to vomit. \"I'm going to go downstairs and get your dad, and then we're all going to have a little talk\" he said. \"Oh God no!\" I yelled, \"Please don't tell him! Is there any, any way we could keep this between the two of us?\" \"Maybe\" he said \"but I'm going to need something from you first.\" My stomach squirmed. \"What\" I asked. He looked down, then directly into my eyes, and said \"Well, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time that I noticed Betsy's dad was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the palezoic era.

{"body": "I was visiting some friends down in central Florida, around Sarasota county I think it was, and we were out in some backwoods country. We went fishing out at a lake near some property one of my buddies owned, and we were going to camp out there for the night. We had made a fire and had a few drinks when a couple of the guys went back down to the lake. A few minutes later they started calling for the rest of us to come down to screw around with a couple turtles they'd found or something like that, and I agreed to stay back and keep cooking the food we were grilling. While they were gone I jogged a couple hundred yards away to where the truck was parked to grap some of the camping equipment. I was rummaging through the back when I heard someone say \"Shut the fuck up and get on the ground.\" My heart stopped. I stood up straight, then knelt to the ground, and said \"what do you want?\" The guy standing to the side of me was wearing a beanie pulled low down to his eyes, a plain gray sweatshirt, camo overalls, and he was pointing a gun at my face. \"Don't you fucking move, man\" he said. I couldn't believe this was happening. I knew I couldn't expect any of my friends to come back to the truck anytime soon, and even if they did they wouldn't be able to do anything to a guy with a gun. \"Listen, sir, just tell me what you want. Niether of us wants you to kill me.\" The guy walked behind me, pausing for a step, and then continued to stand on my other side. \"Looks like you're in a tight fuckin spot\" he said. I thought for a second about trying to make a lunge at him, but I figured he would definitely have time to react before I could close the distance. I was stuck. \"You're right, I don't want to kill ya\" he said, bringing the gun down to his side, \"but I'm going to need something from you.\" I shuffled on my knees to face him. He looked out towards the lake in the distance, seeming to take in the starry night laid out before him. He tore his gaze away, looked me dead in the eye, and said \"Well, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time I realized that this guy was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

{"body": "&gt;Yes but by not believing anything you infact believe in something.\n\nNo you don't. Your analogy with choosing doesn't apply. Saying something is analogous doesn't make it analogous. Believe in the common usage appears to mean an acceptance or feeling that something is true in the absence of evidence. For example a person wouldn't say they 'believe' 1+1=2. That's as solid a fact as someone can get since it is an imperative that it be true. 1 being defined as half of two and 2 being defined as double 1, 1+1=2 is a description of that relationship. I am someone who knows that 1+1=2 and then approaches everything else with varying degrees of certainty from there. That my eyes are still blue since last I looked in the mirror being a very high degree of certainty, that David Cameron is Prime Minister of the UK being less certain but still high enough to be functionally 'fact' all the way down to things like 'Juventus will win tonight's game against Celtic in the Champions league' being an informed guess but certainly in the realm of chance and then 'there is a loch ness monster' being seemingly as unlikely as my eyes having changed colour in the last minute. \n\nI'm not sure it's fair for you to say I still 'believe' something if we are defining belief as thinking something is true without full evidence such as a blief in god. You can say it if you want but it is nonsensical and ultimately is just a word. I believe my description of how I approach truth should be enough to separate my own approach to truth from that of a theist. I say belief in that case because I say so with a high degree of certainty but with the admission that I'm not able to make that a statement of fact.\n\nEdit: Normally I wouldn't do this but I'm genuinely curious for a response. This has been downvoted. Please tell me what I've said that you disagree with. I seriously would welcome the perspective since I'm not able to see any way in which a person can logically argue that atheism is a 'belief' unless one wants to muddy the definition of 'belief' to the point that it becomes a useless word. (NB See the way people can muddy 'God' to mean more or less anything when backed into a corner.)\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362597624", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

We're all in his room, trying not to cry because we know that he didn't have much time left, which was agony for everyone involved.\n\nI was sitting there, with my siblings, my mother...and I felt so helpless. My father was so strong, and now he was reduced to this frail, thin shell of a man.

She hugged him and said her goodbyes, finishing with the most sincere \"I love you\" she's ever said.

My sister just cried the full time, and was inconsolable when she came out of the room.\n\nThen it was my turn. I'm trying so hard not to burst into tears because I know it was the last time my father and I would talk one on one. That was the worst part, going in and knowing that this is the last time you'll ever speak to this person. So I went in, burst into tears and shared a last beer with my father. I told him how much I'd miss him, and he said the same thing. We just talked and laughed, until I realized it was my time to go so that my brother could say his last words. As I'm walking out, my father says \"Make me a promise.\"\n\nOf course I obliged, I would never say no.

{"body": "\"This is my time to shine... I guess I can tell the story of how I was picked up by a 'cougar'.\n\nSo I was couch surfing following a fall-out with my parents (long story, not worth going into). Anyway, this went on for a while and I ended up staying at one friend's for about a month or so. My friend lived with his single mum (dad had gone out to get milk, never returned type thing). His mum was young-ish considering my friend's and my ages at the time (18), in pretty good shape, lovely smile, always very friendly with me, and I was obviously very grateful to have somewhere to stay at this point. My friend worked in a mobile windscreen repair service and I was between jobs. His mum worked part time so we were often in the house together. Was kind of awkward at first (obviously) but we got chatting. She would make comments about how mature I was and how she couldn't understand how I didn't have a girlfriend etc., I would sort of giggle and brush it aside, but the more it happened the more I thought maybe I had a chance here. A chance for something great...\n\nWhich leads me to a piece of advice: if you think something is on, ask for it. Same with meeting any girls. You can whinge about not getting dates, but are you actually asking? The girl that smiled at you on the train, at the bar, buying coffee, did you just ask them? They are people after all! I digress, of sorts. So, with this spirit of adventure, one time when we were alone, I though I would give it a shot. She was sat on the sofa one morning, I decided to join her. Normal small talk, sly comments, 'why don't you have a girlfriend'... My heart is pounding, but I say something cliche along the lines of 'only being interested in you'. She cottons on, leans into me and says 'what can a young boy offer someone like me'. Excitedly, I ask 'well what do you need?' She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was about that time that I noticed this smoking hot milf was about 500 feet tall and from the paleothic era\". I shouted \"I ain't giving you no free fiddy you god damn loch ness monster, get your own money\".\n\nMy friend came home, and he never knew what went down. I still feel bad to this day.\"\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362675214", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ignoring the calculation to figure out what percent of the ejected matter had dino-origins, you should be aware that the ejecta gets completely fucked for a variety of reasons. I can think of 3 main sources:\n\n1. Heat and speed of the projectile, as well as heating of the air underneath the projectile by compression during descent, transfers a lot of energy to the material that will be ejected. \n\n2. The impact event itself produces very high accelerations. Ejecta will experience a massive shockwave and high g-forces.\n\n3. After accelerating, the material ejected from the surface has to pass upward through the atmosphere, being heated during its ascent in the same manner as the projectile was during its descent. \n\nYou might be inclined to think, \"Well, maybe something on the ground can survive the really really high temperatures if it's only exposed to them for a split second, before it's whisked away like the kids that get abducted by Peter Pan?\" I'll put all of these scenarios aside for a second and I'm going to focus on that last point for a second. I'll take a guess that the largest meteor that can survive falling to the earth without burning up entirely is roughly the same size as the largest ejecta that can survive being chucked up. This makes sense; if something falls into the atmosphere really really fast and heats up, then something ejected really really fast is going to basically experience the same phenomena in reverse. The minimum size limit for a meteor to survive descent through the atmosphere (or equivalently, the maximum limit for almost complete burn-up), is about 25 m in length. \n\nSo how big were the dinosaurs that were around during the Chicxulub impact (65 million years ago that caused the Cretaceous extinction event)? Well, TRex and Tricerotops are two examples. TRex was 5 meters tall, and 15 meters head to tail, so it's too small. Tricerotops was smaller, about 9 meters long and 3 meters tall. Okay, so they were probably too small. \n\nWhat was the biggest dinosaur that may have lived on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, the site of the Chicxulub impact? The biggest I can find (by Googling headlines for \"Largest Ever Dinosaur Discovered in Mexico\")  is Alamosaurus, which was actually discovered in New Mexico (close enough) in 1922. They were common in the late Cretaceous (spot on again), and were 16 m head to tail and 6 m tall. I'm still going to bet that the mighty Alamosaurus would be incinerated before it made it out of the atmosphere. \n\nWhat about an aquatic dinosaur? The largest marine dinosaur in the cretaceous that I know of is of the family Pliosauroidea, but is again about the size of the Alamosaur (and looks a lot like the fabled Loch Ness Monster too, or the Pokemon Lapras, since it was based on this dinosaur). \n\nSo I think it's pretty safe so say that there are probably no dinostronauts in the solar system, but that's not to say that dinosaur matter hasn't been strewed through space- at least in fragments anyway. In fact, this is one semi-plausible explanation for the origin of life on earth. If life couldn't have begun via abiogenesis on earth, perhaps it could have been seeded by biological ejecta from other planets, whose life was crushed in an impact event much like Chicxulub. It's not impossible, and this theory has a great name, which is why I want to mention it. It's called Panspermia, and its evidence includes fragments of a meteor that may have been ejected from Mars and may contain primitive Martian microbes, and science fiction novels. \n\nBottom line- I wouldn't be surprised if there's plenty of dinosaur bits in orbit, but they were probably cooked to a crisp before they made it there.

She lived completely on the other side of town, and she knew I had no way back home: sex invite confirmed. We ride with one of her friends back to her place and they drop us off. I am piss drunk at this point; I could barely make it up the front steps to her door.

To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\n\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\n\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\n\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.\n\ntl;dr: Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362757168", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Posted this story the last time this was asked, maybe it'll get traction this time:\n\nWhen I was in 6th grade, I dreamt that my mother and I were leaving OM practice (odyssey of the mind, for the uninitiated) after school. Instead of taking our normal route home, she took me over the mountain near the elementary school, a path that would take us into the town nearby.\n\nThat route, an unconventional path that we didn't often take anyway, was on that day totally altered. We pulled around a bend and the road took us by a large body of water that I recognized, somehow.\nMom said look, it's [Loch Ness](http://www.ego4u.com/images/countries/uk/loch-ness01.jpg) , and being 11 and more than a little monster-obsessed, I didn't stop to wonder why a Scottish loch was suddenly in Southwest VA, I just begged to stop, and we did.\n\nWhen we got to the water, I began to notice large ripples, and a head broke through the water! It was large and vaguely equine, with ossicones like a giraffe, and I was thrilled because we had discovered incontrovertible proof of the existence of Nessie!\n\nAt that moment, there was a loud rumbling in the distance, louder than anything I'd ever heard. I looked away from the monster towards Mom, and she was staring at the horizon. When I turned, I realized that the explosion I was hearing was an atomic detonation. The mushroom cloud was rising, and I feared that we had little to no time to react. The monster dove back under water, and I leaped toward the car. I knew the answer was in their, somewhere.\n\nI think I said something about escape, and Mom said \"we'll never make it in time.\" She leaned into the car and got something from the glove compartment. She turned back to me and handed me a handgun, which I knew we didn't have, but in that moment, I knew what I had to do.\nI turned the gun to my temple, and woke up sweating. I didn't sleep anymore that night or the next, and for months after I couldn't hear certain songs on the radio or watch certain TV programs without feeling a deep sinking in my stomach coupled with a sense of impending danger and fear of the mortality I suddenly understood very well. Those feelings persisted until about 8th grade, and even now, many years later, I can remember every moment of the dream vividly and still have that sinking feeling when confronted by certain era-specific triggers.\n\nTL;DR -- Nessie hits like an atom bomb and \"The Sign\" by Ace of Base makes me consider my own mortality.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362769315", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "About 3 years ago I was workin' a real late night grave yard type shift. Ya know, the one where I shuttle back and forth from the airport during redeye flights. \n\nAnyway, it must have been about 3am on a humid Wednesday summer night. I picked up what appeared to be a woman in about her mid 40's, looked like she'd either been on an island vacation or just overly faked tanned, either way she looked entirely too exhausted. I help throw her bags in the trunk and open the door for her, ya' know the usual, but the unusual thing here was she hardly even gave me a glance or anything close to a hello. But whatever, it's late and these people just want to get home I suppose. \n\nSo I start driving and finally she speaks up: tells me about how she had such a rough day. Apparently she was some sort of high-up executive for some corporation. Anyway, she's blabbering on about how she never gets the respect she deserves solely because she's a woman, and how she's way over qualified for her position in the first place. \n\nSo here's where things start to get interesting. As she's blabbering on about who knows what, she starts going into how men could never do the job that she does and how most men couldn't even please a women in bed if their life depended on it (yeah, now this is where I started to listen more intently too). She goes onto say how she cant commit to a long term relationship because she's always traveling and the only time she gets any is when she hires a male escort and even then those men can never truly please her the way she needs. \n\nAt that point she starts heavily coming onto me, I don't want to sound conceited but I was about 28 at the time, in shape, and a good looking man (i'd like to think). She asks me to pull over on the side of the road and climb into the back with her. Listen guys, I'm single at the time and there's no way I'm turning this down. So I pull over on the desolate highway (remember this is a limo with tinted windows), and I climb into the back. It was a little awkward at first but she made the first move and we started making out. Just a little tongue at first, but then a lot more. \n\nSuddenly she stops me and says, \"do you have what we need to keep going?\" (In my head I'm thinking a condom, but still not entirely sure what she's talking about). Instead of spitting out what I'm thinking, I just go ahead and say \"uhh what?\". She turns to me and says \"I.. I.. I'm gonna need about 3.50\"\n\nIt was at that point I realized this woman was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "I only worked at one for like 3 months.  After that, I had to quit because of the terrible hours and lousy pay.  But there were a few that really seemed crazy.\n\nI was working the 10pm-6am shift in a part of town that I can't say was the *worst* area, but it for sure wasn't the *best* area.  So I got all the crazies.  This wasn't exactly a 4 Seasons here, either.  It was like an off-brand Motel 6 (not a chain, just owned by 3 guys for tax reasons or whatever.  I never cared enough to find out).  We got weirdos all the time.  And guys with hookers.  We didn't rent by the hour but it was only like $45 for the whole night so it still happened a couple times a week.\n\nAnyway, one night this guy comes in and leaves muddy footprints all the way up to the desk.  I know, because I was expected to clean up if the floor started looking *too* bad, so I had gotten into the habit of checking how much work each new customer was going to mean for me.  It had been raining a little bit before, but not a ton, so I was surprised how muddy his shoes were.  And pissed.  But customer service is what it is, so I asked if he was looking for a room. \n\nHe comes up to the counter and leans on it to start discussing what room to get and blah, blah, blah.  He asks if he can pay cash.  Our policy was to allow that, but there was a $20 deposit under their name.  He gets a little pissy about that, but in the end agrees (especially when I pointed out we had a sign posted explaining the rule).  He starts to walk back to the door, then turns and asks if his room is visible from the street.  I tell him, pointing to where it is, that while his room is not *in*visible from the street, it's at an awkward angle that makes it hard to see well.  He stood there and thought for a second, and then walked out to his car to pull it closer to his room.  I stand up to grab the stuff to clean, and get angrier when I see that he also left muck smeared from his jacket on the counter when he leaned on it.  So I start to wipe it up, and I noticed that it's not just mud.  The cloth is getting red smeared all over it.  I turned on another lamp to get a better view, and there's blood congealed in the gunk and dirt. I went and got a better look at the footprints, too.  Not much, but it looked like there was some blood in some of the footprints too (or I guessed at the time it could have been something else, but only if the guy was playing with red paint all night).\n\nSo now I'm curious *and* scared.  But I'm a pretty big guy, and I figured the guest wouldn't be able to do much to me if there were any problems.  So I go out to in front of his room with a flashlight (there was a lamp over the parking lot but they were those stupid orange-y floodlights that make everything look weird).  I went up to his car.  The whole back end was covered in mud, and right above the back bumper there is scuff parks and blood everywhere.  Like loads of it, mixed in with the dirt and the mud.  Then I did something stupid: I knocked on his door.  I don't know what my plan was, I wasn't thinking straight.  There was no answer, but I could hear what sounded like a scuffle.  I got out my key to the room (I had a master key to all the rooms) and opened it up.\n\nThe guest was eating a dude.  Straight up biting into him. blood was everywhere, his insides were spilling out.  I was petrified.  I wanted to run, but I couldn't make myself move.  What kind of sick twisted freak was this...\n\nI've always used humor in awkward situations, and I said the first thing that came to mind: \"You're not gonna get your deposit back after this...\"\nHe walked up to me, with blood and entrails all over his mouth and hands and said\n\n\"I'm gonna need at least part of it back. At least tree fiddy.\"\n\nThat was when I noticed that the guest was a 90 foot tall monster from the paleolitic era.  I turned and ran as fast as I could, screaming \"damn you loch ness monster!\"\n\nAnd I quit the next day. Ugh, that job was a nightmare.\n\nTL:DR people at motels are gross.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362790245", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I am not aware of any other source than the Bible for the story of Jesus other than a probably forged reference from a historian that was not even alive at the time he was supposed to have lived. The earliest Gospel was Mark and it came 70 years after Jesus was supposed to have lived. Even then no one knows what the actual text of that Gospel was. \n\nBut if there was or wasn't a Jesus as a man doesn't really matter much to me. The claims of his divinity would require quite a bit more actual evidence. \n\nAs far as what Jesus was supposed to have taught it doesn't seem to be much more that The Golden Rule which predates Christianity. I don't like the idea of vicarious redemption particularly but there we might be straying into the supernatural which has no evidence to support it's existence. Thomas Jefferson rewrote the Bible without all the \"magic\" because he thought the message important enough. Perhaps that would be an improvement.\n\nAs for belief in a deity I make no claims to certainty. There has never been any credible evidence that a god is real and not imaginary. Until that evidence is provided there is no reason to believe that a god exists, so I won't.\n\nGod is a concept, an idea. Ideas deserve no respect. They should constantly be questioned and assailed.

He was a pretty cool kid, but occasionally got into some trouble for some small things like shoplifting, trespassing, etc.\n\nOne particularly hot day in summer, he called me over for 'something big'. I, knowing him, walked pretty slowly, thinking it was just going to be a little prank that does more damage than he realizes. But I still went.\n\nWhen I arrived, he quickly swung the door open and shoved me in, then slammed the door. His eyes looked like a child's on christmas morning, and he couldn't stop pacing.\n\nHe explained to me that he and one of his friends (Noah) were planning to go to this abandoned factory type thing that had a bunch of grain slides and things.\n\nHe grabbed a few pairs of his father's work gloves (he was a landscaper) and we set off. To this day I have no idea why I went with him, nor do I know why he was so excited.\n\nIn a jiffy, we arrived and Noah was already there, so we hopped the industrial-looking fence and joined him. The sun was going down, so we started climbing the rusty machinery, but I was kinda chubby, so I stayed low.\n\nWithin fifteen minutes, they both made it to the top, and were attempting to coax me into it.\n\n\"Fuck no.\"\n\n\"Whatever, pussy.\"\n\nThey descended slowly, and I waited. Then Noah made a slip. Thankfully, he slipped *away* from the tower thing and landed in the soft(er) gravel. I rushed towards him as \"oshitoshitoshit\" coursed through my veins.\n\nHe was unconscious, clearly, and his arm was definitely broken. James flies down, and looks down to Noah along next to me.\n\n\"... shit.\"\n\nWe look at each other, and I pull out my cell phone (this isn't even close to the ballsiest thing). James, even though he may not do smart things, he was somewhat intelligent, so he let me call the police to request an ambulance. We knew that the police would call our parents, so we decided to cross that bridge when we came to it.\n\nA police car and a loud as fuck ambulance drove up, and they cut through the fence's lock on the gate. They ran up to us, as we hung our heads in shame. Noah had awoken and was screaming profanities, but he was taken away. The ambulance sped off, leaving two officers to question us.\n\nThe officers were nice, but James (since I convinced them I did practically nothing) was in *deep* shit, but I won't go into details. So, when one of the officers went back to the car to scribble some things down, I looked to James. He was miserable.\n\nIn an instant, I thought of the thing that *always* works when you need to get out of a pickle. So I kicked the officer in front of us in the nuts. Not my best moment.\n\n\"RUN!\"\n\nSince we were in Oregon, there was plenty of foliage to take cover in, so I dived for the nearest bush and ran through the trees from there.\n\nJames, unfortunately, got tazed. It did *not* sound pretty.\n\nJames and I go back to elementary school, so I was instantly mortified that I had done that to him.\n\nA day and a convincing lie to my parents later for where I was, I got a call from James, who was going to spen the next few days in jail and possibly more in prison, because he told them it was him who kicked the officer. My heart sank.\n\n\"But, there is a bail, and my parents won't pay it...\"\n\n\"How much do you need?\" I asked, glancing over to my empty wallet on my desk.\n\n\"Imma need about tree fiddy\"\n\nI then realized my friend James was an eight-story tall Loch Ness monster.\n\n\"GODDAMMIT LOCH NESS MONSTER I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\"\n\n**TL;DR - Clown getting arrested tries to assault officer, so I kick him in the nuts.**\n\nNo regrets, not deleting.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362860785", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 1}

I'm sorry such a simple concept flies over your head.\n\nA friend steps in and confronts you when you're about to do something incredibly self-destructive.

Bush did much the same thing, and they both did them in times that weren't remotely a crisis.  FDR and Obama ran up huge debts, but at least they can argue that they did so when the country was in periods of incredible financial crisis.  Saying Reaganomics worked is like saying running up huge debt on your credit cards \"works\": fun times while it lasts to be sure, but you're screwing over your future.  Clinton took the remains of Reagan's huge deficits, paid them down over time, and left the country with projected surpluses and good economic times.\n\nYou're probably too young to remember and just repeating what you heard on Limbaugh, but as someone who actually lived through the Reagan era, he was a terrible, terrible President who was incredibly irresponsible.  \n\n9/11 was avoidable.

The Bushies talking all those years about Pakistan being such a good ally was horseshit back in '02: by '09, those were some dry horse pies.  9/11 was conveniently and cynically co-opted by the Bushies to justify their much-desired Invasion of Iraq, their economic ineptitude and just about every other one of their multitude of failures.  They even had a color-coded Fear Chart so they could cynically manipulate Americans day by day over 9/11.  The biggest disaster of the Bush years was the Iraq War, 2nd was the complete lack of regulation on Wall ST, 3rd were the predictably catastrophic tax cuts, 4th was global warming denial, so what does it say about conservative governance that 9/11 was only the 5th biggest avoidable disaster of the Bush Administration?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362889026", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll put one out. Diana Gabaldon is a glaringly painful example of this. It's a science fiction book (FFS the main character is a *time traveller*!), but most people who talk about it rave about what a wonderful piece of historical fiction it is and how accurate it is. Due to my interests, I get this a lot. Eventually, I picked up the book just to see what people where talking about and by 20 pages in, I wanted to stop. The time travelling hadn't even happened yet and the history was already off. \n\nIn the end, I did manage to finish it by telling myself it was a parallel universe and therefore could do what it wanted. The writing itself was decent, though the \"sex scenes\" were atrocious. Some of the more egregious errors or \"massaging the facts\" that stand out, however:\n\n-- The title of the book, Outlander, is supposedly a translation of Gaelic *Sassanach.* Sassanach just means English, a person who inhabits Sassain, England. (Sassain itself draws its roots from the Saxons, incidentally.) It's not an insult in and of itself, though a Scottish nationalist might certainly use it that way.\n\n-- Jamie Fraser, the Gaelic-speaking highlander, speaks Doric. Not even with a Doric accent, he's speaking a totally different *dialect* that sounds nothing like Gaelic-influenced English (like a stronger version of Sean Connory, who was raised around it, though not speaking it, as far as I can tell).\n\n-- Periodically, she attempts to use Gaelic in the dialogue, but it's pretty clear she translated it using a dictionary or some second-language learners on a forum somewhere rather than a native speaker. I don't have any exact quotations to hand, as I gave the book away as soon as I finished it, but at one point, Jamie gets up to acknowledge a speech at his wedding and literally states: \"An acknowledgment.\"\n\n-- The whole clan loyalties, tartan-wearing, Scottish romanticism claptrap.\n\n-- The flipping Loch Ness Monster is real. It pops up out of Loch Ness and offers a mystical experience to the narrator. I pretty much lost it there entirely. (Though interestingly, the Loch Ness Monster appears over 3.5 pages, setting up a bad South Park joke, if you want it.)\n\nI could go on. Really, though, the problem here is that people take fiction for fact and believe this is *how it really was.* As a work of science fiction, I may not have enjoyed Ms. Gabaldon's work, but it was creative and pretty much deserves its renown. As supposed historical fiction, though, it's probably one of the more egregious examples I've come across.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362934848", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So you're asking why those who believe in gods argue about something that they can't prove, right?  I just want to make sure I understand your question.  I think it's because they feel threatened by those who don't believe, and they try to justify themselves.  In the end, they can't prove that their gods exist, but often, they're not so good with the logics -- they start creating a false equivalence, saying that since you can't prove that gods *don't* exist, that it's somehow the same thing.\n\nLook.  Gods are enormously magical beings with enormously huge power, and if we can't provide any actual evidence of these gods existing, none at all, then saying that they exist doesn't pass the laugh test.  Yes, and invisible pink unicorns exist too!  And ghosts and zombies and the Loch Ness monster!  Because nobody's been able to prove that they don't.  And the Riemann Hypothesis is both true and false.  In other words, if you want to convince someone that gods exist, be prepared to show up with some evidence, because nobody has any reason to believe such an obviously fictional story.\n\nNow, you're also making some interesting claims: \"if God does exist, technically we wouldn't be able to prove his existence through science\".  Really?  Why is that?  If gods did exist, we should be able to verify their existence easily.  They could come by publicly and say hello.  (YHWH did this in the Bible, and this is used as evidence in the Bible, but the Bible is not reliable!)  We could watch something and see if it behaves in an unnatural way; that would be evidence of something interfering with the forces of the universe.  We should be able to call them with prayer and see if anything happens.  If gods *do* anything, we should be able to detect it.  So far, nobody's come up with any evidence.  And if you take the time to actually *define* what a god is, you can generally check if it exists or not with good confidence.\n\nBUT NOT PERFECT CONFIDENCE, you say.  Oh, come on.  That's bullshit.  If you take that path, you also stop believing in an enormous range of phenomena that we know exist but have only been able to verify to some very large (but finite) accuracy.  When you cover your eyes, how do you know that the world doesn't disappear?  I mean, you know, but not to PERFECT confidence, right?\n\n\"Gods don't exist.\"  \"But you can't *prove* that they aren't just hiding!\"  That's your argument, in a nutshell.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362938804", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I went to visit a friend in Colorado before he was going to go into surgery for a tumor.  Before I left (from Sacramento), I borrowed a stun gun from my girlfriend, to show my buddies that it wasn't as powerful and painful as they all thought it was.  After successfully showing them how strong it actually was and how painful it actually was, I put the stun gun in my backpack so when we got drunk we wouldn't find it and stun each other.  *Fast forward 3 days later,* I am in a rush to get to the airport and like a total **numpty** forget to take the stun gun out of my backpack.  SOMEHOW, I get the stun gun through security, on the plane, and to Colorado, all unbeknownst to me.  *Fast forward 2 days,* me and my buddy, who's about to have a potentially life changing surgery, are out and about Boulder when he gets the awesome idea to call an escort, just in case he doesn't make it.  Yes, that is he justified it.  Me, being the Friar of Fidelity, had some reservations about being part of the whole thing and also about security issues.  Who comes with her? What if we get robbed?  How does it all work? We decide to go with the tried and true resolution of **\"Fuck it.\"** (unintended good pun).  So we call \"Marrissa\" a gorgeous darker skinned girl to come meet us at the Holiday Inn we just booked.  She says she'll be there in about 45 min.  Hesitantly, we wait around second guessing our actions and arguing whether or not we should just bail.  About 30 min later, we decide to ditch the idea and just cruise over to the bar and get schwasty.  *LITERALLY*,  as we get up to leave \"KNOCK KNOCK!\". Oh shit, looks like we are going to do this.  I nervously look through the peep hole and see \"Marissa\" the girl pictured in the online ads.  Breathing a sign of relief, I open the door. (mistake #1)  As soon as I open the door, two large men (one white thuglife looking clown and one Mexican thugdog who looks like the person who would **ACTUALLY** kill you) rush the door and push me on the bed.  My buddy freaks, runs into the bathroom and locks the door. (Like it's going to help).

The thugs didn't get away with anything, got charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, and assault. My buddy didn't want his family to find out about the escort part of it so when one of the cops who shot the guys came to visit me in the hospital, I asked him if there was anything that could be done so that part of the story didn't make it into the news or even the police report.

{"body": "I applaud you for your courteous criticisms and recognition of the bias's involved.\n\nVegetarianism:  I understand a moral arguments are hard to address and may subject you to bias.  I am not attacking your beliefs, but I am simply curious how you deal with the logical implications below? \n\nI am an animal lover myself, after a recent fishing trip I filleted a fish improperly and was very distraught at having wasted some of the filet. I was primitive camping so I was eating this fish for sustenence.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, agriculture has led to more suffering for animals all over the world. Agriculture allowed for a 10 fold increase in human population density which equaled more habitat destruction more hunting pressure, more pollution.  Modern hydrocarbon fuels led to a 1000 fold increase, but tha'ts another story.  How does this factor into your beliefs? (just curious honestly, no offence)\n\n\"This is probably true, but what do you mean by \"recent?\"\"\n\nBy recent, I mean food adaptations related to the rise of agriculture circa 13,500 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene.  This includeds lactose tolerance, adaptation to glutens/grains and other phytochemicals like phytic acid.  I would argue many adaptations have been external (food processing), for example, adding lime to a corn tortilla neutralizes phytic acid in the grain, keeping it from binding to minerals like iron, zinc and magnesium ect and making you deficient like these chemicals were evolved to do.\n\n*\"Is it not possible that humans have evolved enough since the paleolithic era to be able to beneficially process a diet (like mine) which consists mostly of whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and soy?\"*\n\nOf course we have adapted to these foods somewhat, and in ways they have adapted to us, by humans artificial selecting the least bitter and most tasty vegetables. This is where I would argue these adaptations are not perfect.  For instance, the Japanese have a adaptation, via a gut bactiria which allows them to digest seaweed. (a quick googles shows it is called \"Zobelia galactanivorans.\"  However, the problem many paleo diet circles have with the following:\n\nBeans:  they contain many gut disrupting compounds as defenses against herbivores.  When you get gas from eating beans, its due to these, they can be very disruptive to the gut, which is where much of our immune system is located.  Gut integrity is key to good health, and modern beans are actually less processed today than native peoples did to them, along with many other grains.\n\n(oligose and large amounts of purines.)\n\nSoy: google \"phytoestrogen\"  you can see some of the potential problems that may arise from soy.   In addition soybean oil (last 100 years since industrial presses) is an omega 6, which is too prevalent in modern diets.  To much omega 6 increases arachidonic acid and can lead to inflammation.\n\nVegetables:  depends what you mean, with a ketogenic-paleo center diet I eat a pound of vegetables each day covered in multiple tablespoons of grassfed butter, more than any vegan/vegetarian i know.(ancedotal evidence, i know :P)  Human evolution shows the fire resulted in the ability to process and eat many tubers that weren't avaliable without fire, due to toxicity, Raw Casava can contain arsenic if it isn't processed with heat, I think.\n\nWhole grains:  I would not say these are a problem but years of doing elimination diets has showed me these and probably gluten gives me issues.  Gluten intolerance is a serious problem, also, the fact that many breads and grain foods have a ton of added preservatives and sugar.  The sugar increases the food reward, making it tasty but addictive in nature.  the preservatives meant to interfere with bacterial growth outside your body, also can cause problems with good bacteria INSIDE your body.\n\nI understand this doesn't in detail full refute the authors assertions by any means.  However, this a reddit post, I don't have time to be any more thorough than I have been.        \n\n***It is up to you, the redditor to decide if this information makes sense, based upon all the other information you have learned, more information is available at your fingertips than many will ever experience, use it!***\n\nPS: ***try to avoid confirmation bias by not searching \"paleo diet cons fraud ect\" or searching \"paleo diet benefits\"  You have to sort through both the positive information and the negative, and decide with a basic understanding of the science whether the overall information conflicts or flows with what you already know, critical thinking is valuable, good luck***\n\nedit: lots of typos but sleep is more important, sorry", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362979004", "subreddit": "science", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

You talk for hours as if its  you're first date again. You've never been so sure of anything in your life. You're both a little drunk from the wine and the meal is winding down.

{"body": "Here's a scenario I remember going through during my residency:\n\n**TL;DR at bottom of post**\n\nOne of my patients was the most adorable little girl you could ever meet.  She was 7 years old and had such a kind and round face, she was one of those kids that you just couldn't ignore.  Her name was Jessica.  Her family was just as amazing to be around as she was.  Her mom was a third grade teacher, her dad was a CPA at a regional accounting firm, and she was surrounded by loving grandparents, aunts, uncles, and her older brother and sister.  The love and cheer that radiated from this family was contagious, and made you want to cry and celebrate all at the same time!  I'll even admit, I was quite attracted to her older sister, but unfortunately I had to try my best to keep my distance, because Jessica had a severe case of Leukemia.\n\nHer particular cancer was quite a bit worse than most, so I was there more for basic prep and comfort care, while the higher-ups handled the bigger issues.  No resident would be in charge with handling a case like that, I just had to soak up the experience and be the \"friend\" to the family (I was the youngest and outgoing, and related well with them).  Dealing with that family was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life.  While Jessica was going through her various treatment attempts, she continued to get worse and worse.  Reddit, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't help getting attached to this family.\n\nJessica's condition eventually became too severe for us to realistically expect her to survive.  Her face had sunken in and lost it's cheer, her family became more quiet and reserved as opposed to their original cheerful and loving selves.  Don't get me wrong, they were all still very loving, just quiet, you know?  I finally had to pull them to another room and talk to them about end-of-life care.  Obviously we were still fighting it the best we could, but this was when we had to officially inform them  that their child, Jessica, will probably pass away.  I'll admit, I even cried with them.  It wasn't sobbing or anything, but the tears were flowing full force.  Her family was very understanding, as I believe they had been expecting this for a while.  They asked me the usual questions of what was truly wrong with her body, if her death would be painful for her or painful to watch, and what the hospital would do afterwards.  I answered their questions like a zombie, I was there, but I just wasn't *there\".  It just felt wrong.\n\nThankfully Jessica's death was pretty easy to predict and follow, where she and her family were able to say proper goodbyes and Jessica was able to know and accept what was happening to her.  After she passed, life moved on.  I added her obituary to a special folder I have at home, just to make sure I never forget her, and I moved on with my residency and her family moved on with their lives.\n\nSeveral weeks later, I get a call saying I had an \"Alexandra\" here that needed to see me.  Alex; Jessica's older sister.  Alex had apparently been struggling with her little sister's death (for obvious reasons), and came to try and get some more closure from me.  Well, that didn't work.  We got as far as a hello and an empty room and then she was crying in my arms.  I held her for as long as she wanted, where she finally looked up at me with tear streaked eyes.  Let me tell you Reddit, this girl was beautiful.  Like, 5'10, blonde, was a college volleyball player beautiful.  \n\nShe whispered to me and said, \"There's one thing I still really need from you...\"\n\nI replied with \"Sure, anything.  You just let me know and I'm here.\"  Now I'm starting to get a weird feeling about this, but she looked up at me again and slowly whispered in my ear, \"I...I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNow it was about this time that I noticed Alex was 7 stories tall and a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era!  That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!  \"God dammit monsta!  I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"  I yelled as she swam off into the distance.\n\nLife moved on afterwards, and I haven't seen Alex or Jessica's other family members since.  They send me a Christmas card every year, and I'm sure to update them on how things are going, but I honestly have no idea where Alex is these days or who she is with.  Part of me wants to know, but then the other part wants to take this to the grave and never tell a soul.\n\n**TL;DR:**  Was a resident doctor working with an adorable 7 year old cancer patient, got approached for sexual favors by the patient's older sister after having the end-of-life conversation with her family.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363050572", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "\"Yesterday was my 19th birthday, so me and my buddies decided to celebrate by going to the bars at my college campus (minimum age is 19). I usually don't drink too much, but, since it was a special occasion, I decided to get really fucking wasted. We pregramed a lot before the bar, since it's difficult to obtain alcohol in a bar when none of us are 21, plus it's really expensive so I wasn't trying too hard to get my friends with fake IDs to buy me some. I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my fucking mind.\n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this really sexy chick dancing by herself. Being drunk as shit, I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance sexy? Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up grinding hard/making out a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes.\n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated. We were making out a lot on my bed, and we took off each others shirts and things were really escalating. I had her panties off, and I was starting to think me losing my virginity was a sure thing. I could tell she was really into it. She said \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". I figured she meant me going down on her, and me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\". Then the question came: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"I aint givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!

NSFL.\n\n[Erotic fan fiction featuring Kobe Bryant....](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/139ghf/unofficial_rnba_bet_thread/c721chf) I am not a smart man......\n\nIt was another long night for Kobe Bryant, the Lakers had just dropped another game due to Dwight's terrible play. Feeling frustrated Kobe went to the gym to shoot his normal 500 post game jumpers. upon coming out of the locker room he noticed something strange, the rack that contained the practice balls was already out in the middle of the court, and the lights were already on.\n\n\"Who else is gonna be here this late at night?\" he wondered to himself.\nHe looked up and saw something strange. Usually after games Dwight would go and get with some posse and hang out at a club, but this time he was sitting at the free throw line, chucking up brick after brick.\n\n\"This is pathetic,\" Kobe thought to himself \"I've seen kids shoot free throws better than that.\" Then, much to Kobe's surprise, Dwight started crying. Kobe felt bad. He went over to where Dwight was sobbing on the ground and put an arm around his shoulder. \"It's OK Dwight.\" He said encouragingly. \"You'll get better.\" \"K-K-obe!\" Dwight croaked out. \"W-w-what are you d-doing here?\"\nKobe sighed. \"I guess I'm here to help you Dwight, I'm sure there's something I could do to help you shoot better\" \"W-w-well there is one thing you could do.\" \"I could really use a special massage\"\n\n\"Well, I guess, since we're teamates.....\" Kobe said somewhat reluctantly. \"It's ok.\" Dwight said \"Instead you can just give me about treefiddy.\" Next thing you know Dwight turns into a 500 foot tall monster from the paleolithic era with a preference for chucking up a lot of bad shots. \"God damn you Loch Ness Monta I ain't giving you no treefiddy\" Enraged Kobe leaves the gym, calling out as he exits. \n\n\"I'll see you around Dwight.\"\n\nI hope you're happy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363219126", "subreddit": "nba", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Most people don't get to be a \"Privileges Customer.\" (What's the minimum for that, anyway? Just curious)\n\ntree fiddy.  Actually $50k total across all accounts.\n\n&gt;OK then, but even historically the big banks have offered worse interest rates than credit unions and such. BoA currently offers a whopping 0.01%APY on savings, which any credit union can beat with even 0.10% or 0.20%APY. Online banks and credit unions are even higher.\n\nFYI it shows .08% for me in CA. At any rate, this is just chasing pennies.  This isn't applicable for \"the average customer\" but, BoA has higher interest rate for \"Platinum accounts\" (i.e. &gt;50k) at .20%: [linky](https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/bank-account-interest-rates.go).  For amount &lt; 50K, there's no appreciable difference between .01% and .20%.  The reason I brought up this \"privileged customer\" thing is because OP has exactly enough to qualify for that. \n\n&gt;wat\n\nThe UI is good looking but half the time I end up in a loop of pages and I keep coming back the same page after following a bunch of links.  I check vanguard account via  Mint anyway so I don't care too much about it.\n\n&gt;Wait times are part of customer service. If I had to choose though, I'd say that Charles Schwab has hands-down the best customer service of any financial institution I am a customer of (which is several). They answer the phones fast, are based in the United States, and treat you like a person regardless of your balance.\n\nFair enough.  Besides wait times, BofA's CS is also based in US (going by CS's accents alone).  I can't really comment more than that because I haven't needed them.  But they treated me equally the same when I had a student account vs now.\n\n&gt;An ATM refund is where you get cash out of any ATM, pay the $x fee, and then your bank pays you back $x (usually at the end of the month). So I can go to the no-name ATM at a concert, get out $20 + $3 fee, and later the bank pays me back the $3.\n\nFair enough. I'll concede this point.  However there are enough BoA ATMs for me not to notice this issue.  As a bonus BoA ATMs have check reading capability, so it reduces the need for social interaction with other people.  IIRC, not all online banks have those \"snap a picture of check\" method of deposit.\n\n&gt;I still don't understand how a big bank is \"convenient\" vs an online bank, unless you need something notarized or so (in which case my credit union 3 blocks away offers that for free). I'd rather do as much stuff online as possible, and when I need cash I can go to literally any ATM for free since I get ATM refunds (so number of locations is no longer important).\n\nHere are the list of benefits I get due to me using BoA:\n\n* Free wire transfers (never used it but  sounds pretty kick ass)\n* Free cashiers checks\n* 30 free transactions a month if I choose to use their broker (Merrill Lynch)\n* A no annual-fee credit card that has effectively 4.5% cash back on gas, 3% on grocery and 1.5% on other crap.\n\nThere are probably a few more things I'm forgetting because I never use them.\n\nThese aren't purely \"banking\" services, but if you buy into the \"vertical integration\" thing going on, it's a pretty nice package overall.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363220049", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It's the answer in the negative to a specific question. This is how burden of proof works. You do not go around believing in everything until you have reason not to. This would result in contradiction. Instead claims should provide evidence for why they are true. Or else you can happily go on not believing them. This is how it works for big foot, for fairies, for the Jumping Flarg of the Venusian Undermines, all claims. Do I need to bring something to the table when I say I'm not convinced that the Loch Ness monster exists? What are you expecting?\n\nEdit: Thinking more, it seems you want atheists to put forward some of their philosophies for discussion but this makes the mistake of thinking that atheists must have something in common with one another beyond their atheism. When they do, it is only by coincidence. If you want to talk about philosophy go to a philosophy sub. If you want to discuss atheism, stay here.

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade in High School I took a psychology class, one of our assignments was to do an amateur psychology experiment on some people or someone we knew.\n\nThere was this girl in the class, lets call her Amy, Amy was a really good friend of mine but she was also fine as hell. At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward. And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.\n\nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward. So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\n\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, Thehealeroftri, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\"\n\nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"\n\nEveryone in the hall heard. The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.\n\nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.\n\nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"\n\nWat.\n\nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying.\nA few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.\n\nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.\n\nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered. I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.\n\n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her. Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"\n\nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her. She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.\n\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"\n\nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\" I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\n\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.\n\nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear. This is great.\n\nIt slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time. After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life.\n\nWe're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\"\n\nI personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time. Then she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\" The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\"\n\nShe says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.\n\nI stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.\n\nAs for my psychology project, I never did get it done, and instead dropped the class because of the terrible memories it had given me. To this day I hate reading about Psychology in general.\n\ntl;dr: Psychology experiments have forever ruined because of one stupid mistake. Also, never trust a shy girl.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363292683", "subreddit": "jerktalkdiamond", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Studied together, and so forth.  After year two I thought we were meant for one another and we were sorta engaged.  But there was always this catch.  Early on she'd borrowed some change from me and I never got around to asking for it back.  It really nagged at me.\n\nAnyway, we got a trio of cats, rented a house in LA and things were chill.

{"body": "A long time ago I was driving through a little place called Lake Village down in Arkansas, right off the Mississippi River. I was stopped at a gas station and went in to pay when the cashier told me I had \"a nice set of toadin' fingers on me.\" The fuck are toadin' fingers? I asked the guy, and he looked at me with a puzzled expression and said \"You never been toadin' before?\" I laughed a little awkwardly and replied \"Can't say I have.\" The cashier smiled and gave a small chuckle. \"You must not be from around here. I tell ya what, I own this here joint and can close up shop whenever I want. If you ain't in no hurry to get nowhere, me and young Johnny will take you toadin'. It won't be but a five minute walk to where we're goin.\" At this point I felt like my encounter with this fellow was spectacularly odd enough to merit me sticking around for a while. The man walked out through a door in the back of the shop and returned with the most hillbilly-bumpkin-lookin redneck I've ever seen. He had to be about 16, and literally wore boots, overalls, and no shirt. Young Johnny, I could only presume. The two of them led me out through the back of the store and started walking down towards the river, which was not all that far away. As it turns out, \"toadin\" refers to the act of catching toads, fucking giant toads, with your bare hands. We had wandered down to the bank of a stream that fed the river, and the two guys hopped right into the water and then looked back at me with expectant smiles on their faces. \"I think I'll just watch, for now\" I told them. \"Suit yerself!\" young Johnny replied, plunging one hand into the water. He crouched there in the water, seeming to dig around in the mud, until he yanked his hand out in dramatic fashion, clutching a toad, a fucking giant toad, in his fingers. \"Hot damn!\" cried the cashier. It was all stupidly stereotypical. Here I was, in the middle of the southern delta, with poor white trash catching amphibians. I couldn't help but join in on the fun! We spent about fifteen minutes catching toads before heading back to the store. The cashier and little Johnny both brought back a couple toads each; they said frog legs were a pretty popular dish in the area (of course). We were all soaked from the stream, and the man insisted I change into some old clothes he had lying around and take them with me. \"The least I can do, friend\" he told me. I was starting to think these guys were alright after all, if not a little odd. \"Thanks a lot, man\" I told him. \"You've been great. Surely there's something I can do to pay you back.\" The man smiled, looked down at the ground, and said \"I guess there is one thing I could use.\" \"Name it\" I replied. \"Well,\" he said, taking a step towards me, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time I realized that this cashier was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "&gt;**Loch Ness Monster**\n\n&gt;An unidentified animal living in Loch Ness, the largest body of fresh water in Britain. It first came to the attention of the general public in the thirties when a London surgeon R.K.Wilson took a photo of what looked like the head-and-neck of a dinosaur-like creature. What with The Lost World and RKO's King Kong in the cinema, there was an explosion in public interest. The monster's image, however, was to be forever tainted by the pantomime which followed, in which a game big hunter called Wetherall came to Loch Ness and discovered footprints on the shore. The tracks turned out to have been made by a hippo foot, which was some kind of ashtray or other keepsake. What kind of a big game hunter couldn't work out that they were all hippo tracks made by the same foot I don't know, but he left Loch Ness. In 1994 the now-famous surgeon's photo turned out to be a fake, a model on a toy submarine made by Wetherall - revenge on the world that mocked him. Over the years there have been a number of photos and films of unidentified creatures in Loch Ness. Some have been proved as fakes (to be honest, I wasn't surprised when the surgeon's photo turned out to be a fake. I'd always thought there was something odd about it). But there is still strong film evidence and a lot of eye-witness evidence to support the existence of a long-necked animal of some kind. Modern scientists often dismiss eye-witness evidence as non-evidence. I'm glad they're not running the judicial system, otherwise they'd have every prisoner released. What doesn't help is a decidedly vulgar merchandising industry which has turned the monster into nothing more than a theme park attraction. The official Loch Ness exhibition centre now officially doesn't believe in Nessie anyway. Their cinema now shows visitors a film telling of all the reasons why Nessie is a hoax, accompanied by silly music. You leave the cinema at the end of the film and are then confronted by a shop selling plush Nessies, Nessie mugs, china Nessies, Nessies with tartan hats and endless other over-priced junk. Personally I'm sure there were unidentified animals in Loch Ness until recent years. I think, what with their proven sensitivity to noise, and what with Loch Ness now covered in countless noisy boats of every shape and form, that whatever was in the Loch has either died out or returned to the sea never to return. Either way, I think it's better for the welfare of these creatures that their existence is never proved.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363381867", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

It was in an old trailer his dad bought off an impound lot at a police auction.\n\nWe were pretty convinced (being kids at the time) that it had something valuable in it.  Maybe drug money or a spy's stash of fake passports.\n\nThis was all pre-Internet so we didn't have much to work with for information.  We tried using a stethoscope we bought from a medical supply company, and could hear clicks, but never made progress with this or other movie tricks.

We finally took it to the local University and talked a machine shop operator into helping us drill into it and split the front off.  Tony got to see what was inside first, and when I asked him \"What is in there?\" He said \"about tree fiddy\".

{"body": "We seem the same kind of thing with Leviathan.  A lot of the Canaanite religions had \"monsters\" that the gods would fight, and I have always interpreted the Biblical references to creatures like Leviathan, etc. as polemics against the conception of these monsters in Canaanite religions.  When the Bible refers to monsters like this, it emphasizes God's sovereignty over them.\n\nFor example, in the Ugaritic texts, Baal fights Sea and Leviathan (among other monsters).  In scripture, we see a polemic mentioning these monsters clarifying that it was not Baal, but Yahweh who defeated these monsters and further that Leviathan isn't some great mythical monster but something Yahweh \"draws out with a fishhook.\"  (Psalm 74.)\n\nSOURCE: [The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts](http://www.amazon.com/The-Origins-Biblical-Monotheism-Polytheistic/dp/0195167686/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363469520&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=origins+of+biblical+monotheism)\n\nDepending on whether or not you consider Sea and the multi-headed dragon(s) as cosmic monsters, the Bible mentions 3 other cosmic monsters that I know of: Behemoth for the land, Leviathan for the Sea, and Ziz for the air.\n\n**Behemoth**\n\nYou have posted verses for Behemoth (although it should be [Job 40](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+40&amp;version=NRSV), as mentioned above).\n\n**Ziz**\n\nHere's the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziz) on Ziz since Ziz is hard to see from the text.\n\n**Leviathan**\n\nPsalm 74:\n\n&gt;12 Yet God my King is from of old,\n    working salvation in the earth.\n\n&gt;13 You divided the **sea** by your might;\n    you broke the **heads of the dragons** in the waters.\n\n&gt;14 You crushed the **heads of Leviathan**;\n    you gave him as food[c] for the creatures of the wilderness.\n\n&gt;15 You cut openings for springs and torrents;\n    you dried up ever-flowing streams.\n\nalso [Job 41](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+41&amp;version=NRSV):\n\n&gt; 1 Can you draw out **Leviathan** with a fishhook,\n    or press down its tongue with a cord?\n\n&gt;2 Can you put a rope in its nose,\n    or pierce its jaw with a hook?\n\n&gt;3 Will it make many supplications to you?\n    Will it speak soft words to you?\n\n&gt;4 Will it make a covenant with you\n    to be taken as your servant forever?\n\n&gt;5 Will you play with it **as with a bird**,\n    or will you put it on leash for your girls?\n\n&gt;6 Will traders bargain over it?\n    Will they divide it up among the merchants?\n\n&gt;7 Can you fill its skin with harpoons,\n    or its head with fishing spears?\n\n&gt;8 Lay hands on it;\n    think of the battle; you will not do it again!\n\n&gt;9 Any hope of capturing it will be disappointed;\n    were not even the **gods** overwhelmed at the sight of it?\n\n&gt;10 No one is so fierce as to dare to stir it up.\n    Who can stand before it?\n\n&gt;11 Who can confront it and be safe?\n    —under the whole heaven, who?\n\n&gt;12 “I will not keep silence concerning its limbs,\n    or its mighty strength, or its splendid frame.\n\n&gt;13 Who can strip off its outer garment?\n    Who can penetrate its double coat of mail?\n\n&gt;14 Who can open the doors of its face?\n    There is terror all around its teeth.\n\n&gt;15 Its back is made of shields in rows,\n    shut up closely as with a seal.\n\n&gt;16 One is so near to another\n    that no air can come between them.\n\n&gt;17 They are joined one to another;\n    they clasp each other and cannot be separated.\n\n&gt;18 Its sneezes flash forth light,\n    and its eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.\n\n&gt;19 From its mouth go flaming torches;\n    sparks of fire leap out.\n\n&gt;20 Out of its nostrils comes smoke,\n    as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.\n\n&gt;21 Its breath kindles coals,\n    and a flame comes out of its mouth.\n\n&gt;22 In its neck abides strength,\n    and terror dances before it.\n\n&gt;23 The folds of its flesh cling together;\n    it is firmly cast and immovable.\n\n&gt;24 Its heart is as hard as stone,\n    as hard as the lower millstone.\n\n&gt;25 When it raises itself up the gods are afraid;\n    at the crashing they are beside themselves.\n\n&gt;26 Though the sword reaches it, it does not avail,\n    nor does the spear, the dart, or the javelin.\n\n&gt;27 It counts iron as straw,\n    and bronze as rotten wood.\n\n&gt;28 The arrow cannot make it flee;\n    slingstones, for it, are turned to chaff.\n\n&gt;29 Clubs are counted as chaff;\n    it laughs at the rattle of javelins.\n\n&gt;30 Its underparts are like sharp potsherds;\n    it spreads itself like a threshing sledge on the mire.\n\n&gt;31 It makes the deep boil like a pot;\n    it makes the sea like a pot of ointment.\n\n&gt;32 It leaves a shining wake behind it;\n    one would think the deep to be white-haired.\n\n&gt;33 On earth it has no equal,\n    a creature without fear.\n\n&gt;34 It surveys everything that is lofty;\n    it is king over all that are proud.”\n \n------------------------------------------------\n\n[edit]: I just got the tree fiddy joke, but I still think it's fun to discuss, because this is a weird area of the Bible. =\\", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363469615", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students.  I heard most of the drama but there is one student that I will always be reminded of when people ask this question.  \n\nThere was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip.  She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't.  Everyone could hear her, including me.  Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about.  She gossiped most days but one day was different.  \n\nI heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom.  I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not?  It could be fun.  \n\nAnyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with.  \n\nMr. Thehealeroftri..\n\nI was shocked when I heard this.  \n\nBut stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young.  She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess.  If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress.\n\nAfter class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work.  It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head.\n\nAs soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, \"Hey Kathy.  I heard you talking about me in class...\"  she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, \"Oh my god!  You heard me say that?  I'm so sorry! And-\" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, \"I want to have sex with you too.\"\n\nShe stopped her sentence and smiled.  Then she said, \"Do you know what my rates are?\"\n\nConfused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in.  It turns out she mentioned that she *would* have sex with me... if I paid that is.  \n\nI decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her. \"Alright,\" I told her.  \"What do you mean?\"  \n\n\"I'll do it, but I need some money of course.  That's just how it works.\" she said.  I replied, \"Okay, what do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That goddamned monster had tricked me again!  \"GODDAMNIT MONSTAH, I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" I said to her as she swam away.\n\nClass was really weird after that with Kathy gone.  I never told any of the students about our encounter but I sure as hell would never mention it to anyway.  Ever.  Of course I'm telling Reddit, but isn't that what the internet is for?  To tell strangers your deepest, darkest secrets?\n\nThe year ended without being... too weird.\n\n**TL;DR:  Overheard a student talking about having sex with me... things got... weird and it ended in an unexpected way...**\n\nI feel like I should thank whoever gave me Reddit gold.

It was on the parents of gay kids and whether or not they knew about it before the came out). \n\"Yes; I found out when my son was 17 (this was a few years ago). He would come home from school, get on his computer, and message someone for hours. I noticed this, and tried asking him occasionally at the dinner table. He just shrugged and said \"It's just one of my friends I met on the internet.\" I was glad that he was making friends, but I became worried this person might be a bad influence or do something harmful afterschool. One day for whatever reason I was so distraught, while he was retaking a test at school, I went up to his room and got on his computer.

I opened up his Skype, and he only had one contact; someone named \"Jeff.\" He had over 4,000 messages with him, and was currently online. I quickly read the first few messages sent between them and I was shocked. I couldn't believe that this was happening.  Over the past few months, 'Jeff' was trying to seduce my son to get money through paypal. I went to Jeff's profile and examined his profile picture. It was about that time I realized this kid 'Jeff' was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I messaged him, \"Damn it monster, leave my boy alone! I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363488468", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 1}

This happened during my Basic Military Training (BMT) on an offshore island called Tekong. Tekong is well known to be..dirty, for various reasons. Anyways, I was tasked with prowling guard duty one night with my buddy over the weekend (we'd been punished for smoking in the toilets). We ended up being asked to prowl around the most deserted and out-of-the-way part of camp, the Ammo dump. We prowled around it a couple of times and got lazy, so, since there wasnt anyone around, we decided to just lie down and have a quick nap. We were jolted from our sleep by the sounds of a girl laughing. We immediately radioed back to the guardhouse to report this. They replied :\"Recruit Neralo, don't try to play punk with us, we've heard all these stories before, get back to work before i make you sign more extras\" So we decided to pretend we didn't hear it, and got back to work. We turned a corner and about 15m in front of us was a small girl, maybe 5-6 years, in a white dress, with long hair covering her face. We were freaked. My buddy collapsed on the spot. I decided to ask it what it wanted. It said, \"I want ice-cream. Can you get me ice-cream?\" (not in english, but in hokkien). I said that there wasnt any around, and grabbing my buddies body armour, had begun to drag him away when she said \"help me get some\". I said \"what do you need?\"  She said, \"Imma need bout tree-fiddy\", at which point she turned into an 8 storey tall dinosaur from the paleolithic era. I yelled back \"GODDAMMIT MONSTAH, IM NOT GIVING YOU MY TREE-FIDDY\" as it swam away. \n\ntl;dr guard duty in a particularly deserted area of an army camp, met a little girl ghost. \n\nI swear everything was true right up till the conversation with her.

{"body": "OK, this is a weird, long story, and I don't think I've told anyone before. But it's weird and has always stuck with me.\n\nI was in college and working at a vintage clothing store, that was just off a busy foot traffic area. It was usually pretty slow so I just read, did my nails, or played solitaire on the store computer and then got paid in cash from the drawer at the end of the day. It was an ok gig, aside from having to shoo off a few small time drug dealers who liked to sit in the retro furniture we displayed outside to draw people in. That was actually ok at times, because then I actually felt like I was working and doing something. It could get kind of boring for seven hours at a time, listening to the retro lounge music I was supposed to play.\n\nOne day on like a Tuesday (or some slow weekday) afternoon, no one has come in for hours. A man comes in. He is kind of bigger, kind of a little sweaty, and breathing really heavily. He asks if we have any plus-size clothing. I know we have like a muu-muu and some bigger dresses. Even though the guy is weird, I help him out because OMIGAWSH SOMETHING TO DOOOOO besides try and plow my way through this stupid Diana Gabaldon book I promised my friend I'd read.\n\nHe takes a look at all the dresses and asks if he can try them on. I'm kind of looking at the dresses and at him, thinking they probably won't fit all that well, but don't want to offend him and it's not like there was anything else in the store that would fit him and who am I to judge if the man wants to wear dresses? So I point to the fitting rooms and make my way back to the front of the store.\n\nHe's in there grunting for a while. I knew the grunting sound of trying on vintage clothes that you desperately want to fit but but won't, and that was it. I'm pretty sure he wasn't slappin' da bass or anything. At one point he sounded a little like he might start to cry. I'm starting to feel really weird, like this guys vibe is all wrong to be in this store, and maybe I should call my boss OH SHIT what if he ruins some of those clothes...\n\nHe comes back out and hangs all the dresses back where I had gotten them from. He is still kind of sweaty and I am not really liking his vibe. He goes into some weird, long explanation of why he needed to try on dresses. It involved some bet (I don't remember what the bet was, but it was elaborate and very long), and he lost it to some female co-workers. Because he lost, he had to go and try on women's clothing in a store. He asked me my name and made me write it down on a piece of paper stating that I had seen him do this. I have NO idea why the women didn't come to the store, and I was weirded out immensely by him wanting me to sign some pre-printed out story about him trying on at least five articles of women's clothing. I wrote a fake name, just a first name, in plain writing. I think it was Pam, or something stupid like that. It wasn't a signature and he didn't ask me to change it. He apologized for about a whole excruciating minute (funny how long a minute seems when you're trapped behind a retail counter and a sweaty weird dude is apologizing to you), and finally left.\n\nAt this point it was about ten minutes to closing, so I waited five minutes not knowing what to think of what just happened. I went outside to take in the furniture and he bolts out of his car towards me, waving something in his hand. He tells me they are company credit cards and the women from his office wanted to compensate me for putting up with his behavior, so to select a credit card and he'd purchase me a gift of up to $50 on it. I just wanted to get the furniture in and lock the fuck up, and he was still acting quite sweaty and just frankly kind of *off*, and things were sounding kind of scam-ish at this point. Like, up to $50 dollars? Waving a fan of credit cards? They were all placed so that I couldn't see names or anything on them, so I just mumbled \"do it on the American Express, \" or something. He gets really agitated and shoves the cards towards me saying \"NO, you have to point to it!\" So I point at the AmEx, not touching it, and he gets more agitated and says \"NO, you have to TOUCH THE CARD.\" So it took my long fingernail and tapped a card (what with all the time to do my nails, they were fabulous). He sighed heavily, and is about to open his mouth again and I know he's going to say something like \"WITH YOUR FINGER\" or something, and I'm getting more weirded out...like why does he need my fingerprint? So I grab a chair and start hauling it inside, telling him \"GOODNIGHT, HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT!\" or some such other dumb thing, just talking over whatever he was saying as I hauled ass (and chair) inside. I close the door behind me and turn out the lights, leaving the rest of the furniture outside. He goes back to his car and sits there for like 15 minutes, so I just wait it out. I'm prepared to wait until I have to, when he revs the engine and speeds off, like, *peels* out of the parking space and down the street. I hustle the rest of the furniture inside and practically run home, looking behind me the whole time. \n\nI never really told anyone about it, because it was just so *weird* and thinking just how stupid it would have been to tell this story over beers or something later that night. I to this day have no idea what he was trying to do: if it was a scam or just plain crazy or what. Just to get one fingerprint on one credit card? Going through all that? I didn't even sign the piece of paper he gave me, just wrote a single name in plain script! I still think about it, and it was like ten years ago, at least. It was one of the weirder displays of face-to-face interaction I've had with someone in my lifetime, and it just left me feeling so *odd*. I can't explain any of it, and don't think I'll ever be able to. I don't think there's ever been anything that came of it that I know of. \n\nThis may not be the kind of story you were looking for, but I typed it all out.\n\nTL;DR This is not a tree fiddy story, I promise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363571525", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was 13 &amp; dating the bad boy next door. He had a small party at his house which consisted of him, his creepy older brother, my guy friend, &amp; me. (Hooray! I'm the only girl!)\n\nThere was a liberal amount of vodka that ended up going down my gullet in a relatively short period of time. (Yep, I thought I was a bad ass.) I ended up completely wasted but conscious enough to realize, \"holy shit! I'm now in a bedroom!\"\n\nI only remember flashes of memories from this period: his tongue in my mouth, him feeling me up, trying to finger me, him starting to take his pants off, then him lying down next to me with his exposed, erect penis. My first thought was \"how on earth could a penis be that long?\" To my beer-goggles eyes, it looked at least a foot to a foot &amp; a half long. Almost like he had the Loch Ness monster trapped in his britches. \n\nI must have really upset myself in the seconds (possibly moments) looking at this giant spear of a penis because the next memory is of projectile vomit appearing all over him &amp; his bed. \"Who is puking in here? Oh no!! It's me!!\" If memory serves me correctly, I didn't physically touch his penis at all... except with my alcohol infused upchuck.\n\nNext thing I remember is waking up in the bathtub with cold water drenching me. I was later helped to dress by this boyfriend (panties inside out &amp; one sock missing). Apparently, I ran through the house naked but this was never confirmed by my friend.\n\nThen my friend &amp; I were walked outside to their driveway. They asked me if I could stand up straight &amp; walk across the street. I replied in what was apparently an \"affirmative\" response. They let go of me &amp; I bent over at the waist to begin an amazing Irish Yoga pose but I must not have been aware of the car in said driveway.  **WHACK** My face dents the hood of the car &amp; bloodied up my lip. (First drunken fight... with a car, I suppose.)\n\nThen they escorted me to the street &amp; let me be free to flitter like a beautifully bloodied, blitzed butterfly all the way home across the street. The last thing I remember was struggling to turn my front door knob in vain. I pass out just as my mother opened the door. Somehow I made it back to my room &amp; puked in a bowl several times that evening causing my mother to replay her dinner of hot dogs. \n\nThe hangover was more than adequate punishment. Oh, Lord, it was a bad two or three day hangover. It's been nearly 20 years &amp; I'm still not much of a drinker. I usually refuse vodka now since the thought of it makes my tummy do little flips.\n\nNever really spoke to the boyfriend or his brother after that event. The boyfriend never mentioned it to my knowledge but his creepy brother would stare me down &amp; try to run me over on his bicycle for several years afterwards... even when I was 16 &amp; driving a beast of an Oldsmobile.

{"body": "When I first learned to bop the bishop I didn't really realize there was any stigma to it. To me it was like taking a shit; it was something you just kind of did from time to time. My big discovery came before most of my friends, so I hadn't talked to anybody about it. Back then I had a huge crush on the girl that lived next door to me. Cliche, I know, but she was in my grade and drop dead gorgeous, how could I help myself. My room was on the second floor of my house with a perfect view of their backyard, and their pool. Which sets the stage for a most unfortunate July afternoon. My neighbor, Betsy, had been swimming for a while, but now she was laying out by the pool. Boy did she look good. I remember peeping over the ledge at my window, feeling mischievous and excited at the same time. And then I got a familiar feeling.. I thought, What could it hurt? Dad was downstairs taking a nap, and the rest of the house was empty. So I got down to business. Then, mid-business, I heard a \"Oh shit, I'm sorry!\" from behind me. I whirled around, pants down, johnson flapping around, to see to my greatest horror Betsy's dad staring straight at me. \"Jeez, I'm sorry, I had no idea you were up here. I was bringing over some old baseball cards, I mentioned it to your mom a couple days ago. Your dad told me to just drop them off in your room, I had no idea y......\" He caught sight of what I was looking at through my window. There she was, his bikini-clad daughter, tanning by the side of their pool. The color drained from my face, and my flag fell exceptionally below half mast. He looked at me and said \"Son, you've got a lot of explaining to do.\" I wanted to vomit. \"I'm going to go downstairs and get your dad, and then we're all going to have a little talk\" he said. \"Oh God no!\" I yelled, \"Please don't tell him!

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied.\n\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\n\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\n\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.\n\nThey were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.\n\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\n\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\n\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\n\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.\n\ntl;dr: Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363650866", "subreddit": "Braveryjerk", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It happened when I was about 17 years old. Me and my best friend were on our way home from school. He had decided to take the backroads home because the streets on the way to the freeway always get ridiculously overcrouded with traffic when school gets out.\n\nWe were driving down the road, it was a really long, straight, two lane road. A lot of the kids liked to drive really fast down this road because there were never any cops, and it was straight for about 3 miles. I myself had always maxed out any car I was ever able to drive down this road. So from behind us, we see this little Honda Civic just smashing balls towards us, we were going the speed limit, so this car decides to pass us. He apparently thought he would be able to make it before the car coming towards us in the other lane got to us. He tried to pass us like an idiot, and ended up swerving out of the way of the oncoming car, just barely making it back into his lane, the oncoming car, in panic had swerved as well, towards my friends car.\n\nI don't really recall what happened next. I just remember being thrown around the car (I wasn't wearing my seatbelt), and then BAM! It all went black. I felt like I was in a dream. They say you can see a white lighwhen you die, but I remember everything being white. I remember seeing someone, it wasn't anyone I knew. This person had short brown hair, and was dressed in all white, it was an angel. I told him \"I'm not ready to die, I want to go back.\" He then said, in the softest voice,\"If you want to go back, there is only one thing you need to do.\" \"What? What do you want from me?\" The angel then looked me in the eye and said,\"I need about tree-fitty.\" \n\nWell it was about this time that I noticed this angel was eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "[I hope you don't mind, I took the liberty of making a spin off. Your locker holds dark secrets.]\n\nI walk out of class, stretching my neck. I'm stiff from sitting around all day and can't wait to get out of here. I open my locker and throw my books in there without really looking, causing a loud bang as the books hit the back of the locker. I lean in to inspect the damage. The upper right corner of the back of the locker is bent back. Behind the locker isn't a wall, like I expected, instead there's some kind of dark room. I can't see properly what is in there, but by now I'm intrigued. I squeeze myself into the locker sideways, put one shoulder to the bent backside of the locker and push. With a groan the metal bends and gives way and I stumble into the darkness beyond. \n\n\"Whoa.\" The darkness stretches on in all directions. This place is impossibly large, there is no way it could fit inside the small wall behind my locker. The only sources of light in the inky blackness is the light streaming in through my locker behind me and a tiny sliver of light far ahead of me. I consider leaving, just forgetting about all this, but my curiosity gets the better of me.\n\nAfter jogging towards the distant light for a few minutes I run right into some kind of metal wall and fall backwards. The darkness is so thick that I couldn't even make it out before running in to it. When I get up and inspect it more closely I see that the light is not far away at all, it's just a tiny sliver of fight coming through a tiny hole in the metal wall in front of me. I put my eye to the hole and try to peer through. \n\n\"No way.\" It looks like the corridor where my locker is, but I just left it and ran away from it for minutes, how can I be back here? Besides, I bent the back of my locker clean off, this one is still intact. I decide this needs investigating, so I take a couple of steps back and tackle the locker as hard as I can. It gives way surprisingly easily and I stumble through and out into the corridor beyond. It really is the same corridor. Weird. I shrug it off, I want to get to the bottom of this, but the blackness behind the locker kind of creeped me out, so I decide I'll head back tomorrow with a flashlight so I can explore it properly.\n\n~\n\nSomething has been bugging me on my walk to my house, ever since I left the school. I couldn't quite put my finger on it until just now. Nobody is talking. There are people all around me, walking to and from their schools or their jobs, people driving their cars or riding their bikes, but the only sounds are those of car engines and a dull humming of birds. In fact, it looks like the people don't take notice of anything around them, they walk mechanically, go about their business, but show no emotion. This is creepy as hell. Am I in some kind of parallel universe? Or is this some elaborate prank? I walk up next to a middle aged businessman and keep up with his mechanical strides. \n\n\"Hello? Excuse me, anyone there?\" I wave a hand frantically in front of his face he stops and turns his head towards me, staring at me with blank, pupil-less eyes. After a moment of silence he turns around and start walking again.\n\nMy lungs feel like they are about to explode in protest as I'm running head over heels back to the school, into the locker, through the darkness and back out my locker. My real locker. I collapse on the ground panting. \n\n\"What's up with you? Did someone steal your Twinkie, again?\" Sam looms over me with a face of mock sympathy. \n\n\"Oh, piss off.\" I consider telling her about the place beyond the locker for a moment, but I decide not to. I don't want to sound like an idiot or a nutter. Not a coward either, not in front of Sam anyway. I'll go back tomorrow and explore further. Maybe there's a race of evil aliens enslaving the people in our parallel universe? On second thought, it's probably the government. It's always the government in the movies. They've probably finally invented the ultimate mind control, capable of sending people in to drone like states where they do their jobs without asking questions and without demanding a raise. Way to go, you capitalist pigs. Either way, I mean to find out tomorrow.\n\n~\n\nFinally, the bell rings out for the day. I'm excited, but more then a little nervous to go back in there. At least this time I'm better prepared. I filled my bag with some food and water, just in case, a flashlight and a Swiss army knife I nicked from my dad's bathroom drawer. You never know what might come in handy when dealing with weird, zombified people in a parallel universe, I guess. \n\nI open my locker, half expecting the dark space beyond to be gone, but no, it's still there. I get in and shuffle through my bag for my flashlight. I press the button on the back, but nothing happens. Weird, I checked it this morning and it worked just fine. I don't want to explore any further in here without a light so I head out through the other locker. There's a few students in the corridor, but they take no note of me as I burst out through a locker. I avoid meeting their eyes, their blank faces makes my skin crawl. If this is some kind of mind control, maybe I can wake them up by yelling at them through the schools speaker system? Honestly, I doubt it will work, but I can't come up with a better idea right now. \n\nI take the stairs leading up to the principals office and knock on the door. I takes me a moment to realize that these people probably wouldn't notice if I kicked the door down, let alone if I knocked on it, so I open it and walk in. There's a low desk with a young woman with short brown hair sitting behind it, tapping away at her computer. With a pang of shock I realize it's the principals assistant, the same principals assistant that's in the 'real world'. If there's two of her, does that mean there's two of me? My brain is starting to hurt just thinking about it, so I push the thought away. \n\nI can see the microphone they use for school announcements on the desk next to the assistant. I try to reach past her and take it, but it's awkward and she's not making any effort to move. I gently slide her rolling chair away from the desk. She continues to tap away at the air as if the keyboard was still there, eyes fixed where her screen was a moment ago with a faint smile on her face. I clear my throat and tentatively ask the mic \n\n\"Hello? Is this thing on?\". My voice can be heard echoing through the school from the various speakers. Yep, definitely on. \n\n\"Excuse me, but I think it's time you people snap out of it, alright? Nap time's over, time to wake up! If there's anyone feeling like they're not a zombie, please come meet me at the principal's office!\"\n\nI glance at my watch. It's been five minutes and I'm getting tired of watching the assistant practice her air typing, I guess nobody is going to show up, hardly surprising, so I should probably figure out some other plan. I gently slide the assistant and her chair back in to place, it seemed cruel to leave her like that. When I turn around I just about have a heart attack. There's a purple haired girl standing right behind me with the same blank expression as the rest of them. I recognize her immediately as a girl in my class and a brilliant idea strikes me. I'll just bring this girl with me, back to our world, then I'll have some real proof of what is going on and I'll be able to get some help. \n\n\"Come on, I'm taking you to meet some friends, okay? We're gonna help you.\" I talk to her as if I was talking to a child, I'm not sure if it helps though, she doesn't seem to register I said anything at all. I grab my the hand and drag her behind me, she stumbles after without a word. When we get to the stairs she takes a step right out in to the air, as if expecting the floor to be the same level as before. When her foot meets nothing but thin air she is sent tumbling down the stairs before I can stop her. I look on in terror as a dark pool of blood begins to expand from her head at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nHoly shit. Holy fuck. I just got someone killed. What do I do now? Go back and pretend like nothing happened? I wonder if these zombies will even remove the body or if they'll just let it lie there and rot. I try not to think about it. What if I go back and tell someone what happened? First of, they wouldn't believe me and even if they did they wouldn't be able to help, she's already dead. Besides, maybe they'll lock me up for murder. I'm not up to date on our local zombie slaying laws, but I don't think this would look good on my record. This it too much. I've got to get out of here. I'll come back tomorrow, maybe I'll even bring Sam, god knows I could use the help. I'm in way over my head here. \n\n~\n\n\"Listen, man, there's this place behind my locker, it's like another world in there. It's like here, except the people have really creepy eyes and don't really react to anything, like they're mind controlled or something...\" I trail of realizing how insane I must sound. Sam can hardly suppress her giggling. \n\n\"You didn't happen to see any werewolves or aliens while you were in your locker dimension did you?\" I don't know what I expected, but I think I would've preferred being called a madman in front of being laughed at. \n\n\"Yeah, yeah, go ahead and laugh. I know it sounds insane, but just promise me you'll meet me at the lockers after class, okay?\" She grins at me as if I walked right in to her trap. \n\n\"Gee, if you wanted to take my out on a date, all you had to do was ask!\" I scowl at her as we enter the classroom together, already a few minutes late. \n\n\"As I was saying\" The teacher begins, clearly annoyed at the interruption, \"I'm very sorry to inform you all that your classmate, Alyssa, was in an accident yesterday. She fell down a flight of stairs and died, I know you'll all miss her very much and I thought it would be best if we take a break from studying today and take a moment to remember her. You are dismissed, classes resume tomorrow morning.\" No way. There's no way it's a coincidence she fell down the stairs both here and in the locker world. My stomach lurches as I realize I caused the death of not one, but two people yesterday. Maybe it still only counts as one, they were the same person after all. Kind of. This thought doesn't really make me feel any better about it all though, but at least me and Sam will have plenty of time to figure out what's going on in there, now that we don't have class for the rest of the day.\n\nI swing the locker door open and step back, letting Sam get a good look. Her mouth hangs slightly open in surprise, but she climbs through into the darkness beyond. I go after her, but the darkness is so thick I can't see her anywhere. \n\n\"Sam?! Where are you?\" What if she's gone, there's been some strange stuff going on the last few days, maybe I'm the only one who can get in here. \n\n\"I'm right here. Take my hand.\" Her voice is no more then a few inches from me, all the air of giggling and teasing gone from her voice. I'm glad she can't see my look of relief when I hear her voice or hear the thumping of my heart when she grabs my hand and pulls me through the darkness towards the glimmering light on the other side.\n\n\"Wow, you weren't lying...\" Sam says absentmindedly as she waves a hand in front of a blank-faced student. \n\n\"Why would I lie?\" Sam continues to examine the boy who seems to take no notice of her poking or her waving arms. \n\n\"I don't know, you lie about this kind of stuff all the time.\" The way she says it without even paying attention, as if it was a well known fact makes it sting a little bit. \n\n\"Well, I didn't lie this time. Listen, there's something I need to tell you... When I was here yesterday, I thought I'd bring one of them back. To show everyone, you know, so they'd know I was telling the truth and all... Only, when I was leading her down the stairs, she fell and died... It was Alyssa from our class.\" Sam finally stop examining the student and looks at me as if she didn't hear a word I just said. \n\n\"What?\" I'm not sure what I expected and I'm starting to regret telling her, but I can't take it back now. \n\n\"I think... I think I killed Alyssa... I didn't mean to, you know... it just kind of happened.\" Sam's knees seem to buckle under her weight and she slips down to the ground looking exhausted. \n\n\"This is serious.\" I nod grimly. \n\n\"What should we do? I mean, maybe we should just leave and never come back. The people here seem to be fine without us... maybe.\" Sam thinks for a moment before getting back on her feet. \n\n\"I want to explore a little more first. There's something wrong with these people, and I think we need to help them.\"\n\n~\n\nSam is walking back and forth between the rows of student tapping away at their keyboards. She's poking them, moving them around, shouting in their ears, doing everything she can think of to get some kind of response. Nothing. I lean in close to a girl around my age, my face inches from hers, to see what she's typing on her computer. \n\n'HELPMEHELPMEHELPMETHOMASSALTHELPMEHELPME'. The girl turns her face towards me and with a jolt of surprise and fear I see a flicker of desperation, of fear in her face as she whispers \"Help me\". I stumble backwards in horror and when I look back up, she's staring blankly at her computer screen once again, tapping away, with a faint smile on her face. \n\n\"Did you see that!?\" Sam is clutch her desk with one hand and her heart with the other. She nods. \n\n\"They're real. They're human just like us, I think. Only, there's something stopping them from thinking properly.\" I slide the girls chair away to get a good look at her screen again. \n\n\"Come look at this. There's a name here.\" I point at the screen, in the middle of what looks like the girls geography homework is the message she wrote. 'HELPMEHELPMEHELPMETHOMASSALTHELPMEHELPME'. \n\n\"Thomas Salt. Maybe he's got something to do with all this. Any idea who that is?\" Sam shakes her head. \n\n\"I think we should get out of here.\"\n\n~\n\nI grab Sam by the arm as we're walking out of class and steer her away from the other students. \n\n\"I looked up that guy, Thomas Salt, on the internet. It's a pretty common name, but there's one that stood out. He lives in the area, a 24 year old guy who seems to be some kind of hacker. He had a bunch of previous arrests for identity theft, fraud and even trying to break in to the pentagon. I think we should visit him, try to get to the bottom of this.\" Sam doesn't look convinced. \n\n\"I don't know, it just sounds dangerous. He doesn't sound like the kind of guy who likes surprise visits...\" I grab her wrist and stop her, trying to make her understand. \n\n\"Look, I'm going to see him, no matter what. That girl... she wanted my help. She *needs* help and nobody else is gonna give it to her.\" Sam gives a resigned shrug. \n\n\"Fine. Then I'm coming with you.\"\n\n*Knock knock*. A few hours later we're at the address scribbled on a piece of paper in my hand. Only just now do I realize I have no idea what to say to this guy, if he opens the door. After waiting a few moments I knock on the door again. It immediately opens a crack and a pair of eyes stare out at us through the gap. \n\n\"The hell do you want?\" I'm a little taken a back by the hostility in his voice. \n\n\"Uhm... Do you mind if we come in? It's kind of important.\" The door swings open. \n\n\"Get in.\" The apartment within is dark and dank, there's a large blanket hanging over the window, blocking out the sun. There's discarded pizza boxes, various computer parts and dirty clothes scattered all across the room. The only clean thing in the entire apartment seems to be the computer and the desk it's standing on. The man talks over his shoulder as he makes his way through a pile of dirty laundry toward his computer. \n\n\"My services aren't cheap, but whatever you need I can probably get it for you. So what are you kids in business for? Fake IDs? You want me to hack your schools network or something?\" I guess that explains why he let us in. \n\n\"Actually we want some... information. We found a sort of... gateway to another world or something and the people there are kind of like...\" The man holds up a hand to stop me. \n\n\"Just get out of here, stop wasting my time.\" He starts shoving us brusquely towards the door and slams it shut behind us. \n\n\"Well that didn't do us much good...\" Sam grins mischievously at me. \"Oh I don't know about that.\" She's dangling a set of keys in her hand that she nicked of the table.\n\nThe next day, we decide to pay Thomas Salt another visit. The other Thomas Salt that is. We have his apartment keys, hopefully they'll work in the locker world too. I slide the key in to the lock carefully, trying not to make a sound. With a satisfying *click* the door swings open. It's dark inside, it doesn't look like anyone is here. I take a few steps in to the dark apartment when a sudden jerk below me sends me and Sam flying through the air. We hit each other and get tightly packed into some kind of rope net. We walked right in to a trap. \n\n\"Well, that didn't quite go the way I had planned.\" Sam is wriggling around trying to get more comfortable. \"Your knee is in my face.\" I try my best to move it but the net is tightly wrapped around us. \n\n\"Sorry.\" We wait in silence for a few minutes. \"Hey... if we starve to death here, I just wanted to ask you... You want to go out some time? With me... like a date.\" Sam looks at me with disbelief. \n\n\"I'm trying to figure out if there has ever been a worse time in my life for someone to ask me out. Nope. I don't think so. Figure out a way to get us out of this instead!\" I should probably start thinking before I open my mouth. \n\n\"Geez, I was just asking in case we die here! Relax!\"\n\nI had almost started to give up hope when a man finally shows up outside the door. It's Thomas Salt, except he doesn't look much like the Thomas Salt we saw yesterday. He had shaved, had short, neat hair and a nice suit. He was holding a bag of groceries in his hands, but drops it in shock when he sees the two of us lying in a tightly packed bunch on the floor. \n\n\"Hi.\" I give him a little wave. \n\n\"You... you're not controlled? How did you get here? What are you doing here?\" Sam shifts uncomfortably next to me and snarls at the man. \n\n\"Get us out of this thing and we'll talk!\" Thomas hurries to cut us loose. \"Sorry, I just had to set this up to stop those creepy Controlled from walking in and just standing next to me, staring at me. It really creeped me out.\" A few minutes later we're free and Thomas slides a cup of tea towards me across the table. \n\n\"Here, drink.\" Now that the light is turned on I see that this Thomas keeps his apartment much tidier, it actually looks kind of nice. You never would have guessed judging by the state it was in in our world. \n\n\"Thanks. So... you wanted to know how we got here and what we're doing here... This is probably going to sound stupid, but I found a path behind the locker at my school. When I walked through it, we got out in my school again, except it wasn't really our school. Everything was the same except for the people... The people are all... blank?\" Thomas nods. \n\n\"We've been aware of the other world for some time now. I guess I'd better start from the beginning. A few years ago I was a real scumbag. I would do anything I could to get my hands on some money, a lot of it illegal. I was pretty good with computers and some guy ended up paying me to hack in to the pentagon. I wasn't sure if I could do it, but he payed a lot of money so I gave it a shot. In the end, I managed to do it, but I got caught. They offered to let me avoid time in prison if I agreed to start working for them, help them improve their security systems. I didn't want to spend the rest of by days behind bars so I took the offer and I turned my life around, became an honest man. After a few years my employers started to take a lot of interest in a project I was working on in my spare time, just for fun. It was a sort of mind control device, I never got it to work properly, but they put their best scientists on it and eventually they got it to work. They hooked the whole thing up to a broadcast system linked to peoples phones, anyone with a phone was turned into this mindless creature that only went about their daily routine, doing their jobs and only needing minimal food. My employers were thrilled, this would make them billions! I didn't like it though, I didn't like it at all. It's just... wrong, but they made it very clear that my only choice was to keep quiet and do what I was told or join the Controlled, so I kept to myself, did what I was told.\" I sip my tea, it's a lot to take in. \n\n\"You said you guys knew about our world?\" Sam asks. \n\n\"Yes. We've known about it for a while now, but you guys are the first to come through from your side, at least as far as I know. They're planning to do the same thing to your world, control everyone. It's just a matter of time, really.\" Sam sighs in frustration. \n\n\"Can't you do something, you're smart aren't you? Can't you make a laser and zap them or something?\" He smiles a little. \n\n\"You read too much science fiction. Sorry, there's nothing I can do.\" Sam and I are both getting angry now. \n\n\"Oh, come on! You can't just give up that easily! Can't you change the signal to affect your employers as well?\" He looks dumbstruck for a moment, his mouth opening and closing, trying to find the right words. \n\n\"Uhm... I might actually be able to do that.\"\n\n~\n\nI sit watching Thomas work, his hands are flying fast across the keyboard, numbers and text that mean nothing to me fly across the screen at a blinding speed. Thomas turns around and looks at me. \n\n\"Sorry, there's just one more thing. Do you think you could give me about tree fiddy?\" That's when I realized it. The man sitting in front of me wasn't Thomas Salt. It wasn't a man at all. It was a three stories tall crustacean from the paleolithic era  wearing a suit and a wig. \n\n\"Goddamnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled at it. Me and Sam both grab a chair and start beating the monster with it. He flailed his monstrous limbs trying to fight us, but eventually we managed to over power him. \n\n\"Goddamn Loch Ness monster... always asking me for tree fiddy...\" Suspecting what is really going on, I smash the computer with a satisfying *crunch*. The change is immediate. I can hear voices coming from the neighboring apartments. I sprint outside and there's a few people standing there. They look at me confused, but otherwise normal. \n\n\"What happened? What's going on?\" A confused man asks. \n\n\"Don't worry, it was just the goddamned Loch Ness monster.\"\n\n~\n\nThere had to be one of these in here, right?\n\n[Sorry!! I hope I didn't disappoint anyone with this abrupt and non serious ending, I just wanted to finish this before it got buried further and people lost interest, it already got quite long.

{"body": "Years ago I was happily browsing Omegle searching for aesthetically pleasing, young maidens to flirt with. I was whiling away the hours skipping the hordes of penises, casting onto them my judgment, until I finally came across Aphrodite herself. This girl was so jaw-droppingly beautiful that I couldn't help but awkwardly wave to her and type messages at lightning speed to prevent her from nexting me. And to my surprise, it worked-- she stayed. I then tried to defluster myself and create some conversation, and that too was working great. She was laughing at all of my jokes and showing a lot of the signs of attraction, like playing with her hair. \n\nHer name was Olivia. \n\nNow, when we got past the initial, awkward introductory phase of the encounter, things got suspiciously good. She told me about her insecurities and how good I made her feel. This girl liked me a lot, and trusted me enough to tell me about her problems at home (her Dad thought she was a slut, because she had sex with her ex boyfriend). She reeled me in, I completely believed everything she told me and my heart really went out to her. I have never been a hit with the ladies, so I felt very attached to this girl who was showing so much interest in me. \n\nWe talked until I could hear the tweeting of birds outside and my eyelids got heavy, but fuck it, I didn't care. I was mid-sentence, when she interrupted me and told me to stop talking. She then unzipped her hoody to reveal small, perfectly shaped breasts to my fucking delight. \"Myrmidon_Bro, can you help me?\" To which I replied \"I'll do anything for you.

{"body": "Last weekend I had the pleasure of meeting the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She was tall, thin, had long flowing brown hair and vibrant green eyes. We met at a bar downtown and we really hit it off. I asked her if she would like to go out on a date and to my own surprise and complete happiness, she said yes. I felt on top of the world. So I picked her up the following evening from her place on the east side of town around 7pm. We listened to my iPod along the way to the restaurant and she loved nearly every song. We even sang to most of them. What a great start to the evening! We arrived at the restaurant and we sat down and ordered our food. I told her to not be shy about what she ordered and she politely agreed. I got a prime rib dinner and she ordered two fish dinners. In the back of my mind I thought \"wow, that's a lot of food for such a skinny person\" but that was about all the thought I gave the situation and we continued our amazing date. We talked about each other's lives, how she was born in California, how she ran track in high school and how her father's business made her family move multiple times all over the country. There was such a huge connection between both of us that I got lost in her eyes, in her stories, in her everything. It felt like I was just floating there, like I wasn't even on earth anymore, everything was going so perfectly. Then it came around the time that I had to take her home. It was a very romantic night drive back to her house while she was laying her head on my shoulder throughout the drive. We both couldn't have been more content I puller into her driveway and the truck came to a stop. I threw it in \"park\" and asked her a question... \" can I kiss you?\". She said \"yes\" and my face lit up like the fourth of July. As butterflies continued to burst in my stomach she then said \"but... I'm going to need about tree fiddy.\" It was at this moment that I realized it was that damn loch ness monstah in a brown wig! I says \"damnit monstah get outta my truck! I ain't givin you no damn tree fiddy!\" Then in one quick motion, all 27 feet of her fled out of my truck and slithered away into the cool evening horizon.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363754016", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Back when I was in college, I used to work for a Domino's as a delivery boy. I took it pretty seriously because I needed to money for tuition and books, and my boss was a serious hardass about punctuality. This led me to drive in a manner that was perhaps not the safest.\n\nI had a couple near-misses in my driving career, but the worst was when I was making a delivery pretty late at night. It was a school night, and it was the last delivery of the night, so I really wanted to finish it and go back to my dorm to do some work and sleep. I was on a two lane road, in the right lane, and the only other car on the road was this white pickup truck that was going probably 15 miles per hour under the speed limit. I hadn't driven that road much, but as I looked up, I saw that my lane ended and I had to merge. I didn't want to be stuck behind the slow-ass pickup, so I slammed on the gas and cut him off (I was a dick, I know).\n\nI didn't think much of it. I'd done similar things before. I expected to get honked at and flipped off, but I really wanted to make my delivery. I was not expecting what ended up happening. Out of my rearview mirror, I could see the guy flipping me and his mouth moving like he was screaming. He was beating the horn of the car with his fist and flipping me off with his other hand.\n\nWithout a hand on the wheel, the car was not moving straight, and as he brought his hand down to hit the steering wheel again, he missed by a few inches and caught the side, abruptly veering the car off into a ditch. I immediately when ghost-white and pulled over onto the shoulder, feeling bad because it was basically my fault.\n\nHe was alright, but his car was beat up pretty badly. He called the cops and they said they'd be by to help him out in twenty minutes or so. I thought he was going to beat my face in, but he was actually pretty calm about it, and apologized to ME for losing his temper. He explained that he didn't usually get road rage, but that he's been laid off at work and didn't know if he was going to able to feed his kids that night. He was a really nice guy, actually. I felt really bad at this point, so I offered him the pizza in my car, which he gracefully accepted. I told him I wanted to wait with him, but that I had to get back to work and explain to my manager what happened. He thanked me, and I asked him if there was anything else I could do for him before I left.\n\nHe said \"Well, there is one more thing I need.\" I asked him what. He looked down sheepishly, like he was embarrassed, and then whispered, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Now, it was about this time that I realized the man was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. It was the Loch Ness Monster. I said \"God dammit Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" and hopped in my car, speeding away.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363754938", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Scientists are just starting to solve these questions. Why do theists expect they should have figured out EVERY single question of the universe by now, and if not, then they're discredited. Give them time. We only figured out flight 100 years ago. To me it's more arrogant to claim your have the answers already than to simply admit you haven't gotten them yet. \n\nLastly atheism requires no faith. Period. Remove this idea from your thinking. Not believing in something in the absence of evidence is the literal opposite of faith. Do you have \"faith\" that there's no leprechauns and unicorns and the loch Ness monster? Does that require you to suspend your reasoning? No. That's it. No atheist needs to reaffirm \"faith\". Atheism is simply \"i don't not have sufficient proof that there is a god.\" Faith does not step into the picture.

{"body": "Going by last week:\n\nSt Patrick driving the snakes out of Ireland is a metaphor for him driving out or killing all the pagans.\n\nThis is wrong for a number of reasons. First, one guy cannot kill a whole population. Two if it happened then we would have some record of it. But most importantly 3, ancient Irish writers and biographers did not use metaphor. To all the early Irish saints there is attributed 'great feats', St Columba fought the loch Ness monster, raised people from the dead and turned milk into wine. St Brigid had her magic cloak etc. This was to portray the saints as more great and powerful than the pagan predecessors and the heroes of celtic mythology. They are literally saying Patrick got rid of all the serpents.\n\nAlso, The 'Celts' never invaded Ireland. This was popularised by T F O'Reilly in the 40s based mainly on the book of invasions. There is no evidence of any invasion from mainland europe around 500bc. Instead there is evidence of gradual adoption of cultural ideas from europe.

{"body": "Maybe not complete idiots..but certainly largely misinformed:\n\nI had just graduated work and had landed myself a job in new city, working for at a production plant.\n\nOn my first day, not much went on. General orientation, meeting the people around the office, getting introduced to my boss, getting to sit in my office for a few minutes. The next day was the first formal day of training. Training was being done by the training coordinator for the department.\n\nHe started off by giving us an overview of the process for the plant. Take chemical X, do this to it to produce chemical Y, which we then filter to extract out components T and U, thus purifying Y. Things of that nature.\n\nThen he got to the part about the main reaction, and started talking about the reactor. The reactor had a catalyst bed in it. For those that don't know, a catalyst is essentially something that helps speed up a process or improve its efficiency **without being consumed itself**. That means that there is no reaction taking place between any given chemical and the catalyst (there is potential fouling, but that's different).\n\nIn any case, as he's talking about the reaction, he mentions how chemical Y is put into the reactor and extracts component Z from the catalyst and becomes chemical YZ. Now, the component he was talking about actually is taken from air, not the catalyst. I asked him if he knew what the catalysts purpose was, and he informed me it was to make the reaction better by supplying more Z to chemical Y. I inform him that Z does not come from the catalyst but rather from the air, but he disagrees, begins arguing, and bitches and moans about how he's the trainer and it's his *job* to know this stuff in detail, blah, blah, blah. I'd like to point out that my job is dealing with the process -- one that I *have* seen before and understand to a good degree.\n\nAnyway, at this point, I just leave it at that, because this guy has supposedly been training people for 36 years, and I'm certain people have corrected him, but he chooses to not listen.\n\nAnyway, someone else asks him a question, then we take off to take a tour. At the tour, he's going in detail about the process, and, again, describes it to us all incorrectly. Whatever, I know what's going on and most others in this training session will not have to know the details, so it's no big deal.\n\nThen we go back to the office and he 'quizzes' us by having one random person draw the process on the board. One guy goes up and he draws it, but he uses my process description for the reactor rather than what the guy told him. The guy is immediately annoyed and \"corrects\" him. At this point, I've stopped caring and I just want to get this training over with.\n\nAfter we finish with this process, he's supposed to hand us our gear so we can go to the plant by ourselves (he was our escort until then). He starts handing them out while jokingly asking people for money for the gear.\n\nHe gets to me, hands me the gear, and says, \"I need about tree fiddy\".\n\nWell, it was about this time that I realized that the trainer was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "Yup. Got laid in Vegas. Not kidding.\n\nEdit: I guess I'll tell my story.\n\nSo it was back in 2006. Spring break of fourth year of university. My buddies and I decide to take a few days off and head to Vegas. We head from Toronto to Vegas and get off the plane after a long flight. It's late so we head up to the hotel. So the first night we are in our room and decide to head out anyway. We head to Beano's Casino for a night of fun and drinks. I had a few and so I was out of it. This gorgeous brunette is serving drinks and is filling me up like there is no tomorrow. It's about half past two and I'm really tipsy. I had about 5 beers and a few shots. The brunette comes by to serve me another drink and whispers in my ear \"meet me in the outside alley in five minutes\". So I finish my round of poker and get ready to leave. As I am leaving, a guy bumps into me making me spill his drink all over him self. He takes a swing at me and misses and out of nowhere, my buddy appears and knocks him out. I head outside into the alley way only to find the brunette topless. She whispers into my ear \"are you ready for the time of your life?\" \"Fuck yeah!\" \"But I need something first\". Confused, I ask \"what is it?\" \"I just need about tree fiddy\". Well it was about that time that I notice the hot brunette was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \"Get outta here Loch Ness monster, ain't nobody giving you tree fiddy.

{"body": "This was about a year ago. Junior year of college (or uni; not sure of your nationality), very beginning of the semester. I had just gotten back to school from a long winter break, which was preceded by a long stretch of isolation while studying for and taking finals. And, since it was the beginning of the semester, my workload was light. If there was any time to do something memorable, it was now.\n\nSo my platonic female friend (guy here) and I decide to hang out one Wednesday night. Her friend from back home is visiting, since she's still on winter break. Our mutual guy friend joins us too. Well, we all want to show this visitor a GOOD time. So naturally, we go to the local gay club. \n\nI'm a straight guy, but this is honestly my favorite club in the city. The music is great, I can dance without feeling like a loser, the drinks are reasonably priced and, truthfully, I kind of like getting hit on by dudes. It's a weird sort of validation. So we get there, and it turns out it's Student Body Night. I have no idea what this is, since I don't tend to visit my local anything on a Wednesday night. But I quickly find out what it is: college students get in for free. Oh, and there's also a competition. College guys get on stage and do a striptease, and the winner gets $100.\n\nI see the sign for it on my way in, and in my head I'm like *noooo way*. I just want to have some drinks, enjoy the drag show (which is honestly hilarious. Those shemales know how to put on a great show), and get to know my friend's friend. \n\nThe drag show finishes after a while. By this point, I've had probably 6 Miller Lites. I don't like Miller Lite, but for some reason all the guys there were drinking it, and I was just trying to blend in with the crowd. So I'm kind of tipsy. That's when the drag queen on stage announces that it's time to start the Student Body Competition. Unfortunately, they don't have enough entrants, and she's trying to get people to join.\n\nI happen to be at the bar, toward the back but right in the center. Right in his (her?) line of sight. So the drag queen looks right me and say, \" I need about tree fiddy\".\n\nJust kidding! She says, \"C'mon, get up here!\" Everyone around me is cheering me on. I'm just shaking my head no, no. But two things changed my mind: (1) the realization that I would get to take off my shirt, around my friend's friend. I'm not totally out of shape, and I'd been getting good vibes from her. So, I thought doing this might help. But what sealed the deal was my guy friend. He looked at me and said, \"if you do this, I'll buy you beer for the rest of the semester\".\n\nI promptly got in line. A few people went before me, then it was my turn. I don't really remember what I did, since it was a while ago. All I remember is unbuttoning my shirt and, when I causally threw it off the stage, thinking to myself *shit, where'd that go? Ugh now I gotta find it after this*. When my time was up, the host did a short Q&amp;A with me on stage, like with all the other contestants. All I remember from that is that I gave her my middle name instead of my first name, and one question. She asked me \"Are you into girls?\", to which I replied \"...uhh, mostly.\" (I was at a gay club, so didn't want to lie, but I also didn't want people to realize I was straight. I almost felt like I was trespassing!) And the host replied, \"Well I'm mostly girl!\" and stroked her finger down my bare stomach. It was honestly pretty funny, and evoked many a laugh from the crowd and from myself.\n\nI ended up taking 2nd, as measured by crowd applause. I lost to some guy with a swimmer's body and a much better sense of rhythm than me. He deserved to win. Plus, I beat the black guy. So good enough for me!\n\nAfter that the dance floor opened up. I danced with my friend's friend all night long. We hooked up that night, and then we had sex the next night. So yeah. That's how a bunch of Miller Lite got me to do a striptease at a gay club, which led to me getting laid.

{"body": "I had this happen to me once. Just a little back story to explain why I went along with it:\n\nIt had been a long day, but not a busy one. I had already been to all the usual \"hot spots\" around town without any any luck. It was a cold night too, so nobody wanted to walk around, but that also meant that people weren't going out much if they didn't have a car. \nI work for myself, so that means that I don't have a dispatcher. I prefer not to work for a taxi cab company because they usually rip off the taxi drivers for using their services, they are basically a relay service for us but I opted not to take part I that mostly because of money. \nWhat this means is that I rely on the usual customers instead, which I have acquired over the many years as a cab driver but my phone wasn't ringing that night. \nFinally, at the last hotspot stop I would make before stopping for lunch, I saw somebody looking around with their hands up waving up and down. I figured, they must be hailing a taxi. I stopped next to him, and he jumped in and yelled at me in a British accent to hurry up and follow the red car. Now, normally I wouldn't agree with this, but I wasn't having any luck so far, and I wanted to be able to at least have some extra cash so I didn't have to get dollar menu McDonalds. So I obliged.\nThe red car had just finished making a right turn, and I sped after him so I wouldn't lose him.While I'm on my way, I ask the guy why we were following him. He looks at me, and says \"Don't fookin ask me any questions mate, just catch up to him and I'll tell ya\" or something like that anyways. That bothered me a bit, but I figured that it must have been his girlfriend which had just gotten in an argument or something and he was probably still pissed off. I caught up to the car, and when I was about 3 car lengths away from the red car, the British guy tells me to slow down, and not get any closer. That's when I started to think this guy was up to no good. I told him that I wouldn't drive him any further until he told me what was going on. His response was \"Fookin yankee, let me the fook out then\" He gets out, and yells \"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?\" so I tell him, \"I need about... tree fiddy\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363833841", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -9, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "One day, a boy was out walking, his pet parrot on his shoulder, and a blue push-mower trailing behind him, its newly-sharpened blades motionless as it was pulled backwards. It was a beautiful, green-feathered parrot that would occasionally jerk its head this way and that to see better. The boy came up to a large building, made mostly of brick, with many windows and three garages, each with four cars. He walked up to the door, an intricately-carved masterpiece of metal, wood, plastic, and marble, and reached for the ornate door-knocker. The door-knocker was solid bronze, and in the shape of a lion's head holding a ring. As he swung the knocker forward, it made a loud \"clack\" on the door. The boy waited, standing in his new button-down shirt and tie, idly inspecting the bushes near the walkway; each bush was perfectly green and trimmed to near perfection in the image of various animals: a pouncing wolf, a crouching tiger, a mermaid, basking on a green rock-shaped bush, and a breathtaking, enormous shrub clipped into the image of a chimaera, with its roaring heads of dragon, goat, and lion. Meanwhile, the boy's parrot ruffled its verdant feathers and twitched its head around, occasionally shifting its stance on the boy's shoulder for balance. Eventually, an old man dressed in a blue suit and black tie answered the door. Smiling kindly towards the young lad, the man casually put his hands in his empty jacket pockets and said to him, \"hello, young man. Is there something you wish to ask me?\" The boy's face turns pensive for a moment, before looking back up at the man with a large, beaming smile. \"Yes, sir. I wanted to know, could I mow your lawn please?\" The man let out a soft chuckle that involuntarily shook his torso up and down. He replied nicely \"of course, lad. I remember when I was your age, just starting out in the world. Lawn-mowing, what an enduring profession.\" The boy thanks the man again, and sets out on the lawn, dutifully pushing his mechanical machine around in a distinct pattern: a straight line out, then turn in a tight semi-circle, then return on a slightly-offset parallel line, to ensure that no patch of grass was missed. All the while, the boy's parrot would hop between his shoulder and the handle of the mower, occasionally emitting a whistle or imitating human speech. A few hours later, the boy approaches the door again, knocking a second time. The \"clack\" seems to reverberate around the front of the house. After a much shorter wait, the old man opens the door for the boy, wallet in hand. \"So,\" he asks, \"how much do I owe you?\" The boy smiles sheepishly before pointing to his parrot, who responded, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well, it was about at that time the old man noticed that the parrot was actually eight stories tall, and a crustacean from the Paleozoic Era. He screams with fury \"GODDAMN MONSTA! I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU  NO TREE-FIDDY!\" and slams the door, leaving the parrot to swim away through the grass.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363918849", "subreddit": "Jokes", "score": 25, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I knew my ex since we were kids.  I know it's a complete cliche, but I fell head-over-heels for him when I was 16.  All of my friends and family supported us, and we kept our relationship going through college.  Long distance was tough, but we'd talk almost every night and have sexy skype times on the weekend.  I ignored little things that didn't seem important then.  For example, he never talked about plans with friends but he sometimes missed calls because he was \"busy\".  Also, I don't consider myself materialistic, but I was hurt when he didn't buy me presents for my b-day or Christmas - he always claimed he was \"out of cash\".  Of course, he always managed to win me over with some gesture or another.  \n\n\nWe got through the rough patches though - I still believed he was my knight-in-shining-armor.  So much so that after graduation I turned down a job offer in Austin because he ended up taking a job in Dallas.  We moved there and I had to take up shifts at a local restaurant while hunting for a decent job.  There were times when I felt things weren't clicking exactly - god, how naive I was - but I brushed them off, as we were planning a December wedding. \n\n\nThe wedding went off without a hitch.  He seemed loving and totally devoted to me, and the number of times he was unexpectedly late had diminished.  And just when I thought *we made it*, things came to a head during our honeymoon.  I had always wanted to go to the UK, so we had planned a 10 day tour for our honeymoon.  He made a lot of calls before our trip - very suspicious in hindsight, as he wouldn't tell me who he was calling - but at the time, I foolishly thought he was planning a surprise for me.  Yeah, well what a surprise it was.  \n\n\nAbout halfway through our trip he said he wasn't feeling well - maybe it was the fish - but that I should go visit Urquart castle anyway because we already paid for the tour.  I loved him - *actually LOVED him* - for being \"selfless\" and letting me explore the castle instead of watching him puke.  He knows that I've never been able to be around sick people.  So off I went, happy that my husband loved me enough to give me independence.  Except the tour ended early, and when I got back to our room he wasn't there.  I checked in with reception, and they said they saw him leave with a woman *they assumed was his wife* two hours ago.  \n\n\nI think I went into shock, because I don't remember how I got from reception to my room, or what I did to pass the time.  All I remember is hearing his card swipe outside the door and his footsteps in the hall.  \"Kara...\"  He said my name, and I knew from his tone that he knew the jig was up.  Just hearing his voice filled me with a bubbling rage, and I stood up to go smack him.  He spoke again: \"Kara, please, let me say something first.\"  I was ready to slap him, but a tiny, foolish bit of hope in me told me to stay my hand, that maybe he had an explanation for all of this.  And then he said, \"Can I have tree fiddy?\"  It was about that time that I noticed he was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1363920041", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1607, "controversiality": 0}

I peered through the crack in the stall door at the scene going on before me, \"Give me your purse.\"\n\nThe woman obeyed, shaking as she did so. I tried to remain as silent as possible while dialing 911 on my phone. As anyone who has ever been in a mall bathroom will know, I did not have cell phone signal. To my horror, the man pulls a gun out of his pocket.\n\nThe woman started shrieking, \"Please don't shoot me!

{"body": "I go to University, and my student ID allows me to use the bus for free, so I used to use it all the time when I wanted to get around town because it was free.  No gas, no insurance, no car payments, and all it cost was a little bit of extra time, something I had an abundance of.  \n\nBeing naive and stupid at the time I figured that it wouldn't be that weird if I rode the bus at night, surely all those stories they tell about crazy people on the bus aren't true for *my* city.  Oh ho ho, I was wrong.  I was so very, very wrong.\n\nAbout a month after school started up and I was a freshman I was riding the bus downtown at about nine o'clock.  I can't remember what it was for, I think I was heading to the public library to pick up some research material for some professor who was insisting that we do not use the internet for any of our references.\n\nThe bus itself was pretty much what you'd expect for public transportation.  Uncomfortable plastic seats, the stale odor of vomit clinging to the air, and the smell of degeneration.  I thought it was rather cultural.  I was also an idiot.  As we were approaching the library, two stops away and maybe 15 minutes of actual travel time, we picked up a group of 'people', and I use that term very loosely in this context.  They were an incredibly ragged assortment of what I assumed to be vagrants.  From deep within their tattered clothes and ragged beards they produced bus fair and took seats.  \n\nI gave them the benefit of the doubt.  If they can afford the bus, they're probably alright, right?  Ho man, that always gives me a good laugh, remembering that I actually thought that.  That was when I realized that the one who had taken a seat next to me, an older gentleman (Hah!) with a beard down to his ankles, reeked of poop.  Not just poop, but seriously diseased poop.  This is what poop would smell like if it was weaponized.  My eyes were watering, and I could feel myself salivating in preparation for a good hurl.  I did my best to try and ignore him, but that's when I heard it.  I heard a wet farting sound, and to my dismay, I could feel something warm on my hand, which I had, in my idiocy, left on the bench we were sitting on.\n\nLooking down in horror, I realized that this...creature had shit itself through its pants and it was leaking onto the bunch.  I puked.  Raucous laughter from his friends ensued as I stood up so that he wouldn't ruin *my* pants too.  Pooplord stood up with a shit eating grin on his face, sniggering.  When I say shit eating, I mean it in the most literal terms possible.  His breath was absolutely foul.  I will never forget what he said next for the rest of my life.  \"Can I have three dollars and fifty cents for the bus fare home?\"  It was about that time I realized that pooplord was actually several stories tall and a reptile from the paleolithic era.  Or, that's what I wish I could say, because the nightmare did not end here.\n\nHe grasped my shit-stained hand and said \"It's been a real pleasure meeting you son,\" he shook my dripping hand and I wretched again.  \"Hope to see you around.\"\n\nThe bus driver had caught on to what happened, so he pulled over and kicked these freaks off, called for a bus change, and was apologizing profusely.  Apparently this was not the first time this had happened.  I went across the street while we were waiting for a new bus and washed my hands for about a decade in the McDonalds.\n\nSince then, I haven't ridden any form of public transportation, and buses always make me a little sick.\n\n**tl;dr: Bought a car after meeting the pooplord on public transpo**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363961575", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 346, "controversiality": 0}

Friend of a friend and i hit it off, mess around discuss life, love, politics, and past events( this is important), of our lives. She was just amazing, If i had to describe my perfect partner this girl would be it. \n\nThe similarities between us are a bit insane. If i told her i used to steal cars, she would be like me too! i mean that's an exaggeration but that's how similar our pasts where. \n\nwell, back to the story, one of my friends is trying to drive drunk we tell him not to, she tells him about how she lost a boyfriend due to a drunk driving incident, and i told my friend about how i had lost a very good friend to one as well. and convince him to stay put for a while longer. A few minutes later her and I decide we are going to go on a walk to the store and buy some more cigarettes and leave my friends and mutual friend at her place. Somewhere along the walk she realizes that my friend can just take off with us not there, i told her that our mutual friend wouldnt let him, and that if he did he knows i would cause him severe bodily discomfort the next day. She elaborates more on her incident, she later let slip that she served time in jail (but not for what). We get back, everyone is still there and she is relieved. She takes me to her room we have our fun, and everyone went home when they sobered up but me. \n\nWe get up a a few hours later and she starts doing something on her computer, i see she is having difficulties and offer my assistance,    this is when she notices a tattoo on my arm and asks in a horrified voice \"what does your tattoo say!?\" \n\nI was a little taken back by her the way she asked but her voice and demeanor went back to normal as soon as she realized the way she asked the question ( i thought maybe she just didn't like tattoos) and i told her \n\"My tattoo says 'blankity blank blank' (redacted for privacy) its for my friend. . . yada yada yada (brief explanation not too in depth i just met the girl)\"\ni didnt mention the xx-xx-19xx  through xx-xx-20xx part of it, which i realized was the only visible part because my sleeve covered the rest, when i got home. \n\nwe part ways, she tells me i should call her sometime, i agree.\n\nI get home get to bed to because sleep always eludes me the first time i share a bed with a new girl. \n\nHours go buy i wake up and i am about to call her to see if she wanted to meet up again ( it was still my weekend, i really liked her, and i knew that my work schedule and her school schedule wouldn't allow us to meet till the following weekend, which i didn't exactly want to wait for) as i scroll through my contacts i find her name and realize this name is really familiar to me. . . . it was the god damn lockness monster wanting tree fiddy again and none of that shit happened!!\n\nno not really though i wish, that shit did happen and the name sounded familiar because she was the driver when my friend passed away. She was his girl friend that i had not yet met at the time of the incident. i realized the reason she was surprised when she saw my tattoo on my arm instantly, i call one of my friends and ask her \" hey do you remember the name of ______'s gf, you know the one that was driving\"\n\n           \"no i dont, she was just a dumb slut, why do you ask?\"\n\n     \"was it ________?\"\n  \n          \"yea that was the sluts name!\"\n \n     \"god fucking damnit!\" and i hang up\n\nas you could tell none of us really had any sympathy for her and most of us blame/d her to some extent because of the way she and her other passengers handled the situation.      \n\n(holy crap this is way longer than i thought it would be sorry guys)\n\nso yea, long story short after that i talked myself out of the hate and resentment i had for all those years, and went on a few dates with her. luckily i did not say the first shit that came to mind when i first found out who she was or those dates would have definitely not happened. but i am very reluctant to take things any further because this is kept a secret from a bunch of close friends who still blame her. there is no reasoning with these friends, i would be forever shunned over a girl who thing might not even work out with. its off putting, disheartening, and my life felt like a shitty written movie the next day or so of me finding out who she was. idk. all i know is that she is stuck on my mind. and idk what to do about it, or if i even like her all that much or just have a morbid fascination with knowing she is part of the reason one of my closest friends is no longer here.

Every tuesday I ate the same meal in the same seat, and today was the 30th year of this. I still didn't know what mystery meat was. BUT TODAY I WOULD.  \n\nI went and got my meal, 3.50 was the cost just like every tuesday. I brought my own water so I wouldn't spend as much.  I ate my lunch, all  but one bite. ONE SMALL BITE. of mystery meat.  I stuck it in the plastic bag labeled \"test subject.\" I returned to my lab, where it was dark and dark. I worked alone, no one ever came in. I haven't had a visitor in 30 years, except for the rat which i called \"Sir cheezington of high hole in the wall.\"\n\nI had perfected it, I have to far crossed the molucles of my pen and pencil. I still call it a pencil, but it writes in pencil and has no eraser.  I would cross cheezington and this mystery meat to finally find out what it is. My heart was racing, this was the first time I had crossed living things. I shakenly put the meat in the first container labeled \"1\" and the rat in container \"Two\". \n\n....I was ready, I through the switch... Which turned on my computer. I then had to restart my computer because windows decided to update. It seems this happens when I try to do something important. I waited, and i waited, and then it stopped updated and said it will restart my computer.  The homescreen booted, it was a picture or me and cheezington with the words \"BFFFFFFF4LYFE\" in pink comic sans. I opened the program and it begun.  \n\n..The machine hummed like a humming bird or sorts and cheezington began to change.  His neck grew, long like a long neck dinosaur.  his back arched. his feet changed into flippers, and this tail grew scalely. but his head. his head stayed as a rat.  THIS WAS WHEN I REALIZED. HE was a loch ness monster. The mystery meat I had been buying for tree fiddy was loch ness monster meat.  I was satisfied, i now knew. I knew two things. I like loch ness monster meat, and cheezington was actually a girl.

While working in the copy center I had a customer come in asking for some copies made over the counter.\n\n I was closing the area by myself that night and had all of my machines working at the time, so I told her it would be about 20 minutes before I would be able to do it myself but offered to show her how to work the self-service machine, which would not only be quicker but less expensive. I walked her over to one of the machines and did one of her copies myself as I explained how the machine worked and how she would want to place the originals to make sure they came out to her liking. After I asked her if she had any questions, which she didn't so I went back to working on my various projects. \n\nYet of course, since we're having the story in this thread, of course it doesn't end there. I hear through my copiers running this woman snapping her fingers for me like the retail servant he believed I was. I came over a little irked and it was just a mess; dozens of papers wrongly copied with mistakes I specifically went over with her as if she had become helen keller when I was ten feet around that copier as she must not have heard or seen anything I had done. I once again calmly go over how to do what she wants again, making sure with each step that she understands what to do, and once she understands I go back to my projects. \n\nNow to preface the rest of the story, to use the self-serve copier you need to use a credit or debit card, and you are generally responsible for any and all prints that come out during your session unless it's an issue such as a machine jam. Five minutes later she is standing at my counter, snapping again (urgh) asking \"What am I gonna do 'bout these?\" slamming down the stack of mismade copies. I explain to her the policy, which is why I had shown her exactly how to do what he needed. Of course she wants nothing to do with this (over about 4$ worth of copies) and scatters the scrapped ones behind my counter and storms off to one of my managers, and had the best thing ever happen. \n\nAs this customer goes to speak with the manager about the situation, he (who is hands down the best manager when it comes to these types of situations) then proceeds to tell her that \"because it's a credit card transaction and its separate from our registers that he cant re-credit the card, but give me one minute I'll go grab my wallet and reimburse you.\" and immediately this bitch goes from all huffy to suddenly realizing how much of a dick she's acting like. \"how much were the copies ma'am?\" \n\n\"bout tree fiddy\" \n\nMy manager then begins to freak out as well.\n\"God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain’t gonna give you no tree fiddy.\" Then proceeds to force the 15 ton mythical creature out the door as I'm picking up copies. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363978880", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I used to work at an upscale jewelry store in Atlanta. We had some pretty rich clients come in regularly, but one woman, who I knew only as Vanessa, was over the top. At least once every two weeks she'd come in and buy a new pair of earrings (I'm talking $500-1000 earrings, sometimes more) and pay for them with her card like it was nothing. She'd then saunter out and leave in her Range Rover. \n\nFor a while, I didn't particularly have anything against her, but I got the sense that she was a bit of a snob. This was confirmed one day when we had a homeless man come to panhandle outside our store. I had just noticed him and was about to go politely ask him to leave when Vanessa pulled up in her Range Rover, rolled down the window, and spat at him through her botoxed up lips.\n\nNeedless to say, I was appalled. The homeless man walked away sullenly, and I was too shocked to really do anything about it (in retrospect, I really regret refusing her service, but since she was a regular my manager would have flipped a shit if I was rude to her).\n\nAnyways, after spitting at the homeless man, Vanessa walked into the store, and grabs a new pair of earrings. She came up to the counter to swipe her card, and to my absolute delight it was declined. She was furious. After making me swipe her card at least 8 more times (in every different direction and orientation possible) she demanded that she be allowed to buy the earrings on credit with the store. I apologized and told her that this was strictly against policy, but she kept getting angrier and angrier until her face was the same colour as her liberally applied lipstick. \n\nFinally, after her yelling had scared out the other customers in the store,  our manager came out of the back to try to reason with her. To his credit, he handled it quite well, and she eventually stopped screaming. Still, though, she was really insistent on taking the earrings with her, and since we made several thousand dolars from this woman monthly, the manager was patient enough to talk her out of getting her credit card rewards and find some other way of paying.\n\nWhen this woman was digging through her purse, she actually pulled out several hundred dollars, almost enough to pay for the earrings. Oblivious to the pointless struggle she had just put up, she looked up smiling and asked \"Could you please just lend me the money to buy these? I'm not some lying hobo, I'll pay it back.\"\n\nMy manager wearily replied \"Alright, then, how much do you think you'll need?\"\n\nVanessa looked down at the earrings in her hand, back up at us, and replied \"I'mma need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nAt this point I realized that this rich white woman was really a giant monster from the paleolithic era! \"Goddamnit Loch Ness monster I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" my manager shouted. Vanessa hunched over in shame and squeezed through the door of our shop, never to be seen again.\n\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1364049010", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 699, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied.\n\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\n\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\n\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.\n\nThey were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.\n\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\n\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\n\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\n\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her.

So we go in and immediately it felt like something crazy was about to happen. It was dark inside except for some neon and strobes that were lit up, and the DJ was playing this really wierd trance/techno music. So we have a seat in the corner and we order a couple of Hurricanes and start perusing around the place looking for talent...and there were women everywhere....hot ones....some half naked. There was a group of four women dancing together in a circle, and I looked, and out of the group came the absolute most gorgeous female I had ever seen in my life. She was wearing a skin tight black dress, with long blonde hair and spiked heels, and onviously she had been on MDMA because she was rubbing up on the other women in her group and gyrating, her hair soaked in sweat and sticking to her neck in a sexy kind of way. So my buddy and I were staring uncontrollably at this point and I guess the ladies could tell, because they starting staring back...and blondie looked me right in the eyes and licked her lips...then gave me the \"come here\" motion with her finger.\n\nSo we think \"fuck it....lets go introduce ourselves and see what is what\". So we walk over and the music is loud and bumping, and all four of the females surround us in a circle and start grinding up on us, and I mean grinding. The blonde is rubbing her backside all against my happy spot, and she could tell that I was getting excited...all I was thinking was \"hell yes\". Then she starts licking my neck and kissing my ears...and before I know it she takes me by the hand and starts pulling me into a back room in the club. She pushes me into a chair, pulls down her top and starts rubbing my hands on her tits. Before I know it she is running her hands up and down my thighs, in between my legs...and before long she is rubbing on my cock...that was now hard as a rock and almost ripping out of my pants. Then the craziest shit happened.....she proceeds to straddle me and dry humping me and moaning ...and I mean loud.....and then she grabbed me by both of my ears and pulled me close and she said \"If you are gonna fuck me big boy, you are gonna have to give me what I want...........tree fiddy\".....and thats when I realized this bitch wont no sexy lady...she was a giant fuck monster from the paleolithic age...and I threw her off my dick and yelled \"Hell no monster I aint giving you no goddamn three fiddy!!\" ....and I ran straight for the exit door.

{"body": "I remember once my father told me \"Women are inferior and don't deserve equal rights\" I thought it was great advice. I really loved my father. He was a great man, even if he was addicted to alcohol. Sometimes he would come home and I knew he was bad. He'd hit my mother and yell at me. But there were times when he wasn't bad, and those were the times I loved him the most. I remember once he took me fishing with him. He taught me how to properly handle the worms and put them on the hook. We went out in the middle of the lake on a small boat and sat there for hours, waiting. He caught three big fish and I ended up catching the tiniest little one that you could fit in the palm of your hand. It was so small, but he was happy anyway. He patted my head and told me how proud he was, and I was so happy.\nAbout a week later he came home late, drunk. Another bad day at work. He slapped my mother around and called her a bitch, and I watched from my room, scared out of my mind. He was getting bad again. He tugged at her hair and punched her against the wall as she cried and begged him to stop, and I started crying too. I was too loud, and he noticed me. He came at me, yelling at me about how I was an ungrateful little shit and how I was a drain on his wallet, and he had to put up with working so hard just for me. He picked me up by my hair and slammed me against the wall and I sobbed even harder and kept apologizing, even though I didn't know what for. My mother came at him from behind, wet with tears, her hair sticking to her cheeks. She pulled at him uselessly, trying to get him to stop. He got angry and threw her against the wall and left the house, and me and my mother held each other and cried for a couple of hours.\nI still loved him. I knew it wasn't his fault. It was the alcohol, and he was nice when he wasn't drunk. The next day he came in looking sad. He sat down next to me and hugged me, and started crying. I just sat there, not sure what to do. I'd never seen him cry before. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, sobbing. \"It's okay,\" I said. \"No! It's not okay!\" he said, crying even harder, and suddenly I started crying as well. My mother stood in the doorway, covering her mouth, sobbing. \"I won't drink again! I'll never drink again I promise!\" I just . . . I need you to do something for me.\" I wiped the tears from my eyes and looked at him. \"What? What do you need?\" He choked back a few more tears, as if what he was gonna say was really hurting him. \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was at this point I realized my father was actually eight stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damn loch ness monster had gotten me again! \"Goddamnit monstah! I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" I screamed, as he swam away. My mother gave him a dollar.

He would rarely show up in class ( not a big deal it was a class of about 70) but when he did show up he would always distract others around him. He would always do ridiculous shit. One day he showed 40 minutes late and when he was walking forwards a seat grabbed another student and shoved his face in his ass and ripped one. I got really mad but the kid played it off as a practical joke and the other kid just shrugged it off as that too. He also would follow me around outside of class ( at least I think so because I always \"ran into him\" at stores ). One day I was at a Starbucks, sitting down on my laptop and noticed him in line. He was denied service because his credit card was declined and he was absolutely furious. He decided to come up to me and demand I hand over money. Because I'm a pretty nice guy and try and do at least one nice thing a day, I just decided I would give him the money for my nice deed.

So, we decided to drive to her house.\n\nFrom where we were, it was about an hour drive. It was dark, and we didn't really know the highway that well. So, we're driving around listening to metal. My best friend was into this band called Arch Enemy. I thought, \"Holy shit this dude can scream\" and he says \"That's a girl...\" I was shocked!\n\nAnyway, we're driving around, both of us are headbanging. Everytime my head would go down in a headbang, so would my foot. Well, all of a sudden I see something every 16 year old dreads to see in the rear view mirror - flashing red and blue lights. I pull over thinking that its for someone else like a real emergency. Nope! Its for me. The highway patrol asks to see my license and insurance, so I provide both. I explain that I wasn't aware how fast I was going, or that I was in a work zone. Surprisingly, he let me go.\n\nSo, we get back on the highway. Drive a bit further down the road and get a call from our friend asking where we were. We explain that we were on our way, we got pulled over. She says to hurry up.\n\nWe get to her town, pull into her driveway, and she comes out of her house crying her eyes out. She starts explaining something horrible to us...

{"body": "I had been dating my boyfriend, Sean, at the time for about 5 years when a close friend of ours, named Chris, attempted suicide.  About a week after he was released from the hospital I had the following dream:\n\nThe dream began in the midst of a house party.  It was late in the night and both Sean and Chris had been drinking.  The house was still packed and the music was loud enough that you had to lean in, cheeks touching, to anyone you wanted to talk to.  Sean was downstairs with a few other friends and Chris approached me saying that he had been feeling under the weather.  \n\nWe squeezed through the throngs of people gathered throughout the winding layout of the house until we found a bathroom.  Chris sat on the tub rim and I ransacked the cabinets for a washcloth.  After soaking it in cool water, I dabbed at his brow and offered him a cup of water.  He was clearly still shaken up about his recent suicide attempt and started talking about life and his struggles, especially that of being alone.  I was trying to comfort him and it took me off guard when he leaned forward and kissed me.  I stopped him, taken aback, and he just said, \"Fine\" and left the room.\n\nIt took me a moment to get my thoughts together and I immediately went back out in search of my boyfriend.  I found him where we had left him, and leaned in, explaining what had just happened.  More worried about his state of mind than anything, we started looking for Chris.  We hit every room in the house, but couldn't find him anywhere. Thinking he may have gone out for some fresh air, we pushed past the crowds and out the front door.\n\nOnce outside, it was eerily dark.  A kind of shadowed, blue/black that you only see in movies.  We walked down the pathways, along the neighborhood's streets, calling Chris' name into the darkness.\n\nI was about 15 feet ahead of Sean when I heard him quietly say \"hey....man\".  I turned to see Chris walking slowly through the grass, completely shadowed by another house. As dark as the night had seemed, the shadow that covered Chris was absolutely haunting.  At first, all I could make out was his tear stained face. \n\nI saw the glimmer of the gun too late.  \n\nBefore I had time to even take a step, Sean caught a bullet to the chest and Chris collapsed into the grass, having put one in his  own mouth immediately after.  \n\nEverything slowed like in a movie, time seemed to audibly tick, second by second, with my mind racing, but the moment dragging by.  I was devastated, knowing immediately that Chris was gone, and watching the man I loved crumple to the ground.  It seemed like my legs wouldnt run fast enough, but I finally reached Sean and held him as he began to fade.  I watched his eyes gloss over, our tears mingling on his face as he gurgled for air.  I asked him if there was anything he needed and he quietly muttered, \"...about tree fiddy\"\n\nI realized then that the dying man in my arms was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. It was that gosh damn Loch Ness monster again.  I told him I wasn't going to give him no \"tree fiddy\" and he pulled himself up and slid away, leaving a dark, bloody trail in the grass behind him.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364113826", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh man, my chance to shine!\n\nWhen I was addicted to opiates, I met this kid, let's call him Theodore. Theodore had all the good connects for the right prices, and I would go through him every day, picking up various pharmaceuticals. There was one thing that seemed a little off about him, though: he would never let me inside his house. I would just call him and tell him I was out front, he would open the door and just step outside really quick. This went on for about a month, and then I met his brother, who we'll call Josh. The day I met Josh is the day the rest of this story transpired\n\nSo, I meet Josh, and he seems normal, if a little bit lonely. The first time I noticed anything was off about him was when I left to go grab some money for some oxy from his brother. He literally teared up, gave me a hug, and made me promise to return. A little weird, but if he's that lonely, it wouldn't kill me to give him some company. Little did I know that that very well might have happened later that night.\n\nFast forward about two hours: we have been hanging out at this park in our neighborhood (just me and Josh) and Josh is so excited to have made a new friend he wants to introduce me to his whole family. It is at this point that I should mention that this kid almost definitely schizophrenic. He would get this weird little smile on his face, and after questioning him about why he was smiling, our conversation went a little like this:\nMe: \"Why are you smiling?\"\nJosh:\"The Sky Goddess is talking to me again!\"\nI don't really know what to say, so I just ask what she's saying.\nJosh: \"If you can't hear her, then you can't know. She says only the chosen can hear her words.\"\nMe: \"Oh, well you must be very lucky to be a chosen one\".\n\nAt this point, I am kind of uncomfortable so I just want to go, but he INSISTS I go meet his parents. Off we go to his house, me just wanting this to end so I can go home. We walk up to his house, everything seems normal. Before we step inside, he says one thing. \"Don't be scared, they won't hurt you.\" Okay, maybe he's hallucinating or something, I don't know, but he opens the door.\n\nI step inside, and I am IMMEDIATELY FUCKING TERRIFIED. There are dolls, just...everywhere. Staring lifelessly at me from their thrones on the tables, on the floor, on the shelves on the wall. He starts talking to them as if in a conversation. \"Hey guys, yeah, we had a lot of fun! We've just been sitting at the park hanging out, meet my new friend!\" He introduces me to EVERY. FUCKING. DOLL. Over thirty of them. After the very unsettling introductions, he calls to his parents, who come in, say a brief hello, and leave us alone. Josh takes me to his room, a very nondescript, boring looking room, just a bed, a dresser, and a window. Upon a second glance, however, I notice handle on the wall. It wasn't protruding, it was IN the wall, almost as if there was a secret room behind it. So we sit in his room, talking for about five minutes, and I decide to ask what's in the room. A dark look crosses his face \"Only the chosen can enter that room. You cannot know.\" So, I kinda sit there for a second and just bring up something else to talk about, when his dad angrily calls for him. \"JOSH! GET THE FUCK DOWN HERE!\" Josh tells me not to move, and goes to his dad.\n\nImmediately, I hear something break. I hear Josh crying, and the sound of a dull pounding...I then realized the cries were in rhythm with the pounding. Holy shit! Josh is getting the shit kicked out of him by his dad! What the fuck do I do! I sit there, not knowing what to do, just listening to this kid crying out for help from his doll friends. It broke my heart, hearing this kid cry out to these dolls knowing they were imaginary and could do nothing for him.\n\nSoon, the crying stops, and about 30 minutes have passed without a sound. The whole time it has been silent, my curiosity has been growing, I want to know what's in that secret room. I just didn't gather the courage yet because I was sure Josh would come back in soon. But after so much time has elapsed, I decide to go for it. I walk stealthily over to the handle, look towards the door Josh would come in from to make sure it's clear, and extend my hand for the handle. As my fingers grasp it, I notice the doorknob turning, and in comes Josh. He sees what I'm doing, and starts FREAKING THE FUCK OUT. He's screaming, cursing, throwing any objects around him at the walls.\n\nI ask him what I can do to make this okay again. \"What do you want from me?\" He says \" About tree fiddy.\" It was at this point I realized he was actually a three story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364149805", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 14, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "One of my good mates is very religious, and I'm an atheist, one day he invites me over for the weekend with another friend of ours. We're at the dinner table, and before hand I told my mate that I have no problem saying grace, amen and the rest of the prayers as long as I don't have to lead it. So a few minutes after casually talking with his parents and getting along quite nicely, his Dad begins holding hands with the people next to him, initiating grace. Now there were about 15 people at the table, all very religious relatives of my friend, except for me and one of my other friends who was invited over who was also an atheist. Everyone bows their heads and suddenly his Dad says my name and tells me to lead the prayer. His Dad doesn't just kindly ask me if I wanted to lead the prayer, he demands it. I try to weasel out of it but he forces me to, even though he knew my feelings towards religion. About this time my face flashes red and I feel so awkward. I proceeded to say a very short and typical prayer \"Thank you Lord for this delicious food we are about to eat, amen\". Everyone says amen and lifts their heads and I find his Dad just staring at me with a blank face. I give the occasional glance to my atheist friend who noticed and he gives me a \"wtf face\", I then look over at my religious friend who is happily eating like everyone else. His Dad isn't just staring at me while eating and acting normally, he hasn't even touched his food and has been staring at me for a good 2 minutes along with not moving at all as everyone else ate and chatted happily. I excuse myself to go to the bathroom to get away from this awkward situation and think about what I might have done/said wrong or what I could do to get his Dad to stop staring at me. As I exit the bathroom after a few minutes I find his Dad waiting right outside with one ear on the door as well as holding a mobile phone uptothe door as if he was recording. I open it, he stares at me and then walks back to the dinner table. His Dad acted normally for the rest of the night and everyone else acted like nothing had happened until around 3 in the morning, a couple hours after we all had gone to sleep in his living room. I wake up to a faint noise sort of like the static sound you get on TVs. I sit up from my sleeping bag and see right in the middle of the doorway his Dad staring at me with his phone in his hand. His Dad slowly walks toward me and slowly gets this massive grin on his face. He gets right up to me and I'm frozen with shock, like sleep-paralysis but I was sitting upright. His Dad leans down and whispers in my ear menacingly, \"Can I have three-fiddy\", it was about that time that I realised his father was 8 stories tall and actually a crustacean from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364178046", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "There was this one teacher who was just an absolute asshole. He'd constantly put down students who weren't sports stars. He felt that if you weren't part of a sports team then you were a waste of space. He would often give the stars at the school extra time for their assignments and grade them more leniently. \n\n\n\nAnyway, one day after turning in a project that absolutely HAD to be turned in that day according to him, my friends and I had absolutely had it with his shit. One student had a family emergency and couldn't give the teacher her project that day, but he handed her a paper with a big, red zero. Who comes waltzing in late to class? One of the star players at the school. He doesn't have his project, but that asshole of a teacher gives him an extension on it. \n\n\n\nMy friends and I decide to make the next class a living hell for this teacher. We replaced all of his dry-erase markers with permanent markers, replaced his computer's background with a some dinosaur giving him the middle finger (this was not my doing, I don't know why they chose this picture). We hung his sports-themed bobblehead from the ceiling via noose. We ended this by drawing a big, red zero on his desk.\n\n\nThe following day, he is 5 minutes late to class as usual. My friends and I are sitting, anxiously waiting for what is about to unfold. (everyone had noticed the bobblehead by this point.) The teacher walks in, sees the bobblehead and says under his breath, \"that's real mature, you little shits.\" He takes the bobblehead down and goes to his desk and sees the zero we left him. At this point he wants to know who the smart-ass is. No one says anything and he states that class will be held for longer than normal unless someone tells him who defaced his desk. \n\n\n\nHe starts up his computer and walks to his whiteboard. After writing some definitions down, he goes to erase some. He realizes that it won't erase and he is just furious. He starts yelling at us and demand to know who did it. He looks to the girl he gave the zero to and tells her to go see the principal. Not wanting someone else to take the blame, we all came clean and he told us to get out and that we would have detention for a very long time.

{"body": "Heh, are you serious about that? Funny story actually. I'm currently leading a small indie game studio and a few years back, when we were only a few people, and after having mainly been working with Flash games and apps, we figured it could be a nice change of pace to make exactly something like this. We were all avid Metroid players as kids and everybody agreed it could be fun to have something a bit different going on, so after getting the appropriate permissions from Nintendo (including of course stuff like not being able to distribute it commercially), we decided to devote a (short) day of the week to this project and started working on it on Fridays before hitting the pubs. It really did set the mood for that perfectly. :) So anyway, as we come along, we realized that our small studio was lacking (seriously) art-wise and advertised an opening for a 2D game artist. Of course we immediately got a tonne of responses from applicants around the city but there was this guy, his name was Alan as far as I rememeber, who blew away all competition, after showing us this (animated!) remastered renditions of Metroid Zero Mission, very much like the one OP posted. I quickly decided that this guy was simply perfect for the job, as well as a big asset for our everyday projects, assuming that he was able to work proficiently. So, we had him in for a short test run, and he got to show us how he would usually work over the course of an hour. Not only was he extremely efficient but he was also the nicest and calmest guy you could imagine. Moreover, our relaxed workspace, nice folks, in a bright hall with tall ceilings in an office building in the middle of London seemed to fit him just perfectly as well, so I figured we could easily figure out a deal. I take him in to my office and as we were discussing salaries I asked him what he could see him self earning, to which he simply said that all he needed was about tree fiddy. Well it was about this time that I realized that Alan was four stories tall and from the Mesozoic age.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364240184", "subreddit": "Metroid", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Thanks for you replies, I really do appreciate them. I don't know if your first statement was meant to be sarcastic, but I just finished the course \"Programming Languages\" on Coursera. \n\nIt wasn't, you're actually much further along than you made me think with your comment about interfaces. \n\nFor the record, the point of using interfaces is so you can decouple the implementation from the interface - let's say you have an ErathostenesSieve class that generates prime numbers using the Sieve of Erathostenes, and you use it to generate primes all over your code base. Then, at some point, you find out that one of the components of your system generates prime numbers as a by-product of normal operation (unlikely, but bear with me.) If you used an interface called PrimeNumberGenerator, you just have to make your component implement it, while if you directly used the ErathostenesSieve class, you're in for a LOT of rewriting.\n\nAnother example: I had a small hash table with an index made out of an ordered array, at some point the hash table grew so I made the index a hash table itself. (This was a *very* weird use case and I'm skipping a lot of context, don't actually do this IRL.) The previous coder had made the ordered list implicit in the code, it didn't actually exist as a class but was there with calls to sort() and binarysearch() over a subset of the memory space used by the hash table. I had to extract that list out of the code, make it a separate class, make it implement an interface and write another class that would implement this interface. Then, I wrote benchmarks that instantiated two of the big hash tables but with different indexing strategies, and tested their performances against one another. That wouldn't have been possible without an interface, or at least an abstract base class.\n\n&gt;Although, I hated functional programming initially, I eventually warmed up to it.\n\nFunctional programming really taints you. If you start doing a lot of it you'll find it really hard to go back to mutable, imperative, object-oriented programming. That's because there's an entire class of hard problems that don't exist in functional programming, and most sane functional languages provide a fall-back imperative way of doing things for things that functional programming can't do nicely.\n\n&gt;However, I really don't see how huge projects could be effectively written with it.\n\nThe secret of big project software engineering in a functional paradigm is the actor model. Basically, you define a bunch of messages, and you define \"actors\" that message each other stuff. It sounds similar to object orientation (replace messages with method calls) but it's very different in practice. It's really nice because it allows you to decouple each part of the system, and only reason about a very small space at a time. It also gives you basically free concurrency while preserving the thread safety of functional programming.\n\nI'm going to \"start\" with Java. What that means is truly learn OO design with Java, and then move on to another language if necessary.\n\nI highly encourage you to bid your time in OOP, and Java's a fine language to hone your skills. Should you get interested in the actor model, I suggest trying Scala's event-based actor library. Scala is basically an OOP language based off Java that adds some functional goodies like type inference, union types, etc. It's got some very nice and intuitive features that are present in only a few or no other languages like traits (the bastard child of interfaces and abstract classes), hygienic macros (code that rewrites itself), and of course the actor model.\n\nI personally work with F# a lot, it's possibly the closest language to Scala except that it runs on .NET and has a few different pros and cons.\n\nYou could ignore my advice and spend the next twenty year working strictly on Java, C# and C++ code bases and you wouldn't be less happy or fulfilled, but remember that a programmer is nothing without his tools, and knowing more tools enables you to face vastly more problems. My company's CEO chose F# to run on a networked embedded system; that sounds like a counter-intuitive choice, but he's been right at every turn, and we've managed to reach commercial expectations no one else thought were credible; the two people most responsible for this have seen their careers fast-tracked,  both are less than two years out of university and manage people with significantly more years of experience than them.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364257326", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, I suppose the best way to start is with background.\n\nI was born blind, carried on throughout life not being able to see. At 24, just last year, I was approached by a specialist who told me that he could give me robotic replacements.\n\nI can't go into too much detail, but the procedure was paid for by a University and I was basically a Guinea Pig.\n\nThe buildup was intense, my entire family was extremely excited for me. I remembered being wheeled into the OR, and then nothing.\n\nI woke up and the eyes were not yet active. After regaining full consciousness and allowing some healing, we proceeded. The doctor activated the eyeballs, and I had a complete and total brain explosion.\n\nI couldn't process all the information and I wound up passing out. Slowly, we tried to wean it into me. I began to experience such a bizarre and complex world. I had obviously heard of the concept of \"seeing\", but experiencing it was so alien. I put pictures to the sound, despite not knowing what a picture even was.\n\nIt started out what I now know to be \"pixelated\". I spent a good few months adjusting. Finally, my mind began to make sense of things. I no longer saw a void of shadows and strange visions of color. I saw forms, patterns. I associated things with my hearing.\n\nJust a few months ago, I finally progressed beyond pixels. I see much better. I have colors, I can see well enough to type and read!\n\nAnd art! Oh, do I love art! From everything I'd heard, people described art as \"hipster\" and \"pretentious\". I can't imagine how someone can think things like that, even about the most bizarre arts. Being able to convey such odd things through color and shapes and everything... It still puts me at a loss of words.\n\nI specifically remember my first experience with a television. I had listened to it before, but this was the first time I had *watched* it! Specifically, we tuned into my favorite program - Histories! \n\nI loved listening to the immense details on the universe, humanity, wars, peace, everything! I remember the first thing I saw on a television was a story on waters. It was simply beautiful. I remember the announcer describing immense beauty beforehand, but being able to see it was totally new. As I sat there in wonder, the announcer plainly asked his audience, \"can i get tree fiddy?\"\n\nIt was then that I realized that my TV was actually about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

Finally, she sat me down and explained to me that my sister had lied to me and that I had the whole thing backwards. I couldn't comprehend which was which and ended up calling both downstairs for the longest time. \n\nA couple of years later I still had a habit of either getting them mixed up or just calling them both downstairs.

However, there was one time that I brought a cute girl down camping with me. We'd kind of had a thing for a while and were really taking the next step spending the night together. She was absolutely beautiful, a solid 9, 9 and a 1/2, but she was kind of timid and scared a little too easily.\n\nWhen we were out in our group at the bonfire telling stories, the \"I see something in the lake!\" story came up like usual. She started glancing over towards the water and swore she saw something herself. I kind of laughed I myself but not out loud because I didn't want to embarrass her.\n\nAnyway, the night proceeded as usual and we ended up in my tent together. It was pretty warm and we were all snuggled up to each other, both of us pretty happy I think. We started kissing and slowly things heated up and we started taking off each other's clothes. I was starting to get nervous because Id never had sex before and neither had she, I was terribly afraid I was going to mess things up. Things kept going and going, and I was getting really nervous now and stalling before we really started the act. \n\nFinally I told her \"Wait a minute\" and she said \"What's wrong?\" \n\"Nothing,\" I told her, \"Im just a little nervous... Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?\"\n\"Yes I am, I want this more than anything... But there is one thing Im going to need you to do\"\nNow at this point I didn't know what she was going to say. A condom, maybe? I had one, but I hadn't told her because it hadn't been an issue yet. Maybe she wasn't a virgin... I really wasn't sure what she was going to say, but I was still really excited that she wanted me.\n\n\"What do you need babe?\" I asked as cool and calm as I could manage\n\nShe said, \"Im gonna need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was about this time I realized this girl was 8 stories tall and a monster from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "I have to say, this is an interpretation, and I think it doesn't show the whole story.  \n\nFrance was heavily nationalistic at this point in time following the \"roaring twenties\" and then Léon Blum's term in office (a moderate leftist prime minister).  There was also a large (ongoing) anti-Semitic movement.  I've read before that if Germany had not begun the Holocaust, France would have.  (I personally wouldn't take it nearly that far, but national sentiment was leaning in this direction.)  \n\nThe point of Vichy is that when the Germans invaded, the nationalists in France pushed really hard to have their own sort of autonomy and were willing to give up a lot for it.  Fortunately for them, they didn't have to give up much.\n\nRemember how I said France was heavily nationalistic?  The people being sent to Germany from France (in instances like the Vélodrome d'hiver) were mostly Eastern-European immigrant Jews.  The fact is, 90% of French Jews survived the war (I'll look for this source when I get home).  This is because Vichy actually had quite a bit of autonomy (unlike what night-hawks has suggested), and met Nazi requests in a way that met their own needs.  \n\nI actually detest the way you describe the roundup of vel d'hive, and I highly recommend the film \"La Rafle\" (in English, The Roundup) which is an incredible film about the event (not 100% accurate, as with any historical film, but they give the facts at the end).  French police were responsible for the round-up, NOT Germans as night-hawks writes.  The French were the ones going into immigrant neighborhoods and taking entire families to the velodrome (and later shipping them to French concentration camps before they were sent to Germany).  \n\nAlso, \"There's a disconnect between the image and reality of occupation here: the image of a moral, Catholic France whose values line up with Nazi Germany, and the reality of a France whose resources are being steadily sapped by the Germans.\" &gt;&gt; WHAT?? Catholics in France were absolutely NOT sharing values with Nazi Germany? Check out Témoignage Chrétien, Esprit (unfortunately stopped publishing for much of the war but resumed after), other catholic journals that opposed Nazi crimes and occupation. This is just flat out false.\n\nFrankly, the French had their own Gestapo, when resistance fighters were caught they were tortured and executed by the French, not the Germans generally, and when the war ended many people involved in the Vichy government lost their legion d'honneur and whatnot.  \n\nIt is THIS-- that France actually retained so much autonomy and so willingly collaborated-- and not the \"unequal partnership\" that made France so unique in Germany's occupation.  (Keep in mind that Germany only occupied certain parts of the country-- many people from the north escaped to Vichy and collaborated from there.)  \n\nI want to bring up also that there is, as always, disagreement about how willing the collaboration was.  A lot of people say 90% of French jews would not have survived had France not collaborated, and it was all part of the plan.  Others, like myself obviously, say nationalism took the opportunity and actually tried to benefit from the situation.  French people involved in the Vichy government obviously take the former position whereas French socialist intellectuals at the time took the latter.  \n\nSome reading on these subjects, and more: Journal d'Helene Berr, **the Vichy Syndrome (Rousso), Vichy's afterlife (Golsan)** &lt;&lt; these are incredibly books and kind of outline what I am talking about; and obviously I think you should watch some films: The Roundup, Army of Shadows (about the resistance), life and nothing but (life in paris under occupation)\n\nAlso, if you want this information from people who actually lived through it and had even more criticisms than I do for the concept that Vichy was just meeting German demands, authors like Vidal-Naquet, JP Sartre, de Beauvoir, Camus, and certain journals like Temoignage Chretien wrote about this either as it was happening or following the war. \n\nPlease, OP, don't get the idea that France was just muscled into this position, they absolutely collaborated in a way that benefitted them and  did not simply watch Germans commit crimes-- they too actively participated. Everything about this post hurts, and I'm disappointed to see it at the top of the comment thread. I haven't read Marianne in Chains but if it's a credible book at all then I can't imagine it made the French seem passive in the action. Seriously, this post got my blood boiling.  Sometimes it seems to be going in the right direction, then I'm slapped with claims like the French were \"stunned\" to see the Germans round up Jews. Please, do some of your own research and don't just take the commenter's word on it (or mine for that matter!).\n\nEdit: As [/u/herecomesnessie](http://www.reddit.com/user/herecomesnessie) points out below, around 75% of French Jews (not 90%) are believed to have survived the Holocaust.

{"body": "&gt;Could we find a large unknown ape who has left some plausible evidence of it's existence? Yeah.\n\nThose apes you are referring to, the Bili apes, turned out to be chimpanzees of the already known sub-species Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii. Notably, they were found in the Congo, a place where there are many other chimpanzee populations.\n\nAs far as new species of monkeys being discovered, I am sure you can recognize the difference between discovering new species of monkeys that no one was explicitly looking for, and few people were even looking for incidentally, and new species of megafauna that many people think exists, and who have spent huge amounts of resources trying to locate and prove exists.\n\n&gt;I agree most never existed, but I'm not going to throw a named species in there. We have found fossils of giant apes resembling a potential precursor to 'bigfoot' that lived side by side with man.\n\nRegarding fossils, I'm not questioning the prior existence of Gigantopithecus here. I am questioning the basis for believing in their continued existence given no substantial evidence supporting that belief. I mean, I would look at you a bit askance if you argued there are still stegosaurus running around on the basis of stegosaurus fossils and large unexplored sections of the Amazon, or even that there are still woolly mammoths running around based on the fact that they co-existed with humans until relatively recently. Fossils are evidence that a thing existed *at one distant point in time*, not that they exist now.\n\n&gt; We have found modern, unidentified footprints and some would say hair and scat as well that returns unknown DNA. \n\nThat evidence has been consistently debunked. I guess you and I might have very different ideas about what constitutes plausible evidence, and indeed our disagreement may hinge on that very fact. I just find questionable footprints and unidentified scat and hair (most of the time these samples *are* proved to be from another species) to be very unconvincing in the same way that I find crop-circles and photos of the Loch Ness Monster unconvincing. Employing occam's razor, the most plausible explanation is that this \"evidence\" originates from various hoaxes, and indeed in the majority of cases this has been not just suspected, but proven to be so. Since we know this to be the case most of the time, and have no definitive evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that more recent evidence is similarly faked barring proof to the contrary.\n\n&gt;As for drawing the line - don't. I don't want your lines, they stop thought. \n\nI get the point you are making, and there is certainly legitimacy behind it (all discoveries are of course of something that wasn't previously known to exist) but I also think there is a line, even if it is blurry. The logic you are using is essentially the same logic used to justify belief in magic, religion, alien UFO's and a whole host of other \"phenomena\" that people waste enormous amounts of resources pursuing. Now, perhaps those things are worth pursuing entirely independent of their reality. I could see the virtue in that type of argument. But to pursue those things on the basis of expecting them to pay concrete dividends doesn't make sense to me. The distinction for me is drawn between things that one pursues because there is evidence *suggesting* a things existence, as opposed to evidence of one thing showing the mere *possibility* of another thing. What you have presented is a lot of evidence indicating the possibility of bigfoot by way of some other provable fact (the large size of forests in the Pacific Northwest), but no real convincing evidence of bigfoot itself. But, we could just as easily extend this argument to *anything* of a certain size existing in the Pacific Northwest, as the argument is fully transferable. \n\nThe problem with your inference is that large forests are not known or even theorized to correlate with or cause bigfoot, so inferring a bigfoot from a large forest is not a sensible proposition. Rather, you are merely saying that a large forest does not *exclude* the possibility of a bigfoot, therefore we must take this possibility seriously. I think that is a logical leap. The inability to definitively exclude a possibility is not reason to treat the possibility as a real probability, otherwise everything possible would have to be treated as *probable*, which is nonsensical.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364358259", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

I did a little more reading on Paleolithic era after seeing your comment (see quote below) and was interested to see that given how long the paleolithic era lasted and the varied landscapes in which people lived, people's diets varied greatly. \n\n&gt;The Paleolithic was an extended period of time, during which multiple technological advances were made, many of which had impact on human dietary structure. For example, it is almost undisputed[by whom?] (with only a few scholars adopting the divergent view[who?]) that, for much of the Paleolithic, humans did not possess the control of fire, or tools necessary to engage in extensive fishing. On the other hand, both these technologies are generally agreed to have been widely available to humans by the end of the Paleolithic (consequently, allowing humans in some regions of the planet to rely heavily on fishing and hunting). In addition, the Paleolithic involved a substantial geographical expansion of human populations. During the Lower Paleolithic, ancestors of modern humans are thought to have been constrained to Africa east of the Great Rift Valley. During the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, humans greatly expanded their area of settlement, reaching ecosystems as diverse as New Guinea and Alaska, and adapting their diets to whatever local resources available.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364411754", "subreddit": "JoeRogan", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was about 9 years old I moved into a new house, it wasn't anything fancy or modern. This house was old though, and everyone had strange feelings about it, we thought it was all fine and dandy and really appreciated the \"ageness\" of it. Right off the bat things seemed strange to me. Not really anything happening, just felt off. I would wake up in the middle of the night or suddenly feel very cold or hot, I just attributed it to the drafts or something like that. But carry I'll on, about a week into living there I was playing in the back yard, nothing special, just pretending to have a war with those tiny little army men, using a lighter to melt them (which seems a bit strange now) like they got wounded in a brush with war. Suddenly I looked back for a reason I can't explain and I thought I saw something run into the shed, well at least the door was in the final moments of closing just as I looked over. I was obviously scared and ran inside and pretended nothing happened. \n\n\nLater in the week I was walking home from school (I was fortunate enough to only have to walk about 20 minutes back and forth so my mom would still let me walk alone). I heard screaming and laughing coming from my backyard, it sounded like my mom and brother were playing some stupid game and she was just messing with him. So I go into the front door and there is a note saying she has just gone to get some food for dinner, and my brother wasn't home from work as he had detention (I later found out), but I didn't know this and went walking around looking for him, he wasn't upstairs and suddenly a lightbulb went off in my head, and I remembered the noises \"maybe he had a girl over or something?\". I ran outside and the shed was open and the stuff on the side was scattered all over the place, my brother no where to be found and me scared shitless of the shed I left it alone and ran to my room to play with my gameboy until my mom got home. She saw what happened out back and snapped and I was then grounded for a week and had to clean and do extra chores. I was pissed right the fuck off.\n\n\nThat same night I felt another cold draft and I swear I could see my breath, I was sure my house was haunted, it woke me up and it was 3:50 am and I heard more giggling and laughing of an old woman, I thought this was strange as my mom is a heavy sleeper and is never up this late, I also heard a deep growl coming from down the stairs outside my room, I got all scared but had to find out. I walked outside my room, loaded with pajamas and my plastic extendable light saber, and ran down the stairs, tripped, hit my head (still have a scar to this day) and saw big (huuuuge) feet, which were hairy and I could swear they were scaley, from under the door (it was one of those old ones that didn't fit all that well but was good enough, there was about 4 inches between the bottom of the door and the floor), it scared me so bad I ran into my room and cried for about an hour before falling asleep. \n\n\nThis waking up at ten to 4 every morning happened almost every night at it's peaks, but at best was about 2 nights between. I was so scared the ghost would come for me in my sleep.\n\n\nI knew it had to do with the shed but I was way too damn scared to go in there. But I had to man up so I devised a little contraption with my remote control car and one of those bulky cameras taped to it (before them smart phones, lucky kids), I thought it was genius, like in Home Alone or another kids movie. It worked brilliantly. I saw everything, from axes to chainsaws, to a lawnmower and rakes. No Ghosts or anything else as I suspected. But just as I turned the car to leave A long nailed hand, like a claw, grabbed the edge of the door frame and I quickly whipped it around and... Nothing. Lost it again. Damn.\n\n\nI had to know, so I swallowed my fears and I woke up at 3:45 am to go down those stairs and into that shed (I chose this time because I kept waking up at 3:50 am for no apparent reason all cold and scared), I went down those stairs and was outfront my shed by 3:47 with a flashlight and my light saber. I did not open the door just yet, I waited until exactly 3:50 when I opened it...\n\n\nThis was about the time I noticed this ghost was about 500 feet tall and from the palentological era and all he had to say was \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy..\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364417520", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

As it's lab leaders are quite good, but in hindsight it's a very very intensive camp and requires you put in a lot of effort. Great reward though.\nLastly is SDI the camp leaders there are also amazing but the leader also goes around asking everyone the same question, \"Could I have treefiddy\"? And I finally realized on the last day of camp that this guy had a neck 12' long, was 3.5 million years old and from the Paleolithic Era. I said, \"Damn you Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\" I then got up and finally left camp.

{"body": "So back when I was about sixteen,  I ended up going with a friend of mine to this monumentally huge party. Had some drinks, and started talking with this super hot girl.

I almost lost it when she leaned in close to my ear, and whispered in the most seductive voice: \"I need about tree fiddy\".

{"body": "This one's a doozy, so take a seat.\n\nIt was a Friday afternoon in december about four or five years ago.  I think I was a freshman in college or a senior in high school, it doesn't really matter.  What does matter is that I couldn't really do it at home because I live in a small house with several siblings.  The walls, no matter how paperthin, aren't the problem.  The problem is that there is literally no privacy.  The shower would be the only time I *could* if I wanted to, but to keep the heating bill down our mother would only give us seven minutes in the shower.  Just enough time to wash up, not enough time for a wank.  Other than that, it was impossible to be in a room alone in that house for more than five minutes, and while some of you weirdos might only need five minutes I prefer to actually take the time to do the job right.  I don't just masturbate, I make love to myself.  Ha ha, man that sounded gay.\n\nAnyways, this particular Friday I had been feeling pretty pent up.  There was a cute girl in my algebra class I'd had my eye on for weeks.  Shocking as it is, I was not nearly as outgoing and outspoken as I am now, and I looked like an utter slob.  I had no money to spend on clothes, hair gel, etc.  The parents would not allow me to get a job, and I couldn't exactly buy nice clothes off of dirt and pocket lint, so I wasn't really the type to ask anyone out.  I lacked confidence, as did a lot of teenagers my age.  Why was this day different?  Well, we'd just finished a group quiz and I'd been doing my best to break down all the problems for her.  By the time it was over she felt like she'd actually learned something (She did too, got a B on the test for the chapter) and was giddy with excitement over finally understanding something.  Some of that giddiness was directed at me, and teenage, hormone frenzied me got to thinking some pretty dirty thoughts that would not get out of my head. \n\n I decided it was time to fix that.\n\nI hopped on my bike and went for a nice stroll down to the local church.  Why the church?  Well, a number of reasons.  At the time, I thought that a little bit of exhibitionism would be fun but I wasn't going to be too risky.  The church was always open, but almost always empty save for maybe a clerk or a priest or something.  I was a super edgy atheist, and the thought of \"Sticking it to God\" was sounding like fun too.  Essentially, I was young and stupid.  That's really what it boils down to.  So I get over there, panting and sweaty, and I head inside and into the main hall of the church where mass is held.  I surveyed the room looking for a place to get down to business and figured hey, what the hell, the confessional box would be a lot of fun.\n\nI climbed inside and got down to business.  I'm not going to go into any great detail, because despite this place being NSFW I'd really rather not explain the nitty gritty.  Suffice it to say I was enjoying it enough where I was being a little noisier than usual.  This was probably a mistake, because the father got into the other side of the confessional box and said \"You've come to confess your sins, A_Mirror\".  I just about died.  He must have seen me come in, or recognized my bike. I biked a fair amount around town and I'd seen the father a few times and said hi.  I might not be a believer, but I'm at least respectful to him.  I was a few strokes away from orgasm at that point, but that killed the mood pretty quick.  I didn't really say anything, I kinda squeeked an agreement and he said back to me \"Your parents are going to hear about this, this kind of behavior is unacceptable.\"  That scared me back to my senses and I fucking begged him not to tell them.  I would never hear the end of it, I'd do anything, etc etc.  So he leans close to the window and says \"Well, there is one thing you could give me.\"  I was scared as hell because I thought for sure he was going to want me to have sex with him or something, but he just said \"three dollars and fifty cents\".  It was about that time I realized the father was fifty something stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  So I told him \"God damn it, father, I ain't got no three fiddy for you.\"  I kicked open the door to the confessional booth and made a run for the doors.  It wasn't exactly hard to escape, mind you, as old dinosaurs in priestly garments don't exactly run particularly fast.\n\nI was lucky though.  My parents never heard about it, probably because the priest was too scared I'd reveal his secret to the community if he told them, so it worked out sorta well in the end.\n\nI'd do it again if I could, I'd probably just try and be more subtle approaching the damn church.\n\n**tl;dr: read it, fuck you**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364503267", "subreddit": "ploungeafterdark", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My favorite guild name Naga Stole My Bike, a throwback to a really old internet joke that I think originated on YTMND.  There's also the old classic Rogues Do It From Behind.\n\nI've had quite a few WHOA moments, almost exclusively from the first couple years of WoW Vanilla.  I'll give you a couple.\n\n1.  The first time I wall-walked into the Pre-Cata Mount Hyjal and saw the enormous skeleton of Archimonde hanging onto the World Tree my mouth dropped open and I got goosebumps.  It was such an incredible rush to see fully completed content that was never meant for players to see (and was ultimately never released), knowing that at any time a GM could notice where I was and the ban rod could slam down on me.  Hyjal was the first of many wall-walking adventures in Vanilla, including the Outlands under the Deadmines, ZG long before release, unfinished CoT when it was still a rumor, the Karazhan Crypts, Old Ironforge, The Emerald Dream, Nessie's tank is the Deeprun Tram, The Ruins of Lorderon above the Undercity, AQ before the gate was opened, and so much more!  [Bonus story: I don't know if this exists in the version of Hyjal in game now, but in Vanilla there was a deceptively deep pool of water below the world tree.  Like, really freaking deep.  So deep that to get to the bottom would take nearly 5 minutes of swimming:  impossible unless you were a warlock or had the water breathing buff from the Hydrocane (staff from Gnomer).  So I brought a lock buddy to Hyjal, we swam down the bottom, invited random people from IF, summoned them, and watched them get halfway to the surface before they drowned and were forced to use the spirit healer in Winterspring.  Good times.)\n\n2.  UBRS run back when UBRS took 15 people and potentially hours and hours to complete.  I was MT in our guild which was currently hitting a wall in our Molten Core progression due to a lack of FR gear.  We kill Gyth, and the Chromatic Carapace dropped.  I nearly shat myself with joy when I beat 3 other warriors for the roll.  I already had the abomination stitchings and brilliant chromatic scales from countless Strat UD and UBRS runs and a couple weeks of militantly scouring EPL for Blood of Heroes later, I became the first person on our server to assemble the mighty Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight, which gave me enough of a power boost to help the guild break the wall we were butted up against in MC. \n\nThere are many others, such as logging to see Doom Lord Kazzak tearing through SW after being kited there by the Horde, or being in IF during the disease outbreak that killed almost the entire server (disease from Hakkar in ZG that unintentionally escaped the instance and spread like wildfire due to it's unique mechanics).

I offered her a cup of water, (sterile - be it), but she declined. She kept talking about her love for mountain dew. I'm an avid mountain dew lover myself, so I felt a pretty tight bond between us. I told her the ED doesn't have mountain dew, but perhaps after she left the hospital she could pick up a bottle.\n\nShe says no, I'm REALLY thirsty, I don't think just a bottle would do... perhaps a 12-pack so I'll have plenty for later. I agreed that this was a good course of action, but she seemed disappointed. After asking what's wrong for a few minutes, she said she didn't have the money to buy a twelve pack of mountain dew. I said okay, I'll slide you some cash, but don't mention it, as it may be frowned upon, just to make her feel special, like I'd gone out of my way for her. Our hidden little secret.

We were pretty excited, as we were going on a tour all day and were ready to explore them.\n\nSo the day we get there, we were surprised how close to the cabins we were staying in the caves were, so as any naive group of kids would do, we ventured into these caves, by ourselves, at about 3 in the afternoon. At first it was fine, the caves always being lit by residual light from outside, but slowly, as we got further in, it inevitably got darker. \n\nUnfortunately, when we were ready to leave, we had been in the caves by ourselves for so long that it was dark and the sun was all but down, so we we had residual light 3 hours ago, it was dark, making us unbelievably disoriented. Without warning, I heard my friend, let's call him Dan, scream in pain. On the ground, with only the light from our phones, we gathered Dan had broken his leg when he didn't see a little ledge to walk down .\n\nSo with him on the ground, I was nominated to attempt to find my way back to the cabins to get help. All my friends were talking figuring out ways to keep his leg elevated and safe, I had to figure out what I was going to do. After mapping out roughly where we were in my head, I went over and asked them if there was anything I was forgetting, or that they needed. Dan at this point, through his pain filled daze looked up and said something I'll never forget:\n\n\"Yeah, theholesdamnshow, I really need something soon, or I might not make it back.\"\n\n\"Yeah man, whatever you need, you're the one in tons of pain, whatever you want.

I was 7 years old and very hyperactive). \n\nSo I get on the website, and low and behold, there it is. The new Ed, Edd and Eddy board-balance game that I'd been so excited for all week. So I get it up and it starts loading. If you never tried to play flash games on dial up, I'll tell you one thing: They take forever to load.\n\nSo it starts to load, and 20 minutes in, it's going fine, about 20% of the game had loaded and I was looking forward to playing the game. Then, suddenly, the phone rings, and, to my disdain, my mother answers it. She tells me to disconnect from the internet, which I do with remorse. So, with puzzlement, I ask my mother who it was, and she answers back \"a telemarketer\". A fucking telemarketer sets me back half an hour to play my new game.\n\nSo, after my mother went back to bed, I rebooted up the dial-up, and I gave it a second go. An hour in, and it was just over 50% in. Little theholesdamnshow was getting excited. Then, my father wakes up, and informs me he is to make a business call. So, after a minor spat, allow my father to make his business call. After it is complete, we get to 6:30, two and a half hours after I woke up.\n\nSo after starting up again, and getting 90% in, over 2 hours in (my internet slowed down a ton in the middle for some reason), my mother walked in after waking up. So I say to her:\n\n\"Do you need anything mom\"\n\n\"Yeah actually theholesdamnshow, there is\" she responded\n\n\"What is it mom?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized my mother was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

My \"Drug Use\" is. Ive never taken illicit drugs,  I drink a bit but stay away from drugs because of my past with deppression. That didnt stop the cops from taking me simply because i was the closest to the entrance at the time and I looked the part (Dressed in a singlet, Phat pants and a moderate amount of Kandi)\n\nThey had turned up to the warehouse in an attempt to crack down on the scene after the increase of drug use, there were even reports of Heroin going around though i never saw that personally, and i have to say i completely agree with their motives. Just not their actions. \n\nAnyone who has experience with drugs can tell you that freaking out someone tripping is not a good idea. There was a lot of LSD going around at this particular event and 20 cop cars and 5 paddy wagons showing up was not welcomed. I think someone literally shat their pants. I was taken straight away and jumbled into a wagon along with a few others. After about 15 minutes the car started up and we where taken to the local police station and i was separated from the rest of the group ( I didnt really know anyone else that i was taken with)\n\nI was scared out of my mind, but knew there was nothing that they could pin me with. Unless they tried to plant something on me, i tried to check my pockets (Handcuffs didnt make it easy) But as far as i could tell i only had my wallet and phone in there.\n\nA copper comes in and talks to me for a while, asking a few questions about who was there, what was going around, if i knew any dealers. And then he changed tack, asking me what i was on, why i wasnt cooperating and if i wanted to spend the next few years behind bars for possesion.\n\nI looked him dead in the eye and asked \"What the hell am i in here for, and how do i get out\"\n\nIt didnt go down to well.

Just because somebody believes in tarot cards does not make them crazy--it makes them deluded and incapable of determining reality from fantasy.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, you are completely closed to any idea of a God or higher power.\n\nOn the other hand, no I'm not.  I am completely, 100%, totally open to the idea of a God or a higher power.  All you have to do is present a single shred of evidence for why any sane person would ever do so.  In the past 10,000 years of society, as long as there have been humans worshipping gods, there has not yet been produced a single shred of tangible evidence for a single one of them.  Given how long people have been worshipping gods, and the complete and total lack of evidence, and how readily humans can be deceived by the own minds, I find the stance of, \"Every single belief in a deity, from the origin of mankind up until the present day, has been completely and totally an irrational belief,\" to be infinitely more likely than, \"There exist magical beings external to the universe which control every aspect of the universe.\"\n\n&gt;I don't consider myself Christian anymore, but I always felt that if I completely rejected the IDEA that there could be a higher power that I would be just as closed-minded as many of the Christians that I have met. \n\nAgain, I'm not closed-minded.  They can present a single shred of evidence, and I'll quit thinking that they're all completely and totally deluded.  (Although, I'll still think they're critical thinking skills are flawed--they would have been correct but only by using unsound methods.) The same holds true for people who believe in ghosts, tarot cards, unicorns, and homeopathy.\n\n&gt;I don't see scientific evidence of a God, but I do see things I can't explain all the time.\n\nSo?  Seeing things that you can't explain is not any sort of good reason to believe that there is an all-knowing all-seeing all-powering magical force that exists external to the universe which controls the universe!  How the hell do you even make that connection?  It's crazy-talk.\n\n&gt;I just think that there is not enough known about the world or universe to completely discount the idea of one.\n\nDo you think that we don't know enough about the world or the universe to completely discount the ideas of the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, Leprechauns, Unicorns, the Easter Bunny, or Santa Claus?

Most of such comments were removed by the moderators. \n\nIf you actually go into /r/Christianity you'll find the users do accept valid criticisms quite often. In fact, a large portion of the users of the subreddit are atheists who try to offer alternative viewpoints to Christianity and religion in general. When they disagree with Christians in a valid and polite manner, they are most often met with respect. Those that do otherwise are usually censored. You can see the same in /r/debatereligion. \n\nSo it wasn't that they were disagreeing, but that some were doing so rudely, and more than that, there were users who were vote brigading (to no surprise I'm sure). So that was the problem. \n\n&gt;To me those threads seem far worse\n\nHow so? Again, the quote you shared is by a user who is pointing out a *reason* why some people hate atheists. They are not necessarily saying they agree with the hatred. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364689377", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If you know more or less what the laser's voltage drop is, each diode gives you 0.7v so just divide by 0.7 to get the number of diodes you need.  Grab some out of the parts bin or at Fry's when you get the meter.  Also get some alligator clip leads as well, as they're invaluable for testing things like this.  Word of warning: if the laser diode gets disconnected momentarily (say, test lead slip), it can be destroyed by the driver as it can produce a brief but sufficiently large surge of current when the load is re-connected.

{"body": "Don't trust anyone. \n\nWhen I was about 12 years old I met this girl in my class, Samantha. She was around the same age I was, she had just moved here so she didn't really know anyone in town, and I was a bit of a loner before I met her. We became fairly decent friends over the course of that year, and we spent almost every day together over that summer. \n\nShe never knew her father, and she had been taken away from her mother due to drug problems. She lived with her grandma in a small apartment not too far from my house. I would ride my bike all the way over there and we would meet up, take off and be gone together for hours. Sometimes we went to my house and hung out in my tree fort, and sometimes we would just go out into the field behind her apartment complex and lay in the grass talking for what seemed like forever. We spent a lot of time at the lake that summer. She was my first kiss, and my first love, and I was hers. \n\nWe ended up going to different middle schools because she moved again, but we still stayed in touch. We talked on the phone all the time, and my dad would give me rides to her new apartment sometimes so we could see each other. We had \"sleepovers\" some weekends, and we would zip our sleeping bags together, or keep them both open so she could slide over and get close to me in the middle of the night. We were in love. Or what I would call puppy love, knowing what I know now...\n\nWhen we were in high school, we didn't see each other as much any more. Not only because we went to different high schools, but because we fell in with our own, very different, groups of friends. My clique was into video games and Magic: The Gathering, and her friends were into some other, much less forgiving things. Though I didn't know it at the time, she started drinking and using drugs. On the rare occasions we did see each other, she acted like nothing had changed, and we fell back into the type of friendship we used to have. I would ask her all about her life, school, friends, etc. and she just made up stories that she thought I would want to hear. She lied about everything. She lied about her grades, her friends, her drugs... She lied about how she felt about me... She let me believe everything was perfect, and that we would go off to college together and get married and blah blah... Turns out that never happened. \n\nOne day, on what would have been the 5 year anniversary of our first kiss, I planned to surprise her at her house when she got home from school. When I got there, I saw something that changed everything. And I was more mad at myself for not seeing it earlier than I was at her for deceiving me. At this point, I realized she was actually a 3 story tall monster from the Paleolithic era. And when she saw me, you know what she had to say? \"I need about tree fiddy...\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364710082", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Dead people. The colder and paler the better. It's best when they have a wound or something because they look more dead. I just want to fuck the shit out of every lifeless body i see. There was this one time I was in med school. I'm fascinated with dead bodies so i had my sights set on doing autopsies in a crime lab. It was my first year there and I was in the morgue with a bunch of other students. We were watching an instructor do an autopsy. I just loved watching him take the scalpel and slice a clean Y shape in his midsection. You could see all the ribs and organs and shit inside. I continually got more and more turned on as he showed us how to check for possible causes of death by feeling the organs and checking the ribs. Eventually after he was done, he showed us how to sew the body back up. The professor and everyone else started filing out of the lab after the class was over. I stayed behind for a short while and gave the TA a hand putting the body back in the freezer. The TA was waling out of the door when i told him i left my bag behind the table. So he left and i walked back to the freezer and opened up a few, looking at the cold lifeless bodies. I eventually came across a gorgeous blonde girl, her papers said she was 22. She was skinny, had a beautiful face, and amazing long hair. I rolled her out of the freezer and looked her over. Her breasts weren't very big, but they still felt squishy and cool. It was 8 oclock so i didn't have to worry about anyone else coming is because the classes that were held in the lab ended at 8. I rolled the body out onto the floor to examine it further. I removed the cloth covering her and felt her smooth skin. My hand wandered to her pussy. It was cold. but still a bit damp. I poked and prodded at it for a while. I tasted my fingers. It was cold, but it tasted like any other girls. I made sure the doors were locked and lowered the body to the floor. I went to the attached office and found some hand lotion on the desk. When i got back to the body i slowly started unzipping my pants and feeling myself. The girl was so hot. ten times as much because she was dead. I kneeled down to inspect her further. I caressed her face with my hand, It was almost like i could see her mouth moving. Then i realized that it actually was. I was in shock. I assumed it was her nerves acting up being out of the freezer until i leaned down next to her mouth and listened to the slight sound escaping her lips. I listened closely and barley made out  \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\". It was at about that time that I realized that this girl was about five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era. \n\n[](/seriouslyjuice)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364742913", "subreddit": "ploungeafterdark", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}
