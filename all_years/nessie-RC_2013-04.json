{"body": "&gt; My question to you, is why you DO NOT BELIEVE in God (Gods)? \n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims of theist unconvincing. Every reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\n\n&gt; Though science can not prove, nor disprove of any God or Gods\n\nThis is not true, many gods can in fact be dis-proven.\n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364792499", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A lot to cover.  It will take a bit to get to it all, but here is my first stab.\n\n* Who has the burden of proof?\n\nFirst, I think you've set up a false dichotomy.  Patient two comes in with lower back pain and no palpable tumors.  Does he have testicular cancer or not?  Lower back pain associated with testicular cancer is a sign of metastatic spread to the lymph nodes of the abdomen.  So, the doctor could start with a CT scan or an MRI.  Perhaps there would be an exploratory surgery.  But if nothing was found, then what?  Is the onus on the physician to prove that the patient does not have testicular cancer.  No.  The patient has come in with lower back pain.  Evidence.  The burden is upon the physician to determine what is causing the back pain, and there are many things that could cause lower back pain: injury, over use, herniated discs, spinal fractures, pinched nerve, bacterial infections, kidney stones... the list goes on.  To pick one out of the hat is not helpful.  His doctor would likely do a full work-up to determine the cause.\n\nSecond, there is not a symmetrical burden of proof.  If there were, I could ask anyone to prove that there is no tooth fairy, no santa clause, no big foot, no Loch Ness monster, no flying spaghetti monster, no Greek gods, no Egyptian gods... again the list goes on.  First these would be impossible to do.  You can't disprove something, because you could always say, \"well, what if you had done the experiment this way instead.\"  However, no one has shown any credible proof that these things exist.  Thus, in all likelihood, they do not exist.  Based on this lack of evidence we do not believe in the tooth fairy.  That does not take faith.  \n\nThird, and this is nit-picky (but important), you say that if you want to convince me the theism is correct, you must present evidence or argument.  To this I say only evidence will do.  This is not a logical debate for me.  As a scientist, I want data.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364842311", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I know you said \"not stalked\" but it's part of my experience... sorry.\n\nWhen I was a teenager there was a teacher who I used to be obsessed with.  She was in her mid 20's and I lusted after her every day.  Mrs. Scott.  I still remember that Mrs. Scott was around 5'11, single, and she had the most perfect body ever.  Holy hell.  Every single boy in the grade did whatever she said because we all wanted her.\n\nAnyways, my obsession got to the point where I decided I'd begin to stalk her.  Kind of for excitement, but at the same time kind of because I lusted after her.\n\nAfter a month of stalking her here and there I knew a lot about her.  I knew she was single, I knew where she lived, I knew which Starbucks she went to every morning before she came to school, I knew a ton of things about her.\n\nI'm trying to make this kind of short because it's really a long, long story, but I got the dumbest idea ever after about a month of obsessing over her.  I decided I'd try to ask her out at her home after school.\n\nI know, it's a really dumb idea, but at the time it sounded like it'd work and I was obsessed with Mrs. Scott and in my little teenage head it sounded like a good idea.\n\nAnyways, so during school one day I decided to sneak out early and make my way over to Mrs. Scott's house.  I got there about 10 minutes before school ended and it took her 20 minutes or so to get home, so I waited there for around 30 minutes before she finally got home.\n\nShe got out of her car and walked up to her doorstep where I was standing.  I remember she dropped her keys in surprise and said, \"Oh, hello (my name).  What are you doing here?\"\n\nI cringe thinking about it, but I replied, \"Mrs. Scott.  I just want to tell you that I think you're an amazing teacher and I think I have a little crush on you.  I know I'm only your student, but would you like to go on a date sometime?\"\n\nMrs. Scott looked at me for a moment and started to giggle.  She explained to me that we couldn't date because I was her student, but in truth she had a little crush on me too.  We could have sex and stuff, but no one could know.\n\nI couldn't believe it.  She invited me into her house and into her bedroom.  When she walked in the room I kissed her and she kissed back.  Things got pretty heated up and we were about to start stripping each other when she said, \"Wait.\"  \n\nKind of annoyed (because I wanted to make out) I said, \"Yes?\"\n\nShe said, \"I need something before we make love.\"  Kind of confused I said, \"What do you need?\".  \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Mrs. Scott was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That goddamned monster had tricked me again!\n\nI went back to school and acted like nothing had happened.  Mrs. Scott wasn't there anymore unsurprisingly. I don't know where she moved to, but I can only assume she had a lake side home somewhere or something...\n\nNone of the students ever questioned me about it because they didn't know.

{"body": "William December \"Billy Dee\" Williams, Jr. (born April 6, 1937) is an American actor, artist, singer, and writer best known for playing the character of Lando Calrissian in the movies Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.\n\nWilliams was born in New York City, New York, the son of Loretta Anne, a West Indian-born elevator operator from Montserrat, and William December Williams, Sr., an African-American caretaker from Texas. He has a twin sister, Loretta, and grew up in Harlem, where he was raised by his maternal grandmother while his parents worked at several jobs. Williams graduated from the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art in Manhattan, where he was a classmate of Diahann Carroll, who coincidentally played the wife of his character Brady Lloyd on the 1980s prime-time soap opera Dynasty.\n\nHe first appeared on Broadway in 1945 in The Firebrand of Florence. He returned to Broadway as an adult in 1960 in the play version of The Cool Word. He appeared in A Taste of Honey in 1961. A 1976 Broadway production, I Have a Dream, was directed by Robert Greenwald and starred Williams as Martin Luther King, Jr. His most recent Broadway appearance was in August Wilson's Fences, as a replacement for James Earl Jones in the role of Troy Maxson in 1988.\n\nHe made his film debut in 1959 in the Academy Award nominated The Last Angry Man, opposite Paul Muni, in which he portrayed a delinquent young man. He rose to stardom after starring in the critically lauded blockbuster biographical television movie, Brian's Song (1971), in which he played Chicago Bears star football player Gale Sayers, who stood by his friend Brian Piccolo (played by James Caan), during his struggle with terminal cancer. The film became so popular that it was given a theatrical release. Both Williams and Caan were nominated for Emmy Awards for best actor for their performances.\n\nHaving broken through, Williams became one of America's most well-known black film actors of the 1970s, after starring in a string of critically acclaimed and popular movies, many of them in the \"blaxploitation\" genre. In 1972, starred as Billie Holiday's husband Louis McKay in Motown Productions' Holiday biopic Lady Sings the Blues. The film was a box office blockbuster, becoming one of the highest grossing films of the year and received five Academy Award nominations. Diana Ross starred in Lady Sings the Blues opposite Williams; Motown paired the two of them again three years later in the successful follow-up project Mahogany.\n\nThe early 1980s brought Williams the role of Lando Calrissian, which he played in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Calrissian's charm proved to be popular with audiences and Williams now had a substantial fanbase within the science fiction genre as well. He reprised this role when he lent his voice for the character in the 2002 video game Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, as well as the audio dramatization of Dark Empire, the National Public Radio adaptation of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, and two productions for the Star Wars: Battlefront series: Star Wars: Battlefront II and Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron. (However, the appearance in Battlefront II was archive footage and it is unknown whether it was him or another actor in the role of Calrissian in Elite Squadron however he appears through Archive footage for that game's full-motion sequences). Between his appearances in the Star Wars films, he starred alongside Sylvester Stallone as a cop in the critically acclaimed film Nighthawks. He co-starred in 1989's Batman as district attorney Harvey Dent, a role that was planned to develop into Dent's alter-ego, the villain Two-Face, in sequels (including a pay or play contract that would have guaranteed Williams the chance to play Two-Face). Unfortunately for Williams, that never came to pass; he was set to reprise the role in a more villainous light in the sequel Batman Returns, but his character was deleted and replaced with original villain Max Shreck. When Joel Schumacher stepped in to direct Batman Forever, where Two-Face was to be a secondary villain, Schumacher decided to pay Williams' penalty fee to hire Tommy Lee Jones for the part.\n\nWilliams's television work included a recurring guest-starring role on the short-lived show Gideon's Crossing. He has had a brief cameo in the television series Scrubs Season 5, where he plays the godfather of Julie (Mandy Moore). Turk hugs him, calling him \"Lando\", even though he prefers to be called Billy D. He is also well known for his appearance in advertisements for Colt 45 (a brand of malt liquor) in the 1980s and early 1990s, for which he received much criticism. Williams responded indifferently to the criticism of his appearances in the liquor commercials. When questioned about his appearances, he allegedly replied by saying, \"I drink, you drink. Hell, if marijuana was legal, I'd appear in a commercial for it.\"\n\nWilliams was paired with actress Marla Gibbs on three situation comedies: The Jeffersons (Gibbs's character, Florence, had a crush on Williams and challenged him on everything because she thought he was an imposter); 227 (her character, Mary, pretending to be royalty, met Williams at a banquet); and The Hughleys (Gibbs and Williams portrayed Darryl's parents).\n\nIn 1992, he portrayed Berry Gordy in The Jacksons: An American Dream.\n\nIn 1993, Williams had a guest appearance on the spin-off to The Cosby Show, A Different World as Langston Paige, a grumpy landlord.\n\nWilliams made a special guest appearance on the hit sketch comedy show, In Living Color, in 1990. He portrayed Pastor Dan in an episode of That '70s Show. In this episode entitled \"Baby Don't You Do It\" (2004), his character is obsessed with Star Wars, and uses this to help counsel Eric Forman (himself a major Star Wars fan) and Donna Pinciotti about their premarital relationship.\n\nWilliams made a cameo appearance as himself on the television series Lost in the episode \"Exposé\". He also appears regularly on short clips on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! as a semi-parody of himself.\n\nHe played Toussaint Dubois for General Hospital: Night Shift in 2007 and 2008. Williams reprised his role as Toussaint on General Hospital itself beginning in June 2009.\n\nAlso in 2009, he took on the role of the voice of Admiral Bitchface the head of the military on the planet Titan in the Adult Swim animated series Titan Maximum.\n\nIn July 2010, Williams appeared in the animated series The Boondocks, where he voiced a fictionalized version of himself in the episode \"The Story of Lando Freeman\".\n\nWilliams was plagued with financial troubles for many years. The Empire Strikes Back co-star Harrison Ford helped Williams pay off a portion of the debt he owed. In an interview with People magazine, Ford states \" I asked if I could do anything to help, he is my friend after all. He says to me 'I need money,' and I say 'how much?' Then he says 'about tree fiddy' and all of the sudden he transformed into this giant lizard thing and I yelled \"GET THEE HENCE LOCH NESS MONSTER!'\"\n\nPotatoes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364867000", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

The Royal society's motto is \"on nobody's word\"\n\n\"it is mighty funny that over 90% of early scientists who made significant finds and contributions to their respective fields were Christians to begin with.\" Both incorrect and unsurprising that during the reformation occurring in Europe (where christianity was the norm AND had been forced by threat of torture and death) the people working on science had the same predominant faith of the region, just as all those arabic astronomers were Islamic, and many of those greek philosophers believed in the greek gods.\n\n\"This debate is as old as time\" again wrong. Your religion is new compared to many others and religion isn't even as old as humans.\n\n\"will only be settled when God decides to reveal the truth.\" Rather assumes the answer really. Perhaps it will be settled when  the various claims of the followers of said god get demonstrated as false as well as the validity of such a god consistently failing to mesh with reality.\n\n\"Carbon dating has been proven to be erroneous.\" No. Carbon dating is constantly analysed to better understand the uncertainty in readings. There was one shift when the half life was measured with more accuracy, but again here's the point: what is understood adjusts to new information, it does not stick in the mud.\n\n\"Many of the early hominids have been proven to either be hoaxes or not as old as others purported.\" again no. some (an astonishingly low number of thousands of remains) have, such as nebraska man, but this again is science in action: always questioning and seeking the truth.\n\n\"yet the Bible says they did\" The bible never mentions dinosaurs. It mentions leviathans which match the large crocs of the Nile, behemoths which match elephants and unicorns which match rhinos.\n\n\"there are plenty of fossils were man's footprints appear inside of a dinosaur's.\" Yet again incorrect. There have been none. Those found and presented have been consistently demonstrated as fakes OR have had size 45 (UK sizings) feet with a right foot for a left foot and a left foot for a right foot.

{"body": "I've been on the receiving end of this from a student who was clearly trying to improve their grade. I was working in Philadelphia at the time as a substitute teacher for a college history class. Their original teacher had been diagnosed with cancer and was taking the time off to focus on his chemo treatment and spend more time with his family. The whole class had a sombre look to them, you could tell they really looked up to this guy and were sad to know he wouldn't be teaching them anymore so I tried my hardest to keep them interested in the subject and take their minds off their teacher.\n\nIt was going pretty well as I tend to take a more relaxed approach to teaching. We'd do quite a bit of practical assignments, getting students involved and moving and really trying to bring the class to life. A lot of them responded well and managed to stay on target with their grades but there was one girl who just seemed to be struggling and something seemed off about her.\n\nWhen class was dismissed and the students were heading home, she approached me at my desk and said that she wanted to talk to me. I obliged and waited until the rest of the students had left and closed the door behind the last one to leave. I could feel her eyes on me as I did so. I walked back to my desk, sat down and asked her what's up.\n\nHer eyes kind of glanced up and down at me before she answered. \"I know my grades have been dropping.\" she admits. \"I took the news pretty badly about Mr. Roberts (the guy I was subbing for) and I've had trouble focusing since. I was wondering if you could...\" she paused for a second, looking at me deeply in the eyes and smacked her lips softly. \"...help me focus?\" she continued.\n\nI knew what she wanted at this point but it was totally against my ethics. I'd be lying if I said I didn't want it though, she was a pretty girl. She placed both her palms on my desk and leaned over at me. I blanked for a second and didn't really know how to react. I stuttered \"Wh-what do you n-need?\" She leaned ever closer and put her lips next to my ear. She whispered \"I need about tree fiddy...\"\n\nWell it was about that time that I notice that student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. The Loch Ness monster had tricked me again! I said \"Dammit monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I rushed out of the room, got into my car and drove home. I didn't talk about it to anyone.\n\nI turned up for class the next day and she wasn't there anymore. I think I embarrassed the poor girl and she switched classes. Soon after that event, their original teacher got better and came back to teaching and I was on my way to the next teaching job. I'll always remember her though.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364946556", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I had a similar event happen to me:\n\nI've got a three year old girl and I'm not one to take her to the doctor at low grade fevers, especially ones that can be kept under control. However, when she was about 1 she started running a fever one night, nothing too big, keeping steady at about 101. So, I gave her some tylenol and set my alarm to get up and check on her every 4 hours and alternate it with ibuprofin. Right about morning the fever started creeping up and we couldn't keep it under control with medicine so my wife and I decided it would be best to get her to the ER (it was Sunday morning and the pediatrician was closed) by this time her fever had crept up to just under 103 and I was getting alarmed, so while my wife was getting everything packed up and calling in to her weekend job (she's the praise band leader at our church) I decided to draw a cool bath for our daughter to keep her body temp low. I get her out and throw on some loose fitting PJ's for her and grab her a cold bottle of water and I'm walking around with her in the kitchen while my wife is explaining the situation to the pastor, I look up at the time and my daughter lets the bottle fall out of her mouth and grip and drops it. I bend down with her and pick it up and am about to give it back to her and I notice that she has gone limp and just has a glazed look in her eyes. I start saying her name and snapping my fingers in front of her eyes and there's no acknowldegement, just nothing. I flip shit and run her into the room and lay her on the bed and check her breathing and she's breathing but still not responding to anything. I call for my wife who was in the closet getting the bag and she's continuing to talk to our pastor and not acknowldeging my excited attempt to get her attention, so I yell at the top of my lungs \"my wifes name GET OFF THE FUCKING PHONE RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO GO NOW\" so she throws the phone down, and see's her and starts freaking. At this point I know there's an EMS station 3 minutes away, so I grab my phone and call 911. It has been the only time i've had to call 911 in my life and i'm balling talking to the lady standing over my daughters motionless body with her eyes glazed over. I give the lady our address and start telling her what's happened and I walk out of the room and grab my notepad. Anytime our daughter gets sick, even a low grade fever I keep notes on temperatures, demeanor, when medication was given, etc in case I ever need it. I start giving her this information including her height weight race and the recent illnesses she's had hoping that it will help the paramedics when they arrive. The lady on the other end was fantastic, just trying to keep me talking (in the back of my mind I was beginning to see that she was doing everything she could to keep me sane, doing kind of a trauma prevention). She tells me the EMS is seconds away and I get off the phone and walk back in the room and my daughter is sitting up on her own and my wife has a relieved look in her eyes. The paramedics come in and I explain everything and they offer to take a look at my daughter. They take her in the van and take her temp and check her vitals. They say everything looks fine minus the fever and that they could transport her or we could take her. At this point i've calmed down and called both of our parents and let them know what's going on and we decide we'll just drive her to the ER. We sit in the ER for 45 minutes with a kid that is acting perfectly fine (maybe just a little lethargic). My point is, sometimes what you may see as sniffles has something behind it that really warrants an ER visit.\nEpilogue: Doctor diagnosed her after 5 minute eval as having an ear infection, prescribed antibiotics and we went home with meds. 4 hours later we were back at the ER with the EXACT same situation. Second ER doctor concurred with the first and we went home again. Next day we go to pediatrician who says there's NO sign of ear infection and it turns out she had pneumonia.  I asked him how much it would cost for teh antibiotics and he said, \"That'll be about tree fiddy.\"  Well it was about that time I started to notice the pediatrician was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacian from the protozoic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364964749", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 1, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Hello my friend!\n\nI am not going to beg you for your gametime, nor am I going to make self-deprecating jokes about my own virginity. I am going to tell you a story. \n\nThis is the story of a young man named Joe. Joe was a pretty average guy. He came from a middle class family, went to a big public school, and had an average job in retail. There was nothing extraordinary about him whatsoever. This is the story of how everything changed. \n\nJoe had just turned 18, and being an America, did what many Americans do on their 18th birthday. He went out and bought a lottery ticket. However, this was no ordinary lottery ticket. This was the winning ticket! Now, being from an average town, the jackpot wasn't huge, but it was large enough to attract unwanted relatives, and friends. So Joe used the money to change his name to Derrick, and his looks. \n\nA few months pass, and Derrick wakes up one morning, and looks in the mirror. The only thought to pass through his mind is \"Wow, I'm ridiculously good looking. Maybe I can do that for a living?\" He goes to a modeling agency, and the agent agrees. He gets Derrick his first job, and for a few years, things just go great! Derrick becomes the number 1 male model in the world.\n\nNot all good things last though. A new challenger arose, and unseated Derrick's place as number 1. Dejected, Derrick decides to leave the modeling business. But things are not all as they seem. A group resembling the Illuminati control the garment industry. They have been behind all of the major political changes in the last 200 years. Now, the Malaysian Prime Minister is attempting to reform his labour laws, which would increase costs to make clothes. \n\nThe group sees a dejected Derrick, and brainwashes him to become a mindless assassin. In an attempt to be diplomatic, the Garment Group invited the Malaysian Prime Minister to a fashion show. When it's Derrick's turn to walk the catwalk, the GG triggers his assassination subroutines! Through a fortuitous turn of events, he's interrupted. Derrick is extremely upset by the turn of events, because he never wanted to hurt anyone. He asks the Malaysian Prime Minister if he can do anything to help either him, or his nation. The Prime Minister thinks for a few moments, and says, \"Actually, Derrirk, you seem kind of heart and soul. If you would give me but tree fiddy, I could help my nation greatly.\"\n\nAnd that's when Derrick realized he was talking to a sea creature that was 40 feet tall, and from the paleolithic era. \n\nDerrick shouted \"I AIN'T GIVIN YOU NO TREE FIDDY YOU GODDAMN LOCH NESS MONSTER!\"\n\n\nedit- so many downvotes lol.

{"body": "A friend of mine told me a story that's relevant to this. \n\nHe's one of those repair men for appliances that go out and fix fridges, dishwashers, washing machines, and stuff. Usually he just goes in, fixes the thing, and leaves. We'll call him \"LN\".\n\nThis one day LN went in on a call about a broken dryer. When he arrived he was met by a middle aged woman. She was average looking, not ugly.  She was the only one in the house at the time. \n\nShe showed him the dryer and he took a look at it, nothing major. As soon as he was about to get started on it she started bawling about how her husband left her and never appreciated her. It turns out he left her while she was away on a business trip and slept with another woman. \n\nLN tried to comfort her by patting her back and saying it was okay, but she wanted more. She started throwing her self at him and saying she wanted to get back at her husband. LN had been single for a while so he agreed and they went into her bed room and started making love. \n\nHe described it as one of the best nights of his life, she was experienced in the all the sexual techniques. They went at it like wild rabbits. He said he was afraid he would be repairing her bed by the time they were done. \nThey did it doggy style, missionary, cow girl, for at least an hour and a half. \n\nBy the time they were done she was worn out and led him to the door and promised never to tell his boss or anyone. Just as LN was about to leave he said \"Hey you never paid me for fixing the dryer\". She laughed and said that she thought the sex was payment enough but then seriously asked \"How much?\" LN replied \"About tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time that she realized that LN was about 8 stories tall and from the paleolithic era. That goddamn Loch Ness had gotten her again! She yelled \"Goddammit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" as he swam away. \n\n**TL;DR: Friend goes to repair dryer, lady starts sobbing about her ex husband, sexy times ensue**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365100446", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 33, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Yeh I've never admitted this, but it's the internet and we're all reletively anonymous. Bear with me, it's quite the tale, so here goes!\n\nI live in a wealthy area of California and for years I worked as a lifeguard, mostly for the city, but family and friends would ask me to come watch their kid's birthday pool parties. It was fun, eat some cake, get paid about $100 for a couple hours work.\n\nI come home from school one afternoon and mom says, \"There a message for you.\" I go check the machine, and it's the mother of a kid who was at the last pool party I guarded, her name was Vanessa. She wants me to come watch her kid's party at the end of the month. I call back and arrange everything with her, when we get to payment details she says, \"Oh Sandy (the other mom) told me she gave you $100, so would that be fine again? Or do you want something else?\" I told her no, $100 is great, see her soon.\n\nEnd of the month rolls around, and it's a scorcher. Middle of July, easily 90 degrees in the shade. I'm standing out at the pool, kids are all running around, having a good time. Some of the parents are in the pool, in the shallow end just talking. Every once in a while, as I'm scanning the pool, I catch Vanessa looking at me. She's quite attractive and in a bikini she catches my teenage eye.\n\nI guess I was staring too long at one point and when I clued in, I realized she was staring right back at me, with a sorta half smile. She gets out of the pool and comes over.\n\n\"Maybe you should keep your eyes on the pool and off my breasts, lifeguard.\"\n\n\"Uh...sorry, I was just staring randomly...I didn't mean to.\" I was so red, man, easily the most embarrassing moment in my life. She was so forward about it!\n\nThoroughly ashamed I watched the kids as the party wound down and everyone was leaving. I cleaned up the pool area a bit and got my stuff. I was so embarrassed that I was going to just leave without getting paid.\n\nI was about to leave when she caught me and said, \"Oh come inside, I'll give you your money. I've got $100 upstairs.\" I protested, again apologizing for staring at her.\n\n\"Come upstairs, the money is in my purse.\"\n\nLike an idiot I just followed her upstairs, into her bedroom...\n\nShe closes the door...\n\nI'm still not cluing in here. She gets her purse and pulls out a few bills. She comes over and stands very close and whispers in my ear, \"So, what would a boy like you want with a woman like me?\"\n\nInstantly I realized what was going on. I flushed red. I opened my mouth and managed, \"You don't really need to give me anything, Vanessa.\"\n\nShe stepped back, looking at me seductively. \"You're right, I think you owe me.\"\n\n\"What...?\" I replied sheepishly.\n\n\"I think you owe me 'bout tree fiddy\" It was then that I realized that she was actually 30 feet tall and over 1,000,000 years old.

{"body": "Paradise. Toiletoad, after a long and dreary journey filled with dangers no toad had ever seen before and escaped alive to tell the tale, had finally made it to Paradise. It was a small, secluded pool of water, whose steep cliff faces shone the brightest white, glinting in the golden sunlight. Beneath the surface of the still, crystal water, a tunnel sat, having as much as a serene pocket of air for breathing. Truly, this place\nwas every thing his people had dreamed of, and more.\n\nAs Toiletoad settled in for a blissful day of soaking, he let out a contented croak. Peace like never before washed over him. For here, away from the dangers of the outside world, a total calm blanketed all. No constant threat of predators; no day to day struggle just to survive. Just life itself, soothing in its glory.\n\nHundreds had tried to find this place, but none had succeeded. For the great frog in the sky had not willed them so. But, Toiletoad supposed, the watcher had granted him this day a land of infinite opportunity and perfection. And make use of it he would...\n\nA dark shadow swallowed the sun. From high above the crystal pond, a deep drone reverberated off the once shining cliffs. Something struck the water, slamming into its surface like a dropped boulder. It shook Toiletoad to his very core. Something was not right. No, something was not right at all.\n\nThen, amongst the now constant rumbling and groaning, Toiletoad prayed to the Froggy Watcher. *Watcher*, he prayed, *protect this place. For I know that it is holy, and so I offer myself as an offering...*\n\nIn his mind's eye, Toiletoad could see the Froggy Watcher, watching from his place in the heavenly rain forest. The holy one smiled, gently shook his head, and said, \"I need something from you first...\" \n\nConfused, Toiletoad replied, \"What do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time Toiletoad realized that the Froggy Watcher was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten him again! \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nA great whirling sound, and the water of the pond swirled away down the tunnel. He hung on for dear life, and managed to stay at the surface until the water returned. The shadow lifted, and the sun returned. To this day, Toiletoad still rests in Paradise, mostly at peace, but still wary of the shadow in the sky.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365120533", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I take a look - this port, and one end of the ADB cable that should connect it to the printer, is absolutely destroyed.  He hadn't really made any effort to make sure he had the cable right side up, or even aligned in any way, shape, or form when trying to plug it in.  So, when it wouldn't go in, he'd just pushed harder.  And harder.  All of the pins were squashed flat, the cowling/shielding around the outside was bent all to hell, everything was all scratched up and misshapen as a result, and the port wasn't even oriented directly towards the outside world all that much anymore.\n\nI tried telling him that this wasn't a manufacturing defect and that he'd need to pay for the repairs the machine needed (a full motherboard replacement)... and he goes ballistic.  This quickly escalates to the point where I needed to get the manager involved, and not only does the guy end up admitting he was in a really bad mood when he tried to plug the printer in and that he knew it was his fault, but he says \"It's just like my dad tells me: you're not going to get good or even fair service unless you get really angry and loud with the stores.\"\n\nThe manager eventually told me that he was going to cover half of the guy's repairs - so we ended up losing more than the margin we made on selling him the computer in the first place.

We had always been very good friends, but even though I was a straight guy I had never felt anything between us. I had a girlfriend of my own (who wasn't there at the wedding, since she was unfortunately busy that day), so I was ecstatic when I heard that she had gotten engaged to her fiance. He was a weird guy, came from the scottish highlands, and he wasn't used to America, the city, or really being around people. But he was a nice guy from the little that I knew him, and they genuinely loved each other.\n\nSadly, her family was not so happy with him. She was African American, and parts of her family had suffered horribly during the Civil Rights era, and they still had the scars of racial oppression and distrusted white people to some extent. Of course most of her family didn't feel this way, but there were a few who did. One was her dad. He was a tall guy, had grey hair but nothing on top, and a great beard, but he did not like this guy. Claimed he had met him in Scotland, even, but couldn't quite recognize him. The guy also practiced voodoo, though, so he was a bit off-the-rails.\n\nAnyway, the ceremony got under way. Part way through, the groom stopped to address the attendees. He started talking about the typical stuff, how much he loves the bridge, how happy he is to see everyone who showed up, etc. Then he stops, and says: \"One more thing. [Bride's dad], I need something from you. I'm gonna need... about tree fidd-\" - and the father jumped up, pulled out a pistol, and fired off several shots as the screaming guests fled the scene. \"God damn lochness monsta! I aint givin you no tree fiddy!\" he shouted as he was dragged away by the groom's family members.\n\nAnyways, he was arrested, and the couple rescheduled their wedding for the next week.

Things like morals and philosophy, religion and war. Eventually their conversation turned towards sexuality as the old man had intended.\nAfter talking a while, the old man- hoping to tease her with his wit, asked her at what price she would consent to sleep with somebody of his age and disposition. \nThe lady took a sip of her drink and replied smooth and sassy as ice: \"I would sleep with 'you' for lets say, a billion dollars\". \n\nHearing this the old man roared with laughter, causing the beautiful lady to sit back in apparent surprise. As the lady asked him what he found to be so funny, a wicked grin grew across his face.\nThe old man haggled: \"how about a million?\". \n\nAt this point the lady, almost blue with indignation (as his outburst was quite loud) asked why he thought she might consent to such an offer at all.\nThe old man quietly; having calmed down, replied: \" you've established the principal, I'm just negotiating a better price.

{"body": "Firstly I'll apologise because I am perfectly aware of my affliction of non-conciseness, but here we go anyway.\n\n1. I'm only 19 but the first Doctor I ever saw was William Hartnell - my dad started bringing the DVDs home a couple of years before the series returned in 2005, so my first episode was The Dalek Invasion of Earth. Nevertheless when asked who my doctor is I tend to say Christopher Eccleston  or David Tennant, because the 2005 season was the first one I watched faithfully and as it first aired.\n\n2. I tend to panic when people ask me who my favourite doctor is, so I've given this one a lot of thought so as to prepare me for those moments. I think my favourite doctors are joint - David Tennant and Patrick Troughton, but most of them are pretty close behind. I don't think you can have a best doctor though, because all of the doctors *were* the Doctor. It's not like James Bond where you have to have the personality the same, however much I dislike Colin Baker's version (for example), that was undeniably who the Doctor was at that point in his history. He was as much the Doctor as any of the others, and therefore his doctor was as good a doctor as any of the others.\n\n3. My favourite companions are joint too - Jamie McCrimmon and Donna Noble, and for similar reasons. They both take on a special, 'best-friend' relationship with the Doctor rather than a romantic one like Rose or a basic doctor-companion one. I like watching that play out, and because I get far too involved in the emotions of the show (which is of course the only real way to watch the show :P) I like the characters that understand and reach out to the Doctor the most; the ones that make him happiest and most secure. In my eyes that's Donna and Jamie.\n\n4. *spoilers for the 50th in this one, just to warn the casual reader* My favourite enemy is the zygons. There's no real deep reason why - I think it was just that they were linked to Nessie and I've always had a bit of a fascination with Loch Ness. You should have seen me when I saw the announcement about the 50th, I almost exploded with excitement. I also love the idea behind the Vashta Nerada - I think that was really innovative, making the scary thing about the dark the dark itself. Also cured me of my nictophobia, I realised that if the Vashta Nerada were what I should be scared of, the I had nothing to fear - if they were here, I'd be dead already, so I must be safe. Ta da. :P\n\n5. I think the eighth Doctor gets a lot of bad press because of his short reign, so to speak, and lots of things about the film that I'll get to in a minute. He actually does a fantastic job at capturing the energy, the tenderness and the wild, madcap exuberance of the Doctor (I think) in a less-than-inspiring film. The eighth Doctor is essentially the sole reason I watch the movie. He's one of my favourite Doctors despite my dislike of his co-stars and the film's plotline.\n\n6. You know of my appreciation bordering on fangirl-y love of Paul McGann's Doctor, so I'll leave that aside. Grace rates as one of my most annoying companions of all time, though she has her moments of (no pun intended) grace. I thought the Doctor's regeneration was a bit over-dramatised and I felt like there were religious undertones to it that didn't need to be there; having said that I did like *why* he regenerated. I thought the fact that he died from human surgeons trying to help him was a clever way to do it, and highlighted the dangers of the Doctor wandering around 20th/21st Century Earth. I decidedly did not like the Master in the film. He was like a bad parody of Dracula and the Terminator's lovechild. The Master in most of his guises is my absolute favourite character of Doctor Who and I praise him from Roger Delgado and Anthony Ainley (my personal favourite) to John Simm and Derek Jacobi's ever-so-important job of bringing him back to life after the Time War, but Eric Roberts did not do it for me. he needed to be more nonchalant, more sarky and charismatic. He did charisma in an oily dracula way - trying to show that characters in the film took him to be charismatic but without bothering to charm the audience in the way that John Simm and Anthony Ainley could do so well. I'll stop now before I give you an entire essay on the subject, but you get the idea. As I said before though, the film was saved by Paul McGann's portrayal of the Doctor.\n\n7. Gonna pretty much pass this one as I was pretty young. I'm surprised that I can't remember, because I know I was pretty invested in it from watching the classic series with my family when I heard the news, and I know I was already enough of a fan to fight tooth and claw (also no pun intended) with my parents to let me watch The Unquiet Dead (third episode in) when they thought it was too scary but... I can't remember any sense of surprise or jubilation at the news. Maybe I was just so young I didn't realise how unusual it was for shows to restart.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365296956", "subreddit": "doctorwho", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It's a pretty gross and embarassing story, but I'll try to keep the nasty parts to a minimum.\n\nI was at a concert, and my friends and I got hungry, so we decided to get some tacos from this somewhat sketchy food truck. They tasted alright, but about half an hour later we all started feeling \"off\" in our stomachs. We realized pretty quickly that we needed a toilet, some of us urgently. This being an outdoor concert, the only available toilets were porta-potties, and pretty gross ones at that. But hey, we were in no state to be picky. \n\nThere was also a fairly long line in front of the porta-potties.

But when I finally made it to the front, I ran into the box, slammed the door, pulled down my pants, and let out a sigh of relief that the wait hadn't been thirty seconds or so longer.\n\nAbout ten minutes later I realized the stall was out of toilet paper. I'll spare you the gory details, but without some way of wiping my ass, I was not going to be leaving that little metal box any time soon. So I sat there, panicking with my pants around my ankles for what must've been at least 15 minutes. Eventually, I realized I wasn't getting out of there without embarrassing myself. I started banging on the wall of the porta-potty and screaming about how I needed toilet paper. I think the banging drowned out my screams, because before I knew it someone else was knocking on the door and yelling \"Hey, this is a public concert, you can't have sex in there. Other people also need to use those facilities.\"\n\nI stopped pounding on the wall and yelled back \"I'm not! There's only one of me and no toilet paper! I had a bad taco, and...\" I realized it was probably better I stop talking. There was a long uncomfortable silence before the person outside said \"ah, I'm afraid I don't have any tissues but I'll see if I can find you something.\" I squeaked out a \"thank you.\" \n\nThen, I heard another voice from outside \"I have tissues, if ye need 'em.\" The first voice said \"Great.\" Then, slightly louder \"Open the door a little bit, I'll pass them in.\" I unlocked the door, someone passed in a small pack of tissues, and I got myself cleaned up, which took most of the pack.\n\nWhen I got out, the crowd of people were still standing outside the porta-potty. I could feel my cheeks burning. Gosh, they must've been bright red. I walked up to the woman at the front and mumbled another thank you. She said \"Don't thank me, thank him, he's the one who had the tissues.\"\n\nSo I thanked him and we exchanged pleasantries, which was far less uncomfortable than the situation warranted. I apologized for using up the whole package, he told me to think nothing of it. I offered to pay him and asked him how much. He said \"how about tree fiddy?\" I looked him up and down and said \"Goddammit monstah, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" Then I went home, because I was in no mood to enjoy the concert after that. Now that I think back on it, I don't even know why the loch ness monster was at a concert in the first place. One of life's great mysteries, I guess.\n\n**TL;DR: I was trapped in a porta-potty after eating a bad taco at a concert.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365318411", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 58, "controversiality": 0}

I went on a holiday with the last of my savings to try and clear my mind and decide where I wanted to go with my life. I never thought I would find somebody, but I met her  at a lodge on the side of a lake, it was sunset and she just came up to me and asked me if I was OK. Just the fact that anyone cared about me at all made me break down in tears (attractive, right?) and we sat by the shore the rest of the night just talking. It turned out she was lonely too, and we started a long distance relationship, just jumping in at the deep end. It was that moment I realized she was the one for me, and I asked her to marry me on the same shore of that lake. No-one I knew believed she even existed, I must have looked like a nut-case to them always going on about this wonderful woman I met on holiday, but when I told them I was getting married it finally sunk in for them.\n\nFastforward two years ( it took us a while to save up for the wedding) and we're getting married at Urquhart Church, her hometown. I was stood at the end of the aisle waiting for her and she walked in. She looked beautiful, her hair was glimmering in the sun, her dress billowing out behind her and everyone gasped in shock when they saw her. She came up the aisle, stared deep into my eyes and whispered into my ear \"Do you have tree fiddy?\" It was about this time I noticed my bride was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. I left her at the aisle and will never find love that strong again. My heart bleeds for her.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365332909", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I figured he was on his phone, but I din't care because he always got his work done.\nOne day, I look up to see him staring at a girl at the front of the class. I make nothing of it and get back to marking work. 5 minutes later I look up again, he's still staring. It's starting to get weird, so I go up to him and ask what he's doing.\nMe: Chris, is anything wrong? \nChris: No response \nMe: Chris why are you staring at Jazlyn?\nI notice Chris has his hand in his bag again, except this time it is moving up and down over his crotch. I'd heard stories about kids wanking in class, but I never thought it would happen in mine. Not wanting to call him out immediately in case he wasn't wanking, I said abruptly\nChris, show me your hands.\nAt this point, he notices me. He looks straight at me, with the most hateful eyes I have ever seen on a child, and stands up.\nHis bag falls to the floor. I almost vomit at what I see. His right hand and penis is covered in shit, as is his pants, seat and bag. He spits right in my face, runs up to the girl he was staring at and tackles her to the ground, attempting to beat her. I pull him off, and tell the kids to get help. The security guard comes in and restrains the kid, then takes him to the principal's office.

I loved her and she loved me (I think).  \n\nBut anyways, I felt guilty because of what I did at my bachelor party.  My friends thought it would be a good idea to hire hookers and strippers for the party.  I came to the party thinking that I would have no problems resisting the want to have sex with a hooker but... plans usually never go as planned.\n\nThe start of the party was pretty fun.  It was a very... naughty party.  I shouldn't have been there in the first place.  My friends were all single except for one who was having problems with his on and off girlfriend so they were all in the mood to have some sex with prostitutes at the party.  \n\nAt first I had no trouble keeping myself in check but as I saw more and more friends going into other rooms with the girls my hormones kept raging until a prostitute named Krystal started to seduce me.  \n\nI had had my eye on her the entire night but that bitch had to seduce me.. she even knew that I was the one getting married... some women.\n\nShe had an amazing body.  Not to trash talk the girl I was getting married to... but Krystal was worlds ahead of that girl in terms of physical attractiveness.  She had an amazing ass, her legs were great, and her boobs were just right.  Her nipples may have been a little big for me, but that's aside the point.  \n\nShe started talking to me and making dirty remarks to me and eventually I caved in and brought her to a room.  I didn't even feel guilty as we were kissing.  Her dirty talk kept me going, \"Oh yes! (Name)! Treat me like a bad girl!\"  I can still hear her voice in my head.\n\nI feel guilty just thinking about this.  As things were heating up she kept screaming that she needed something.  \"I need it very badly!  Oh yes! I need it!\" \n\n\"What do you need?\" I said.  \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that Krystal was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "&gt;  explain to me how atheism is correct\n\nAtheism is little more than a label to denote someone who is not a theist, so, its not really something I can show to be correct. Although, if some theist were to actually prove their god were real, that might disprove atheism.\n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims of theist unconvincing. Every reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logic fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nThis is not true, many gods can in fact be dis-proven.\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365384847", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I worked until later in the day, so it was up to me to find out where it was from their crappy directions. No one had cars either, and public transit is crap here.\n\nAnyway, it's about a half-hour walk through the city to the general area of where they said the restaurant was. I start off, already tired from work. \n\nI figured I was almost there when I got onto a main street that had quite a few restaurants. Trying to remember the directions I was given, I turn off to a side street with more restaurants, but it wasn't a busy street compared to the other one. Lo and behold, I see some shaggy-looking dude about 50 feet away get out of his van, open the back and take the little sign the sandwich place had out on the sidewalk. He threw it in the back, got back in the van and drove off.\n\nFuck, that was weird. \n\nI continue looking for the place with no luck. Ten minutes later, I'm contemplating just eating at a random place by myself. Fuck it, I'm hungry and tired. I find myself on a smaller side street than before, see a sub place, and go in.\n\nAs I'm standing in line, I happen to turn around to look out the window and see the *same fucking man* with his van stop and steal the sign for the sub place.\n\nHoly shit, who wants those small advertising signs? I debate on confronting him, but don't because hunger. \n\nI eat and leave. I'm about halfway back home when I see a small electronics shop ahead of me, with a small advertising sign out on the sidewalk. Of course, as I get closer (about 10 feet away), the *same fucking guy* pulls up and takes the sign. I figure, what the hell, I'm close enough that I can run up and ask him what he's doing.\n\n\"I need money, man. People buy the signs from me for cheap.\"\n\nI've given to the homeless before. This guy looked on the verge of losing everything. You could see it in his eyes. I figured he couldn't keep stealing signs for money, and he seemed to know that, so I thought he must just need a little money to help him out of whatever jam he was in. I ask him if he wants some money. He looks surprised, but accept the offer. I ask him how much, and say I'm happy to help him out. He says, \"I... I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time I realized that this shaggy dude was ten stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I said, \"goddammit, Loch Ness Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" and walked off.\n\nNever have I been more disgusted and betrayed by trying to help out a fellow human being.\n\nI've stopped giving things to people since then. I know I should still help, and maybe some day I'll volunteer at the soup kitchen again, but for now I feel like my innocence has been stolen from me.\n\n**tl;dr: Saw a dude stealing those sidewalk signs for restaurants, confronted him and asked if he needed help.

{"body": "New Years Eve 2002, my friend and I had gotten a hotel room that included an open bar at two bars inside the hotel that both had live music. When we checked in around 5pm we both immediately got into our pajamas and slippers, to be funny, and headed to one of the bars to start drinking. Turns out we knew the bartender there too, she was dating one of our friends... and she was giving us a massive amount of shots, I remember getting an *entire glass* of jagermeister and a *shot* of red bull when I order a jagerbomb (we were in college, that would never happen anymore... especially after this night). Most of the night is a blur, I remember looking around at one point and realizing I had crashed a wedding reception in the banquet hall, at least I think it was, everyone was all dressed up and I was in my pajamas. At one point we left the hotel completely and headed out to the local bars to meet up with our friends. I was at a friends house doing lines, I remember that, and then at one of my regular bars on stage playing a guitar (in my pajamas, mind you). But the craziest thing was yet to happen... This is where I don't remember anything until the morning. I woke up at the hotel, no idea how I got back there. My friend wasn't there but I woke up to his phone call. \n\n\"Hey man, you back at the hotel?\"\n\n\"yah, where are you?\"\n\n\"I just went home, figured you and your new friend would want the room to yourselves\"\n\n\"my friend?\"\n\nat that point I realized somebody was in the bathroom making all sorts of noise... I got all freaked out, it could have been anybody honestly. I realized my pants were on the floor, and only one of the beds had been used.

{"body": "New Years Eve 2002, my friend and I had gotten a hotel room that included an open bar at two bars inside the hotel that both had live music. When we checked in around 5pm we both immediately got into our pajamas and slippers, to be funny, and headed to one of the bars to start drinking. Turns out we knew the bartender there too, she was dating one of our friends... and she was giving us a massive amount of shots, I remember getting an entire glass of jagermeister and a shot of red bull when I order a jagerbomb (we were in college, that would never happen anymore... especially after this night). Most of the night is a blur, I remember looking around at one point and realizing I had crashed a wedding reception in the banquet hall, at least I think it was, everyone was all dressed up and I was in my pajamas. At one point we left the hotel completely and headed out to the local bars to meet up with our friends. I was at a friends house doing lines, I remember that, and then at one of my regular bars on stage playing a guitar (in my pajamas, mind you). But the craziest thing was yet to happen... This is where I don't remember anything until the morning. I woke up at the hotel, no idea how I got back there. My friend wasn't there but I woke up to his phone call.\n\n\"Hey man, you back at the hotel?\"\n\n\"yah, where are you?\"\n\n\"I just went home, figured you and your new friend would want the room to yourselves\"\n\n\"my friend?\"\n\nat that point I realized somebody was in the bathroom making all sorts of noise...

So its just before midnight, probably 11:30 or so (I'm feeling pretty good at this point) and I'm at the bar when I notice this short, tanned, cute looking girl across the bar. I take a gentleman's peek and after a few moments of just relaxing at the bar, she's looking over at me. Normally, I wouldn't assume she was looking at me, but I was likely the only dude at the bar at the time so hey.. it's go time.\n\nI saunter over, not too eagerly, and take a seat next to her. Instantly, we greet each other and begin making the chit chats. I find out over the course of 20 minutes that she is single, has a young boy, lives on her own, and is a mechanic. She also is the DD of the night. Much of this blows my mind as she literally looks like she's 19 and in the prime shape of her life. She's 28. All goes well and eventually we have to catch up with our respective group of friends, so we say our good byes, I get her phone number, and off we go.\n\nFast foward to about 1:30 when she comes up to me and says \"I've gotta drive my friends home darlin'\" kisses me on the cheek, and away she goes.\n\nFast forward to around 2:00 and she does the same thing.\n\nUnsure of what exactly is going on, I just take it in stride and continue my evening where I eventually get home to pass out.\n\nThe very next day, I sit at my computer, redditing (surprise), when I get a text message.

{"body": "Not sure if this is someting to be glad about, but I got a good one on this.\n\nI worked in software develpment at that time (SAP in Germany, pretty big company). I worked in a department where we created specific software-solutions for problems company came to us with, so basically we were one of the few departments in the company were we had to interact with customers directly, keep deadlines and such.\n\nMy boss at the time was fairly new in this department and not used to that. Word was he was to be fired from his former position in another department, but they couldn't be let him go completely because he had contacts up high. I wouldn't say he was incompetent, but he had a bad temper and wasn't used to the whole deadline stuff.\n\nSo there was this big customer who had made several adjustments to teir request along the way so we were struggling with the time due to that. They were raging douches, so they wouldn't accept a delay without reduction of the price. My boss however for some reason never got the idea to pull people from other assignments for a week or so to finish this one.\n\nI was worked in this department longer than average so people respected me, and one afternoon I just took matters into my own ands and said to a handful of people that they should stop what they were doing, get on this assignment, pull a couple of extra hours and we might get it done. We did almost, and I even stayed almost the whole night to finish things up. I slept in my car for two hours that night. The next morning, I was a little late because I drove to a friend who lived closer to shower after waking up because I smelled, people were already giving me those weird looks and I could tell things weren't good. At my desk there was a note that I should report to my boss asap.\n\nSo I got into his office and he gave me this raging glare. He almost yelled at me \"WHAT WAS THAT YESTERDAY?\". I said that I did what was necessay to not piss of this customer. Then he went into fullblown raging mode and screamed \"THAT WAS NOT WHAT I NEEDED!\" I was pretty pissed off at this point and was getting loud as well, asking what it was that he needed. He then said: \"I need about tree fiddy.\". It was about that time that I noticed that my boss was a chrustatian from the zenolithic period! Goddammnit!

{"body": "My general first questions are; what do you believe and why do you believe it?\n\nThe first part(what do you believe) is usually understood and answered, however, the follow up(why to you believe it) is often answered with; because I am a Christian or because the bible says so...\n\nSaying that you believe in Christianity because you are a Christian doesn't really tell me why. Yes, I get that you were born into a Christian culture or raised to believe these things, but, that doesn't tell me why I think any of it is true. And simply citing the bible as the reason doesn't help me understand why you believe what you do anymore than someone telling you that they are a Muslim because they read the Koran. Why should someone view the bible as true or holy, but, not the Hindu Vedas?\n\nTo me the why is crucial. What logic, evidence, or reasons brought you to the conclusion that your particular brand of Christianity is anymore true and correct than any other version of Christianity or some other faith all together? Why are you not a Muslim? Why not a Buddhist or a Hindu? Why not Zoroastrianism or worship of the Greek Pantheon? \n\nIs it because of the circumstance of your birth? If we are talking about something that is supposed to be a universal truth, why would geography &amp; time play such a deciding factor in determining ones religion? \n\nAs for me and my position on the existence of deities, I am an atheist because I have found the claims of theist unconvincing. Every reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nThis is not true, many gods can in fact be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365444846", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

She said she hated kids, and how her 6 yr old son usually came with her to this bar for her dates.\n\nShe also told me she lived with her aunt, who was gonna kick her out because she refused to take her anti depressants. She also told me she saw spiders coming out of people's mouths they tell lies. And how she was afraid to go to the north end of town, just because. She drew a picture of me on an invitation for her sons best friend to his birthday party. Oh, also, she was ugly beyond all reason.\n\nThe next day she called me to tell me she spent the night at some other guys house north of town, conquering her fear. I asked why she went to his house. She said because she keeps her meats in his freezer. She then told me she wanted to keep dating, and that I'd be crazy not to continue seeing her.\n\nSo I decide to give her one more chance.

{"body": "The simple answer would be that atheism just made the most sense to me. No god has any empirical evidence, or observability, or measurable results, or logical reason. But I suppose it started when I was much younger and read about the myths and religions of other cultures. Naturally they seemed silly and obviously not true to me, there was no jesus or my god involved. So Native American tails and African origin stories were just cool fairy tails to me. Something people did to explain the origins of the things we know before we actually knew the cause. To me this cause was the right god. But as I got older I realized that there explanation was just as valid as mine. And that instead of these stories being a place holder until Christianity arrived they were instead a place holder till science arrived. I was sure I could be a scientific Christian. But I didn't like the scientific ignorance in the religious world, nor did I like all the abuse of other groups and hate, and war, and lies, and oppression, and hypocrisy, I fought it for a while as I didn't want to be an atheist. But there seemed to be no reason for a god or afterlife. Why would there be this place of bliss free from all the chemical demands are bodies make to exist and live with infinite space for all of the dead that we can not find any evidence of existing that you only get to by acting certain ways in life that in no way change your chemical structure? Why need a god to make all the wonders of the world take place when you have science? Because we know science and chemicals have a role in it. So if there a god it only gets MORE confusing because now you need science and god. It would just be much simpler with explainable, understandable, logical, necessary, science. So one day I just woke up with clear vision and knew that I didn't really believe in any of it. I don't believe in witches or ghosts, I don't believe in big foot, or the Loch Ness monster, and there is no holy being I think that ever existed either.

So naturally I dropped whatever files I had brought home from work that night and rushed over to her. She explained that she had just lost her job. (a little background ever since she was little she had wanted to be a fashion designer and had finally gotten an entry level position at a local firm which had just gone under, this was in late 2008) So I spent the next hour reassuring her that she would find another job and that every thing would be alright. Finally she calmed down and asked if I though we would be alright financially until she could find another job and I said I was sure that we'd get through it and in the meantime if she needed any money until we could get her a credit card connected to my bank account all she had to do was ask. She wiped the tears from her eyes and kissed me. Then she said she had worked up an appetite and that she was going to take a walk down to the local bakery to get something to eat and asked me if I had any cash. To which I replied of course and asked how much she needed. She said, about tree fiddy. It was about that time I noticed I had been dating an eight story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "I remember this dream not only because it was f***ed up, but because my depression medication gives me lucid dreams. So I am just going through a normal day of high school: going to classes, checking out girls, hanging with friends, eating lunch, going to the library, gym class, etc. However, this day in my dream seemed different as the day wound down and it was about time to go home. Suddenly it seemed strange as I walked to my green, beat up, 1998 Pontiac Grand Prix. I pull out my keys, and unlock the driver-side door; but I don't get in. I just can't shake this feeling. I look around, and I see my friend's sister wave to me as she is about to get into her car as well. She also stops and looks around. I look towards the nearby highway, and notice it first. Why are there no cars? It's 4 p.m., but the traffic is almost non-existent. It is usually hustling and bustling. \"Hey, wait up!\" I yell at my friend's sister. We make small talk, and I tell her to let her brother know I will be over to play basketball this weekend as we always do with our big group of buddies.Then I see this large group of people walking on the highway. What the hell are they doing? Is there a major accident? I didn't hear anything. I tell her to wait, and I run over to check it out. Before I can go 100 meters, a large group comes out from behind the library towards the parking lot where she is waiting. I run back to ask them what is going on because I didn't feel like running a quarter of a mile to the highway instead. I approach them, but the weird thing is is that they seem to be looking for me. I am innocent! I didn't do anything! Whatever, I cool down. I stop, and let them approach. \"We have overturned the government, and we are looking for people to join us and create a new one.\" My mind immediately goes into gear on how to get out of this. \"I'll go get my family, too. Where can I meet you guys?\" They are surprisingly not suspicious. \"We are headed to the bus terminals to go together to the state capitol. We will leave at 8.\" My heart lifts that I have escaped the mob. \"See you at 8 then.\" They head off, and I go back to my friend's sister. She is freaking out, and I take advantage. I offer to follower her home to check on her brother and parents. We get to her house, and it is looks empty. She invites me inside, and she ends up finding only her mother in the backyard. \"Thanks for escorting my little girl home. You always were the one I could trust the most from your bunch.\" Her daughter does the unexpected. \"Mom, we found out today that we are in anarchy right now. People are marching in mobs doing what they want.\" Her mother consoles her dismissively,\"I know I know. Your father and brother went with them.\" I am truly shocked. I never figured my friend and his dad as overly anti-government. Then comes the kicker,\"Mom, I want to tell you something before things get out of hand and people attack us or our house or something random.\" She always was a drama queen, and a bit paranoid. \"Mom, I am a paid escort.\" Her mother's face twists more than a pepper grinder with disgust and disbelief,\"Excuse me?\" \"A prostitute, mom. A prostitute, okay?!\" I couldn't help myself. I instantly asked the stupidest, most selfish question. \"Wow! All this time?! I could have hit that all this time?! How much?!\" She turns to me with a smile,\"Oh... about tree-fidy.\" It was then that I realized she was really a giant plesiosaur from the middle Jurassic period. \"Damn you, Loch Ness monster!

{"body": "&gt;The major disagreement is that saying there is no god is more reasonable than saying there is a god. The term reasonable is too subjective.\n\nIt's quite subjective, but I think the only reason people broadly disagree on this point is cultural bias. You seem to have the sense that denying the existence of God is unreasonable. Many people do. However, few people would find it unreasonable if you claimed there is no Odin or that there are no Leprechauns. God is on even footing with them. What I'm trying to get at is that I think people are biased in God's favor and approach these arguments without objectivity.\n\nWe reject cryptozoological claims (Bigfoot, Loch Ness Monster, etc.) because they do not fit into our evolutionary or ecological models and we have never seen them despite the fact that we've looked quite a bit. People would find no difficulty accepting \"There is no Bigfoot\" as a reasonable conclusion. It is precisely the same reasoning that leads many to conclude that there is no God.\n\n&gt;I think that if God did exist it would be impossible to prove logically.  Our minds can't really comprehend the nature of time and space\n\nBut we know it's there. We can observe it, measure it, make predictions about it.

A family to feed.\"  Every day people passed him by, not giving him anything.  It always ate at me, how we all just passed over him, too busy to stop to give him money or food, always in a rush to our work.  Then, I realized even I didn't take the time to stop for him.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI walked up to him after parking in the parking lot at my work.  The mud was dried up on his face, his jeans were disgusting, and his shirt had sweat stains all over it.  He didn't even lift his eyes to me as I approached, too ashamed of his current disposition.  Nonetheless, I went up to him and asked him how he was doing.\n\"Been better...\" He said.\n\"How did you end up like this?\" I inquired.\nHe then went on to explain his story.  His name was Rick.  he had been a construction worker a few towns over, until one day, the owner, who absolutely loved this guy, died, leaving it to his son to manage.  Now the son didn't know anything about construction, so he sold off the company to one of those huge corporations.  The corporation, in order to reduce costs, decided to make lay offs.  Rick was one of them.  \nRick had a sick wife at home.  She had diabetes, so she needed proper nutrition or else she collapse from low blood sugar.  Before, Rick had been able to provide for his wife, albeit just barely on his low construction worker salary.  In addition, he had a 5 year old at home who was still a growing boy.  Rick couldn't provide for either of them.\nI was so incredibly moved.  I immediately asked Rick needed anything.  Food?  Money?\n\"What can I give you to help out, Rick?\" I asked.\nHe said, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\nIt was at this point that I noticed that Rick was a 8 story tall Crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "Are you saying the chair is or isn't solid? As far as we're concerned, no matter what we know of the space between atoms and the forces that hold them together and the forces that repel other atoms (because we technically aren't touching anything either, right?), as far as were concerned the chair is solid because it's not a liquid or gas or plasma. According to our definition of solid it's solid. And as far as my butt is concerned when I'm sitting on it, I'm touching it. Despite my knowledge of the way things work at the atomic level I can still apply my definitions and be accurate.\n \nso we reject the existence of the afore mentioned dieties and monsters because we have a list of attributes we can check off. Is there anyone living on top of mount olympus? No? Well that solves the issue of zeus. It works the same with big foot and the loch ness monster.

Why does cultural bias infuencing our belief in god make it any less valid? Just because you can name the mechanism doesn't make it any less real or true.

{"body": "&gt;the chair is solid because it's not a liquid or gas or plasma\n\nI spoke informally. I did indeed mean that it is not solid in that it is mostly empty space. It seems solid because we perceive the electromagnetic force and because it is opaque to visible spectrum light. I was trying to use this to illustrate that we have evolved to view the world other than how it really is, but science allows us to understand things beyond those limitations.\n\n&gt;Is there anyone living on top of mount olympus? No?\n\nPerhaps he turns invisible whenever anyone goes to look. He might be a very private deity.\n\n&gt;It works the same with big foot and the loch ness monster.\n\nActually, there are animals we've assumed to be extinct but later found individuals of the species. The fact that we haven't found an animal isn't proof that it doesn't exist. We *could* be wrong about Bigfoot, but we almost certainly aren't.\n\n&gt;Why does cultural bias infuencing our belief in god make it any less valid?\n\nActually, it has no effect either way on the validity of the belief. I'm not saying it's less valid than any other conjecture, rather that it's equally valid. It is cultural bias that elevates the perceived validity above that of comparable claims.\n\n&gt;In fact, I'd say the whole point of religion is culture.\n\nReligion is an aspect of culture. Ontological claims about God are, in turn, features of many religions. But you don't have to be religious to believe in God, you don't need a holy book, and you don't need a cultural tradition. I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at, but my point was that cultural traditions reinforce beliefs we would otherwise comfortably discredit with the knowledge we gain since their inception. We should evaluate these claims objectively rather than through the lens of our culture, because universal truth isn't up for a vote.\n\n&gt;Are you saying that if god existed then belief in him would transcend the natural characteristics of man and mankind?\n\nI was only saying that our understanding has proven time and again to transcend the apparent limitations of our evolutionary history. I'm wondering why you're so quick to reason that we would not be able to comprehend something outside time and space. Science and mathematics are powerful tools, dealing comfortably in dimensionalities the human brain cannot otherwise conceive of. We can't picture four dimensional space time without resorting to math. We also can't lift a giant rock without resorting to a lever. We are good with tools.\n\n&gt;I wouldn't try to prove the existence of a god. And you've admitted the possibility of a divine being.\n\nIndeed, but as I said, I think this admission receives more attention than it deserves. It is treated as some sort of profound concession on the part of an atheist, but to the atheist, it's no more meaningful than admitting the possibility of unicorns or celestial teapots. \n\nThis conversation is often framed as a heavyweight matchup between those who believe and those who disbelieve, and it focuses on just the one question. The atheist, however, doesn't find the question particularly special or interesting. If he assumes the position of agnostic atheism, he is perceived as making a major concession to the \"other side\". If he assumes the position of gnostic atheism, he is perceived as being unreasonable. But if he assumes either of these positions with respect to other seemingly ridiculous claims, no one cares. I can't disprove the existence of unicorns, but this is no major concession. If I outright declare them nonexistent, no one thinks I am being unreasonable.

She wasn't wearing her seatbelt, and the force of the impact had thrown her out the front of the car. When the EMTs brought her to the ER, she was in pretty bad condition. Her heart rate was abnormal, her BP was low, and she was losing blood faster than we could replace it. The worst thing was that a piece of glass from the windshield had managed to puncture her abdomen, which was causing a lot of the blood loss. The amount of pain this woman must have been in was unimaginable. We (somehow) managed to stabilize her for the time being, but her condition was on and off over the next few days. She even went into cardiac arrest, but we managed to bring her back. After about a week of her being there, I was walking past her room, when she called me over. She sounded terrified. I came in and sat down on her bed. We made idle small talk for a bit, but eventually my pager went off and I had to go. As I was exiting, she called to me one last time, asking me for a favor. \"What do you need?\" I asked. She slowly looked up at me with those scared eyes, and said \"About tree fiddy.\" It was at this time that I noticed that this woman was in fact an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era.

It escalated to the point that this other kid had gotten his friends in the next school over to chase my brother and threaten him while he was walking home. When I heard about this, I told my brother, who had tried going to the teachers about it, that if this Luke kid keeps it up, you tell him you're going to punch him in the face. If he keeps it up, you punch him in the face.\n\nTwo days later, both of them are on suspension for the rest of the week. My mom understood the situation, so for my brother it was just time to play video games and work on homework. When he went back to school, he was seen as the good guy (the kid he punched was the grade asshole). He thought it was all over, until a van pulled up beside him, a woman got out, and told him \"If you even look at my son again, I'll make your life a living hell.\"\n\nYou see, this lady was a teacher. She didn't teach at that school, rather, she taught at the high school that I was attending (this is when I was in grade 10). I didn't know this teacher, never recognized her in the halls, and didn't even know what she looked like. All I knew was the name of this kid, making the teacher Mrs. N____.\n\nEnter 12th grade; this year. It turns out, I have Mrs. N____ first thing, first semester. Of course, she never did shit to my brother, but a threat's still a threat. So what did I do? Every single morning, I'd walk over to her desk and steal her pencils. Every single morning, she'd look on her desk for something to write with, and come up with nothing. Every single morning, she asked to borrow a pencil. One time though, she caught me and I thought the jig was up. It was at this point that I realized that my teacher was 500 feet tall and from the Palaeolithic era.

{"body": "&gt;Using the term “skeptic” to say “atheist” is not a matter of employing a synonym, but of concealing one’s atheism behind a euphemism.\n\nI'll have to disagree with this. How one can claim to be a skeptic and not also be an atheist by the reasonable application of that skepticism to god-claims is beyond me.\n\nSure, being an atheist does not necessarily mean you should assume someone is a skeptic, but being a skeptic does mean you should assume someone is an atheist. And if they aren't, then they are not applying their skepticism to at least one claim.\n\nAtheists, I agree, are not necessarily skeptics. They aren't necessarily intelligent, rational, or people who reject supernatural claims as unsupported by the evidence. It's wrong to assume that atheists are skeptics.\n\nBut it is not wrong to assume that a skeptic is an atheist. Atheism is a natural conclusion that comes from skepticism. If you say you're a skeptic, I naturally will assume you think dowsing and homeopathy is not true. You would not have to also go out of your way to point out you are not a believer in dowsing, because that's covered under the general umbrella of skepticism.\n\nThere are indeed many self-identifying skeptics who claim to be theists as well, but at the risk of a No True Scotsman, those people are not being good skeptics. I am far more bothered by a theist \"skeptic\" than I am by an unskeptical atheist, because the latter need not be intrinsically linked, but the former should be.\n\nI get that this entry is more about trying to say that atheists shouldn't be afraid to identify as such directly, and that they shouldn't hide behind the more-acceptable label of skeptic, but I do have to disagree with that one issue. Skepticism is absolutely synonymous with atheist, in the same way that it is synonymous with someone who doesn't believe in psychics or the Loch Ness monster.\n\nAtheists can believe literally anything as long as it's not in a god. Skeptics have a much more stringent set of things they can't (at least as long as the evidence for these things is insufficient) believe in while still legitimately claiming to practice skepticism. That includes not believing in a god, but also includes a whole host of other things.\n\n**Edit:** I'll also add that saying, \"I'm an atheist\" tells you only of my conclusion. Saying \"I'm a skeptic\" tells you how I came to my conclusion.

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied.\n\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\n\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\n\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.\n\nThey were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.\n\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\n\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\n\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\n\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.\n\ntl;dr: Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365654299", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;No one cares about the guns you've fired, you obviously have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to games.. Which is what this is, not a fire range ffs. Do you even know what aimassist and bullet magnetism are?\n\nI'm aware of my gun shooting history and you not caring. The point of that was not to declare I know better then others as you assumed. Next time, please read the full post before you make a comment.\n\nAs for aim assist and bullet magnetism, its hard to play since 01 and not know about those. So yes, I am aware of that which is exactly what I was hinting at when tweaking got brought up. Re-working those variables can act, as all other \"tweaks\" both in 343's favor and not. From what I've seen, the BR has a ridiculous amount of it, the DMR, not so much, but still a little more then acceptable. Aim assist plus bullet magnetism actually help decrease the overall skill gap currently, I'd ideally like for 343 to increase the skill gap so others start learning about the various niche's for each primary firearm. At this point, its just the commendations for which why players would switch between them besides there own personal reasons. This, I feel, is not good enough to inspire players to really use a gun during X gametype on Y map.\n\n&gt;It doesn't decrease a weapons efficiency it means to actually have to hit your shots instead of letting the game do it all for you. I think you're just scared they'll reduce aimassist on your favourite weapon and you won't be able to wreck people with no skill required.\n\nYou are mistaken. I'd rather enjoy a more healthy skill gap, but for those who aren't able or unwilling to fire guns in real life and do enjoy Halo, having that to help them is actually a blessing in disguise, one of which 343 needs to decide whether or not is in there best interest as much as those who complain about those currently. I personally believe I don't need as wide a skill gap to both enjoy the game and pull kills in matches. My K/D spread alone has a 1 kill and 1 assist for every death, regardless of gametype, solo searched or with a group, though a group generally pulls better numbers as I'm playing with people I know. another issue I have with Halo 4, but that is a topic for another time. Currently, I'm perfectly content with my statistics.\n\n&gt;Also \"why people do like and enjoy\" the people who understand the game want balanced multiplayer which requires a DMR nerf or a serious buff on other precision weapons.\n\nThe people who come online and express there opinions out of some misguided ideal that they know what the game should be like, based on prior experiences? Following that philosophy, we both know the ramifications of what happens to Halo if you pursue that with a different game and different mechanics naturally built in that prior Halo's never dreamed about implementing.\n\n&gt;And you've already mentioned fast kill times so I think you're contradicting yourself.\n\nthere's no way a single post is going to get this clearly across, so I'll merely explain this from a more simple perspective. This game, all games, do not follow, need ideas, or pull things from prior installments. Innovation for the sake of innovation is the founding principles which date back to the beginning of the paleolithic era, roughly 4,000 B.C.E.. Taking what the wheel has done and reinventing it is the only way progress will ever get made. Many can't understand why this is and heck, I didn't understand it till I took Humanities 303 from a professor who was a former marine and we sat up talking about this from a historical standpoint. Not one original concept in any video game, including Halo with aliens and alien warfare was not thought up by the time of 1 A.D.E.. You may not be able to believe that, but I'll let you go to college and do the research papers about the study of warfare throughout history to understand why things today are the way things are. The fact is, you don't do that research without realizing a few mistakes which have occurred in history and further realize that its all intertwined. Every single moment of it. Here's an all too possible reality: a video game today, inspires someone tomorrow to build the first slipspace drive and figure out how to make it work. How do you think nuclear power came about? He he, you'd die if I told you the answer. The point of this entire history lesson is simple: you think that because you understand a few measly game mechanics, know how to get a perfect Xsk, and call yourself knowledgeable about Halo, that somehow makes you more qualified to say how things should be? Each Halo game has had certain tendencies of which you have absolutely no power over. If 343 announced tomorrow they are nerfing the LR to a 6sk and 5sk when scoped, how many people do you think would use it outside of lightning CTf and the messed up gametype that is? How many other players would leave because of that?\n\nI don't pretend to say what SHOULD be better, I only say what COULD be better based on my opinion. Judging from where COD has gone with its current game, its more then possible the one thing separating Halo and COD (genre's) could very well be torn down and if it comes to that, yes there will still be differences, but the real question is not how many players would like that, its a bigger issue that I would ideally like to see Halo and COD mechanics farther apart so I could have two separate games with major differences, then two games with more similarities then differences. I am not talking about the entire package either. Just the multiplayer. Campaign Halo and COD will probably remain different. Spec Op's/Spartan Op's will probably remain different too. But the multiplayer is what keeps me with Halo long after I've completed achievements, commendations, and the max rank which, took me a full month to get to. Among other things, I'd ideally like to see 343 increase the memory cap so players have to hike there way to that. Gone is the day in Halo 3 when a five star general was earned, among other things.\n\nThe more you allow yourself to get caught up with these arguments, the more your going to find yourself thinking this stuff is ok. I've said it once and I'll say it again, there is two logical outcomes for this if it keeps up: Halo and COD have so many similarities it is minor changes at best which distinguish one from the other or what Halo is pushing currently... or Halo branches off and acknowledges the innovations which has kept the interest of Halo fans that are willing to enjoy whatever merits 343 pushes out. Like I said in my post, I don't care what 343 does, but if I had a choice, this is definitely a worry I have about how it will change the landscape for something I like currently and would like to be improved upon, not tweaked to whatever they think is right, we've all seen how well that has gone so far:\n\nForge Island - \"This is crap\", \"Wow. One glitch inside island found within first hour of release. Good job 343.\"\n\nAll DLC map releases so far - \"It doesn't have enough small/medium/big maps.\", \"Daybreak is too small for 6v6.\", \"*insert big map here* its too big, my normal sprint isn't getting me back to the action fast enough.\"\n\nCSR release - \"JIP matches are ruining my experience.\", \"I've got a ranking in a playlist I haven't ever entered before.\"\n\nHalo 4 release - Do I have to COUNT how many issues were presented then?\n\nIf 343 wants to do something, I'm all for letting them, but right now, they don't exactly have a credible history with implementing things right the first time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365666749", "subreddit": "halo", "score": -1, "controversiality": 1}

But before I can say science supports this, I have to gather empirical evidence. Once you have empirical evidence supporting something, your hypothesis gets upgraded to a Theory. At that point you can say science support your idea.\n\nLacking empirical evidence, you're hypothesis that aliens exist is exactly equal to someone saying that God exists, or that bigfoot exists, or that the Lochness monster is chilling out in Scotland asking for passers by for tree fiddy. ie.

Galaxies - approximately 100 billion or higher, and increasing as technology advancement continues.\nSource: http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=31\n\n2. Stars - approximately 100 billion in a galaxy, grows higher with advancement in technology\nSource: http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=31\n\n3. Universe is technically infinite, it is TEMPORARILY finite now, as it expands it gets bigger, by definition it is infinite and a held theory that has not be disproved from that angle.\nSource: http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/100805b.html\n\nFurthermore, from nasa, its stated galaxies have been estimated by powerful computers to even contain near 500 billion stars, and with approximately 100 billion galaxies, wether the universe was infinite or finite wouldnt matter, the known universe is large enough to make my claim more than viable with the sheer amount of proveable from reliable sources.\n\n4. God has already been disproved\nSource: Richard Dawkins, Freud, Peter Higgs, Carl Sagan, TJ Kirk, Stephen Hawking, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchins, any Atheist ever, etc etc.\n\n5. Also, your use of the word - empirical.... This data exists, it has been gathered, sources were listed, came from nasa. It exists beyond nasa, i dont have time to sit here and find every shred of information, look into it yourself. I dont have to conduct any of those, theyve already been implemented, i dont have to gather a thing. \n\n6. There we are carbon based life forms, who is to say that its the standard on other planets. Just as early seafaring explorers were ethnocentric due to the cultural lens that they used to view the world, they judged small-scale societies they discovered as not being “civilized” or as too “primitive” because they were based on a European scale of prejudice, fear, or ignorance (rather than extracultural or indigenous knowledge).  Alien life can be anything, even carbon based, from grass to a T rex. Even the combinations of species on our planet is a huge number, let alone the different varying life forms that have existed, exist and will exist on earth.\n\nSo, ill bend again, and even entertain that this is a leap, even with the sheer amount of emperical evidence i provided that has been indirectly available to all in the world since the birth of scientific intrest in humans....However this leap is not a 300 foot chasm, this leap, because of the mountain of data we posess, is more of a 6 inch gap and this is why...\n\n7. The possibility for life on other planets appears to be greater than originally thought; however, the chances of getting there to study or colonize a planet that could sustain human life would be nearly impossible to reach in our lifetimes or in the lifetimes of many generations thereafter. \n\nIf we get to or not, doesnt change the fact that its out there, im not concerned with \"insufficient data\".\n\nThe statistical probability in combination with the amount of known stars in a galaxy, and the amount of known galaxies, and the amount of known carbon based life forms, and the amount of recently discovered potential habitable planets in the \"goldilocks zones\" discovered so far is sufficient emperical evidence that the possibility for life on other planets in the known universe is pretty damn substantial.\n\nIn summation the leap im making IS based on emperical evidence and is no where even relateable to your Stonehenge/Nessie comparison of my thoughts. Also, the entire universe is made up of the same matter. Earth, our solar system, the Milky Way all have the same \"building blocks\" as any other star, galaxy, etc. Our galazy, as the rest are all part of the expanding universe from the result of the big bang, traveling at the same speeds, with VERAFIABLE proof that the closer the the center of the expansion, the speed is slower and the further away the expansion is faster, spherical and flat. Earth, The milky way galaxy, our solar system is not unusual. Billions of solar systems exist, exist in galaxies like ours, enough so to where i can make my leap and clear ten feet, and ten more after that, for a week, go on a vacation, and leap a couple hundred yards... Look, we exist, like i said we have the same building blocks as all of these metric fuckton of possible combinations to the 17th power. Ill bet my left and right nut at least 1 other planet has walking talking beings getting handies and beating their children like the rest of us, period.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365674525", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Back in college I was part of a student organization that had lots of conventions all over the world, both close to home and abroad. I attended whenever money allowed, which was around 6-8 times a year.\n\nThese conventions had very, very crazy parties on absolutely every night for 3-7 days straight, so sex was extremely common. Just imagine around 200-500 20 year olds staying in a hotel, with a 1:1 girl to guy ratio, with all sorts of different exotic curvy bodies and accents and lots of booze to boot.\n\nTo save on money rooms were usually shared between 2 to 4 people. When you were gonna hook up with someone it was polite to talk with your roomies so that they could crash somewhere else so no one would get uncormftable; but sometimes circumstances just wouldn't allow it. I vividly remember a couple fucking in the bunk below me, and not stopping after I went up to the bathroom. They actually got quite a lot ouder after I lied down again. There are also stories about public BJs, cum loads landing on the wrong person, anal gone wrong *with other people suffering the consecuences*, and much more.\n\nOn one particular conference in Puerto Rico, I ended up making out with this German girl. On the next night, I ended up drukenly crashing in a random bed in a random room, while there was this extremely innocent Asian girl and a pretty slutty girl from Boston in the bed right next to me. Little did I know that this bed was where the german girl was sleeping, and when she came back she made sure to wake me up in the best way possible ;) . The thing is that we really didn't care much about the people that were 2 feet away, and did everything possible: BJ, Doggy, no lube anal...\n\nThe next morning I woke up to the asian girl crying, and the Boston slut comforting her and explaining how sex wasn't necessarily as dirty as what she had seen all night long. The asian girl just said, and I'll never forget this: \"I feel so violated, I didn't even know you could take it in the ass... I think sex will be ruined for me when I try it...\". So the german girl just told her \"Don't worry, I just did it for the tree fiddy\".\n\nAnd that's when I realized she was just the Loch Ness monster and I wasn't gonna give him no goddamn tree fiddy.\n\n**TL;DR: They noticed alright**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365701037", "subreddit": "sex", "score": -2, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I am a born and raised Colombian. While my country is now much more safe, my childhood was riddled with stories about abductions, murders, violence and the like. My worst memory is from when I was just 4, back in 1991... At the time Pablo Escobar was in full swing, bombing whatever he saw fit for whatever reason he could muster up, usually just to piss off the government. The FARC, Colombia's dissident faction, were doing the same but even more often. It was not a nice time to be a Colombian.\n\nI lived in Medellin (Escobar's native city and the most dangerous place you could be throughout that decade) with my loving parents and my 2 brothers, Andrés and Camilo. Andrés was barely 2 and Camilo was about 7. [My memory concerns this bomb](http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-27199), which was planted just 5 days after my late brother's birthday, January 17th. We were spending time close to the city's bullring. If I remember correctly my Camilo wanted to buy a toy bull that he had seen at school and found cool. It was a Thursday, but both my parents were off work for a reason I don't remember.\n\nAfter buying the toy, we went to a nearby restaurant to have lunch. I will never forget this day, but specifically I will never forget the details of our lunch and what occured right after. Camilo, my dad and I all ordered a \"Bandeja Paisa\" a typical dish from Medellin. Camilo and I were sharing ours (that thing is huge and we were just kids!). Andrés was eating some homemade food my mom brought and my mom had grilled chicken breast.\n\nCamilo and I started fighting over our food, and in a tantrum I threw his new bull toy to the street. It landed in front of a white Mazda. My mother scolded me and told me to go get it, but I was being a little prick and refused. So camilo was the better man and went for it... To this day I cry a little whenever I remember this moment...\n\nAs Camilo got within about 2 meters of the car, it violently exploded. The FARC were tying to kill some cops who owned it, but they took out around 10 civilians with them... We all watched as Camilo flew through the air towards us, hitting and shattering the wood fence over which I had thrown the stupid bull. My ears were burst from the explosion, but I felt no pain. I could only watch my dying brother at my feet, lying on the fence. One of his eyes was shredded by shrapnel, he lost most of his right hand's fingers and his gut was torn open in 2 different places. It was unbearable. Hell, writing this is still unbearable...\n\nBut somehow he was still alive, and was looking at me with his only eye left. He looked at me directly, not blaming me for what had happened but I knew he was telling me it was ok, he was letting me know that it wasn't my fault... I was coming out of the initial shock and a tear escaped my eye when he said his last words: \"You still owe me my tree fiddy\". And that's when I realized he was not my brother at all and just the goddam Loch Ness Monster. Good riddance!\n\n**TL;DR: Saw my brother die to a bomb in Colombia when we were 4 and 6.

{"body": "Ok, here goes.\n\nI was working at an assemblyman's office in NJ and I was an intern for several months and I thought it would be a seasonal job to just put on my resume, but upon graduating from college, I was given a great recommendation to be passed on to the office of the governor where I transfered and had an office that I shared with one other person-- MY new intern. I was a 23 year old legislative budget manager with a 19 year old intern who was a drop-dead stunner and unfairly flirtatious. She had a really sexy name but for obvious reasons let's call her \"Aubry\" (equally sexy).\n\nWell I had a full-size executive, oak desk and she had a more modest work station with no drawers of it's own, so one day Aubry came in wearing her typical tight-cut business skirt, with matching heels and almost sheer, wispy blouse. This girl was a tease and she embraced the hell out of it. She sat down and with the worst acting, asked \"ohhh... would you mind if I kept some of my things in your desk drawer for safe-keeping during lunch, because my desk [she motions to the very industrial looking, bare desk] just doesn't have what a girl needs...\" I, at this point, have to just go with it, so I stop typing and ask, \"And that is...?\" At that moment, she seductively raises an eyebrow, gives a little 1/2 grin with her bright red lips and very deliberately uncrosses, then slowlyyyyy recrosses her legs to reveal a glimpse of bare perfection, all while maintaining perfect eye contact, then says, \"a **big** desk, with **big** drawers would let a girl spread out a little more in the office...\" I was starting to sweat, this was not happening. Then as she stood up, gathered her purse and slowly walked over to me, never breaking eye contact, she said, \"Well lunch is in 10 minutes, so can I ask you something?\" Now stumbling over my words, I say \"Sure\", and she said, \"I only have my ID on me today, could you lend me some money to cover a salad... and we can come back while everyone's... on lunch?\" I immediately ask her how much. She put both hands on my desk, straightened her legs and leaning over, while displaying the most perfectly sculpted breasts that could *barely* be contained by her bra, she motions forward with her index finger and says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Aubry was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.\nI stood there screaming at her as she jumped into the Delaware river and swam off into the distance.\n\nAs for that career path, I decided that I was in way over my head and the repercussions for making even the most minor mistake, no less one with an intern, were catastrophic. Aubry was as close as you're gonna get to the best bad decision of your life.\n\n**tl;dr: 10/10 would totally make this awesome, once in a life time, bad decision again.**\n\n**&amp; Governor Christie is a beast wingman.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365705221", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 1}

A good segue is important so it seems to flow naturally from the first part of the story.\n\nThere is also a technique that dictates a situation from the perspective of a famous character without revealing the fact that it is not a personal story. Details are omitted or reworded so that it seems relevant to the thread and plausible that it occurred in someone's real life, and ideally the only time the audience realizes that it is actually a story about a famous character is when they get to the last line.

I went downstairs and nobody in my house cared, and when I went outside little kids were hugging me and calling me a hero and stuff like that. I just started walking to a bus stop when a women approached me, she was scared out of her mind and she said her baby was stuck hanging off of a cliff. I ran over there as fast as I could, strangely I ran like a human and it was really slow and sloppy, but eventually I got there. I remember the sky was red, like a really deep red that looks like a rose and a bit like blood. The baby was hanging off the cliff and screaming for my help, in a mans voice which creeped me out a bit. I walked up to the cliff and reached down to grab the baby. SUddenly the cliff collapsed a bit and I was stuck hanging off the cliff while the baby was hanging onto my arm. I screamed for the mom to help me, and she ran over. She looked tired and scared, but I knew I had to help them. I told he to grab on, and she did, and sunk her feet into the dirt. \n\nI couldn't take the weight at this point, I was straining to hang on and the baby screamed and screamed, until he quieted down and started grabbing at my shoulders. I thought he was trying to climb me, so I positioned myself so the baby could crawl over me and to the mom.\n\nAs I sat there looking down the cliff, deep down into that infinite abyss, I heard the baby start to sob and he started putting more weight on my shoulders. The mom sounded more scared then ever before, but she said she had a plan. I yelled out to just do whatever it took to get the baby up the cliff. She told me she would need something from me, and I was scared because I thought she was going to tell me to let go. If I let go the baby wouldn't be stuck on my shoulders and he would be saved. I took a deep breath, wiped back tears with my dangling arm, and asked her what she needed.\n\nShe said, \"I'mma need about tree fiddy.\" It was at this point I realised she 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.\n\n\"God dammit Loch Ness monster, I ain’t gonna give you no tree fiddy!\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365713547", "subreddit": "MLPLounge", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

It was a balmy spring evening when my buddies and I decided it was time to shred the pavement in our suburban neighborhood like we often did. We gathered in a cul-de-sac that my friend Brian lived in cause he had a sweet rail we could set up and grind on, or hurt ourselves pretty good, all dependent on variables beyond our control.\n\nAnyhow, about 30 minutes into our street skating performance, which was something nearly out of Tony Hawk Pro skater game(if the skaters were retarded and inebriated), this neighbor lady came out of her front door yelling at us, walking 3 houses down and onto our side of the street/Brian's driveway.\n\nThis lady was losing her shit, saying we had been hitting her dog with our skateboards(wtf?) and we, being the whitest, nicest kids you could buy at a farmers market, were terrified.  After a few minutes of her yelling at us with great confusion and our weak attempts at arguing, a neighborhood figure we called Weird Tony showed up.\n\nWeird Tony was in his twenties and was equal parts badass and loser, with a dash of creepy tossed in for flavor. He would usually be wearing a white wife beater and jeans, mixing up the look from time to time with one of his many Metallica t-shirts. This guy had a collection. He was tall, muscular, and Mexican - in our eyes his background was more spicy than a jalepeno. He lived with his parents, worked at Jack in the Box part time, and attended some kind of Auto Mechanic trade school; Weird Tony loved cars. But creme de la creme was the hushed rumor that he had been arrested once while trying to steal a car, and once for lighting off fireworks at the local high school during school hours. Basically a straight up badass to us kids.\n\nWeird Tony was nice enough, but always a little dark and angsty, listening to music way too hard for our tastes, and our parents had banned us from associating with him. If you wanted a 6 pack of beer or some fireworks though, he was your guy.\n\nAnyways, so Weird Tony walks up in the middle of our arguing and is like 'Hey. Why are ju messing with these keeds?'. The crazy neighbor lady loses it, starts screaming YOU BACK OFF YOU STUPID MEXICAN, MY UNCLE IS A POLICE OFFICER, Blablablah, poking him in the chest. Weird Tony is all calm and just says, hey, what can we do to fix this or help you? And the lady calms down a bit and says, 'hmm, I'll need about... tree fiddy'. It was around this time that I noticed that it was no neighbor lady, but a 12 story tall monster from the paleolithic era: the god-damn Loch Ness Monster. And I said Monster!

So I stop, turn around and I see nothing. Anyway I think to myself its getting late so I'm probably getting tired so I continue but after like a few seconds I hear the faint footsteps again. This time I see this figure in a beige trenchcoat, khakis that has been apparently behind me by like 20 feet. At this point. I'm thinking \"i'm going to be mugged...\" but I ignore as if the figure is following me at all and I just quicken my pace home.  \nSo here I am...desperately hoping there's someone walking on the streets outside of us that isnt also sketchy..and apparently I have bad luck.\nI only went for an additional uh..30-40feet? and I see someone putting their hand on my shoulder firmly. and I have this \"fight or flight\" response and adrenaline racing through me.  \nSo then I hear a voice \"hey\" and he places a knife against my throat\nlike the tone of his voice didnt sound too threatening but I'm basically doomed...so I just calmly stood around not turning around.\nI distinctly remember...\"I'm not going to hurt you and I'm sorry but I'm going to have to ask you for your money, I need it for my high\" so guessing..maybe a weed or coke user? I wouldnt know....  \nSo I'm sitting there thinking...\"well..shit I'm about to get mugged for the first time in my life great...\"\nAnd hes like \"youre a uni or college kid?\" so I just say \"yes...\" and he tells me how he just needs a few bills and he'll be off on his way. So at least I'm not going to be hurt..I think. So looking at the ground, I respond \"alright man, just relax, I'll co-operate, just tell me how much you need\"  \nHe withdraws his knife a little bit which calms me and says \"Tree Fiddy\"  \nThats when I turned around and realized This was no ordinal figure but one that was 9 feet tall with a huge wingspan and it was that god damn lochness monster and I said \"God damn it lochness monster, you arent getting my tree fiddy\"  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365733233", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

This not only enhanced my natural reading talents, but also created a connection between the two of us that held strong throughout my parents' divorce. I just now realized that you might be suspecting me to be driven by the loch ness monster asking for tree fiddy, but this is legit i swear.

She has since passed away maybe three or four years after I read that scene to her and I am sure that it would make me tear up just as badly, maybe even more, as before. Not only because In feared for the life of a character that held my mother and I together, but also for my mother who, pretending or otherwise, cried with me and consoled me through my first true feeling of loss. Which ultimately helped me come into grips with her death damn near 5 years ago. \n* TL;DR: Butler was not only a character that I held close to my heart, he was a manifestation of my mother's love for me.

I hear a knock on the door so I check it out. It's this hot chick! But she is trying to sell me magazine subscriptions, and I was such a nice guy that I just let her talk and talk, plus she was hot and rocking some cleavage.

After we argued about how poor I actually was for a few minutes, she gave up and asked if she could come inside for a drink of water. (big mistake)\n\nI agreed, playing a few porno fantasies in my head of how this could go down, and in she came. We both sat on the couch and talked while she sipped on some water and told me about her day.

She asked to use the bathroom and I agreed, while rehearsing polite yet firm lines to say that would ask her to leave.\n\nShe comes out from the bathroom a bit later looking amped up, talking fast and seems excited.

Not proof of nonexistence.\n\n&gt;you are the one positing that god does/might exist so the burden of proof lies with you\n\nI'm not asserting anything. I'm an agnostic atheist. You're a 'strong' atheist, namely, you have asserted, specifically, that *god does not exist*. The burden of proof lies on the claimant. I'm not the claimant, I'm just judging your claim.\n\n&gt;if the only proof you have of the possible existence of god is your words, you have failed the burden of proof and therefore, your argument is invalid and wrong\n\nAgain, I have provided no proof because I didn't intend to prove god's existence. I'm saying that *asserting that god doesn't exist is as fallacious as to say that he does exist.\n\n&gt;this hypothetical god of yours requires you to make up a list of attributes and properties that allow this hypothetical god to remain ever elusive. Occam's Razor says \"among competing hypotheses, the one that makes the fewest assumptions should be selected.\"\n\nHow do you know what god I'm speaking of? Besides, I already hold the one with the fewest assumptions that fit our criteria of god--omniscient, creator of the universe, and omnipotent.\n\n&gt;a BIG part of existing is having a presence in reality, which your hypothetical god not only does not have, but one of the attributes of said god is to be able to remain outside of reality.\n\nWow, your arguments are wearing thin now. I have a feeling you're hiding behind a wall of text again. Don't fret, I'll answer every single one, piece by piece.\n\n&gt;the very fact that your hypothetical god requires special attributes to remain ever elusive and always just outside of our ability to perceive falls into the god of the gaps fallacy[1]\n\nCorrect, but irrelevant since this is not proof of nonexistence.\n\n&gt;overall, your hypothetical god is NOTHING more than your imagination and a fantasy. if you believe otherwise, i look forward to your explanation of how you think that is.\n\nAgain, I never asserted that god exists. In fact, I think it is a rather unlikely scenario. However, I am intelligent enough (and not enough of an idiot) to think that asserting that something unknowable doesn't exist is as fallacious as asserting that it does exist.\n\n**The most logical position in matters such as these is to leave it alone.

Of course I'm not speaking adamantly here, much like science theoretically hasn't proven a single thing since its conception. But that would be bending the truth, wouldn't it?\n\n&gt;a hypothesis that REQUIRES lists of attributes that said god MUST have to be \"unknowable\"\n\nYes, and?\n\n&gt;also, didn't you just say that you were not saying that god exists?\n\nYeah, I never said he exists. You were implying that 'my' god had a plethora of hypotheses, and I said no. *If* a god exists, he'd have to have the characteristics mentioned for me to classify it as a god.\n\n&gt;i am, in fact, a practitioner of non-nessyism. i will happily prove that the Lock Ness monster also does not exist. \n\nJesus Christ, you dolt. You don't understand the philosophical side of this. *You can't prove a negative*. To do that you'd have to be omniscient. To prove that the Loch Ness monster doesn't exist, you'd have to have infallible knowledge of the entire universe. Do you have that?\n\n&gt;and for the record, saying that \"we do not know everything so we cannot know for sure that god does not exist\" is not reasonable. when you consider the probability of such existence, it is absurd.\n\nGood, it seems you have understood my point.

In fact, it is so ridiculously absurd that I call the Abrahamic religions extremely moronic.\n\n*However.*\n\nIt's important to know that neither I, nor you, can prove that god doesn't exist.

I explained that they use a darker-spectrum laser so that you can use them normally on transparent surfaces such as glass tables, something which older optical mice had issues with. \n\nHere's where this goes from awkward to just plain weird. The guy starts laughing and giggling to himself, then turns to me and the other employee helping him, and says \"Glass tables!? You know only perverts own glass tables!\" very loudly. I exchanged awkward looks with my employee and kept rambling on about the features of the mouse...then he says \"You wanna know why that is!?\" and before I even have a chance to respond, he says *\"It's so you can sit underneath it while a sexy lady takes a dump on it!\"* I remember it verbatum because it was the creepiest thing I'd ever heard anyone say (in a COMPLETELY non ironic fashion!) outside of the internet.\n\nI can only explain my feelings at that moment as a cross between nausea, horror, and TOTAL fucking hilarity.

{"body": "Yes. Long story: Last semester, there was this girl in one of my philosophy classes who was really intriguing. Redhead, really bright green eyes, great hourglass figure wrapped in the irresistible combo of hipster scarves and ironic t-shirts. She was the adorable artsy type that I would find really attractive just walking across campus, but since I got to hear her talk in class all the time, I didn't need to feel guilty about being shallow; her brain was just as hot as the rest of her. Honestly I could barely follow what her opinions were, because she played devil's advocate all the time and used her witty humor to run circles around everyone else. In a way, that was my downfall.\n\nI generally consider myself a smart guy, and I could usually keep up with the discussion even if I couldn't tell when this girl was being serious or just goofy. And I usually could poke holes in other people's arguments. But I felt like this girl was entirely out of my league unless and until I could demonstrate something close to her wit. I actually became one of the top contributors in the class just with that goal in mind, and things went pretty well. Pretty often we would just go back and forth with each other, and it felt like we were building chemistry without even dating. She certainly seemed to enjoy it as much as I did.\n\nFinally, a couple of weeks after midterms, I'd got to the point where I thought she was pretty impressed with me. It was time to make my move. So after class one day, I stopped her to ask some trivial question about her opinion on Kant's absolutist prohibition of lying, and as soon as the rest of the class had filed past, I asked her out. It took some serious nerve, at least considering how much I'd built her up in my mind, but oh wonder of wonders, she accepted with a grin, and even said she'd been waiting for me to ask. We made plans to go see *Skyfall*. So far, so awesome.\n\nSo we went to the movie that Friday night, and agreed that it was better than *Quantum of Solace,* but a little short of *Casino Royale.* Soon we started talking about *The Master*, and moved on from that to Scientology, psychology of religion, etc. It turned out that one-on-one, she was a lot more serious, less erratic about her arguments, but just as smart. We talked for nearly four hours, and by the end of it I was entirely in love with her. I started working myself up for going for a kiss, but before I got there, she floored me by checking the time and saying, \"It's too late for you to come back to my room. I guess we'll have to be content with your car, huh?\" I stammered like an idiot, the first time I'd been at a loss for words all night. Fortunately she was already invested, and it didn't faze her. Off came the hipster scarf, then the ironic t-shirt, and we started making out right there in the car. She didn't even want to pause to move to the back seat, but asked me if I had a condom.\n\nNow see, there was an interesting thing that came up in philosophy class. Fairly early on, before I knew her style well, she made an argument that sperm are really indistinguishable from toddlers if we are talking about potential for human consciousness. Okay, not entirely indistinguishable, I figured she meant, since she was just poking holes in someone else's definition, not explaining her own theory in full. I had long since forgotten about that discussion. Big mistake. Now, in my car, the dry humping was not helping my judgment any as I pulled a condom out of my pocket. \"I'll put it on with my mouth,\" she said. \"Special skill.\" My focus was on her fantastic boobs when she tore open the condom packet. A moment later, my penis was surrounded by the welcoming warmth of her lips and tongue (holy hell, did I mention she had a tongue piercing?), and took all my effort to avoid cumming right then. Pretty soon she was riding me, rolling her hips to great effect, and I was the happiest man in the world. After a few minutes, she sped up, threw her head back, and moaned, \"I want it, I waaaant it!\" \"What do you want?\" \"About tree fiddy,\" she said. And right then I realized that this gorgeous redhead with the fantastic figure and charming intellect was actually the motherfucking loch ness monster. She leapt off my cock and begin swimming away to join Cthulhu. Holy fucking shit.\n\n**TL;DR: Beautiful, intelligent girl from philosophy class turned out to have some really weird desires.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365817530", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Our first race was against two newer 350z's. We new we couldn't win but it was too late to back out. So we raced them anyway and they wound up destroying us.im kinda pissed off cause it was a bit unfair so i just yell at them..so how much do i owe u,you cheating bastards.and all they said was, about three fiddy.it was about this time that i realized i was race event for 8 story tall loch ness monsters.so i immediately yelled no loch ness monster i aint giving you no three fiddy and sped off.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365950537", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in Year 9 I had the chance to go a International School in Scotland for 6 weeks over summer, which I jumped to as I had previously never been overseas and missed the end of school for. It was extremely multicultural as I met sons of Qatari Sheikhs to South African national rugby players as well as celebrities kids (became good friends with Matthew Fox's daughter, met him on the last day, ripper bloke). \n\nAnyway, the multicultural part is the main aspect to my story. The main class everyone had was English Language and the teacher, let's call him Dr. Z, was an accentric... albeit racist American from Northern Florida IIRC. He would constantly drop in smartass remarks about the Middle East and ramble on about how America isn't doing enough to \"reevaluate\" these countries. This is in front of the kids who will one day rule these countries. The worst comment he made was when he befriended, to a degree, another American student in the class and loudly called out, i'd rather not say, but an offensive slur about Middle Easteners to the kids awkward dismay. This was barely the beginning though, as one night he exploded out of no where.\n\nWe had all become friends in the first 4 weeks and one night we decided to sneak out of the boarding house and make our way to this hut the school owned by a lake. As we were sneaking out a light came on from the teachers ward. We ran but a friend of ours (Iranian, if i believe) was caught in the middle of it. Dr. Z looked at him, with his eyes glowing in anger, screamed out \"Stay the fuck there\" ran out of his room, up to my friend and just as he was about to, what looked like hitting him, screamed in his face \"Where ma tree fiddy?!?!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365962885", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There was a little boy who had been struck by a car speeding in his neighborhood. The driver kept on driving, and didn't even stop to see if the boy was alive (according to witness reports). I arrived on the scene, and it was traumatic. This little boy was lying in a puddle of blood, with a huge gash in his head. He had smashed his skull on the curb extremely hard after being hit. We put him in the ambulance, to take him to the nearest trauma center. Unfortunately, it was a fair distance away. The boy had regained consciousness, and I have honestly to this day never seen somebody so terrified. He kept asking me where all the blood was coming from, and all I could say was that he needed to relax, and that everything would be okay. There was no calming him, though. He kept saying \"Am I going to die?\". And every time, I would say \"You're going to be okay, buddy, I promise.\" \n\nBut the bleeding wouldn't stop. We were still 10 minutes from the hospital when his pulse started to get dangerously low, and his BP started to drop significantly. I did all I could, but my efforts were futile. This kid, who couldn't have been more than 13, was going to die in the back of my ambulance. He knew it, too. His eyes, barely able to stay open at this point, fluttered open as he looked at me. He whispered to me in a raspy voice that he knew I tried my best to save him, and that he only wanted one thing before he died. With tears in my eyes, I responded \"What do you need?\" \"About tree fiddy.\" It was at this moment that I realized the dying boy in the back of my ambulance was an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. \"You goddamn lochness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I said.

{"body": "It's a suburban neighborhood. In the suburbs. You know like King of the Hill? Like that. Houses and stuff.\n\nSo anyway, it's nighttime, right? And there isn't any police or night watch, because it's the suburbs, and there's barely any crime. One house in particular is bigger than the others, because the family that owns it is rich as fuck. They're not even rich, they're wealthy. They have lots of money and wealth I mean. Except it's actually not a family, it's two people. Husband and wife.\n\nThe man has man boobs and is your typical sorta fat looking suburban guy. Just imagine a sorta chubby hank hill wearing a white shirt. Except he doesn't sell propane OR propane accessories, he's a corporate guy. A guy who works in the corporate field of business and corporate things. He deals in corporate stuff. So he makes a lot of money and drinks coffee and drives to work in his magnificent goddamn motherfucking sweet as fuck Lamborghini Porsche Corvette Honda. It's shiny as fuck and it's black. He could keep it in his massive garage in his massive house, but he keeps it outside, even at night, because he's rich and wants to show off. Also it's the suburbs, so no one's gonna steal it.\n\nEveryone's pretty well off in the suburbs, even though this guy has a house twice the size of the rest of them, no one really cares. This guy's name is Steven Mervin. It's saturday in the morning and he wakes up and fucks his hot ass wife. His wife is real hot, and she doesn't have a job. Her only job is pretty much to stay at home and wait til he gets home from work so they can fuck. She cooks also. She's your typical housewife, which is kind of pathetic, considering they don't have kids. She barely does anything. I mean most people nowadays work. Your typical household has both parents working, especially in the city. But this chick, she doesn't need to, because her man boob husband is rich, so she just stays at home watching netflix or some shit, after cooking and cleaning. Not much to clean though. They live alone, it's only two people, that's why there's not much to clean. She drinks wine and shit.\n\nAnyway, after fucking his hot ass wife, Linda, Steve goes off to work. He changes into his sexy looking corporate business suit, and just leaves the house. He waves to his neighbor Bob as he gets into the Lamborghini Porsche Corvette Honda, and Bob waves back, and forces a smile. Linda stands on the porch and waves bye to Steve and he waves back.\n\nBob watches his rich ass neighbor leave in his Lamborghini Porsche Corvette Honda, watches his hot ass wife Linda go back inside the house, and feels extremely jealous. Bob is a mediocre looking man. Real mediocre. His looks are filled with mediocrity, that's why he looks mediocre, because that's what he's filled with. Mediocrity. Bob lives alone, even though he's in the suburbs. You'd imagine a guy in the suburbs to have at least a family or a wife, but he doesn't. He lives alone. He was watering his rose garden when he saw Steve get in his rich ass car and drive away to his fancy job. He got real mad. He didn't even finish watering his roses, he just went back in the house, really angry because he was so mad.\n\nAt six in the evening when the sun was going down in the land of Suburbia, that smug twat came home in his Lamborghini Porsche Corvette Honda, looking smug as fuck with his happiness and hot wife, that Bob got mad again. Bob looked at him leave his rich ass car and kiss his wife hard as fuck with tongues. She had been waiting on the porch, because that's what she does, she's a lame housewife who doesn't have a goddamn job. They kissed like fuck and went back in the house. Bob closed the curtain and started pacing back and forth in his living room, angry at how much better his neighbor's life was than his own.\n\nLinda had made mashed potatoes and gravy and some chicken or some shit. The table was covered with this food in dishes and shit and it was still hot. She had put a lot of work into and and it took a few hours to make. Because that's all she does. She makes food and that's it. Because she's a lame housewife.\n\nSo anyway her and Steve come into the house and Steve throws off his shoes and tie and starts getting undressed while they kiss. Pretty soon they're both naked and fucking on the floor, because Linda's a real hot piece of ass that Steve fucks a lot. They're going doggy style and Linda's blond and her huge sexy tits swing back and forth as Steve pounds her in her tight, wet pussy and she yelps like a dog with each thrust. Pretty soon he switches and is pounding her in the ass.\n\n\"OH ANAL SEX IS GREAT YOU SHOULD TRY IT EVEN IF YOU'RE STRAIGHT!\" Steve screams.\n\n\"OH BREAKING BAD IS A REALLY GOOD TV SHOW GOD YOUR COCK IS HUGE I LOVE YOU\"! Linda screams.\n\nOnce they finished they ate dinner and after dinner they fucked again. They fuck a lot.\n\nAnyway, during the time of the night when the moon was in the sky and the wolves howled a great song of beauty, Bob gave birth. He has a special ability and can give birth, and this story sucks so I refuse to explain more. ^^^deal ^^^with ^^^it\n\nBob gives birth to a small baby and places it on their porch in the night time. The baby is small because it's a baby and babies are small. That's why the baby is small, because it's a baby. Bob left the small baby which was small on the goddamn porch, spat on Steve's Lamborghini Porsche Corvette Honda, and went back home, feeling he'd accomplished something. *That'll show em*, he thought, *those fucking bitches having better lives than me.*\n\nThe next day Steve woke up, fucked his wife, and went out on the porch with Linda to go off to work. Unfortunately, once they got outside, they say the small baby on the porch.\n\n\"HOLY FUCK WHAT THE FUCK!\" Steve screams as he sees the baby. \"Why is there a goddamn baby on the porch?\"\n\n\"I don't know...\" Linda says, confused.\n\n\"I have to go to work, we'll figure this out once I get home. Take care of it until then, feed it or something,\" Steve ordered, and Linda, like a good housewife, obeyed. She said bye to him and took the baby inside. Once she got inside, she took out her huge tit and let the baby suck on it. The baby sucked on Linda's sexy ass tit with fervor, and Linda smiled because it felt pretty good. Meanwhile, Bob was back in his house, cackling because everything was going according to plan.\n\nOnce Steve got home in his Lamborghini Porsche Corvette Honda, he went to Linda on the porch.\n\n\"I'd love to fuck you but we need to do something about the baby,\" Steve said.\n\n\"I fucking agree,\" Linda fucking agreed.\n\nSuddenly Bob jumped over the fence and ran to them, cackling like crazy. \"HAHA, TAKE THAT BITCHES, THAT'LL SHOW YA!\"\n\n\"Bob?\" Steve asked, \"What the fuck?\"\n\n\"I put the baby there! It's mine! I gave birth to it!\" he screamed.\n\n\"What?\" Linda asked, shocked, \"What the fuck?\"\n\n\"Why would you do that?\" Steve asked, \"What the hell, man? What's your problem with us?\"\n\n\"You're so fucking happy! Showing off with your big ass house and sexy wife while I live in mediocrity, fuck you!\" Bob screamed.\n\n\"What do you want from us? We did nothing wrong!\" Linda said.\n\n\"You want to know what *I* want? You want to know what I *need?*\"\n\n\"What?\" Steve asked, \"What do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this point that Steve and Linda realized that their neighbor Bob was actually 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era, and the baby was its spawn. That damn monstah had got em again! \"Goddamn it monstah, we ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" Steve screamed as the monster and it's baby waddled away, crushing the Lamborghini Porsche Corvette Honda beneath their feet.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365983349", "subreddit": "worststory", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

What time?\n\nMe: How about 7?\n\nBoss: Perfect! \n\nAs I fly home I think about what I should make for my family and the bossman. Should I make a tasty ham, maybe a nice steak. \n\nI land in my driveway and go inside and go to the kitchen. I open the refrigeratior and its empty! I look back at the couch and see that my wife has eaten all the food! That pig! \n\nI get back on my jetpack and I start flying to the store only to find them closed. Great. As I fly back home, I look at the time, its 6 o'clock. Great, one hour until my boss gets here!\n\nI walk into my house thinking of what I should do. What am I going to do? Kill my wife? Ha, I'm funny. Wait... Maybe that isn't such a bad idea. We've been thinking about getting a divorce for a year now and she ate all the food! \n\nI see her sitting on the couch, watching Opera and eating bonbons as she usually does. How am I going to kill her, carve her, cook her AND dispose of the body in under an hour?\n\nI look to my right and I see a large metal fan and think, maybe this will work. I take the fan outside and I remove the cover for the fan blades. This should do perfectly! \n\nSlowly I creep up behind her with the fan. I turn it on and I run and point it to her neck, hopefully chopping her neck clean off.\n\nHey! It worked! Her neck came clean off. I see her dead body and get a small erection, but decide I don't have enough time for that so I carry her dead and lifeless dead body to the table then I proceed to cut her into pieces. I turn the oven on and put the meat in. \n\nI rush to hide her body. I go to the elevator and take us to our third floor. I exit the elevator and lay her down. Her dead body looking sexy. I look at my watch and see that its 6:55! My boss will be here in 5 minutes!\n\nI rush back to the elevator and check on my wife in the oven, perfect. I take it out and try a piece, delicious! I set the table and clean up a bit while I wait for my boss.\n\nMy boss is finally here. I invite him in and we sit at the dinning room table. \n\nStill thinking about my wife's body, I start getting another erection. I accidently burn myself to get rid of my erection.\n\nMy boss and I start eating. He says \"This meat tastes funny, but in a good way. I like it.\"\n\nAfter we finish eating he asks what kind of meat this was. I reply with \"Pork! Nice and fresh pork!\" trying not to act suspicious.\n\n\"Well this is some good pork! I might have to get your recipe!\"\n\nI sit in shock trying to come up with something to say.\n\n\"Well Sir, the recipie is a family secret, passed on for many generations now.\"\n\nEverything stays silent.\n\n\"Matthew, I have some bad news and some good news, what would you like first?\"\n\nI ask for the good news first\n\n\"I'm promoting you to Manager! \n\nScared I ask \"Whats the bad news, Sir?\"\n\n\"You have blood everywhere! In your living room, in this kitchen and going down the hallway going towards your elevator.\"\n\n\"Well, Sir, the thing is, my wife ate all the food! I was forced to kill her and make her! \n\n\"Well, since that was so good, but\"\n\nExtremely scared I reply with \"but?\"\n\n\"I might have to eat you!\"\n\nI start running.

{"body": "Oh boy. I feel like this question was written specifically for me :(\n\nIn highschool I was quite an introvert. I didn't go to many parties, or have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked. Maybe they liked my awkwardness? who knows, I dont.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I had no skill in trying to get intimate with a girl, even though I would have liked to.\nIn 12th grade there was a party around my school's Christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it. I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.\n\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where. I still remembered her name though, Vanessa. Damn, I miss her (I'll get to that part soon). She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\n\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me. I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\n\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice that I was capable of. She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back. I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\" Perhaps the greatest point of cringe I have experienced.\n\nShit!. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of. Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\"\n\nEverything is coming up milhouse!!I started saying more things. She laughed even more. We spent most of that night talking and enjying ourselves. I guess we became really good friends, but never went further than hugging. I felt some connection between us, but didnt want to ruin it.\n\nMonths passed, and we became better friends. But still only hugging. Prom was starting to get close, and I know she didnt have a boyfriend, so I decided to try my luck and ask her to come with me. SHE SAID YES!!\n\nSo prom night is here, and im so damn nervous. I guess I thought I might get lucky so I bought a few condoms just in case. As the night progresses, I started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl. \n\nI went to grab some punch from the table, and while i was there she came over, I tried to act as natural as I could . She smiled and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for months now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood tonight?\" I invited her to go up to come outside with me, where we soon started making out and stripping each other's clothes off behind one of the blocks.\n\nhe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\n\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off her clothes. Finally, she was fully naked, as was I. She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me. Ive seen enough porn and thought she wanted doggy.\n\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\". Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\" I couldn't believe it. This girl who was gorgeous, and had boyfriends before that party I had made contact with her, was still a virgin. I still can't believe it. I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock. She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight because she really liked me and wanted me to be her first.. I told her I was a virgin too and she said good. As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\" \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life. Been waiting for awhile for someone to post a question like this to askreddit for a long time now. Happy I finally got the chance to tell that story.\n\ntl;dr: Almost got it on with a cute girl I liked.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366014689", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I won an all expenses paid night with an escort. Let me elaborate.\n\nThis story takes place when I was on a vacation in Sweden in 2011.\n\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Stockholm and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in Stockholm did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends back home that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Stockholm)\n\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty. Soon I started getting kind of but some of the girls were stunning. Im talking 10/10 could be supermodels, blue eyes blonde hair, perfect measurements.\n\nIn my mind it soon became apparent that I wasturned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful Swedish women for sex.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I walked into one of the more upper class establishments there, and inquired into the prices. They just so happened to be having a special promotion. That was, you could pretty much buy a $5 'lottery' ticket with them (It was all in house). With this ticket, one winner would be picked for an expenses paid night with one of their best girls. It was only $5 so I tried my luck, it was going to draw in 30mins so why not? If I lost I would just get a prostitute anyway. So i waited around, and quite a crowd of men had built up all holding tickets. Maybe 60 or 70 men haha. It was strange.\n\nAnyway, time for the draw. They bought out the girl, and just damn! she was the prettiest I had seen in my life. This is no exaggeration. The type of girl wars are fought over. I would have died for her, and I didnt even know her. Anyway, the ticket is drawn, and I win!! Luckiest moment of my life (At that point anyway).\n\nWe got accuainted, and had some small talk. She was quite good at English and had an amazing accent. So cute. I asked her how long she had been doing this for. She was around 21, so im guessing not very long. To my dismay, she says its her first night. She said she desperately needed the money as someone in her family was in quite bad need of it. I felt sorry for her, but my animalistic instincts told me to disregard that fact.\n\nSo we go to our room, one of the 'prestige suites' on the top floor. Its literally 5 star.\n\nIm pretty awkward, so in the room, I was very elated to find that she was quite keen on me. I asked her what she wanted to do first, she replied to me \"I want to change your World\". What the fuck could this mean? Im hoping next level sex, like only a beautiful person like her could deliver.\n\n\nWe proceed to have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal hehe). Not a day has gone by that I havnt thought about that sex. It did literally change my life.\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in the bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her if she would like to join me the next night. Which I would more than happily pay for. In fact I thought I might pay her quite alot depending on what we did.\n\nSo the next night, we once again have mindblowing, world changing sex. We didnt organise price before, and left it until we finished. So laying in bed, I turn and ask her how much.\n\n\"Free, I enjoyed it too\". FUCK! free sex from the prettiest girl in Swedon.She looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"Now it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\n\ntl;dr: Haha..

{"body": "Hooooo boy. Guy here, so obviously I'm not an ex-girlfriend who had a photo put up. I am however a scummy kind of guy, so I have put up a video of my ex and I. I put it up on xnxx a couple years ago, but here is the story of why:\n\nSo I had dated this girl for three years, we had been considering marriage for quite awhile, but we were waiting to finish college and become financially stable. This was back when I was 21. At the time we were at different colleges, so we had to be in a long distance relationship. At times this was pretty challenging. We got in a lot of fights, then we had a lot of \"make-up-video-sex\" on skype. In fact I posted one of those videos I had recorded, but, I digress.\n\nSo obviously, when you're in a long distance relationship, things can get pretty straining. You're not often around and you only see each other maybe every 2 or 3 months, if you're lucky. So at times you can get kind of... suspicious... that maybe this person you love is lying to you, or isn't who you think they are. Maybe they're cheating on you. So I figured out her facebook password and I snooped around quite a bit on it, you know, to see if she was setting up a rendezvous with someone.\n\nUnfortunately I found something. She and a guy, fucking Alister McPherson, my best friend from high school, were going to \"meet\" to \"do things\". \"together\". By which I mean have sex. So at this point, being the scummy guy I was back then, I booked a bus home, got my camera and went on my way home. See, I spent a lot of time at Alister's house as a kid, so I knew his house very well. What I knew was the treehouse in his backyard has a GREAT view of his bedroom. So, I hid there around 7:00pm waiting for the two of them to get back to is house and... do things. They got home around 12:00 or so after going out drinking, and they go up to his room. He starts undressing. Perfect. He opens the window. Also perfect, now I have sound. This is going to be good. She starts to take off his shirt. \"Alister...\" she says. \"Alister I can't do this yet. I need something\". \"Come on baby, what do you need?\" he replies. \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was about this time I noticed my lovely girlfriend of three years was and 8 story tall crustacean from the Palezoic era. That goddamned Loch-Ness monster had tricked us again!\n\nSo of course I had to upload that video, I mean, who wouldn't want that kind of proof to be published?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366038462", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

I still don't regret it.\n\nFor anyone who wants to know the full story, read below, but fair warning beforehand that this isn't a pretty story and *it won't end the way you'd like*, so **if you're weak of stomach/mind just skip this.**\n\nI was home after high school watching digimon in my living room. I was 14. My parents were at work and I was all alone. It was a Wednesday in May, probably around 3:30-4pm. To this day, I have no idea what made me look to my left, but when I did I saw him, running right towards my back deck in the backyard and I just knew he was coming in. I remember the exact chord of fear that struck me that made me just run.\n\nI couldn't think of anything else, I just ran. \n\nMy first instinct was to run upstairs to my room to get my cell phone, I don't believe I was even thinking at that point, I was just in a pre-panic. By the time I was halfway through my kitchen, I heard the giant chorus of shattering, raining glass of my back deck door across the kitchen floor. He was inside. When I look back at this, I think that was the exact moment I realized my innocence and safety was shattered, just like that door: *He was inside my home and was going to get **me**.*\n\nI ran up the stairs and could hear him behind me. He was so fast and I was just so scared. I couldn't stop, I ran past my bedroom and down the hallway to my parents room and slammed the door behind me. The moment I locked the door I felt the enormous amount of force the bastard had rocked my door with and it pushed me back on my ass. I remember just crawling backwards while the bastard started pounding on the door.\n\nI realized that I had completely forgotten to get my cell and my parents just cancelled our landline to save money, so I couldn't call for help and could only hope that a neighbor heard/saw what happened.\n\nI tried to bluff the dude and yelled \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE! I HAVE MY DAD'S GUN AND I'M GOING TO USE IT IN 5 SECONDS IF YOU DON'T LEAVE\"\n\nThe guy maybe skipped 1 beat, and then started pounding the door again. \"I'M WARNING YOU YOU QUEEN, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE\" but he didn't stop this time.\n\nAgain, I don't know if it was the panic or what but I looked around my parent's room quickly to stop at my dad's dresser. My dad had left a plate and a knife on top of it. My dad liked to eat an apple every night and would bring one to the bedroom to eat before bed.\n\nThe moment I saw the knife, I don't know if it was fight or flight or just the pure adrenaline from what was going on that took over, but I felt so angry. Like, REALLY, angry. This bastard came into my home. **MY. HOME.** And refused to leave. I grabbed the knife and got ready to charge towards the door because I knew he would be through any moment.\n\nHe finally broke through and there we were, staring each other in the face. After what felt like 5 minutes, he finally said \"give me tree fiddy.\" It was him. The goddamn Lochness monster. I told him there was no way he was getting my tree fiddy and charged him and stabbed him in the chest. He was almost instantly crippled to the floor and I ran out. Today, that bastard is walking around with an oxygen tank, but he's watching me. I know he is. Waiting for his chance to take his prize.\n\nBut he'll never have it. He'll never. Fucking.

All examples I grabbed from the video.\n\nThe definition they use for god states that it must be, basically maximally great.  If it doesn't exist in all possible realities, it isn't maximally great, so therefore god must exist in all realities if he exists in any possible reality. They then use this to say that unless god can't exist (again, like a married bachelor), he must exist.\n\nSo, to actually answer your question... because you can't apply the nice little \"if it could exist, it must exist\" tag, you can't use this argument for Nessie or little magical Irishmen.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366068029", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

We were at a pretty upscale place, which makes this even more infuriating. We wait for a few minutes, and are seated at a booth. Sitting next to us is a middle aged couple. When we sit down, he makes a snide remark about how \"kids shouldn't be in a restaurat this fancy\" and we were going to \"ruin his night out.\" I was shocked at how rude someone could be, but my family and I sat down and just tried to ignore him. We ordered beverages, and tried to enjoy our night, making casual small talk amongst ourselves. But this motherfucker would not quit. He kept talking to his wife about how the two parents sitting at the table next to them should know better than to bring children to nice restaurants. I'm getting extremely ticked off at this point. We haven't been the slightest bit obnoxious, and we weren't talking loud at ALL. We get our food, but as you can probably guess, this guy WILL NOT QUIT. He continues to make comments throughout the duration of the meal. My family and I are fed up at this point. Suddenly, as I'm finishing my food, I feel a tap on my shoulder and a now annoyingly familiar voice saying \"Hey, kid.\" Now, talking is one thing, but interrupting a meal with my family is too far. This guy actually had the audacity to come up to our table. Furious, I stood up angrily, looked the guy in the eye, and shouted \"WHAT DO YOU NEED?\". He looked at me for a few seconds, then said \"about tree fiddy.\" It was at this moment that I noticed that the rude customer was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. \"You goddamn lochness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\".

{"body": "I'm an Indian who knows Japanese.... Weird combination I know but it's proven to be helpful. Last year we had a few foreign exchange students over from Japan and they hung out with us a lot. My friend was hosting the really hot and spoke Japanese with her often. What she didn't know was that I spoke Japanese. I mean who looks at a brown man and guesses that they might speak Japanese? \n\nLater when it was my friend (male), his exchange student, and me just sitting there after a part at his house she started to talk to him about wether I was single or not and that I was super hot. My friend just chuckles and leaves the room, she starts to follow him but I quickly say 'why don't you stay?' In Japanese and the look on her face was priceless. \n\nWe started talking and it turns out she's kinda been into me since she got here and hasn't been able to tell me because she was afraid the language barrier would be too much. She assumed that I could only speak english and because she can only speak japanese the relationship would be bad. After I put my moves on (in japanese) we started making out in my friends basement. This was probably some of the best kissing I've ever experienced. Up until this point I didn't even realize that there was 'good' kissing. I just assumed kissing was kissing. \n\nOnce it started getting really hot she just couldn't stand that our clothes were still on. When I was doing a little finger play downstairs it was dripping wet. Japanese girls are just super horny I guess. She ripped my clothes off at this point, literally ripped. I had to borrow my friends shirt the next day. The weirdest part was when I tried to remove her clothed she would swat my hands away. Once she pinned me down I only had my boxers on and she was sitting right on top of my bulging cock. I asked her why she wouldn't let me take her clothes off, she instructed me to do so with my teeth ;)  . It was some of the hottest pre-sex I ever had. Once we were both buck naked and going at it she got freaky. I mean real freaky. Probably some of the most flexible kama-sutra esque sex I've ever had. The entire basement was trashed by the time we were done. My friend was NOT happy. But she asked me to keep what we did a secret out of respect for my friend. \n\nBut being the horny teenager I was and proud of what I did, I bragged about it, a LOT. I didn't mention it to my friend until the day before she left though. When I did finally tell him I felt more guilty than anything. I felt sorry that I did it with someone who was practically his sister. He just looked somber and asked 'what exactly happened?' When I started describing what happened I felt a huge hit to my face. When I looked up it was her, there were tears in her eyes that I will never forget. When I said I was sorry and asked what I could do to make it up she said \"I'll need about tree fiddy\". At this point I realized that she was a 50 foot tall Loch Ness monster and that my friend had two broken arms. That bitch also spoke English, what a fucking liar. \n\nTL;DR: fucking read it you little shit, it's worth the effort I put in.

{"body": "Not dated or married, but we did fool around a few times.  My sister is 1 year older than me and we've always been really close.  When she moved away to college, it was hard on me (no pun intended, okay maybe intended) since she was my only sibling and my parents and I aren't particularly close.  She went to school across the country, and we didn't have the money to fly her back home regularly, so the only time I got to see her was after her semester was done.\n\nWhen she came back after her first semester at college, holy hell.  We talked on the phone and facebook, but actually seeing her, it was like looking at a completely different person.  I noticed she had gotten MUCH more attractive.  We have a hot tub, and one night while my parents were out I decided to just put on some music and relax by myself in the hot tub.  I'm out there for about 15 minutes when I hear the door open and out walks my sister in a red pinstriped bikini.  I had never seen her wear this bikini before, but the top had a ring holding the top together in front, giving a nice view of her cleavage.  \n\nWell, I tried to think of other thoughts and asked what she was doing out here.  She asked if she could join me, and I'm not gonna say no, so she gets in.  So we just start talking and catching up and I start asking about how her semester went and all that small talk crap.  Then she says \"You know, I noticed you've been staring at me more recently\".  My jaw dropped.  I ask her what she means and she replies \"ever since I've gotten back from college, you've been looking at me, differently.  Don't think I haven't noticed.\"  I deny it and try to change the subject, but she's unusually relentless.  As I'm stirring in a fluster, she slides closer to me in the hot tub and puts her hand on my thigh.\n\nI ask her what the hell she's doing as my thoughts betray me, and I start pitching a tent.  She feels my bathing suit move and starts giggling.  She slides her hand further up my thigh as I try to back away, since I know this is wrong, but internally I want it so bad.  \"Have you ever thought about me?  When you're touching yourself?\"  Her hands reach the inner thigh, just inches away from my cock.  I'm speechless at this point, and she tells me to just relax.  \"You know, as you've been maturing noticed you getting more attractive too.  And, while I was away I couldn't get you off my mind.  I'm not sure what it is, maybe it's just the taboo nature of it, but I've gotten off to thoughts of you.\"  As she says this, she immediately grabs my dick and gives it a firm squeeze.  She lets out a moan and tells me she's surprised how big it is.  I'm not huge by any means, but I'm no slouch - she was probably expecting a needle dick.  I'm in a speechless trance, so she tells me to get out and follow her into the bedroom.  I oblige.\n\nI check the time as we're heading into her bedroom - our parents aren't due home for another 2-3 hours.  I'm so turned on that I'd be surprised if I last more than 2 minutes.  She throws me onto the bed and climbs ontop of me.  She starts grinding me through her bathing suit as she starts untying her top.  She throws her top off the bed, and wow, her tits were golden.  She starts undoing my bathing and she pulls them off.  She slowly lowers herself down towards my cock, kissing my chest as she gets lower and lower.  Looking my dead in the eye, she wraps her wet lips around my dick, surprised to taste my precum. I start moaning and warn her I'm about to cum, and she immediately stops.  She doesn't want me to cum just yet.\n\nShe has me get ontop of her, and I start kissing her body right around the neck.  I move up to her ears and suck on her earlobes, flicking them with my tounge which I can tell is turning her on.  I start making my way down towards her bikini bottoms, and untie them.  I pull them off with my teeth as I get ready to lick her beautiful shaved pussy.  I move my tounge right onto her clit.  She starts moaning, \"I need...I need...\"  \"What do you need\" I say.  She says, \"I need about tree fiddy\".  It was about that time I noticed my sister was actually a five-hundred feet tall monster from the paleolithic era.  \"Goddamn, lochness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\".  I kept thrusting into her and thrusting until I couldn't contain myself anymore.  As I pulled out she brought herself to my cock and asked me to cum on her tits.  I happily obliged.  After wards we were laying next to each other in a world of perfect harmony.  We noticed the time and that our parents might be home soon, so we put on our clothes and went out to get dinner.\n\nSince the the first time, every time we're on breaks from college and our parents go out, we usually end up hooking up.  I don't think any time has matched the first time.  The pure ecstasy of it all, but we've had some GREAT sex.\n\n**TL;DR**  Me and my older sister, who don't get to see each other very frequently, started a sexual relationship when I was 17, and it hasn't stopped since.

We're supposed to believe that these ghosts exist but only SOME people can see them and hear them but that nobody can really PROVE them despite how widespread photo/video/audio recording electronics are?\n\nBecause if we're saying ghosts exist, we're saying that everyone who has died has the capability to come back. I love how ghost fans always want to set conditions for ghosts: they can only come back if they died prematurely or violently. They can only haunt the places where they died, etc. They have unfinished business or don't realize they've died. Convenient, right? Apparently someone found the handbook to he recently deceased and know all the rules. \n\nIf one ghost exists, that means they all exist. Amd that would make for a tough life for the living to deal with sharing space with the billions of souls who have died in the history of the earth. And it's awesome how ghosts are always wearing 'period clothes from the late 1800s or early 1900s. Why doesn't anyone see fucking cavemen or Vikings or shit like that? Oh, *they* can't become ghosts? OK. only soldiers and old ladies with long white hair and children who play with toys can be ghosts. Oh, and cats too. \n\nGhosts are bullshit. They do not exist and they are a figment of people who are to weak to understand and appreciate that dead is dead and the end is the end. Period. If you believe in ghosts, you also probably believe in fairies and sprites and Bigfoot and the loch ness monster. It's all the same. People believe in that shit because they're too weak to accept the truth. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366106286", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -10, "controversiality": 0}

I couldn't help but spew forth all these questions, put forth all my doubts, and all but demand the answers that I had been denied up to this point.

{"body": "I am an atheist because I have found the claims of theist unconvincing. Also, I can't name single positive, tangible benefit that religion provides that can't be attained through secular means.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many gods can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366155602", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A few years ago, I moved to a new place. I'd left home pretty hastily trying to get away from...well, from what some folks called a monster. But anyways, the past isn't that relevant here. Basically, I really really needed a haircut. I mean, my hair was just going insane, and I was starting a new job in a few days. Because I was new to town, I didn't know where to go to get a cheap cut, and my place didn't have internet yet. I didn't have a smartphone since I didn't have tons of cash at the time. I left my apartment and just started wandering around by foot since I didn't have a car (which, as you may have guessed, is actually not the most efficient way to find a hair salon). Finally, I ran into a kind woman who directed me to the nearest Supercuts. I had to wait for like 20 min. but finally one of the ladies let me know it was my turn. So I went to the chair, and explained what I wanted, and she started cutting away. When she was done, I was super happy with the haircut, and I went over to pay. After I paid, she looked at me, and I looked at her. I asked her \"how much should I tip you?\" She looked me right in the eye and said: \"tree fiddy.\" And that's when I realized the god damned loch ness monster had just cut my hair. I said to it \"you ain't gettin no god damned tree fiddy from me!\" and I ran out of the hair salon.

When a brotha's got an itch, sometimes he just has to scratch) when out of the corner of my eye I spot this Shady fucking Burger King. Now you know it's shady because it always has a drug dealer behind it who sells this weird \"special fries sauce\", I mean, he sells other more common drugs too but that isn't important. Anyway I go into this place and I order a double cheeseburger with tomatoes, mayo, and lettuce and some fries. She says it'll be out in a few minutes so i decide to take a seat on the counter and lean against the wall. I was tired from all my gaming last night so I decided to lose my eyes for a second when out of the blue this cute looking red head parks herself in front of me and pokes me a little bit to see if I'm awake. I ignore her because I'm not really in the mood but she keeps fucking poking me. Once i realize that her finger is reaching closer and closer to my groin every-time she attacks me with her index finger I sit straight the fuck up and you bet all my attention was on her. That fucking smile on her face told me right then and there what I was getting into but i thought that I could take advantage of he situation and so I went along with it. She thought i was cute and wanted to head back to my place. So I was like fuck it YOLO, we grabbed my food and headed home. So we get to my place and i grab a few brewskies and pop'em open while we watch some mindless shit on TV that she put on. Once i get about half way through my burger this girl hops onto my lap and starts making out with me. I'm fucking stoked that I got this far and I didn't even have to get her lunch! I take her up and bring her to my bedroom and right before i hit the light she says something that i'll never forget. \"Hey WFS, There is something you should know\" I get seriously defensive because im pretty sure its the LochNess Monster again but instead she says something along the lines of: \"I'm a man\" to which she rips her skin off and its fucking Odin, Norse god of gods! He screams into the air and points out the window and all I can see is this dragon flying at us, and sure e-fucking-nough, the LochNess monster is on its back. The asshole breaks through my window and says \"I'ma need about tree fitty\" I looked around to see if i had something to hit him with but I noticed the CheeseBurger. I hand that to him and he was satisfied enough to thank me and leave. Jokes on him.

{"body": "Warning: Long and pointless story - but somewhat relevant to this thread.  Read at your own risk.\n\nI worked at Walmart when I was young.  Every week or so a blind woman would come in to shop.  She had some issues with how she related to people, so most of my fellow employees ran like hell as soon as they saw her.  I, however, never ran away.  I always tried to help.  And so for that reason it somehow became my \"job\" to \"deal\" with her whenever she came into the store.  \n\nSometimes it was particularly difficult (for both of us).  I learned during our many shopping adventures that she grew up abused by her family and had essentially been shut off from the rest of the world for all of her developmental years because her family did not know how to deal with her being blind.  She was freed from that situation and tried hard to get out and be around people because she knew she needed to socialize and try to be \"normal.\"\n\nOne time, after two and a half very trying hours of helping her shop - including helping her stop for a bite to eat at the McDonalds inside of the Walmart - and getting into trouble from my boss because I was \"taking an undeserved break\" while I sat with her helping to feed her and clean herself - I had to also help her check out and pay for her groceries.  She was a very suspicious person and was worried that we were trying to steal her money.  \n\nShe had to trust that the cashier told her the correct price; then she had to trust me with her wallet and hope I paid the correct amount.  She was very worried and scared by the whole ordeal.  She kept asking me if the amount I was paying was correct.  She asked again and again that I make sure I wasn't accidentally giving a $100 bill instead of a $20 bill. The cashier was quite annoyed; the people in line were getting frustrated; my boss had taken over bagging the groceries to hurry things up and was giving me a look and tapping on his wrist watch.\n\nI was frazzled by it all and said, \"Look! It's a $20 not a $100.\"\n\nShe crinkled her nose and screamed at me, \"I can't LOOK! I'm blind!\"\n\nEveryone in line, for three registers in each direction, were standing there with their arms folded, shaking their heads at me in disappointment.\n\n\n\nEdit: switched 'there' for 'their' - damn it\n\nEdit 2: I was halfway tempted to pull a \"tree fiddy\" at the end - but alas I'm not a fuckdick.

We see Sleepy walk directly into the kitchen without acknowledging us and figured he was probably just grabbing some water and heading back upstairs.\n\nNow when any door leading to the outside is opened, an obnoxiously loud beeping noise rings through my house.

{"body": "Okay, this might be a little long... When my little brother was in Grade 4, him and another kid, Luke, got into an argument over a basketball court. It escalated to the point that this other kid had gotten his friends in the next school over to chase my brother and threaten him while he was walking home. When I heard about this, I told my brother, who had tried going to the teachers about it, that if this Luke kid keeps it up, you tell him you're going to punch him in the face. If he keeps it up, you punch him in the face.\n\nTwo days later, both of them are on suspension for the rest of the week. My mom understood the situation, so for my brother it was just time to play video games and work on homework. When he went back to school, he was seen as the good guy (the kid he punched was the grade asshole). He thought it was all over, until a van pulled up beside him, a woman got out, and told him \"If you even look at my son again, I'll make your life a living hell.\"\n\nYou see, this lady was a teacher. She didn't teach at that school, rather, she taught at the high school that I was attending (this is when I was in grade 10). I didn't know this teacher, never recognized her in the halls, and didn't even know what she looked like. All I knew was the name of this kid, making the teacher Mrs. N____.\n\nEnter 12th grade; this year. It turns out, I have Mrs. N____ first thing, first semester. Of course, she never did shit to my brother, but a threat's still a threat. So what did I do? Every single morning, I'd walk over to her desk and steal her pencils. Every single morning, she'd look on her desk for something to write with, and come up with nothing. Every single morning, she asked to borrow a pencil. One time though, she caught me and I thought the jig was up. It was at this point that I realized that my teacher was 500 feet tall and from the Palaeolithic era. Immediately, she asked for money to buy replacements for all the one's I'd stolen... I grabbed the pencils off the ground and threw them at her saying \"Goddammit, Loch Ness Monstah, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!!\"\n\nI stormed out of the room and never looked back.

{"body": "Not an escort myself, but I do have a very close friend (who we shall call jill) who happens to be one. \n\nAnyways, she doesn't escort every day, maybe one Saturday every other week or so. \nShe sorta had a reputation with older men, maybe 40-60 year olds, but she didn't mind because they were usually well mannered and very educated, allowing for good conversation and an all around good time. \nShe would usually hang around with my family and I (family meaning people my age) \nI kinda saw it coming, because almost every time we would all get together I would catch my cousin (bill) trying to cop a feel or just blatantly staring at her. \nSo around 8pm a few weeks ago (I hadn't talked to Jill in a few days) I get a call from her and I answer and in the most awkward tone she says \"Hey so uhh... Is it cool if your cousin hires me to be his escort or whatever?\" On the inside I'm dying, but I ask her if she wouldn't feel weird and she says no, second question I ask is how much he's paying her and what the plans were. \n\"Well uhh, just dinner at (lets say fancy place) He just wants to go to dinner and that's it. Oh! And like three hundred something dollars.\" So I say it's fine. *call ends*\nDying of laughter, I get myself ready and head to fancy place with my S/O. \nI get there order food, I hadn't noticed her arrival, but when I did see her, bill had yet to arrive. So I commenced to feast, lost track of time and thought oh shit I hope I didn't miss bill getting there. So I look up at their table and I notice, wait, that isn't bill, that's the god damn loch ness monster! He looks over at me and says, I shit you not, \"I need about tree fitty\" and I said I ain't giving you no tree fitty you god damn Loch Ness monster! Get your own god damn money.\n\nEdit: That was a spin-off, the actual story continues like this....\n\nI see bill looking around and he finally lays eyes on me and he sets his most shameful face and looks directly down at his food and does the walk of shame to the RR. My S/O is having the laugh of her life, then I see bills parents walk in  {Ben(my uncle) and maya}\nBen and maya have been divorced for almost a year and have recently started talking and getting along better. \nI wave him over and we chat it up and he looks over and sees Jill, he all of a sudden assumes shame face. I knew something was up. Jill looks over and sets her face to stunned mode as well. At this point I step out and call Jill because I'm certain something was up. \nShe comes outside reluctantly and explains to me that Ben had hired her as an escort months before hand, something about he was lonely after the divorce. I walk inside by myself as to not alarm Ben, but I now know the dark secret. And it wasn't until I sat down that it hit me, oh shit Ben and bill both hired Jill! I see bill chatting with Ben and maya and then Jill walks over finally and I swear a black hole spawned in the fancy place and sucked the happiness out of the room, the simultaneous shame face by Ben and bill caused by Jill walking over and kissing bill on the cheek as a good bye set off a chain reaction where maya looked at both of them, Jill ended up confessing to maya that her ex husband AND son hired her, maya slapping all three of them and finally being escorted out (not by Jill) after breaking a few plates and attacking with fork in hand and Jill being called a tramp by cousin and uncle of mine which finally ended with a late night hate message to each of their respective cell phones explaining how they are so pathetic ganging up on her and how much of sorry excuses for men they are. \n\nAnd for those wondering, I have yet to communicate with either party since the day after the event occurred.

{"body": "For most of my life i have been praised for my memory and reading speed. I would understand almost anything after a simple explanation and i always seemed seemed to hear everything my teacher talked about, this despite my life long tradition of just goofing around in class. This of course lead to many a \" Excuse me HaNZ1, could you tell the class what i just explained?\", which i would always respond to with \"Of course Miss, you where talking about...\" you get my point, i always knew even if i didnt try to catch it.\n\nIn middle school there was a nation wide reading/comprehension test, to record the over all reading level of children in my country. After i handed inn my paper after 10 minuttes of the given hour and i had all the answers right, they made me sit in another room and take it again whilst a few teachers watched and talked amongst themselves. After that no one ever asked me if i payed attention in class any more. \n\n.\n\n My abilities of comprehension lead me well throughout my school career, i never read anything more than once, if i even read it. And my grades where always near perfection. I seemed to recall anything i had ever read, seen or heard with near perfection every time i needed to.\n It was at this point indentified by myself, and a few people i discussed it with, as some form of eidetic memory, not perfect in anyway. i can not recall tastes, smells or images with the same amount of detail i can with words. Some discussion with a person who had knowledge in this field only helped me convince myself of this idea,\n\n.\n\nIt wasnt til the second year of high school that i realized the flaw in my otherwise excellent brain. While i could recall concepts and ideas perfectly, and re-tell them with enthusiasm and interest, i failed missereably at all forms of higher mathmatics. \n\nPhysics, Theoretical Chemistry, Scientific Math, all classes i signed up for, confident that my brain would take care of work for me as it always had and i could continue goofing off in class. It didnt, even if i worked my ass off it didnt. It simply refused to accept calculations, i could talk about rules, and concepts and explain in detail the laws of physics, but i couldnt for the life of me use them properly inn an equation. I still got passing grades mind you, but there was quite a significant drop. \nI had to change my courses, i realized this so i went to talk to the administration off my school. This entire day is still crystal clear in my head, i remember walking into the principals office, he handled such things since this was a rather small school. I went up to him to explain the situation, and he listened paitiently. \n\nAfter some explanation i manged to convince him to change my classes to English, Chemistry (since i did good enough in it), and Biology.\nStanding there at his desk dissapointed in everything i thought i was he quickly pulled me out off my thoughts with one sentence \"There is one issue however\". I stared at him, still sorry for myself for not being the super human i thought i was, when he said the words that would ring in my head for the rest of my life. \"Im gonna need about three fifty\", it was at this point i realized he was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. Startled i fell backwards, i yelled at him \"I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!\" And with those words i ran out of his office.\n\n\nA while later i transfered schools and im now working towards my masters in biomedical science. \n\n\n\nTl;DR i was not as smart as i thought i was. Math is hard\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366227467", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Now at this point I should mention that he had a 9/10 19 year old sister who was just getting home from being out with her friends at this point.  My friend said that he was going to go upstairs to take a shit, as we had Taco Bell for lunch and dinner that day.  Now his sister was normally a total slut, but it was apparent that she had been drinking, so she was all over me as soon as her brother was up the stairs.  She was saying things like \"I want you, put it in me\".  Now, being an 18 year old virgin, I was all for this.  She was sexy and DTF, so we got to it, as my friend would be at least 30 more minutes.  She started to ride me, bareback because why not?  I was just about to reach the point of no return when she said \"wait, could you let me know when you're ready and pull out?\"  \"Sure\" I said, I was ready to take whatever I could get.  Then she said \"I just need one more thing, too.\"  \"What do you need?\" Then she said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  Now it was at this point that I noticed my friend's beautiful sister was really an eight story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That goddamn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again.

I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.\n\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where. I still remembered her name though, Vanessa. She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\n\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me. I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\n\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible. She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back. I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\n\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of. Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\"\n\nI started saying more things.\n\nShe laughed even more.\n\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl. But then it dawned on me. I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where. A strip club. Vanessa was a stripper. Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.\n\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously. My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once. I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\n\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"\n\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\n\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house. This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue. I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself.\n\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\n\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone. A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms. I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside.\n\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\n\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off Vanessa's clothes. Finally, she was fully naked, as was I. She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.\n\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\". Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\" I couldn't believe it. This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin. I still can't believe it. I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock. She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to. I told her I was a virgin too and she said good. As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\" \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\n\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life. Been waiting for awhile for someone to post a question like this to askreddit for a long time now. Happy I finally got the chance to tell that story.\n\ntl;dr: A stripper who aggressively threw herself on to me was actually a virgin.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366296215", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

We asked him what seemed to be the problem and he claimed that he was out of gas.

When we get there he frantically checks his pockets and states that he must have left his wallet in his car. We decided to help him out by paying for some gas so he could get his car back here and not have to walk. He filled the canister up a bit and then stopped the gas at $3.50, and I gladly paid for him, not being that much money even for a broke college student.

It was a lot of money but i had all my photos, contacts, etc on this phone and i needed it for work.  I pay the guy and walk away defeated.

{"body": "Everyone is absolutely blown away by how much bigger I am. I notice females mirin' hard. I get sexually harrassed at work by the sales girls. Not that I mind the compliments and the arm grabbing. But the best thing by far that has happened to me is either one of two things. \nLast weekend I went to go visit my parents who I haven't seen for a while. I was hanging out at this bar with my dad and this waitress who we're friends with comes over and just looks at me with her jaw open. She says, \"Ohh...my...goddd... You got huge!\" I got red in the face and couldn't help but smile. She started asking so many questions, like, what I eat, what \"I was on\", how often I go and things of that nature. I talked with her for about 20 minutes, and then went to give her a hug as I was leaving. A quick friendly, nice to see you, kind of hug. She had her arms wrapped around me, grabbing onto my traps and she squeezed. I went to release my gentle grasp and she pulled me in, saying, \"No...squeeze me tighter...\" I pulled her into me. Her body as close to me as it could get. She lets out a little moan, she wispered in my ear.... \"I'm wet.\" I was stunned. I didn't know how to react. I said the only thing that I could think of at the time, \"why wouldn't you be.\" She stared into my eyes so intensely that I could feel my heart beating, for a few brief moments, the only thing in that bar was me, her, and sexual tension. She told me to follow her. She led me into the back room of the bar. It appeared to be a break room of sorts. She stood in front of me, with her hands on my powerful chest, slightly digging her nails into me. I knew what she wanted. She pushed me down onto the couch that was behind me. She climbed on top of me and started kissing me with undeniable lust. I couldn't resist, nor did I want to. Things started getting really heated. First my shirt came off, then hers. \"This is it! This is what I've been working for! This is my time to shine!\" I thought to myself. I was feeling her sensually all over, my hand made its way to her pelvic region. I started massaging her \"area\". I slipped a finger in. I could feel her body tense, her breath on my neck, another quiet moan. I put in another finger. She stared deep into my eyes, biting her lip, then she said \"More.\" I put 3 fingers in. \"More!\" She was getting louder, I thought she was getting closer. I was planning to tease her to almost climax, at which point I would unleash the kraken. So I slipped in my 4th finer, but this wasn't enough for this insatiable nympho. She asked again, \"More,more!!\" At this point I had my hole fist inside her. I had no idea who I was anymore, or what I was doing, why I was doing it or where this whole escapade would leave my psyche afterwards. She told me again. \"More!! Mindblasuh, I need more!!\" I said You have my whole fist inside you, what more do you want. She peered deep into my soul, its like I could feel her looking inside my body. Then she said, \"I'ma need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time I realized I had my fist inside the vagina of an 8 story tall creature from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "I don't know man, I just don't know anymore. After watching the new Sanic video and hearing Arin talk *at length* about his opinion on modern games, I knew it was gonna cause a potential shitstorm amongst the grep fans. \n\nSure enough, I checked the comments on reddit and yes, even some on youtube and sure enough: it varied from the rather eloquent \"OHMAHGAWD GREPS SUCK ARIN SUCKS UNSUBBING,\" to the fanboyish \"Look guys it's just his opinion, this content is free quit your bitching,\" and even the \"Arin has completely conflicting opinions about games, etc\" that were rather quite interesting to read.\n\nThen after about an hour it hit me; I was sitting here, reading *PAGES* of text about one's opinion of another person's opinion that was said on an unrehearsed youtube channel. I took a deep breath and a step back, and cheekishly asked myself, \"what am I willing to put up with today? not fucking this.\"\n\nSo, I decided to get off of the computer for a while and go for a walk. It was a rather nice walk, the weather was perfect, not too hot but hot enough to remind me that summer is just around the bend. I was thinking about why I invested *so* much of my time analyzing the opinions of others and completely abandoning my own opinions, bouncing back and forth between \"well it's just a silly show\" to \"no fuck that Arin Grump is fucking stupid how can he say that Bioshock Infinite is an okay game when he hasn't even **FUCKING MET ELIZABETH!?**\"\n\nAfter a bit longer of a walk than I originally anticipated, I sat at a park bench to see the beautiful sunset. A girl walked by and I smiled, and I realized it was someone I knew from high school. We chatted a bit and laughed and it hit me; *this* is the stuff I should be caring about- making friends and enjoying the little things. I laughed a little and she asked what I  thought was so funny. \n\n\"Oh nothing, I just had to....let go of something. Don't worry about it,\" I said. \"Hey, would you wanna go grab some ice cream with me?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" She replied. \"But...see, I've got this problem, and I need your help...\"\n\nStartled by her response, I replied. \"Uh...sure, w-what is it that you need?\"\n\n\"...I need about tree fiddy.\" \n\nIt was about that time I noticed that this sweet girl from high school was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "/entering :)\n\nSo last year, six friends and I, from Australia, went on a roadtrip in the US. Rough summary, we drove something like 9000 miles in a rad old Dodge Ram Van, Going from LA to New York through the Southern States, up through Canada, camping in the national parks on our way back down the west coast, ending back up in LA with a few days in Vegas to end the trip. This took us six weeks.\n\nOn our first drive, learning to stay on the wrong side of the road, we got stopped coming in to Texas from New Mexico. They'd set up a sort of random checkpoint at this point on the highway.\n\nNow, let me do a quick description of our motley crew: at this point there were six of us, since one guy was joining us halfway in New York. The rest of us are all covered in desert dust and sweating like bastards, it's probably 45C and our A/C overheated the car if we left it on. Everyone has long or stupid hair except for me. They're all wearing band shirts, connies or thongs (sandals, whatever you kents call 'em!), skinny denim shorts or jeans. They all look like they're in bands. Most of them are, about five out of the seven. Different bands though!\n\nSo, back to the checkpoint. After a whole lot of other drama, unrelated to this tale (hint: sniffer dawgs!!) the totally cool border guy stops and asks us: 'Are you guys in a band?'\n\nWe all pause. 'Nah, not really.'\n\n'You should say you are... you know, just for the fuck of it. See ya later boys!' and this guy just waves us off.\n\nWe lingered on it for a bit, but that's about it. See, these guys were in bands, and whenever someone asked us, we'd just say yeah, 'he is in this band, he's in that one, bla bla bla.' It took way too much effort - we didn't have the time, six weeks is a tight schedule for 9000 miles! I kept a running tally in my notebook though, and by the time we reached Raleigh, it was well over thirty people had asked us.\n\nI think we made it to Washington DC before the possibilities hit us. We were out at some tapas-sushi-cocktail fusion place, and the waitress asked us if we were in a band. It was like some group delusion fell over us. I'd just started hitting sake, which always makes me puke but guarantees a good night.\n\n'Why yes. Yes we are in a bad.' The waitress goes goddamn wild, and then starts running back behind the bar and kitchen to grab people. We throw the most intense and productive group huddle ever: 'What are we called? Who does what? What songs do we play? What are we doing here?!'\n\nWe nailed out the details quick smart. Most of it was based on reality. The guy who was a singer in real life, sang in real life. We had our keyboardist. No drummer, so the other guy not in a bad got that. I have no musical talent, and don't look like I'm in a band, so I became tour manager - again, a hint of truth, because I was pretty much responsible for buying the car, group funds, booking hotels and hostels and all that along the way. Everything was... a little bit true, and mostly a lie.\n\nBut what were we called? That was obvious. We'd named our car already: Ramona the Ram Van. Named after Ramona Flowers of Scott Pilgrim fame, of course. I was a little head over the heels for that fictional character, and it was a bit of a running joke in the group. God she's cool (but aloof). So that was us: Ramona.\n\nSo this lady runs back, with like three bar staff. They're asking us all sorts of things. What music we play, what kinda shows we're doing. We pretty quickly came up with some essential rules.\n\nWe'd never say it to people we were staying with - if we were in a hostel and someone asked, no, we weren't a band. Anywhere else was fine. We never played in the city we were in - only the one before and after, this city we're in right now? 'Naw, just a quick stopover for some sight-seeing.' When people asked for venues, we'd name places we'd been in the last city, and for the upcoming city people would usually know something from music DVDs or classic shows we'd seen or heard about. If they asked us to sing a song, we'd be reluctant, and then all drum and hum along to something the 'singer' played in his actual band. We all knew each other's songs, so it was all good.\n\nNow, it got way out of hand, just too silly. We'd go to like, museums, and the ticket lady would say, 'are you guys in a band?' Why yes, we are. 'Oh my god! Where are you from?' Australia. We'd go off, go through the whole venue and come out at the exit - only to find the ticket woman and every other employee waiting for us.\n\n'Weeeee got a band in the house!' the lady would yell, and everyone would clap and yell. 'Hey,' she said, 'we were talking, and we think we'll all come to your show. Are you guys playing in DC tonight?'\n\nWell, we're terribly sorry... we're not playing here! We're leaving tomorrow morning and playing in New York City! Sorry love! And we'd sweep out, leaving people a bit disappointed, but mostly elated that they'd met a band.\n\nWe'd get dinner, and we'd sign autographs for the waitresses. Even me, the sneaky tour manager, signed napkins for people. They started asking us how big we were in Australia. It would change, from time to time. We started small. Halfway through and it was like, 'you know Kings of Leon? Yeah we supported their whole tour in Australia last year,' and people would just froth at the thought of it.\n\nAt one point, we were walking around the natural history museum, and a girl walked up to a couple of my friends, who were just chilling. 'Hey, are you guys in a band?' Yeah, we are. 'What are you called?' We're called Ramona. 'I've never heard of you.' Do you listen to much Australian music? 'No.' There you go then!\n\nThis teenager runs back to her friends, and they're all yelping at each other. 'Who are they?' one asks. 'Uhhh, Ramona, from Australia, as if you don't know!' Then they'd come back and get pictures taken.\n\nIt was all brilliant, swimmingly well. Funnily, pretty much no one ever whipped out the internet on their phone to look us up. The one or two that did, I'd just chime in as the tour manager and say, 'oh, we're gearing up for a big tour back home, so it's down and being redone at the moment.'\n\nWe hit our first bump in San Fran. We were eating at this rad Mexican place, and this absolute hotty from the table behind us leans over and asks if we're in a band. Well, actually, we are, I say. We chit chat with this girl and her two friends for a while. They're two guys, I'm fairly sure they're gay but who knows. I am smitten by the woman. We hang around for a while, and as we go to leave, they ask us where we're going. Well, there was this bar near our hotel called 'The Owl Tree' that we were thinking of checking out. Sure thing, they said they'd follow us.\n\nWe didn't expect anything, so as we're sitting in The Owl Tree, chatting about how heart-meltingly attractive the girl is, they walk in. They kept their promise. They come up to us eager to tell us a story... as we'd left the Mexican place, the table next to them asked them who we were. 'Fallout Boy!' they said, and the two teenage girls swooned.\n\nAnyway, I spend the next three or four hours talking to this girl about my life as a tour manager. By the end I'm off my rocker drunk, but I'm keeping it together. This girl was called Bertina or something - worked as a manager at GAP. I've never heard the name Bertina, or even sure I heard it right, so I've just resorted to call her Brittanica since then, since it seems funnier. Anyway, we end up at a dubstep club. I'm buying everyone else expensive drinks and saying, 'hey, the production company is paying for it!' while furiously gesturing that those other kents are paying me back tomorrow, when the act is up. Well, I go off to the bathroom, come out, and everyone is gone. Turns out one of my friends enjoyed those G&amp;Ts I was getting him a little too much and got everyone kicked out. Even Brittanica. I was devastated. I rang everyone, got lost, eventually found the hotel, bought beer as was eventually asked of me, and got up to the room to find everyone passed out anyway. I furiously woke everyone up and told them I bought the beer. I woke everyone up in rage and told them all calmly: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" For the beer. Only then I realized, I was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten them again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\", they yelled as I swam away into the distance. Now that I got you, I have to credit isco123 for this story, without the tree fiddy, of course.\n\nTL;DR: Ramona took the US of A by storm.

{"body": "While I think what you're saying is very accurate, there seems to be a lot of debate in here around movies that are very similar, but both lovingly produced. I've definitely seen more esoteric examples of this effect that clearly didn't have to do with idea grabbing. For example, I remember a time when I was watching South Park and Simpsons every week, and noticed little jokes about the same topic, the most notable of these was the \"tree fiddy\" South Park in the same week The Simpsons had Mr. Burns hunting the Loch Ness Monster. \n\nIt is my belief, with what I've read about art form histories and Jungian psychology, that there is a combination of two things happening here. One is that artists are predictors of changes in our collective unconscious. So part of what we are seeing might be two different ideators seeing the same change in our society, see how our tastes are changing, probably also factoring in what studios are looking for and what audiences want. Out of all the writers in Hollywood, two are bound to come out with similar thematic matter. The other part of this is we are a very linked society. Maybe the writers of both Loch Ness episodes both saw the same In Search Of... rerun during the writing phase of the episodes. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think the process you describe is why similar ideas in different studios end up getting made. But I think even within the artistic ether of creation, you're bound to get twins. The studio system just serves to amplify this, much like record labels push artists to sound similarly, because they want a product that sells. They want a guarantee.

{"body": "Happen to me very recently actually, didn't think I would have a chance to tell this on reddit for a while. Also throwaway for obvious reasons. But it will probably be not be read any way.\n\nLet's say I'm a foreigner from maybe europe, right now somewhere on American continent, it is my freshman year of college, and I've been in the country for a more than a couple years now. My family has a decent income back home, enough to not worry about having food I consider decent.\n\nIt's getting close to the end of the year and I did really bad first semester because I should've tried harder, and this semester it's not going well and I'm trying as hard as I can, and I'm just struggling with school. That puts me at risk for failing out, and would lead to me having to go back home.\n\nThe day that realization comes to my mind, was a Friday and I was hanging out with some friends later that evening, a bit of Tequila involved. At the end of the night, me, my best friend, and this girl that I at the time saw only as a friend end up going to my best friends dorm to order some delicious pizza. We start talking about our families and our plans for future, but we are hammered, my sober best friend was just laughing the whole time. Eventually he leaves to meet the pizza guy in the lobby, so it's just us two in the room. We sit far across from each other and she gets up and leans in for a kiss, which caught me by surprise because I guess I'm just oblivious or something and I only ever saw her as friend. Anyway we continue having our drunk conversations about life eventually munching on some pizza. Suddenly she just says: \"We should get married.\" \n\nSo without thinking of what I would think of my decision in the morning I just say: \"Yea that's a great idea!\" I proposed to her to marry me, she said yes.\n\nSo already in my drunk mind it clicks: Happens so that my family plans to make business there, they already asked me to help them with and they would basically provide for us with our own house, and some finances to help us before I start working. It's really an amazing opportunity to put my life in the direction I want it to go, and I would also go to college part time to finish my education. But for that to happen I need a legal reason to stay, like lets say marriage since I will not be going to college full time. You see the connection I'm making. And it would also relieve me from risk of failing out. \n\nOf course in the morning I knew that decision had to be a joke, because I am not about to marry someone I barely know, and even though the opportunity is really cool, proposal made on Tequila has no value in my opinion. So both of us laughed it off, and just kept on being friends. But the seed in my mind was planted and all I thought about was what if that could actually work. I thought this was an opportunity of a lifetime to move somewhere better and have a job and a place to live already there. It was a crazy idea but I thought I should tell her about it, or I will always question \"What if she said yes\". So eventually I told her about the opportunity and she said she will think about it. It wasn't really a proposal more like a business offer as I saw it.\n\nWe kept on hanging out together for next couple days, trying to get to know each other, but of course there is no way to know someone enough to marry them in a couple days. One morning we see each other and she tells me that before she can decide she needs one thing. I ask \"What?\"\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized she was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

My brother and I would each get probably between 10-20 dollars of \"gifts\" in small things (gum, baseball cards, things that most people get as stocking stuffers). I didn't necessarily live in a poor area, so I went to school with some people that were pretty well off. I would hear them talking about their new bike, or their Nintendo 64 that they got for Christmas, and I always wondered why they got so many awesome presents and I didn't. One day I asked my mom about it, and I will never forget how the exchange went. I could tell that she was visibly shaken when I asked her but I wasn't quite sure why... I didn't think the present shortage was her fault, but Santa's. I now know that she felt disappointed that she couldn't provide for her two sons as well as she wanted to. She worked two jobs to support us, and my dad was pretty much bringing in nothing. Anyways, she tried to pull a smile together and said \"I don't know honey. You'd have to ask Santa.\" Obviously she was trying to spare me from the true reality of how poor we really were, but I didn't realize that. I decided that next Christmas I would sneak out of my room when my parents were asleep and ask Santa why we got so few presents, and if he could give us more. Fast-forward to next Christmas Eve (I think I was about 7), and I decide to execute my plan. My brother and I shared a room, so when our parents made us go to bed, I waited for what seemed like ages for him to fall asleep. I assumed my parents were asleep too, so I carefully got out of bed and went into the living room. I saw someone kneeling down near the Christmas tree. I could only see his back, but it was odd, he wasn't wearing red clothes like I expected Santa to wear. \"Santa?\" I whispered. He completely froze, I had obviously caught him off guard. Before he could say anything, I told him \"I want more presents this year. Why don't you ever give us a lot of presents?\" He kept his back towards me, and said (while trying to disguise his voice) \"Sorry, the North Pole doesn't have enough money to give lots of toys to everyone.\" It still hadn't quite clicked in my head yet what was going on. I got like a $1 allowance a week for doing chores, so I asked him \"How much money can I give the North Pole to get a skateboard?\" Santa stood up and turned around, and said \"It'll cost you about tree fiddy.\" The ceiling ripped clean off of my house due to his sheer stature.

{"body": "I had shared this story in /r/gainit the other day and it seemed to go over pretty well, so I shall share it here as well...  \n  \n  \n  Everyone is absolutely blown away by how much bigger I am. I notice females mirin' hard. I get sexually harrassed at work by the sales girls. Not that I mind the compliments and the arm grabbing. But the best thing by far that has happened to me is either one of two things. Last weekend I went to go visit my parents who I haven't seen for a while. I was hanging out at this bar with my dad and this waitress who we're friends with comes over and just looks at me with her jaw open. She says, \"Ohh...my...goddd... You got huge!\" I got red in the face and couldn't help but smile. She started asking so many questions, like, what I eat, what \"I was on\", how often I go and things of that nature. I talked with her for about 20 minutes, and then went to give her a hug as I was leaving. A quick friendly, nice to see you, kind of hug. She had her arms wrapped around me, grabbing onto my traps and she squeezed. I went to release my gentle grasp and she pulled me in, saying, \"No...squeeze me tighter...\" I pulled her into me. Her body as close to me as it could get. She lets out a little moan, she wispered in my ear.... \"I'm wet.\" I was stunned. I didn't know how to react. I said the only thing that I could think of at the time, \"why wouldn't you be.\" She stared into my eyes so intensely that I could feel my heart beating, for a few brief moments, the only thing in that bar was me, her, and sexual tension. She told me to follow her. She led me into the back room of the bar. It appeared to be a break room of sorts. She stood in front of me, with her hands on my powerful chest, slightly digging her nails into me. I knew what she wanted. She pushed me down onto the couch that was behind me. She climbed on top of me and started kissing me with undeniable lust. I couldn't resist, nor did I want to. Things started getting really heated. First my shirt came off, then hers. \"This is it! This is what I've been working for! This is my time to shine!\" I thought to myself. I was feeling her sensually all over, my hand made its way to her pelvic region. I started massaging her \"area\". I slipped a finger in. I could feel her body tense, her breath on my neck, another quiet moan. I put in another finger. She stared deep into my eyes, biting her lip, then she said \"More.\" I put 3 fingers in. \"More!\" She was getting louder, I thought she was getting closer. I was planning to tease her to almost climax, at which point I would unleash the kraken. So I slipped in my 4th finer, but this wasn't enough for this insatiable nympho. She asked again, \"More,more!!\" At this point I had my hole fist inside her. I had no idea who I was anymore, or what I was doing, why I was doing it or where this whole escapade would leave my psyche afterwards. She told me again. \"More!! Mindblasuh, I need more!!\" I said You have my whole fist inside you, what more do you want. She peered deep into my soul, its like I could feel her looking inside my body. Then she said, \"I'ma need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time I realized I had my fist inside the vagina of an 8 story tall creature from the Paleozoic era.

Its a fairly new concept that it was metaphor but makes no sense in the context of the biographies and haigeographies of Irish saints or the style of writing in ancient Ireland. Its much more likely they are literally saying St Patrick got rid of the snakes.\n\nEarly Irish monks and story tellers did not use metaphor, they used the 'great feat'. The earlier you go back the more extravagant the feats. Take for example 'The life of St Columba' by Adomnán. This is written in the 7th century and every page is replete with miracles that would put Jesus to shame. He resurects people, turns milk to wine, can see the future and even fights the loch Ness monster. Similar stories exist for all the saints, Brigid could communicate with nature, had a magic cloak and her, along with St Aed and St Cainnech performed miraculous abortions.\n\nBasically its propaganda. Our mythology is full of great feats by heroes and gods, Fionn MacCumhall etc, and the fledgling new religion had to compete with that and out do it.

{"body": "Well, there was this one time...\nOkay, so I was over at a friends house a couple summers ago. I was 18 at the time. My friend and I were playing Super Mario World up until about 3 in the morning. Now at this point I should mention that he had a 9/10 19 year old sister who was just getting home from being out with her friends at this point. My friend said that he was going to go upstairs to take a shit, as we had Taco Bell for lunch and dinner that day. Now his sister was normally a total slut, but it was apparent that she had been drinking, so she was all over me as soon as her brother was up the stairs. She was saying things like \"I want you, put it in me\". Now, being an 18 year old virgin, I was all for this. She was sexy and DTF, so we got to it, as my friend would be at least 30 more minutes. She started to ride me, bareback because why not? I was just about to reach the point of no return when she said \"wait, could you let me know when you're ready and pull out?\" \"Sure\" I said, I was ready to take whatever I could get. Then she said \"I just need one more thing, too.\" \"What do you need?\" Then she said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Now it was at this point that I noticed my friend's beautiful sister was really an eight story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again.

{"body": "Stories a bit long and involved, so bear with me.  It all started when my (then) soon-to-be-girlfriend (currently my 1st ex-wife, we'll call her Bitch-Cunt, or BC for short) brought her bastard daughter (I dont mean, \"that child is an asshole\"...I mean \"that child's father is a run-away asshole\") on our 3rd or 4th date (maybe 5th? was so long ago).  Keep in mind that, at this point in our \"relationship,\" I had no clue BC had a child.\n\nSo at first, I am a little turned off by it.  I mean, really? *THIS* is how you introduce your kid to me? \"Surprise!  Play with my kid!\"  So we went to eat lunch, which ended up being a bit awkward at first, but as I spent more time around BC's daughter (We will call her Amber), I realized that Amber is a pretty cool kid.  Definitely not a snot nosed brat.  So the tension eases and we get along pretty well.\n\nSo after lunch, we kinda walk around a bit, and end up at a nearby park, where Amber sees some of her friends playing and asks to join.  BC says yes, so we go sit on a nearby bench and just chat about random things, I dont even remember what at this point.\n\nAfter a bit, BC and I notice a small commotion happening around Amber.  BC starts to get up, and I follow her.  As we approach, we can hear some boys about the same age as Amber standing over her and her friend (I later found out this boy constantly teased Amber in class).  He was saying things like (paraphrasing cause it was so long ago), \"You're just a little bastard,\" or \"I bet your mom needs a dick in her life, then she wouldnt be such a bitch.\"  Quite frankly, I was pretty shocked at how aggressive this kid was.  And I could see BC starting to seethe with anger.\n\nI put my hand out toward BC, and gave her a \"let me handle this\" look.  So I walk up to Amber and start acting like her dad \"Hey Pumpkin, Mom said you would be over here.  You playing with your friends?\"  As I said that last part, I shot an evil glare at this boy.  Amber kinda gives me a weird look, but I wink at her and she smiles.  \n\nNow, I'm not a big guy, but I guess my glare was intimidating enough, because the bully kinda slinked off as I was talking with Amber and her friend as Amber's dad. \n\nSo after the boy left, I move back with BC to the bench, and we sit down again.  Almost immediately, a man walks up to me (who I learn later is bully's father) and says something to the effect of \"I heard what happened.  You're not really her father, are you?\"  I replied \"yeah, I was lieing to protect her a bit...\"  He immediately cut me off \"Clearly...\" (You see where I'm going with this), \"but I may need something to keep my silence.\"  I was shocked for a second.  Was this guy really going to blackmail me so that BC's daughter doesnt get bullied by HIS son?  Bracing myself, I hesitantly asked, \"What do you need?\"\n\nHe looked straight into my eyes.  \"I need about treefiddy.\"  Well it was about that time I noticed that bully's dad was 10 stories tall, and obviously a creature from the paleolithic era. So I said \"DAMN YOU LOCH NESS MONSTER YOU WILL NOT BE GETTING MY THREE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS THIS TIME\"\n\nand thats the story of how I got my username.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366730745", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have told this story before but i believe it deserves retelling.\n\n\nFor most of my life i have been praised for my memory and reading speed. I would understand almost anything after a simple explanation and i always seemed seemed to hear everything my teacher talked about, this despite my life long tradition of just goofing around in class. This of course lead to many a \" Excuse me HaNZ1, could you tell the class what i just explained?\", which i would always respond to with \"Of course Miss, you where talking about...\" you get my point, i always knew even if i didnt try to catch it.\n\n.\n\n\nIn middle school there was a nation wide reading/comprehension test, to record the over all reading level of children in my country. After i handed inn my paper after 10 minuttes of the given hour and i had all the answers right, they made me sit in another room and take it again whilst a few teachers watched and talked amongst themselves. After that no one ever asked me if i payed attention in class any more. Other kids started asking me to help them with their homework.\n.\nMy abilities of comprehension lead me well throughout my school career, i never read anything more than once, if i even read it. And my grades where always near perfection. I seemed to recall anything i had ever read, seen or heard with near perfection every time i needed to. It was at this point indentified by myself, and a few people i discussed it with, as some form of eidetic memory, not perfect in anyway. i can not recall tastes, smells or images with the same amount of detail i can with words. Some discussion with a person who had knowledge in this field only helped me convince myself of this idea. \n\n.\n\n\nIt wasnt til the second year of high school that i realized the flaw in my otherwise excellent brain. While i could recall concepts and ideas perfectly, and re-tell them with enthusiasm and interest, i failed missereably at all forms of higher mathmatics. \nPhysics, Theoretical Chemistry, Scientific Math, all classes i signed up for, confident that my brain would take care of work for me as it always had and i could continue goofing off in class. It didnt, even if i worked my ass off it didnt. It simply refused to accept calculations, i could talk about rules, and concepts and explain in detail the laws of physics, but i couldnt for the life of me use them properly inn an equation. I still got passing grades mind you, but there was quite a significant drop. I had to change my courses, i realized this so i went to talk to the administration off my school. This entire day is still crystal clear in my head, i remember walking into the principals office, he handled such things since this was a rather small school. I went up to him to explain the situation, and he listened paitiently.\n\n.\n\n\nAfter some explanation i manged to convince him to change my classes to English, Chemistry (since i did good enough in it), and Biology. Standing there at his desk dissapointed in everything i thought i was he quickly pulled me out off my thoughts with one sentence \"There is one issue however\". I stared at him, still sorry for myself for not being the super human i thought i was, when he said the words that would ring in my head for the rest of my life. \"Im gonna need about three fifty\", it was at this point i realized he was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. Startled i fell backwards, i yelled at him \"I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!\" And with those words i ran out of his office.\nA while later i transfered schools and im now working towards my masters in biomedical science.\n\n.\n\nTl;DR I was not as smart as i thought i was, dont get cocky kids.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366736604", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

I also haven't comprehensively surveyed the field for evidence for the loch ness monster, leprechauns, chakras, crystal energy, or dragons. I dismiss these claims without thorough study because they are claims presented with *unconvincing* evidence. If someone presents a convincing argument for the existence of leprechauns, then I will do more research, but until then I'm fine dismissing claims on the basis of insufficient evidence.

{"body": "This happened a long time ago in what now seems like another lifetime.  I saw this girl at school and just fell head over heels for her.  She was absolutely beautiful and was one of the nicest people you could ever want to meet.  I was very shy at the time, too.  There were a couple of different times that I wanted to talk to her, but just the thought of it gave me a bad case of the butterflies inside.  I'd almost get physically ill and ended up backing out every time.  \n\nFortunately for me, I had a friend(let's call him Bob) who knew my situation.  He told his girlfriend and his girlfriend, thank goodness, decided to play matchmaker.  I'll never forget her kindness for doing this.  Anyway, she arranged to be out with the object of my affection and \"accidentally\" run into me and her boyfriend somewhere.  Things went along swimmingly... until we left the house.  \n\nAs we were driving down the road, the \"check engine\" light came on and the car starting making a serious clunking sound.  It definitely didn't sound good and we were about 5 miles from anything that we could walk to.  We pulled over with the car smoking and Bob called his dad who said he'd come rescue us.  We waited there for about 15 minutes and Bob had texted his girlfriend to let her know we were having a bit of trouble and to stall.  \n\nThe next thing that happened was just amazing.  We saw Bob's dad coming down the road with his pickup truck, but we were a little surprised to see his mother's car driving behind him.  His dad stepped out and took a quick look at the car and said \"It's fucked\".  I was really dejected at this point because two people had gone out of their way to set me up with my dream girl and the evening was turning to shit.  What happened next still stuns me to this day.  \n\nBob's dad said that he would have to call a wrecker to get the car towed to the garage, so we thought the evening was over.  At that point, his dad waved to his mother in the other car and motioned for her to come up with us.  His mom stepped out, handed Bob the keys and said \"I know you boys have a big night planned, so go ahead and take my car tonight.  I'll drive your dad's truck home and he's going to wait on the wrecker.\"  I was almost in shock.  Somehow, I believed a miracle had happened and, for once, the stars had aligned in my favor.  We cranked the radio up and headed down the road to meet Bob's girlfriend and the object of my affection.  \n\nWe had decided to \"run into each other\" at the local mall (where else?) so we could all grab a bite to eat together and walk around a little bit.  Bob's girlfriend suggested that being in a mall with other people around would not be as intense for me as being on a double date or, heaven forbid, an actual one-on-one date with dream girl.  Bob and I were walking along and he saw his girlfriend who was very \"surprised\" to see us both there at the same time as they were.  \n\nBob's girlfriend then decided it was the perfect time to introduce me to her friend.  James, this is Dream Girl.  Dream Girl, this is James\".  I managed to squeak out a \"Hi\" and she said \"Hi.  I've seen you at school before.  I was wanting to hang out with you sometime, but I wasn't sure if you were interested\".  Well, fuck me Santa Claus.  I said a few words that have been forgotten and for probably good reason and then we decided that we were hungry and headed over to the food court to get some grub.  It's always easier to deal with butterflies when you smother those little fuckers with pizza.  \n\nWe decided to hit Sbarro and grab some Italian food.  It was about as Italian as we were going to get where we were.  Bob and his girlfriend ordered their food and then Dream Girl and I stepped up to order ours.  We placed our order and I started to reach for my wallet when Dream Girl says \"I think I have enough money.  Hang on.\"  I'm standing there thinking \"You've got to be shitting me.  I'm the one who was dying to meet her and she wants to pay for dinner?\".  You just can't beat that.  \n\nThe cashier rang up our food and Dream Girl started counting out the money.  She looked over at me a little red-faced and said \"I'm really sorry.  I'm just a little bit short.  Can you help me out?\".  I said \"Sure, how much do you need?\".  She said, \"I need about tree-fiddy\".  It was about that time that I realized that Dream Girl was 8 stories tall and was a large crustacean from the paleolithic era.  I said \"I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy you damn Loch Ness monster!  Now get the hell out of here!!!\".  Dinner or not, I wasn't about to give up any money to that monster.  That's my story.

I kept reading all the way through and was completely shocked that it did not contain any memes or jokes or reddit references.

Quickly walking over to me she pressed up against me and started to unbutton my shirt for me, sliding back the shirt over my shoulders. She took off her white satin gloves gently touching my chest arousing my inner beast. She could feel my rock hard cock pressing against her stomach as she started to get down on her knees. I felt a tug at my belt and pants, soon after I heard the sound of my zipper giving way to my pulsating erection. She slid her fingers into my boxers pulling them down exposing my cock. As she grasped onto my cock firmly, yet with a gentle touch, she stroked it a few times. My head went back with anticipation and excitement for what was to happen next. I then heard her say, \"Where's my $3.50?\" Stunned by this question I looked down and tore away the veil revealing her to actually being a eighty foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic period.

{"body": "&gt;You can't miss out on the good for the sake of the perfect. \n\nNo idea what you're trying to say here.There is NO evidence that's reliable to date. Asking for SOME isn't going for perfect knowledge, it's asking for at least some trace of reliable evidence. If someone came to you and promised a 'miracle cure' are you telling me you would just cough up your life savings in the hope of it... in the face of a dozen other similar claims? Or would you be at least somewhat skeptical and ask for some evidence their claim was valid? Be honest, you would ask for some evidence, right? Okay, so would I. Only difference is that I would ask for the same type of evidence in both cases, whereas many believers are satisfied with internal emotional evidence, and I'm not, because I'm very aware of how easily our emotions go astray. \n\n&gt;If you hesitate to believe because you can't be sure, you get the same loss of soul and punishment. \n\nI don't know about you, but belief (real belief) isn't a choice so much as an action taken on a conviction. I believe my wife is a good person due to years of contact. I can't choose to believe in god (lacking any evidence that is credible to me) any more than I can believe in any other being lacking evidence (from the loch ness monster to big foot to elves, I can't force myself to believe without some solid reason to do so). Can you?\n\n&gt;Zero religions let atheists that didn't try to follow the morals they prescribe in, so you're almost certainly screwed. \n\nHow would you know anything at all about me? Bit presumptuous and arrogant to assume I am not a moral person don't you think? I don't assume you're prone to being judgmental just because you're a Christian, do me the favor of not assuming I'm an evil person and keep it about the topic at hand. \n\n&gt;Because of that, this \"there's no evidence I'd accept\" standard is a bad proposition to make.\n\nI never said that, that was AstroNerf. There IS evidence I would accept, it just isn't the evidence we have because the evidence we have is suffers from being second or third hand, details lost in time, circumstantial, confirmation bias, or entirely subjective. Similar evidence exists for many religions, yet I'll bet you won't even consider them to be potentially real. Why is it okay for you to dismiss their scripture, their prophets, their faith and personal testimony and want reliable evidence to support their claim but it's not okay for me to apply that same standard to your claims, or anyone else's claims?

Because the church and state is supposed to be separate right? I’m confused because I never went to school. Does a confused person ever get a resolution? You see, when you make a cross with your fingers, that’s how I felt when I was in Waterloo. Because when I walked there and smiled at people, they treated me like a vampire. Those who know me, I’m a nobody, and you can’t kill a person with no body? So why I am afraid? I’m afraid of the [boogeyman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1kApnsayeQ). Who is the boogeyman? You are the boogyman. I’m getting out of here, I’m going back to Waterloo where the vampires hang out. I’m gonna wear my sunglasses at night, you know why, because women, show their tits, have short skirts, and then they feel violated when I look at them. Why? I’m from Humberside. All those people who call me a sleepwalker, I woke up. Now I’m going back to sleep. Look at this city, it was a shithole when I worked here. We don’t have bums. But Waterloo has bums, they created me. Why? Maybe it’s the church. I don't know, ask the pope, he knows everything. I’m gonna die. How can you die when you’re already dead. I’m not gonna raise my voice. I’m going naked in the sea, try to stop me you rapscallion. Just try! Sorry for raising my voice, I believe in God. I promise. I'm just a confused old man, and I'm only 21 years old. I was born in March, I like cats, I don't like crabs. What is my name? Is it really **WILLIE POLLARD**? Yes, it fucking is SO GET USED TO IT PAL. I HEAR VOICES. Maine has lobsters. Everything is dead, but the state is so alive it's scary. What are you calling me? I don't know. GOD HELP ME. [**I DON'T EVEN PAY TAXES IN MAINE**](http://imgur.com/28AjHeh).\n\nBut anyways, I remember one time back in 1973 I was in a massive orgy. I had 20 guys circle jerk around me. I loved it so much that I did it every day for a year. I got addicted to semen. This got me kicked out of the nunnery. I was a lesbian atheist after this. 40 years of my life down the drain, and I was only 20 years old. My husband at the time turned out to be a woman. 30 years later there I am, in a lesbian squirt bukakke. I was and old woman but I could still squirt with the best of them. Kids these days have it so good. That day it was snowing, and I walked into the snow naked. I got hot when I was in the snow. I went to he hospital. At that point I found out that I had a penis, a massive 12 inch penis, so I chopped it off. Right on top of my house, and drank the blood of it. I fed the penis to a homeless man. But I lost a lot of blood, so I started going insane. So a Russian man named Vladimir shot me. By this point I only had half of a head. I love Ryan Gosling, so I killed him too. I also needed TP for my bunghole. I was so turned on I had a massive blood orgy. With men, women, bears, cats. I sucked a bears penis, he then shoved his bear penis into my new vagina. It was the sexiest night of my life. It was me, the bear, and 5 handles of Stolichnaya. We drank it all, then I rode on his back into the night, before being harpooned by an eskimo named Tasniki. I then died. Then I got dragged down into hell, and it surprised me. Hell was not in a cave of fire, it was in North Korea. I still don't pay taxes in Maine. That is my biggest regret.\n\nBut I know what needs to be done. I must fight the army of polar bears, that will invade Bates College, to avoid taxes in Maine. When I kill them, I will fuck every one of them, then chop my dick off, and bomb Russia. But about Maine, we do exist you rascaling lover. We're dead and alive at the same time. Like Russia. We show Putin our tits, and he likes it. But we love them. We will also bomb Turkmenistan, because WHY THE HELL NOT. Kidding, we love them all like Putin loves tits. I had sex with Putin and Kabaeva. I love Canada. But I love Maine and want to bomb Canada. That is our plan, to bomb Canada, so we can avoid paying taxes in Maine. WATCH OUT MOUNTIES, we are coming after you. Then we will kill your Polar Bears and fuck their dead bodies. I love you Canada. I love myself. What am I talking about? I don't know. I'm gonna die. How can you die when you're already dead. I'm going back to Bates, where everyone treats me like a vampire, and act like a vampire. I will suck the blood from their cocks I chop off, just like dracula. What do I mean? You figure it out. I'm going into the ocean, I'm gonna die among the fishes. Only then will I truly live. Just try to stop me you rapscallion.\n\nBut what about Maine? What happens to the state that Willie Pollard doesn't pay taxes in? What happens to the places that are so alive but dead? What happens after we nuke Canada? I win. I fucking win. I love all of you. But I win. I fuck a whale, then I chop my dick off. But really, I'm just a crazed man. I'm not a good man. I need help. For my head. I'm so alone. So cripplingly alone. But I have love. I have love from people all around the world . The Prostitutes I hire love me tender. I think I'm schizophrenic with all these voices I hear. Sorry for typing all of that, the voices told me to. But, even after all these stories, my largest regret is that I don't pay taxes in Maine.\n\nWhat am I even talking about? Do I make sense? Does life make sense? Does anything make sense anymore. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Just what are you all afraid of. Admit that you are powerless, everyone is powerless. I'm gonna be committed in an isolation booth, where they can perceive me for what I am, A FUCK UP. But who is the boogeyman? You figure it out. Ask the Pope, he knows everything. I'm gonna die. How can you die when you're dead? Wait, I'm going to be crucified right? I promise I wont raise my [voice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ktbhw0v186Q), because I'm committed to the Lord. I'm committed to God. \n\nThe I found out that it was just the Lochness Monster, and he wanted tree fiddy.

This actually works both ways and I know that I'm there for them as a friend when they need it, in that I'm always there to listen and I keep being told that I lend much needed perspective and good advice. \nThe thing is, at some point between seeing a girl and realizing I might want to be more than friends with her, I've already stepped into the friend zone and this has happened in around 95% of all relationships I've ever had with women. I realize it's to some extent my average-Ness and the fact that I'm incredibly easy to be around. Put the two together and I have most women putting me in the friends category, the category of people that everyone likes to keep around for when things get shitty. \nThing is, I realize all this because I do the same to some people around me too. When I said a lot of my friends were women, a lot of them are friends I genuinely enjoy spending time with but wouldn't probably want to be in a relationship with. I see the circle. \nMy question to you is, do you have about tree fiddy? ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366945802", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Phew. This is a tough one, because it's kind of personal.\n\nYears ago, on a night shift, my partner and I were discussing paranormal stuff, and we started joking about how whether an ambulance- being mobile- could actually be \"haunted.\" I mean, a house- sure, whatever. The energy of the corporeal being remains behind, and that \"energy\" somehow results in apparitions and paranormal stuff. There's supposedly a ghost train in the basement of some ancient bar in Tombstone in the southern part of the state, things like that. But can an ambulance really be haunted?\n\nI mean, a patient dies in the ambo- does the ghost haunt that part of the road you're passing over? I mean, if you're doing CPR, is that patient really dead? Does that spectral energy get dispersed over several miles of highway? The logistics of a haunting get all weird, I argued, so an ambulance can't *really* be haunted like an ER room or whatever.\n\nThat's when it all started, maybe a week or so later.\n\nWe were driving back from a nursing home call, late night stuff, taking the patient to the ER for chest pains- routine stuff, and I swear I saw something dark out of the corner of my eye, as if oozing through the compartment window to my right. Blink- and it's gone, just like that.\n\nI didn't think anything of it at the time. Not a big deal, chalk it up to late night shift work, shadows and so forth. But on the next shift- in the same ambo- we're doing an LDT, and my partner is in back, and turned off the lights so the patient could sleep since it's a two hour drive. And this time, there's the same black... *thing*, oozing over the compartment window. I didn't move my head; I just slowly averted my gaze, and I saw the damned thing, fat and snake-like, oozing over the sill. And then it was gone. The hair stood up on the back of my neck, and I left the overhead light on for the rest of the trip. I kept my partner Marty awake for the entire return trip, just talking.\n\nThe next couple of shifts, I was in back with the patient, and I kept looking at the window frame every few miles while working nights. I didn't see a damned thing, but I didn't sit in the captain's chair. I wasn't going to leave my back turned to whatever it was, either.\n\nBy the next time I was due to drive, I had forgotten about the previous incident. Late into the shift, around oh-dark-thirty hours, driving back from the third EtOH call that night (college town), and there it was. My partner was asleep, and I had no way of waking him up to alert him to the presence of The Thing. This time, instead of oozing, the damned thing was coming through the window and I could fucking *feel* it this time, displacing the air.\n\n\"WHAT ARE YOU?\" I hissed. Marty was sound asleep. \"WHAT DO YOU WANT?\"\n\nAnd the black spectral apparition bent down, and said, \"I need about treefiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time I noticed the creature was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic Era.\n\n\"God damned Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367030262", "subreddit": "ems", "score": 59, "controversiality": 0}

This makes rejecting certain claims perfectly fine and logically sound.\n\nIf you choose the term \"rejecting,\" and not just \"staying neutral,\" than you are taking steps toward a conclusion.  You are taking steps toward faith.\n\nAnd faith should be the antithesis of true atheism.\n\n&gt; Do you consider yourself neutral regarding bigfoot and the monster of Loch Nes?\n\nYes.\n\nI think they're unlikely, in what I recognize to be a mild opinion ... but it's not an opinion I wouldn't lay a feather hat on.  I wouldn't debate for a second on the matter.\n\nBecause, as soon as I do, I'm positioning myself to pretend I know something I honestly don't know the first thing about.\n\nSo, the answer to that is, Yes.  I know nothing about whether the Loch Ness monster exists.  And every bit of evidence I have, either way, comes from believing what other people have told me ... just like is the case for those who believe that Moses parted the Red Sea.\n \nEdit - Probably the more important point is that, as soon as I \"reject the claim,\" and hold something to be false, due to a lack of evidence, I'm doing something even more harmful:  I'm assuming I know what the claim is in the first place.\n\nIn the case of religion, everybody here (practically) assumes it means, \"I choose to believe in an invisible deity,\" when, actually, for so many people who *practice* (see that?  an active verb, not a passive word like \"believe\") a religion, it isn't about what does or doesn't exist in the sky.  It's about a way of living a life, day to day, with active ways to keep oneself focused and strong.  Can one do this without religion?  Yes.  Can one have religion and do worse things in its name?  Yes.  But that doesn't change the fact that millions if not billions of people adhere to a religion not because of \"beliefs,\" but because of what it offers them in a daily sense.\n\nAnd as soon as you say, \"Religion is wrong because science doesn't support the idea of an invisible spaghetti monster,\" you're done the worst bit of science imaginable:  you misclassified and mis-defined the very thing you were studying.

Everytime anyone from Google talks about sd cards they say something about how they're confusing and provide a bad experience for end users.  Here's what Matias Duarte says about them\n\n\"Why don’t Nexus devices have SD cards?\n\nEverybody likes the idea of having an SD card, but in reality it's just confusing for users.\n\nIf you’re saving photos, videos or music, where does it go? Is it on your phone? Or on your card? Should there be a setting? Prompt everytime? What happens to the experience when you swap out the card? It’s just too complicated.\n\nWe take a different approach. Your Nexus has a fixed amount of space and your apps just seamlessly use it for you without you ever having to worry about files or volumes or any of that techy nonsense left over from the paleolithic era of computing.\n\nWith a Nexus you know exactly how much storage you get upfront and you can decide what’s the right size for you. That’s simple and good for users.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367131758", "subreddit": "Android", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I've refrained from commenting at r/economics because, by some definitions, I am pro-austerity.\n\nI have never, however, believed that austerity would lead to instant growth. It doesn't. Never will. I'm (sort of) pro-austerity, even knowing the fact that it makes things worse... *in the short term*.\n\nThe thing about fiscal policy is that it has fairly predictable results. \n\nIf you have expansionary fiscal policy, the economy will boom in the short term, but over the long term it settles back to normal - except that debts accrued during the expansion need to be paid back.\n\nIf you have contractionary fiscal policy, you have the opposite effect. The economy will contract in the short term, but will settle back to normal over the longer term - except that the savings you make during the contraction will begin to pay off.\n\nIn the case of Spain, they are not beyond doomed. (As rightmind said, Spain and other PIIGS nations have been doomed for a very long time) The negative effects of austerity are only short term. The Spanish economy will recover, and that recovery will bring about a fall in unemployment.\n\nThe long term effect of austerity is to bring public finances into line. The horrible spending cuts and tax increases that accompany austerity will have no discernible effect on government finances during the contractionary period. The prize - more sustainable government finances - is only achievable over the longer period. And this will occur.\n\nAs Spain recovers, the Spanish government will begin to reap the tax revenues of an expanding economy. If they are intelligent about things, they won't touch spending or tax rates until debt levels reach zero (net).\n\nNow I've said that I am \"sort of\" pro austerity. While there is always room for productivity improvements in government departments, some countries,  Greece for example, are worse than others. Spending cuts and the retrenchment of public servants should only be a serious consideration if it can be proved that various government programs are inefficient. I'm not one who believes that all government is inefficient, and I'm not one who believes that all government is wonderful either.\n\nBut the vast majority of austerity measures should, in my opinion, be worn by tax increases - especially taxes upon the wealthy. I would rather tax a rich person's income than cut spending on public health or education (assuming, of course, that these government departments are relatively efficient).\n\nYou see I'm only as Keynesian as as Keynes probably was at the time that he wrote his stuff. Economy faltering? Government should spend. Economy booming? Government should save. The government's counter-cyclical behaviour is what helps an economy moderate between periods of high growth and periods of economic contraction.\n\nThe thing is though that Keynes was not writing in a time of high government debt. Prior to the Great Depression, national governments had not gone into debt in the same way as governments today had done. The presence of high levels of debt in western countries prior to the Great Financial Crisis is unprecedented in history.\n\nThere is another solution, though, which no one really thought of: an increase in spending accompanied by an increase in tax rates.\n\nThis sort of action has not, to my knowledge, been tried. On the one hand you have an expansion in government spending. Build solar power plants, wind turbines, grid energy storage, high speed rail links, underground power cabling, expanded subway systems, universal tutoring for 6-10 year olds, an underground tunnel between Europe and North Africa, a bridge across the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia, put a human on Mars, etc etc etc. All these things are good and yes these things could form the basis of some great, effective spending in a time of economic crisis. But while this is happening, raise taxes as well, and raise them so that the government ends up with a fiscal surplus rather than a deficit. And when things begin to recover, pare back the spending without paring back the tax - increased surpluses are used to buy back past debt and, eventually, retire it all, and actually be in situation whereby a country could actually use Keynesian policy effectively. \n\n**TL;DR Loch Ness Monster owes me tree fiddy.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367135876", "subreddit": "Economics", "score": 34, "controversiality": 0}

Scouting events were one of the few ways that dad could spend extended quality time with his son, and this camping trip had been very good for the both of them. He got a little choked up about it, as did I. I simply told him, \"this is what scouting is all about. 'Help other people at all times.' This is just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nOver the next year+, they became regulars of the store. I knew which troop they were with, a large and active one, so they were pretty consistently in need of various consumable camping supplies. More pictures got posted to the brag board. His first summer camp saw him earn four merit badges and the Mile Swim badge. I started to volunteer with his troop as a merit badge counselor, and had a great time.\n\nHowever, real life gets in the way. School, and a couple of new jobs meant I couldn't devote the time I needed to to help his troop out. We basically drifted apart, and the other things going on in my life made me forget about him and his dad.\n\nUntil late in 2010. I get a phone call out of the blue.

{"body": "&gt; evolution, big bang, how that first single cell organism came to be, ect.\n\nAre all questions not addressed by atheism. In fact, atheism only addresses one thing, one's position on the existence of gods. I am an atheist because I have found the claims of theist unconvincing. \n\nAll the things you mentioned are scientific questions outside the purview of atheism.\n\n&gt; Disproof of religions would be great too.\n\nThis is shifting of the burden of proof and a fallacy(proving a negative). However, many gods can, in fact, be dis-proven. \n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as many modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\n&gt; as there IS some proof\"\n\nOh, please share this proof. I really do want to hear you best 'proof'...I'm hoping it's better than the ones I've heard before.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367165391", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

As I cowered in fear outside of the tent I heard her say \"Wait, come back in here!\" So I did just that and she looked me dead in the eyes and said \"Let's do it.\" I didn't even know what to do but I was so excited that I just threw everything off except my underwear. She also got undressed but being as excited as I was, I thought I'd help her.

{"body": "Lived in the Highlands all my life and totally agree. No offence to Fort William but it feels like an aged town. It needs some revamping - it's just not worth the trip unless your desperate to take photos of/climb Nevis. \nGo to Mallaig instead. Pretty little fishing town. \n\nIf you want to see Loch Ness, pop to Dores or try the other side of the Loch at Drumnadrochit. If you head to drum there's a few good walking trails and a lovely restaurant called The Loch Ness Inn. Only things worth doing in Drum.\nGo on a Jacobite cruise if you want to go out on the Loch - the other boats (Nessie Hunter etc.) are not worth the money. Don't both with either Exhibition Centers. Also money-grabbing areas.\nThe thing with the Loch Ness area, on either side of the Loch, the main point of visiting is to take in the beauty of the area. It is gorgeous, there are lots of walks/hikes and it is worth it if you can get some sunshine. Avoid the 'attraction centres' and you'll be fine.  \n\nNow. Urquhart Castle. If you've got a National Trust membership, go for it but otherwise, avoid it. Biggest honey pot there, stupidly expensive to see a few ruins, a replica trebuchet and a short, terrible film on the history. If you want the history of it, ask me or Wikipedia, save yourself a few quid. (I would say hop over the gate at night but they've hired a night guard now because I used to tell folks visit the cafe I worked at).\n\nIf you still don't fancy Loch Ness area, but do love quaint second-hand book stores that used to be a church, then head into Inverness for a day on your way back from Fort William. The place I'm talking about is called Leakys. It's a lovely old bookshop with a big log fire in the middle of it. There's a small cafe there too that does bacon butties the size of a doorstop. \nInverness isn't a bad city - there's plenty of shops, a fair few restaurants and walking along by the river is lovely. Eden court is a fairly interesting building as is the Archives. There's a castle there too - made of red sandstone and completely full intact - however, it's actually used as the courthouse now. There's lots of old churches/cathedrals in the city too. If you go round the back and park by the Moray Firth on a good day you can see grey seals, dolphins and otters under the Kessock Bridge. \n\nAvoid Dingwall. No one likes Dingwall.\n\nKeeping in the Highlands, if you're looking for scenic hikes, go to Aviemore. \nIf you have kids, or like animals, pop to the Highland Wildlife Park while you're there too. Can be pricey but they're a lovely lot of people there and there's lots of animals including Scottish Wildcats (sadly the only place you're likely to see them.)\n\nIn Edinburgh, best admire the castle from a distance. Tram works are still in effect so don't be put if by the construction areas. \nMary Kings Close is a must visit but book in advance if you're heading there during high season.\n\nHmm only other thing to say is, if you find a very nice, high quality restaurant, get some haggis. Unless you're vegetarian.\nTry lorne (square) sausage for your breakfast one day too! And irn bru to wash it all down.

{"body": "I posted this in a similar thread a little while back.  Here it is.  \n\nOkay, so I was over at a friends house a couple summers ago. I was 18 at the time. My friend and I were playing Super Mario World up until about 3 in the morning. Now at this point I should mention that he had a 9/10 19 year old sister who was just getting home from being out with her friends at this point. My friend said that he was going to go upstairs to take a shit, as we had Taco Bell for lunch and dinner that day. Now his sister was normally a total slut, but it was apparent that she had been drinking, so she was all over me as soon as her brother was up the stairs. She was saying things like \"I want you, put it in me\". Now, being an 18 year old virgin, I was all for this. She was sexy and DTF, so we got to it, as my friend would be at least 30 more minutes. She started to ride me, bareback because why not? I was just about to reach the point of no return when she said \"wait, could you let me know when you're ready and pull out?\" \"Sure\" I said, I was ready to take whatever I could get. Then she said \"I just need one more thing, too.\" \"What do you need?\" Then she said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Now it was at this point that I noticed my friend's beautiful sister was really an eight story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again. I yelled \"God dammit monstah I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" as she swam away.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367198095", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've been tracking the paleo community for 2-3 years now, and I've seen the evolution of thinking over time. I'm not sure if Thevents is aware of the various schools of thought or not, but I certainly won't blame him for not realizing it.\n\nOriginally, Loren Cordain popularized the paleo diet by starting with the assumption that we didn't adapt to eating foods after the Paleolithic era. Then he looked for science to support this view. This is akin to a vegan starting with the assumption that any animal food is unhealthy, and then looking for the supporting science. Both methods are susceptible to cherry picking the evidence to support your bias.\n\nCritics of the paleo diet (both external and internal to the community) have pointed out the flaws with this kind of paleo reasoning, and that is why many of the great paleo thinkers no longer defend paleo from this angle. It doesn't stand up to scrutiny.\n\nInstead, paleo advocates now suggest using modern science to identify harmful foods, and then falling back on ancestral defaults when the relevant science is either unclear or unavailable.\n\nKurt Harris even coined a term to mark this shift in paleo thinking - \"[Paleo 2.0](http://www.archevore.com/panu-weblog/2011/3/30/paleo-20-a-diet-manifesto.html)\":\n\n&gt; I call such an approach, when using all available science, and not just evolutionary speculation, Paleo 2.0\n&gt;\n&gt; Paleo 2.0  is paleonutrition where the paleo- prefix means archaic, not paleolithic\n&gt;\n&gt; We appeal to archaic foodways to learn what is wrong with our modern Neolithic/industrial diet. These archaic foodways could be hundreds of years old, or many thousands.\n\nThe term \"paleo\" is largely a relic of the past, and it carries with it a lot of baggage that is holding the movement back and exposing it to unnecessary criticism. Bloggers have lamented the ill-chosen term paleo, but now it's gained so much steam that it's too late to change it.\n\nSo what does this all have to do with genetically engineered food? If the modern science deems it OK, then just because you are \"paleo\" does not mean you have to hate on GMO.

{"body": "When I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students. I heard most of the drama but there is one student that I will always be reminded of when people ask this question. \n\nThere was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip. She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't. Everyone could hear her, including me. Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about. She gossiped most days but one day was different. \n\nI heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom. I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not? It could be fun. \n\nAnyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with. \n\nMr.BundtCaek....\n\nI was shocked when I heard this. \n\nBut stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young. She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess. If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress.\n\nAfter class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work. It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head.\n\nAs soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, \"Hey Kathy. I heard you talking about me in class...\" she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, \"Oh my god! You heard me say that? I'm so sorry! And-\" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, \"I want to have sex with you too.\"\n\nShe stopped her sentence and smiled. Then she said, \"Do you know what my rates are?\"\n\nConfused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in. It turns out she mentioned that she would have sex with me... if I paid that is. \n\nI decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her. \"Alright,\" I told her. \"What do you mean?\" \n\n\"I'll do it, but I need some money of course. That's just how it works.\" she said. I replied, \"Okay, what do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had tricked me again! \"GODDAMNIT MONSTAH, I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" I said to her as she swam away.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367295584", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, it's half true, because she's my half sister. Neither of us had any idea the other existed until about a year ago.once we found out that the other existed, we talked on the phone almost every night. I hope around with everybody when I'm bored, and say things like\"I'LL FUCK YOU UNTIL YOU THINK IT'S CONSENSUAL\". Well,I said this to her a few times and got the usual response(haha shut up, you're so stupid,etc), until the last time I said it. \"What makes you think it wouldn't be consensual?\". Instant boner. I couldn't tell if she was serious or not, so I said\"we've talked about it sex lives, and I know you've got some kink to you, but I doubt you've got it in you to fuck your brother.\" Her response? \"Well,I guess you don't know me very well. We'll have to do some...catching up..next time you cum over;) (this was through text, word for word). And of course I was initially skeptical,cuz I mean, come on. But I guess it's a natural thing for siblings who have never met each other to be attracted to one another when they meet later in life. But back to the story. She has get mom come and pick me up a couple of days later, were both in the backseat, with our little sister up front. Just to test the waters,I put my hand between her legs(they were out off sight from the front of the car).when she didn't stop me,I went to slip my hand down the side of her pants, and yet again, she didn't stop me.I should probably mention she was wearing yoga pants for those of you assuming I undid her belt/button/zipper. I started playing with her pussy, and she seemed to fuckin love it, so I fingered her to get more of a reaction, turns out I was right.went straight rainforest, man.So, we get to her house,n go to\"play guitar hero\"in her room.as soon as that lock turned we were making out like new lovers.I started fingering her again, then her pants come off and I go to town, downtown.she came so quick it was unreal, so after she completely soaked my face with her sweet, sweet nectar, she bit my ear lobe and whispered\"your turn, big brother\". I was lucky I didn't blow right in my pants then and there. But nevertheless, she stuck her hand down my pants and started playing with my dick, after about 30 seconds of that and making out she told me to\"take those fuckin pants off\", to which I replied by tearing them off at supersonic speeds. She kissed me from my lips down to my stomach, and that's when I felt her mouth close over my cock. I couldn't believe it. Literally the hottest fantasy I had, coming(heh) to life.I was off in under a minute, which was probably a good thing, because our other sister knocked at the door right as I fastened my belt. So no, we didn't have sex. *yet*. She's still up for it(duh) and we plan on it the next time we have enough alone time.sorry it took so long, I'm on my phone.You can choose to believe it or not, but I shared the whole, unedited true story of how my sister gave me the best head of my life, and I could care less what you think.

{"body": "When I was about 9 years old I moved into a new house, it wasn't anything fancy or modern. This house was old though, and everyone had strange feelings about it, we thought it was all fine and dandy and really appreciated the \"ageness\" of it. Right off the bat things seemed strange to me. Not really anything happening, just felt off. I would wake up in the middle of the night or suddenly feel very cold or hot, I just attributed it to the drafts or something like that. But carry I'll on, about a week into living there I was playing in the back yard, nothing special, just pretending to have a war with those tiny little army men, using a lighter to melt them (which seems a bit strange now) like they got wounded in a brush with war. Suddenly I looked back for a reason I can't explain and I thought I saw something run into the shed, well at least the door was in the final moments of closing just as I looked over. I was obviously scared and ran inside and pretended nothing happened. \n\n\nLater in the week I was walking home from school (I was fortunate enough to only have to walk about 20 minutes back and forth so my mom would still let me walk alone). I heard screaming and laughing coming from my backyard, it sounded like my mom and brother were playing some stupid game and she was just messing with him. So I go into the front door and there is a note saying she has just gone to get some food for dinner, and my brother wasn't home from work as he had detention (I later found out), but I didn't know this and went walking around looking for him, he wasn't upstairs and suddenly a lightbulb went off in my head, and I remembered the noises \"maybe he had a girl over or something?\". I ran outside and the shed was open and the stuff on the side was scattered all over the place, my brother no where to be found and me scared shitless of the shed I left it alone and ran to my room to play with my gameboy until my mom got home. She saw what happened out back and snapped and I was then grounded for a week and had to clean and do extra chores. I was pissed right the fuck off.\n\n\nThat same night I felt another cold draft and I swear I could see my breath, I was sure my house was haunted, it woke me up and it was 3:50 am and I heard more giggling and laughing of an old woman, I thought this was strange as my mom is a heavy sleeper and is never up this late, I also heard a deep growl coming from down the stairs outside my room, I got all scared but had to find out. I walked outside my room, loaded with pajamas and my plastic extendable light saber, and ran down the stairs, tripped, hit my head (still have a scar to this day) and saw big (huuuuge) feet, which were hairy and I could swear they were scaley, from under the door (it was one of those old ones that didn't fit all that well but was good enough, there was about 4 inches between the bottom of the door and the floor), it scared me so bad I ran into my room and cried for about an hour before falling asleep. \n\n\nThis waking up at ten to 4 every morning happened almost every night at it's peaks, but at best was about 2 nights between. I was so scared the ghost would come for me in my sleep.\n\n\nI knew it had to do with the shed but I was way too damn scared to go in there. But I had to man up so I devised a little contraption with my remote control car and one of those bulky cameras taped to it (before them smart phones, lucky kids), I thought it was genius, like in Home Alone or another kids movie. It worked brilliantly. I saw everything, from axes to chainsaws, to a lawnmower and rakes. No Ghosts or anything else as I suspected. But just as I turned the car to leave A long nailed hand, like a claw, grabbed the edge of the door frame and I quickly whipped it around and... Nothing. Lost it again. Damn.\n\n\nI had to know, so I swallowed my fears and I woke up at 3:45 am to go down those stairs and into that shed (I chose this time because I kept waking up at 3:50 am for no apparent reason all cold and scared), I went down those stairs and was outfront my shed by 3:47 with a flashlight and my light saber. I did not open the door just yet, I waited until exactly 3:50 when I opened it...\n\n\nThis was about the time I noticed this ghost was about 500 feet tall and from the palentological era and all he had to say was \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy..\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367347519", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, so this is definitely one of the freakiest experiences of my life.\n\n\nSo it's late (I want to say about four in the morning or so), and my friends and I are leaving a bar in NYC. Usually we'd just take the subway since it was a pretty direct line from the station by bar to my friend's apartment, but we were with this one kid who liked to buy people shit when he was drunk, so we let him buy a cab for us. We figured it would've been easier... boy, were we wrong.\nA cab pulls over, and everything seems normal enough. I forget what he said his name was, but he was really chatty at first and seemed pleasant enough. We told him the fastest way to get home would probably be down Broadway, and he was just like, \"No, shortcut, shortcut!\"\nSo he's going up some street I didn't recognize and he's continually trying to make small talk even though we're starting to doubt his \"shortcut\" was even a real thing. Eventually, my one friend who lives in the city just yells at him and says, \"Sir, this isn't the way back to my apartment building. You're going in the wrong direction.\"\nThe guy apologizes and makes a turn down a sketchier street. We're all starting to get really uncomfortable. This is where shit hit the fan. He makes another turn and there's a cop car parked along the side of the street. Immediately upon seeing the cop car, he BOLTS. He accelerates and goes straight through a stop sign and gets the fuck outta there. The cop car immediately puts on his lights and follows us.\nWe're freaking out in the back, screaming at this dude to stop. He's having a pseudo-panic attack and yelling at us, saying \"It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok!\" But it's clearly not... he's zooming up and down back alleyways, going up the wrong way of a couple one-way streets, and just driving like an all-around maniac. The cop is continuing to chase us, but we are gradually getting away.\nObviously, we're freaking out in the back of the cab. Why the fuck did this taxi driver just go insane? All I knew was that he just panicked when he saw the cop car, so something was very, very wrong. For all I knew, we were going to be taken hostage or some shit. Basically everyone was in the back pissing their pants.\nSo he drives extremely crazy for another fifteen minutes, and luckily there's not much going on in the street since it's 4:30am. After not much longer, we can no longer see the cop car, and surprisingly, no other cops came (I was expecting a full-out chase with multiple cops). We are all speechlessly freaked out at this point. He turns down this HELLA SKETCHY alley and my friends whispers we are in Spanish Harlem. The taxi driver turned off all his lights and goes \"keep it down and don't move.\" I actually tried to go for the door to get out and he goes, \"DON'T YOU DARE!\" So I folded my hands and shut the fuck up, not sure if he had a gun or some other kind of weapon.\nThere we are, three drunk guys and an insane cab driver sitting in a dark alley of Spanish Harlem. About a minute later, we watch as the cop car literally speeds past the road we just got off of - as if it is right out of a car chase in a movie or some shit. We're all sweating bullets and freaking out still. After a few more moments of us sitting there in silence, the cab driver turns around and says, \"Ok, you guys can get out now. Sorry, you're going to have to find another way home.\"\nWe just mutter something like \"Ok\" because we want to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. I go to open the door to leave and before I can get out, the driver yells, \"WAIT!\"\nI nervously turned to him, half expecting him to pull out a gun on me or something. He looks me straight in the eye and says, \"Your fare'll be about tree fiddy.\" It was at that exact moment that I realized our cab driver was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367348795", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've told this story before in another thread. I've also told all my friends but none of them believed me. I swear this is a true story. So I was living in a vacation house for 2 weeks, and I swear to fuck this place was haunted. It was an old fashioned house, with ancient plumbing and stuff, and the wind always made it shake. Sometimes there was a loud crash in the middle of the night that woke me up abruptly. Turns out it was one of the bedroom doors slamming shut cause of the wind. As a solution, I just kept all the doors shut during the night. Well one night, when I had all doors closed, there was a loud crash. \"This can't be right,\" I thought to myself. So I went to check it out, and the doors were still closed, with no sign of them slamming. No chips broken off, nothing. That's when I noticed the windows were closed. I always kept them open, because it was hot as hell. Remember, this house was ancient, so no air conditioning. So anyway, the windows were closed, but I could still feel a draft. Then the freaking walls started to rattle, and a quiet, rasp hiss came from them. I couldn't really make out the noise, but it sounded like a voice, saying ***\"KILL..... 7 DAYYSSSS.\"*** I sort of shrugged it off, because I didn't (at the time) believe in ghosts or anything like that.\n\nThe night after that, I heard it again. ***\"KILL...... 6 DAYYSSSS.\"*** Same thing, shrugged it off. The next night, ***\"5 DAYYSSSS.\"*** Sort of freaking out by now. \"4 days.\" Holy shit. \"3 days.\" I'm gonna die. So on until the 7th day, when I could hear it clearly: ***\"Tonight I strike.\"*** Here's the part where I start completely losing my shit. \"Who's there?\" \"What the fuck is going on?\" \"What do you want from me???!!\" Then, more clearly than ever, \"About tree fiddy.\" It was then I realized I was dealing with the loch ness monster. \"God damn loch ness monster! You ain't gettin no tree fiddy!\" So I grabbed that bastard by the head, and used all my strength to throw it out the window.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Never staying in an old fashioned house again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367352163", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Two streets down, their was an old house that looked like a typical horror story murder sight. All the neighborhood kids had their own versions of what went on, vicious deaths, satan worshipping, etc. So one night we went to see for ourselves. Worst mistake ever. We brought nothing but a flashlight and wills we wrote earlier that day in our pockets, to whom our baseball cards and skateboards would go to. We climbed over the old gate and walked through the overgrown lawn. I pushed the door open with a jarring noise. The whole first floor of the house had nothing in particular interest, except huge piles of old newspapers. We went up the stairs. That's when we heard it. A giggle. Then bare feet pattering across the mossy wood floor. Needless to say, we were scared out of our wits. My friend proposed the idea that if we split up we could get home quicker. I reluctantly agreed. I went into a bathroom. Nothing. A bedroom. Nothing. Then from the next room over I heard the most godawful scream ever. I ran in, but my friend was gone. Behind me, the door locked and another giggle entered my ear. That's when I saw it. A little girl in a white dress, stained in blood. \"Wha-What do you want?\" I asked.

{"body": "This story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago.\n\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\n\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty. Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\n\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\n\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\n\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\n\ntl;dr: Haha..
