{"body": "Once, in the house I was living in with my parents, I had snuck down to the basement to play video games. To get the lay out of the basement, picture a fly-swatter, with rooms sticking out of the handle. The laundry room was the swatter part, and the so-dubbed \"game room\" was at the bottom of the handle, to the left. The bathroom was right across from it. So being like 12 and scared my parents would somehow find me (they had psychic powers, but thats another story) I had to pee. Naturally, I go to the bathroom, do my business, but don't flush, because that could wake them. As I was walking across the hall, I happened to look towards the laundry room, where I thought I saw a light. I go to investigate. While I'm poking around down there, I hear a noise. Thinking it's my parents, I freeze, and slowly turn around. I came face to face with what I would think of as a pretty average looking ghost. I thought I was imagining it at first, because \"I was too old to believe in ghosts now.\" Well, as I'm thinking that, the ghost spoke. It said to me \"Who are you?\" so naturally, creeped out, I said \"ShadowBlade. Who are you?\" The ghost replied \"No one of consequence, but I have to ask you something before you go.\" I'm terrified at this point, willing to give him anything as long as he doesn't eat my soul or something. \"W-what do you want?\" \"Well, you see, what I really need is about tree fiddy.\" It was at that time that I realized the ghost was really an eight story tall monster from the Paleozoic Era. So I was like \"dammit monstah! I'm not giving you no tree fiddy!\" and it swam away into the moon-set.\n\n**TL;DR: Ghosts, bathrooms, whatever.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367367948", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

I take it's not feasible to convey for some reason?\n\nOriginal post, I gave you a link which lists dozens of sources for dozens of conditions. If you want specifics on comas and vegetative states, go to wikipedia, that's where I drew my information from. So, let me summarize my position, since honestly, I'm kinda tired at this point.\n\nThere's world-class evidence that a huge variety of conditions impact basically every function of the mind.\n\nFrom this, we give a simple judgement call - the brain is the mind. This is not a judgement call that is certain(then again, nothing is and it's hardly an argument to point this out), but it's pretty much as well established as anything can be. If there's any part of the mind that's not affected by physical damage or injury, then it's so small or so unnoticeable that no one has found it yet.\n\nNow, if you want to say that this is not a rational, scientific or empirical judgement... Then you need world-class evidence of your own. Not just philosophical arguments, not just semantics and word games, not just \"oh, you're not omniscient and you don't know everything yet, suck it induction\", not drawing a map of Europe from your armchair, but actual, real, world-class evidence of your own. \n\nYou can believe whatever you want to believe, but please don't try to pretend like \"brain = mind; therefore it's destroyed when the brain is destroyed\" is an irrational, unscientific, non-empirical judgement call - because it is the best judgement we have, given what we know so far(maybe someday we'll find a listener, just like maybe someday we'll find the Loch Ness monster, but for now, it's not unscientific to say that they don't exist). *That* is my main objection here, the rest, I pretty much don't care much about.\n\nStill, have a couple of upvotes, because even if I'm tired at this point, at least you try to think through this stuff and it was unconventional.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367418780", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Here, I wrote this note to myself at the time, while on the subway one morning:\n\n\"I am all the cliches all the sudden, and I keep thinking to myself, \"oh, so THIS is what they meant...\" Love, to me, has always been an act of quiet desperation, hopeless and painful. The physical symptoms are the same now - shortness of breath, abrupt tightening of the chest, queasy stomach and wobbly knees - but I have not, in recent years, perhaps ever, felt this exultation, this endorphin rush, this floating joy. I'm reveling in it; listening to pop music, dancing when I'm doing the dishes, grinning madly at nothing at all, I don't even recognize myself. How could I? The entire world is different to me, I am gleefully meeting each second of each day. This is not the same person I thought i had shown to the world for the last ten years. I don't even know this person.\n\nEvidently my friends all know her well though, this happy person.  I am just now catching up in my own mind to my public self, that happy, joyous, gregarious person. Perhaps that compounds my overwhelming sense of well being, now I feel balanced, no longer like someone who plays the part, but the part itself.\n\nIntellectually, I'm leery of this. My mind screams that this feeling is unsustainable, that I will inevitably come crashing down from this lofty peak, but I can't bring myself to care. I have two choices, hide, or give myself over to this madness, and I've hidden long enough. If it fails, it fails, but better to have taken the ride. I feel as though I am at the top of the first lift of the Loch Ness monster that first time ever, as though my stomach has taken up permanent residence in my throat, and so what if I puke after?

We have no earthly idea what we talked about that night, but the sun came up before we could bear to say good night to one another, and the very tenor of our relationship had changed irrevocably. Our text messages immediately had a weight to them that they had lacked, and where I had always been happy to see my friend log in (we're a Warcraft couple), after that point, my heart positively leapt to see his name. It was like we had started a conversation that night that neither of us wanted to ever stop having, and every time we could talk was just a continuation. We both realized we were falling in love at the same time (we found out later) and then spent the better part of a week in denial, but honestly, for me, it was like a switch was thrown. I've never had it happen that way before, it was like being struck by lightning.\n\nHonestly, I don't think that we even thought about it as being \"in the relationship\" at all, at the time, because we both felt so odd about the genesis of it.

{"body": "This is the first time I’ve talked about this in ten years, and is without doubt the single worst moment of my life, but here goes…….\n\nWhen I was in high school I had the biggest crush on one of the most popular girls, you know how it goes. Now I wasn’t in the popular crowd by any means, but I wasn’t exactly a nerd; I played football and had quite a few friends. She was (and I can’t emphasize this enough) ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. To put it in perspective, I think she worked for as an underwear model for Italian Lingerie Company a couple of years after school.\n\n\nSo one day this girl – we’ll call her Sandy – and I get paired up on some school camp we were on. We had to walk for miles and miles up this stupid mountain, and I had managed to angle myself in to the group she was walking with. She kept complaining and guys were lining up to hold her stuff and make sure she was ok and hold her hand and all that. Part of me was just telling myself to just go hang with my buddies but I stuck around; as anyone who has been on a school trip will tell you, it’s a perfect place to get to know someone.  \n\nAnyway, disaster struck a little way from the end of the walk and she tripped on a rock and fell into a little stream. Facefirst. Now obviously all the guys scrambled to help her and stuff, but one of the teachers at the back saw her and came and told everyone to catch up with the group……. Except me. The only time being considered responsible has ever got me anywhere!\n\nSo Sandy is all wet and covered in pond slime and stuff, but she’s okay. She gets cleaned up and we go back to camp, talking and laughing and getting on really well.\n\nWhen we get back everyone has disappeared up to some awards ceremony, leaving us two alone. Her little brown shirt is still soaking wet and I can see her nipples harden through it. Without even thinking I just say ‘let’s get you out of those wet clothes’ – I instantly feel like an idiot, but to my surprise she just takes my hand, gives me a little wink and walks towards her bunk room.\n\nAs soon as we get inside she lifts up her arms and pulls off her little shirt and I literally can’t believe my luck. I go to grab her incredible body but she puts her hands on my lips and says: ‘One thing first…’\nI manage to stammer…. ‘What?’ ‘I need about tree fiddy,’ she says. Now it was about that time that I recognised she wasn’t a girl called Sandy at all, but that damned Loch Ness Monster. So I says ‘Look here naw Monster, I ain’t givin’ you no tree fiddy.’ In the end we all left camp as usual but hell, I ain’t forgetting that weekend for nothing.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367421877", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

We pregramed a lot before the bar, since it's difficult to obtain alcohol in a bar when none of us are 21, plus it's really expensive so I wasn't trying too hard to get my friends with fake IDs to buy me some. I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my fucking mind.\n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this really sexy chick dancing by herself. Being drunk as shit, I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance sexy? Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up grinding hard/making out a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes.\n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated. We were making out a lot on my bed, and we took off each others shirts and things were really escalating. I had her panties off, and I was starting to think me losing my virginity was a sure thing. I could tell she was really into it. She said \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". I figured she meant me going down on her, and me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\". Then the question came: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

I swore after the first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance.\n\nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. I won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. Besides the fact that I was studying for a medical-related track (kinesiology) and therefore had to take classes in that type of thing, I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable.\n\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime.\n\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives.\n\nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\"\n\nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\"\n\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "When I was 20, I started dating a girl who there was instant chemistry with. We had similar interests, a similar outlook on life, and she was low-maintenance. I swore after the first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance.\n\nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. I won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. Besides the fact that I was studying for a medical-related track (kinesiology) and therefore had to take classes in that type of thing, I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable.\n\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime.\n\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives.\n\nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\"\n\nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\"\n\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed.\n\nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that. We ended up going our separate ways, but I think everything turned out for the best.\n\n**tl;dr - The greatest night of my life rapidly turned into something much different than what I was expecting**\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367496508", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 46, "controversiality": 0}

People constantly say they see bigfoot, nessie, or aliens and we routinely discount them so why do we not discount it when people thousands of years ago say that the graves emptied of dead and they walked out on the streets?  \n\nEven if the 2nd link was evidence for a migration or exodus of a sort, there has still not been discovered evidence of well over a million people wandering such a small area for decades. There is not any evidence either for 10 plagues that decimated Egypt. Or the wiping out of a ton of their army on a  single day. More embellishment?\n\nSun standing still, one of the 4 \"explanations\" is that Mars swung close enough to Earth to change its axis tilt? The only options that have any relevance would be it was figurative writing to make it sound better so did not happen, or \"god did it\" which means the rules were broken and we do not have to prove anything. Again, people say the most amazing things all the time and without reason to believe them why should we. When science makes statements about ancient civilizations it says this is what we THINK happened to the best of our knowledge that fits the evidence.

She looks greats, but still there are eating issues, I though I would push a little for a hot scene.  \n\nFor some reason, I think it would be really hot to see unbaked instant biscuits stuck to a bare red breasts.  \n\nSo I tie her up so her hands are above her head and I put a blindfold on her.  I smack her ass for a while with a flogger, then I start working on her breasts with a cane, while fingering her, but not allow her to come.  And tell her that I have something new and and different for this scene.  \n\nI get out a tube of instant biscuits, and start to unwrap it a little, then I just hold it in one hand while rubbing her down with the other hand.  I hold the tube near her ear and pull the cardboard, fuse with my teeth, while rubbing her down and distracting her.  The tube pops in the starting way it has and she shrieks a little, and she pees a little.  This I find really funny, and start to laugh, but she is kinda freaked out and is embarrassed.  \n\nSo I have to slow things down and take off the blindfold and show her the biscuits, and tell her it is okay that she peed. Once things are all settled down, I'm like, \"Welp, I still got these biscuits, and she's still tied up, might as well stick'm on her.\" So I take the biscuits and kinda mash them on her chest, and they actually stick pretty well.  The GF is a bit whiny about how cold they are, but I tell her, \"If they fall off you aren't going to like what happens to you\"  She she stays still and lets me stick them on.  Part of me is happy, because the pale dough makes a nice contrast to her darker skin, and I've achieved the weird fetish thing I've been thinking about; but I'm a little dissapointed that the tube explosion/pee incident kind of break of the flow of the scene.\n\nSo she hasn't come yet, but I've edged her a couple of times, and she is close.  I get vibrator and whisper in her ear, \"I'm going to make you come, and if your squirming causes any of those biscuits to fall off, you are going to have to eat it.\"\n\nShe says, \"yes, sir\" and precedes to stand very still.  So I got my hitachi in between her legs and turn it on, and it is humming away, and a couple moments later a hear a THUMP, then a THUMP THUMP!  \"I'm sorry sir!, I'm just too sweaty.\"  \"Well you know what that means, you're eating a biscuit\"\n\nI immediately turn off the vibrator, and then I unhook her from the eye-bolt in the ceiling.  I grab her hair and sort of push her down to floor level (she is tied in various ways so moment is a little limited). I push her face next to a biscuit (away from the pee) and tell her, \"eat the biscuit bitch.\"  She kind gives it a lick and makes a face so I swat her a good one. \"eat the biscuit BITCH\" takes a nibble, spits it out \"eat the BISCUIT BITCH\"  she takes another little bite and spits it out, \"EAT THE BISCUIT BITCH!\" so keeps on trying and it keeps on falling out of her mouth like a cat trying to eat a grape.\n\n So eventually I'm just rhythmically beating on her, while to the time I'm shouting \"BISCUIT BITCH!\" \"BISCUIT BITCH!\" \"BISCUIT BITCH!\" \"BISCUIT BITCH!\" with each hand fall.  By now the biscuit is just a big white smeary mess all over her face and the floor and she is crying. And saying \"I can't\",\"I can't\", \"I can't\", I stop chanting and smacking and say, \"Why can't you?\"  and I see her lying curled up on the floor next to her own piss, and she says to me, \"I'm going to need about Tree Fiddy\"  Then I realize, that the woman I've been having carnal relations with was actually 500 hundred feet tall and from the paliolithic era!\n\nTL:DR  What I did with those biscuits would make the Pillsbury Dough Boy shudder.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367537970", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 32, "controversiality": 0}

All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime.\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives.\nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\"\nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\"\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed.\nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that. We ended up going our separate ways, but I think everything turned out for the best.\ntl;dr - The greatest night of my life rapidly turned into something much different than what I was expecting\"\n\nwas not disappoint.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367539807", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

What did he mean? \n\n\"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\n\n\"I suppose I can't blame you, you were young, too young. That night, the one where your mother died, I was with you all in the house. I didn't see it happen, but I heard your mother. She told you to not play around with that, but you were a young stupid kid who didn't listen. A woman screamed. I sprinted to the room, and that's where I found your mother on the ground and the scissors in your hand. I can't say for sure, but I've come to believe you were playing around with them, and when you ran to your mother, you stabbed her with them. It sounds to crazy to be true, but it has to be. I rushed your mother to the hospital. I took you with me, it hadn't sunk in what you did. They couldn't save the baby, and your mother died from blood loss. Every since then I can't look at you the same. You say that you'd pick your mother over me, well so would I. At least I wouldn't have to see your face everyday. Hell, in a perfect world, your mother would be here instead of you.\"\n\nI didn't know what to do, so I ran. My mind was racing. Was what my father said true? I went to L's house, the only safe haven this side of the Atlantic. When I got there I told him everything that was relayed to me. The first words out of his mouth were not comfort, but carnage. \n\n\"You want to kill him too?\".\n\nI don't know why I reacted how I did, but the mix of emotions just came together in a rage of anger at my only friend.\n\n\"Is that all the fuck you think about you psycho? I'm not even sure if I want to go through with this.\"\n\n\"You've done it once it seems, a few more times won't hurt.\"\n\n\"He's my dad, as much as I hate him I don't hate him enough to kill him.

Maybe if you're so obsessed with death, you should just go and off yourself.\"\n\nI left L's house in a hurry. I was pissed at him, I was pissed at my dad, and I was pissed at myself.\n\nI barely slept that night, I grew to regret what I said to L. I planned on apologizing the next day. I woke up late that day, but went straight to L's house. The door was locked, and L wasn't opening up. Luckily, I knew where the spare key was and let myself in. As soon as I entered I heard a shot. Quickly I darted towards his room. It looked like a war zone. Blood was everywhere. I dashed over to my friend, and by some miracle he was still alive. Thoughts were racing through my head, but all that could get out was \"What do you need?\". L looked at me with his big blue eyes and said \"I need about tree fiddy.”.  It was then that I noticed he was a 500 feet tall Paleolithic era creature, who promptly died. I ended up hiding the evidence of out plot from his parents, and the Loch Ness Monster's ashes were scattered over the Scottish hills. At least one of us made it back home.

{"body": "So this was at my sons birthday party. We were kinda slightly irresponsible thinking back at it. Haydos116 jr was 8 at the time and we were kinda not really ready for a child. We half-heartily wanted a child and made one. That's a story for later. We took care of him properly but we kinda acted like dick parents. The funniest thing he said to us actually broke up our family. It was horrible. If only this thing could have ever happened we might actually have haydos 116 jr back. Looking back at it, it's so funny but so sad at the same time. Anyway onto the story. My son was having his 8th birthday party. Me and my wife were hosting it. It was about 3/4 into the party. My wife was preparing the cake for the children. I started flirting with my wife because I can. We got another parent who was there because she decided her son needed to be watched 24/7 (I'm pretty sure he didn't say a word the whole party). Anyway me and my wife went to our bedroom. It was upstairs and the rooms are pretty soundproof. We started undressing like any normal couple would. We then got really into it. I was almost finished until i noticed a person near the door. It was our son who at that moment walked to our bedroom and wanted to tell us about his cool new toys (they were shit like fake lego). Instead of what he wanted to do, he just stares at our naked bodies. It was really awkward. He just kept staring at us. His mouth starts to move. \"Yes what is it haydos116 jr ?\" my Wife asked. He just stares at us and said \"I need about tree fiddy\". I was about that time I noticed my son was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. We tell him he needs to move on and he does. We decide it's best if we can try to find a better parents after this event. Eventually a nice old couple with poor vision adopted him. They gave him a good home and good parents. Some days i wish I could be with him again. There are rumors going round that he has gained several hundred kilos.

{"body": "The full list:\n\nhttp://davejustdave.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/23-questions-from-chuck-klosterman-with.html\n\nFor those of you who don't know of Chuck Klosterman. You should. He's pretty much the definition of Awesome. Below you will find his 23 Questions and I've taken the liberty of answering them. Take the time to answer the questions yourself... Think about them and answer them honestly... it's really rather enlightening.\n\n1. Let us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn any more; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence.\n\nWould this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?\n\n\n2. Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots.\n\nWould you attempt to do this?\n\n\n3. Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical.\n\nWhich option do you select?\n\n\n4. Genetic engineers at Johns Hopkins University announce that they have developed a so-called \"super gorilla.\" Though the animal cannot speak, it has a sign language lexicon of over twelve thousand words, an I.Q. of almost 85, and--most notably--a vague sense of self-awareness. Oddly, the creature (who weighs seven hundred pounds) becomes fascinated by football. The gorilla aspires to play the game at its highest level and quickly develops the rudimentary skills of a defensive end. ESPN analyst Tom Jackson speculates that this gorilla would be \"borderline unblockable\" and would likely average six sacks a game (although Jackson concedes the beast might be susceptible to counters and misdirection plays). Meanwhile, the gorilla has made it clear he would never intentionally injure any opponent.\n\nYou are commissioner of the NFL: Would you allow this gorilla to sign with the Oakland Raiders?\n\n5. You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Creedence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it's being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it's being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a capella (but it will only sound this way to you).\n\nWould you swallow the pill?\n\n6. At long last, someone invents \"the dream VCR.\" This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR.\n\nWould you still do this?\n\n7. Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity.

I would help her carry her books in every morning and I was always insightful and respectful in class. This led to her liking me. It all came together one day in October. Class was just being dismissed and I gathered my books to leave. Right before I walked through the door I noticed something. She was looking at me funny. I turned to leave, but she stopped me. She asked me if I thought she was pretty. I was dumbfounded. I said sure - you're beautiful. I was slowly getting uncomfortable, but at the same time more comfortable than I had ever been before. She told me to pull my pants down. I was shocked. This was going to happen. She unbuttoned her blouse and I ran my hands over her succulent breasts. I began to remove her pants, but then she stopped me. She told me that before we could start, she would need about tree fiddy. It hit me like a brick.

Well I drank tons of beer, played tons of pong, had several shots and jello shots then decided to go on **the prowl**.\n\nNow all you guys know what I'm talking about and ladies too. My mind went from laughing having fun to I need some poon. I was venturing around the party talking to different groups of friends and then stepped outside for a cig. This thicker girl was laughing and standing right beside me and had a massive bust. I kept staring at them nonchalantly...or so I thought. We continue smoking, she toss' her cig and then walks by me and sways at my arm and slightly strokes it like I should follow...So without any hesitation at all, I did.\n\nShe looks behind her as I walk through the door and I walk up to her, she leans in and says if you like them that much then just take them. And I of course suggest the guest bedroom is where we go, so where do we head? You got it.\n\nWe get in, set down our drinks and just start making out hard core. I'm fucking ready to go at it, she starts taking off my shirt and I start lifting hers. Now she isn't fat by any means but definitely had a little chub and was a thick girl but looked good that night. She removes the rest of her shirt and then her goods just poured out. I start playing with them and was in heaven. We moved to the bed and she went to go down on me, took off my pants and then in a sexy voice she said to me, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy. And that's when I realized she was about 8 stories fucking tall and it was that God Damn loch ness monster. I gave it tree fiddy, it could have sucked the chrome off a bumper. We were together about a year before I realized ol' nessie was a stage five clinger. I finally got out of that relationship after all my friends suggested it to me a million times and couldn't believe what I had done and how broke I was becoming.

And it kills me. I hate it. It's so banal and unnecessary. \n\nWhen I was young and my friends would quote SP all day I thought it was kind of weird. \"Damn mongorians blah blah.\" But now that reddit has latched onto it it's painful. Half the one-liners on this site are the same SP, Arrested Development, and Big Lebowski references, and it's frankly exhausting. It's like tunnel-vision - what compels folks to parrot the identical line over and over? I just don't get it. It's like an automatic response - Pavlonian at this point. \n\nIt's not as bad as using SP jokes as a grounds for actual social commentary and stuff, though. That really frustrates me. Like how everytime someone gets offended by the word faggot, someone else throws up a Louis CK clip. SP is capable of some funny and smart social commentary, but you shouldn't actually get your social opinions from it. That's as shallow as people who form opinions based on whatever any other show is broadcasting. \n\nThe whole thing just seems so juvenile and boring, and I'm baffled at how SP has become the de facto standard for humor. It's not even the good stuff - its the same several references, ad nauseum.\n\nSo yeah, a long story that hooks you in and \"creatively\" tricks you with the loch ness bit is one thing (and even that, personally, I'm long tired of - I was tired of it years ago on 4chan, and all the bel air and dinosaur shit that came before it), but that's not even really the joke anymore.

{"body": "You're being downvoted because your logic is really badly flawed.\n\n&gt;It's pushing the idea that science is oppositional to religion...\n\nBecause the very natures of science and religion are built on contrasting thoughts.\n\nYou're right that science is built on empiricism.  Hypotheses are built around explaining phenomena; if incorrect, the hypothesis is revised and until the result is found to be true given the conditions.\n\nBut you're vastly mistaken that religion is based on that very idea.  It takes the opposite approach: a phenomenon is attributed by an explanation that is never tested in any way.  Rather, it's the building of mythologies to make an explanation, but it's never found out whether those explanations are every true.  That's the very nature of faith.\n\nTake a simple scenario.  A disaster happens, killing an entire family.  People of faith often create a scenario, saying that these people are now \"in a better place,\" that this was \"fate,\" that there's \"meaning\" to this.  But seriously, where's the proof?  \n\nWhat you're probably attributing is something like not eating pork, because God told people the animals are unclean.  But this probably has less a religious basis and more an actual correlation between eating pork and people getting sick.  The explanation was tacked on later on, but never actually formally tested in any way.\n\n&gt;...or that atheists can derive their beliefs through science. \n\nAgain, completely wrong.\n\nAtheists have a default state where they do not believe in a god.  They won't believe in god unless there's actual confirming evidence that said being exists in some way.  It's a lack of belief in a formal \"higher\" being.  I don't know how others feel about the matter, but atheism itself isn't a religion (there's no formal rules here).\n\nIt's like with all other things.  Do you believe in little green men from outer space?  Your default opinion, lacking any level of evidence, is no.  How about unicorns, or fairies, or the Loch Ness Monster?  Of course not.\n\nThe reality is that religion's use, in the face of modern science and empiricism, is archaic.  It's idiotic to think that stuff just happens for some oddly personified reason, and that's the explanation.\n\nThe fight from the atheist community from such comments as the one you put up has everything to do with religious people, at least the lowest rung, still adhering to those ideals.  The same people that won't get a blood transfusion because their souls would be tainted.  Or that we should pray to prevent disasters from happening rather than actually preparing for said disasters.  \n\nIt has nothing to do with using science to confirm atheism.  Rather, it's using science to debunk religion, which drives people towards atheism.

I swore after the first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance.\n\nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. I won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. Besides the fact that I was studying for a medical-related track (kinesiology) and therefore had to take classes in that type of thing, I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable.\n\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime.\n\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives.\n\nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\"\n\nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\"\n\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed.\n\nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that.

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade in High School I took a psychology class, one of our assignments was to do an amateur psychology experiment on some people or someone we knew.\n\nThere was this girl in the class, lets call her Amy, Amy was a really good friend of mine but she was also fine as hell. At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward. And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.\n\nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward. So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\n\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, Thehealeroftri, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\"\n\nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"\n\nEveryone in the hall heard. The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.\n\nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.\n\nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"\n\nWat.\n\nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying.\nA few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.\n\nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.\n\nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered. I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.\n\n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her. Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"\n\nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her. She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.\n\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"\n\nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\" I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\n\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.\n\nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear. This is great.\n\nIt slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time. After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life.\n\nWe're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\"\n\nI personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time.

{"body": "Virgins until marriage, what was it like on your honeymoon night?\n\nWhen I was 20, I started dating a girl who there was instant chemistry with. We had similar interests, a similar outlook on life, and she was low-maintenance. I swore after the first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance.\n\nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. I won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. Besides the fact that I was studying for a medical-related track (kinesiology) and therefore had to take classes in that type of thing, I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable.\n\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime.\n\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives.\n\nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\"\n\nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\"\n\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed.\n\nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that. We ended up going our separate ways, but I think everything turned out for the best.\n\ntl;dr - The greatest night of my life rapidly turned into something much different than what I was expecting\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dhucx/virgins_until_marriage_what_was_it_like_on_your/c9qgbj6", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367813085", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

They said from their twitching smelly  alligator mouths, \"U r a smart guy plz help us destroy the world or we will kill your'e parents\" Jon said with a slight tear in his i, \"I got no parents\" and punched the cows in the're stupid shark snouts. he did a flip as he jumped out the whole at the dore, and dodged the lazers with amazing reflexes. The kelp monsters pored out thru the window on the submarine. The cops came in their shiny badges and cop uniforms and said in unison, \"Were the cops, stop lizard gremlins!\" The trolls pulled their guns out, and shoted lasers at the cops and they turned into crustaceans. The general cop shouted, \"they have crustacean guns!\" as he was shot by a beam that turned him into a crustacean. But billy was quick. he dodged every crustacean beam with amazing accuracy that he had all of his life from playing videogames cuz they help u wit stuff like that cuz video games r awesome. He punched  the loch ness monsters. One, BAM too BAM three BAM five BAM and then all the aliens were shot by Stevie. When their was only one left, bobby did the same thing he did all along, he kicked the monster in the face, just like the restof the aliens.

{"body": "**TLDR**: When I was in 11th grade in High School I took a psychology class, one of our assignments was to do an amateur psychology experiment on some people or someone we knew.\nThere was this girl in the class, lets call her Amy, Amy was a really good friend of mine but she was also fine as hell. At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward. And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.\nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward. So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, Thehealeroftri, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\"\nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"\nEveryone in the hall heard. The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.\nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.\nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"\nWat.\nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying. A few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.\nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.\nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered. I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.\n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her. Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"\nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her. She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"\nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\" I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.\nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear. This is great.\nIt slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time. After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life.\nWe're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\"\nI personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time. Then she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\" The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\"\nShe says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.\nI stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.\nAs for my psychology project, I never did get it done, and instead dropped the class because of the terrible memories it had given me.

Hung out with the bros playing Black Ops (at the time, that was the newest Call Of Duty game) until around 9pm. We then took the bus to the bar.\n\nI should have known right there that there was something special about the place. It was my first time there, but my friends even knew the owner. It was a dingy place, good lighting for a bar, really packed. Tables were really next to each other, it was pretty uncomfortable. There was a band playing in the corner. Weird part was the atmosphere. I just got a weird feeling from being in that place.\n\nSo there I was, trying to ignore my gut instinct and enjoying some time with my friends, getting hammered. I noticed this guy on the table beside me trying to hit on a girl and getting turned down good. I looked her up and decided to try my luck.\n\nSo I asked her how her beer was. She said it was fine, but she'd rather something else. Prompt me buying her a drink. Something fruity, I can't exactly recall what it was. We sort of get along, and before long she was sitting at the table with me and my friends.\n\nFast forward a few hours. She was drunk, I was drunk. We got in a cab and went to her place. She opened the door and grabbed my crotch. Before the door had closed we were already half naked in her bed.\n\nCue normal sex (I used a condom, for the record). As I was about to blow my load, she got off me, grabbed a syringe from somewhere and stuck it up my dick through the condom, pulling all the semen in.\n\nShock is a word that can't describe what I was feeling. My mind was numb. I asked her, \"what the fuck are you doing?\" and she said she was collecting my semen for later. Then she told me she was going to accuse me of rape unless I did whatever she wanted. I was still numb, so I asked her what she wanted.\n\nI'll never forget her reply.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was then I realized I had just had sex with a three story tall monster from the paleozoic era.

{"body": "When I was a kid in high school, everyone's favorite thing was to go down to the local lake and tell urban legend type stories. Often times we'd camp out there and have a bonfire, and of course tell more stories. Everyone's favorite story was that they \"saw something moving in the lake\" and would try and freak the rest of us out.\n\nNow I knew an urban legend when I heard one, and wasn't easily fooled. However, there was one time that I brought a cute girl down camping with me. We'd kind of had a thing for a while and were really taking the next step spending the night together. She was absolutely beautiful, a solid 9, 9 and a 1/2, but she was kind of timid and scared a little too easily.\n\nWhen we were out in our group at the bonfire telling stories, the \"I see something in the lake!\" story came up like usual. She started glancing over towards the water and swore she saw something herself. I kind of laughed I myself but not out loud because I didn't want to embarrass her.\n\nAnyway, the night proceeded as usual and we ended up in my tent together. It was pretty warm and we were all snuggled up to each other, both of us pretty happy I think. We started kissing and slowly things heated up and we started taking off each other's clothes. I was starting to get nervous because Id never had sex before and neither had she, I was terribly afraid I was going to mess things up. Things kept going and going, and I was getting really nervous now and stalling before we really started the act.\n\nFinally I told her \"Wait a minute\" and she said \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing,\" I told her, \"Im just a little nervous... Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?\" \"Yes I am, I want this more than anything... But there is one thing Im going to need you to do\" Now at this point I didn't know what she was going to say. A condom, maybe? I had one, but I hadn't told her because it hadn't been an issue yet. Maybe she wasn't a virgin... I really wasn't sure what she was going to say, but I was still really excited that she wanted me.\n\n\"What do you need babe?\" I asked as cool and calm as I could manage\n\nShe said, \"Im gonna need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was about this time I realized this girl was 8 stories tall and a monster from the paleolithic era. I said \"Damnit Loch Ness monstah, I ain't got no tree fiddy!\" I kept screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.\n\nNeedless to say, Im never going back to that lake again.\n\ntl;dr: Urban legends aren't always legends, Im never going to that lake again\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367881967", "subreddit": "jerktalkdiamond", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was working in a steakhouse about two years ago, working the grill on a hot Saturday August night. Tourist season was at it's peak, and this restaurant was located right on the busiest street in town close to the city center. It was a full house with an hour and a half wait for anybody wanting to walk in.\n\nNeedless to say, the kitchen was absolutely jamming. We weren't accepting substitutions that night to make it a little easier on ourselves, as we were having to crank out about 70 tickets per hour. It was probably about 8 o'clock when this guy walks in by himself with a reservation for two. He sat at the table by himself, waiting on his date. When about 25 minutes had gone by, a waiter offered him an appetizer to keep him tided over. \n\nHe was clearly pretty miffed at his date for not showing, but he carried on with his night anyways, ordering an extremely expensive bottle of wine and our heaviest prime rib. Clearly not realizing how ridiculously busy the restaurant was, he was continually harassing his server, asking when his meal would be ready, asking for petty requests right and left, the whole bit. \n\nHis meal finally got delivered, and he immediately looked at the server and asked her \"are you seriously going to serve me this?\" She looked at him a bit confusedly and asked what was wrong with his meal. He went full rage mode, spitting on the steak and yelling how undercooked it was. The server was new, so she didn't know quite what to do. She took the plate away and came back to the kitchen almost in tears. I liked this girl, and was pissed that anybody could be enough of an ass to make her cry.\n\nI went out to the table and asked the guy what the problem was with his meal. He was clearly regretting the way he had acted earlier, hanging his head with shame and not speaking very loud. He was mumbling that he needed something, but I couldn't quite make out what. I asked him what it was he needed.

{"body": "This is a rough one that always makes me feel a bit sad. I used to work in a high school in a city with a fairly high crime rate. A lot of my students were into drugs and alcohol, but I still tried my best to guide them along. It broke my heart to see a lot of my fellow teachers just pass along the students to the next grade just so they wouldn't be their problem anymore. But I remember one student in particular named Jennifer. She was really sweet and tried her hardest. She wasn't the best of students, but she really put in the time and effort and I was happy to say I could give her a B for my course.\n\nTowards the end of high school, I saw Jennifer getting into the wrong crowd of people. Sometimes I would catch her smoking pot outside school which absolutely tore me up inside because I knew she was going downhill. I couldn't call the cops or school security, because I knew it would only deter her from coming back to class ever, but I made sure they at least would disperse. I had a few conversations in private with her about how she could be so much better than that and how she didn't have to get peer-pressured into doing all of that stuff. Unfortunately, she only got angry at me, told me to \"fuck off\" and \"mind my own damn business\" before graduating.\n\nI saw her a few years later in a bar while out drinking with some friends. We were casually relaxing while she strolled in with 2 other guys. Both the very stereotypical \"thug\" guys with tilted hats and trousers half way down their butts. She came over to me and said \"HEY! WHAT UP MR. G!\", and I gave her my most polite \"Hey there, how've you been?\" and after a few minutes she heads over to the bar with her \"posse\" while I continue to chat with my friends.\n\nA few hours into the evening go by, I get a bit buzzed, my friends and I play darts, I wait a bit with them so I can drive home, and during this time I see Jennifer and her friends drinking heavily. Her two guy-friends are drinking pretty heavily, but she is definitely drinking more. On top of getting fairly drunk to begin with, her guy-friends are buying more alcohol for her because the bar-tender would have probably cut her off by then.\n\nSo at this point, those three are starting to get loud and a little \"handsy\" with Jennifer. She tells one of the guys to fuck off and he goes to hit on some other girl in the bar. She keeps talking to the other guy. After a little while longer, the first guy that went to hit on someone else starts making a scene, is slapped by some girl, and then follows her out of the bar. The second guy is still getting handsy with Jen, but she's pushing him away. He starts tugging on her sleeve but she keeps resisting. She's extremely drunk at this point and I can see there is going to be a problem, so I head over and tell the guy to knock it off and that she's clearly pushing him away. He tells me to go fuck myself and continues to grab at Jen, so I get between the two. He then stands up and prepares to take a swing at me, but before he does, my friends come over he realizes that he probably can't win this one. Just then Jen pukes all over the back of my pants. The dude laughs and exits the bar, presumably to go drink somewhere else.\n\nI turn around to Jen and say \"Hey, you alright?\" She is kinda just slumped over breathing heavily so I say \"Hey, cmon. I'm gonna get you home.\" I put her arm over my shoulder and help her out of the bar. I bid my friends farewell, escort Jen to my passenger seat, hop in the car and ask her where she lives. She was slurring pretty badly, but I managed to understand her address and get her back to the shit-hole of an apartment she called home. She was really in no condition to get herself anywhere so I once again escorted her into the building, up a flight of stairs, and into her apartment. As soon as we got into the place she stumbled her way into the bathroom and I heard her start to gag again. I quickly ran over and held her hair as she heaved up some more alcohol into the toilet. After she was done with that round she said \"Thanks Mr. G... You always were my favorite teacher\" and went back to the toilet. She was mostly dry-heaving at this time. Between chokes, she barely made out the words \"I n... I n-nee...\", so I said \"You need? What do you need? Water? A towel? Anything.\" She responded weakly \"I need about tree fiddy.\" At this point I realized Jen was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era! I shouted back \"God damn Nessie!

{"body": "Back in my tech-support days I'd get sent around to various houses. It was the absolute worst because it was usually just some stupidly simple thing that someone couldn't figure out from a phone call.\n\nSo one day I'm in the office and we get a call from this woman who sounded kinda nice, but she was really really dumb. She was having an issue with her \"router thingy\" and she couldn't be more descriptive than that. It was terrible.\n\nSo after a little while of talking on the phone with her, then arguing with my boss, he sends me out to her place to see what the problem actually is. I get there and it's some apartment in this beat-up looking condominium complex. Meh, I've seen worse. So I make my way up the stairs to her place and knock on the door.\n\nWhen she opens it, she's in nothing except for a towel... Like, what the fuck? She knew we were coming. Why would she go and take a shower just then? But she was actually pretty cute... Just saying. So I let her know that I'm here about her router problems and she tells me to come inside and shows me what's wrong. She showed me that her computer was connected to the router via Ethernet cable and that it was on, but she couldn't get any access. I told her that I would take a bit to figure out what's wrong and she went off to get dressed. I only remember that part because she went down the hall and into one of the rooms dropping the towel just as she went out of sight. I got a nice view of her ass and went back to work.\n\nAfter a little while I figured out that the Ethernet cable connecting her router to the wall was messed up. Usually happens when you roll over one of the end with a chair or something. No big deal. I had no idea where she was, so I said something to the effect of \"Miss, I know what's wrong with your router\". She shouted back from the room she went into before \"Oh you did? Come and tell me what it was!\" This sounds suspicious as hell writing it, but at the time it didn't raise any alarms for some reason.\n\nSo I get over to her open door and she still hasn't dressed. She's spread-eagle on the bed and I see *everything*. I did a little gasp that you do when you're surprised and could only really get out the words \"I, uh...\" She just laid there with this big smile and giggled. So again I stammer out \"I, uh... your router... I need to go\", quickly did a 180 and headed for the door. She shouted after me and said \"Wait!\" She ran after me, grabbed me from behind and said \"I have to thank you somehow.\" I just said back \"Miss, I have a girlfriend. I can't do this now. I'll get you a fixed cable, but then I'm gonna go.\" She let me go after another moment and I made my way out the door. A moment later she came through the doorway and said \"Wait, I'm sorry. I won't bother you again, just, while you're out there, could you grab me something?\" I sighed and said \"That depends... What do you need?\" She smirked and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" At this point I realized this girl was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era! I shouted back \"God dammit Nessie! I ain't given you no tree fiddy!\"\n\n**TL;DR**: Cute girl. Dumb problem.

X100S is definitely better, but X100 is good in price value, especially if you can find used ones in good conditions, mostly from people upgrading to the X100S or ones like me who felt the fuji look was not for them.\n\nAs for Canon, I'm basically deciding between G15 and G1X, and so far, G15 is winning. Comes down to smaller size, faster autofocus, faster lens aperture, and basic portability (between the two, not the x20). G1X is heftier but has way better sensor and image quality, not to mention retaining the swivel screen, but ultimately fails in portability and a slow autofocus will just ruin the experience. I'm nervous because even with the G15, X20 did spoil me with SLR-speed phase detection.\n\nAs for others, I've heard people clamoring the sony RX100 for their sensor size and several other shout outs to Olympus ZX2, while better quality interchangeable mirrorless are not in my radar; they're bulky and I'm looking for a compact buddy to my existing 7D. I've never liked the way sony handles their menu UI design, always counter-intuitive, and I've never had reason to pick Olympus.\n\nBut what I'm saying is this. My personal preference is always going to be Canon, I grew up with it. It signifies comfort and familiarity to me, which makes me highly biased towards it in general. I will definitely recommend you G15 from your requirements, but you should ask what is photography to you personally.\n\nWhat is a real camera to you?\n\nIs it a small pocket-able camera so that you'll bring it everywhere? Is it a fixed lens camera to force you to learn composing shots by distance? Is it a versatile camera with a workable zoom? Is it a retro fashion accessories? These and several other questions you need to list out before you make your purchase, and I hope you'll be happy with what you end up with, unlike me.\n\nBut seriously, get the G15.\n\nNah I'm kidding, get what you think fits you best.\n\nheh...\n\nSeriously though, G15.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367940925", "subreddit": "photography", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Every week or so so far she's asked him if He had plans for the night, and every time He says not yet, she tells him that she already is doing something. Last weekend, however, she was free and they arranged for her to come to his house when his parents weren't home.\n\nShe arrived that night around 7ish, and his parents wouldn't be getting home til 12 or later, so they had plenty of time to fool around. He put in a movie (Shawshank Redemption FTW), and they watched the first 30ish minutes cuddling together. Then she went in for the kiss. They made out for about 15 minutes before things escalated. She had her hand on his clothes and He had his hand on hers. After all of this it was only 9:20, and she was planning to stay over til at least 11, so they finished Shawshank with some make out action in between scenes. She left and He was feeling great about himself because she told him how much fun she had/how good he was at kissing, etc.\n\nThe next day she didn't return his call, and him being the nonclinger that he is, he just decided to hang out with the boys for the day. They played some intense football, etc etc. Not really part of the story. On Sunday she told him that she wasn't sure if she wanted to be more than friends, and he was pretty bummed. Come Monday, however, she was back to her old flirty ways. She was being WAY more handsy than usual though, which was awesome. Later, she rode home with him (parents again aren't home), and they made out for a while and she stuck her hand in his clothes, only to take her hand out and tell him she had to leave. They stopped at a gas station on the way home and she asked him for some money for a soda. \"How much you need?\" He asked.

Typically, it involves another main character, who will then, in the last paragraph, utter the sentence \"I need about tree fiddy\" in some form, initiating the \"switch\". This is typically followed by a remark by the narrator how he only now realizes the size of the other character (often measured in stories), how it is the loch ness monster (or one of various paraphrasings, sometimes regarding its age), and how it \"tricked him again\", just as the narrator tricked the reader.\n\nMore information about the meme \"tree fiddy\" can be found on [knowyourmeme.com](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tree-fiddy).\n\nThese stories got especially popular and well-known through /u/Thehealeroftri, who posted them frequently (although not too frequently, lest readers might expect them); he even did an [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/10hi6w/iam_that_guy_who_consistently_posts_stories_that/) about it.

That's not a fucking argument. It's an evasion.\n\nBecause disproof is not a thing. You can take literally anything and go into a \"you can't disprove it\" argument.\n\nSo I'll do that right now. You can't disprove that when I cum on broccoli, it turns into a genie that grants all my wishes, unless someone asks me to test it for them. It sounds ridiculous, right? It is ridiculous. It is total bullshit. But you can't disprove it. There is zero evidence for it, but we could easily spend a fuckload of time arguing it, and I can make it seem like it's possible, but it will still be bullshit no matter what either of us say. Hell, I can come up with an infinite amount of ideas like this that can't be disproved, but they're all still bullshit until proven otherwise.\n\nYou know how you argue for things that we know exist? With evidence and skepticism and things holding up to it through repeated experiment. That is why arguments for things we know are true, like the existence of evolution and chemistry don't do that whole \"we don't know everything\" crap. All they need in order to argue for them, because they're true, is the evidence for them. No personal testimony necessary. There is actual, repeatable, observable evidence that keeps building.\n\nBullshit like ghosts, on the other hand, have had no verification by science. It is not a flaw of science, or the process of empirical objectivism, but a flaw of the idea of ghosts. \n\nOf course we don't know everything, but that doesn't make everything up in the air. For example, you understand the words I'm saying, as we are having this argument in the first place. Ideas are bullshit until they are proven. Gods, ghosts, magic, and cum on broccoli turning into a genie lack that verification. We can say, \"oh, we don't know everything,\" or just be rational for a second and say \"hm, maybe there's no evidence for these things because they're bullshit.\"\n\nOkay, I will try to simplify this: Things are rational to believe because of evidence. If you're making the \"it *could* be true, but we don't know yet\" argument, that is because the idea lacks evidence, or you are unaware of the evidence.\n\nThe reason I am so ready to dismiss gods, psychics, ghosts, demons, witches, chimeras, etc. is because rationality has consistently found nothing to support them. I still am open to evidence, but I have not found it. Having an open mind means being open to evidence, not being open to accepting ideas that lack evidence.

{"body": "When I was 19 I moved to Germany. All by myself. Left my parents in Brazil, haven't talked to them in a few years. Full story enclosed:\n\nIn Germany, there's a test equivalent to the SATs that's called the Abitur. You can only take it once in your life, and it lasts two years. That's how hardcore it is. Anyway, ever since I was in 5th grade I wanted to take this test. I started speaking German in 3rd grade and worked my way up, until when I was 17 going on 18 I started my Abitur.\n\nIt was tough in the beginning. Lived at home still, so parents were still pretty protective. Whenever I wanted to go out, I still depended on them, and that really irked me. I didn't have a job, and couldn't get one because of the amount of schoolwork I had, so all money also came from my parents. It was really hard for me to depend so much on them, because I really, really wanted to be independent.\n\nWhen I finished the Abitur, I was 19. Took the first flight available to Germany. I'll never forget that excitement I felt right when I was going to board the plane. To quote The Shawshank Redemption, it was \"the excitement only a free man can feel\". I boarded the plane and felt truly amazing. I was finally going away, independent, and hoped to never have to go back to that life.\n\nUpon my arrival in Frankfurt, I instantly knew I was in love with the country. I stayed in Frankfurt a few days and just walked around, doing whatever I liked. If I wanted to, I could stop by a store. If I wanted to, I could buy a 30 euro shirt. I could do whatever I pleased. I left Frankfurt, but I haven't forgotten the love I have for the city. I stayed in a small town called Haar, next to Munich. Funnily enough, the town's name means \"hair\", and it's something that had always represented the repression I'd grown under. I had always wanted to grow out my hair and paint it blue.\n\nAnd that's what I did.\n\nI started my studies in the Technical University of Munich. I wanted to become an electrical engineer. I'd always liked building things. I spent five years studying basically nonstop. Now I live in Hamburg.\n\nSo, all in all, I don't regret my decision of moving. I like being free. I like doing whatever I want.\n\nIn fact, I'm so free that I wasn't even constrained by my degree when looking for a job. I'm an architect now, which doesn't really have too much in common with electrical engineering. In fact, my boss came up to me today and told me he'd need some help with the electrical cables we were changing in his office. He called me into it and I asked him, \"was brauchen Sie?\" which basically translates into \"what do you need?\". \"Ich brauche Baum fiddeln\" was his response, which means he needed tree fiddy. It was then that I realized that my boss of six years was a 500 foot tall reptile from the paleozoic era.

All the parents would arrange play-dates for the kids, so they all knew each other. It was like two separate parties, and it was nice. The adults would get together and chat while the kids would go rough-house in the basement.\n\nWell one Christmas, when our child was just a toddler, we took him over the the party and he went off with his friends to go do whatever they usually did. They sometimes got in trouble, but all kids did at some point and my wife and I are very liberal in what we allow him to do.\n\nSo about an hour into the dinner party, we're all talking, having a good time, enjoying the food that our friends put out for us when all of a sudden we hear this huge laughter coming from downstairs. Lot's of laughter, and one was crying. I looked at my wife and we both instantly knew that the crying was for us. We raced downstairs to see our little guy just outside of the bathroom. His pants were soaking wet with a bit of brown trailing down the pant leg. I thought to myself \"oh shit...\" and I ran over to him, my wife right behind me. I got on my knees in front of my son and held his head and said \"Hey buddy. It's alright. There there. Only an accident. It happens to everyone.\" My wife put her hand on his shoulder for comfort. At this point the laughter had died down quite a bit and I said \"Cmon buddy, let's go hang out with the adults\". I wasn't actually going to parade him in front of the adults, I just didn't want to say \"Let's go change your pants\" in front of all his friends. He sniffed and I carried him upstairs.\n\nOnce we got upstairs I quickly said to my friends that we had a lovely evening and we looked forward to seeing them again, but we had to take off early. They understood why, because my son was actually pretty smelly at this point, and they bid us farewell. Just as we got through their front door my son looks up at me and says \"Papa... I...\" So I say back \"What is it little guy? What do you need?\" Through big teary eyes he says back \"I need about tree fiddy.\" At this point I realized that my son was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era!

{"body": "It was my first trip overseas by myself. Now i've done a good amount of flying before, but it's always kind of set me off, I guess. I tend to get a lot of anxiety and just sit there in my seat and do absolutely nothing until it's over; close the laptop, cross arms, stare straight ahead, and do nothing. This time was different though. I'm one of the first to board for my section so I am already set to go by the time that my row-partner shows up, and bless whatever airline gods were staring down at me, the person who was to sit next to me was this early-twenties blonde bombshell and i'll be damned if she wasn't the most excited person to ever get on a plane, and we got along like best friends. Before I even had time to go into man-turtle mode, I felt the plane tip up and we were airborne, but it didn't even phase me. I was so involved in conversation with this gorgeous woman that nothing else mattered. For those of you who are looking for a Mile High Club story, turn back now, because although I may have taken up the offer, when I decided to take a bit of a nap, that nap turned into the majority of the flight's sleep. \n\nUp to this point, everything was fine and dandy, but once we landed is when things started to turn for the worse. She got her luggage well before mine came through and headed her own way. Having met her set my vacation off on a very good note, and I was ready to take the world by storm. But of course, with everything, something had to go wrong. After picking up my luggage, clearing customs, and getting all my stuff together, I get a cab to take me to the train station about half an hour away, and my train leaves about an hour after that. \n\nThe cabbie barely speaks at all, and when he does, the English is so broken that I can only assume he was asking where I came from, but didn't bother continuing the conversation. That isn't what caused the issue though; some idiot on a bicycle darts into the middle of the road and we barely avoid the piece of shit, but the truck behind us wasn't paying much attention and rear ends us without slowing down. Thankfully, we were still in the city, and the truck couldn't have been going more than 30mph, but it was enough to send everything inside the cab flying. The cabbie gets out of his car and screams his head off to the truck driver, nothing of which I understood, and this went on for maybe ten minutes, and my window to get on the train was closing bit by bit. I decide to get out of the cab to stretch and who do I see sitting at a coffee shop? My friend from the flight. I call out to her and head over to sit down with her to tell her about what's going on while the cabbie is still having his way with the truck driver. This is where it gets worse. After talking to her for a few more minutes, I decide to see what the situation is with my cab, and lo and behold, it's gone. Passport, train ticket, clothes, even my wallet was in the cab still. All I had was my phone but I never took down a number for the cab or the cab company, so I was up Shit Creek. \n\nBlondie offers to bring me back to her hotel room for the night so that I can get my shit in order and figure out what to do before going off on my own with nothing, and I graciously accept. We walk to her hotel which was absolutely and alone the best hotel I had ever been to. The landscaping was jaw dropping, the rooms pristine, and the view from her own balcony was majestic. I had never seen a city the way that I did from her room before. It's around dinner time now so I offer to cook us up something. Again, she's taken my mind off of worrying about anything, and I say i'll go get some groceries, but without any money, she points out, that wouldn't be so easy. So I get to hang out in this hotel room that I could never imagine affording, watch TV for about half an hour before she comes back with what I asked her to get so I could make chicken parmesan for the both of us, and she even brought back some ice cream too. Dinner goes swimmingly and we break open the coffee flavored ice cream and chocolate syrup which I pour about half of the jar into my bowl. She says \"Hey come on, save some for me!\" to which I reply \"You're gonna have to ask a lot nicer than that.\" She reaches over to take it and nearly spills her bowl of icecream but catches it before it tipped over too far and says \"Come on, I need that!\" Jokingly, I respond \"Need what?\" and she says \"About tree fiddy.\" It was then that I realized that who I spent the majority of the last day of my life with was a 500 foot tall monster from the paleolithic era. I screamed back at her \"I ain't givin you no tree fiddy Loch Ness Monster!\" and stormed out of the room as spaghetti flowed from all of my pockets. Shirt pockets, pants pockets, front and back, and my sneakers even had little pockets on the side too. It was all spaghetti.

Ren fairs aren't my thing, but my mom bought me a fake chainmail shirt and cape and I knew she'd be offended and cause a row if I didn't wear them, so I spent two days walking through the mud staring at horse manure while wearing a shoddy attempt to replicate medieval armor. Mother still complains the whole time about my dating life and how she's not getting to be a grandmother at this rate. Standard cruddy relative stuff. On Sunday we end up eating undercooked chicken just before we split up.\n\nOn my way back to Trondheim, a snowstorm comes up. Visibility drops. And the undercooked chicken starts rearing its shiny partially translucent head. I'm not sensible enough to pull over and wait it out; instead I'm hoping not to vomit while hunched over, peering into the white abyss in front of me. This isn't going to last. Finally I upchuck, convulsing a bit so my head bashes the steering wheel and I end up in a ditch.\n\nSo I call a tow truck. But the weather's bad enough that I can only find one person willing to tow me and when he shows up he wants NOK650 in cash. (That's about $100.) I've just spent all my money on bad ren fair food and I'm short. The only thing I can think of is to get my mother to front me some cash.\n\nThere I am in puke-stained fake chainmail and a cape, standing in a snowstorm with an increasingly impatient tow truck driver standing over me, yelling into a phone to beg my mother for help.

This wasn’t the most fun game ever so we evolved it to something I like to call the turtle slide. You sit in the basket and slide down the stairs in it like a toboggan. That’s fun as anything. We had a few mishaps, bumps and scrapes to ourselves and the walls and so the game was banned. But we kept playing. This one time we were turtle sliding, I put my sister in the basket and pushed her down the stairs. Really hard. I saw her bumping down stairs out of control in slow motion. The basket tipped over and she flew out and got planted face first into the wall at the bottom of the stairs. I heard her screams, a loud crack and then silence. I was terrified, for myself obviously, and knew if she was dead or mutilated I’d be in trouble. I watched for a moment or two as she lay motionless in a twisted heap on the floor. I approached, cautiously, muttering ‘mum’s gonna kill me’ to myself and whispered into her ear ‘Are you ok? Can you move?’. She said she was fine, but was gonna need three fiddy. At this point I realised I wasn’t looking at the frail injured body of my little sister. No, I was looking at a four story Loch Ness monster. \n\nTL:DR The worst thing my sister ever did was pretend not to be the Loch Ness monster for three years, and ask me for three fiddy after a staircase game of turtle slide went wrong.  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368009217", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When my wife and I got married, we decided to pool our money together and have shared account.  It seemed like a good idea at the time.  \n\nEverything seemed to be going smoothly for the first year or so and then I started noticing our savings slowly declining.  I didn't think much of it at first because we liked to eat out a lot, so I just chalked it up to that.  I know I should have been keeping a closer watch on the money but that had fallen to my wife.  She took on the responsibility of paying the bills and handling the money and she would get upset when I would go through the stack of bills to help out.  She said that she had a system and I was messing things up and it made her feel bad when I started doing her work for her.  She always turned it around on me so it seemed like I didn't trust her to get stuff done.  That was never the case, I was just trying to be helpful.  I really should have seen this as a red flag. \n\nFast forward a few months and I get a call from the bank saying that they've noticed some strange activity on my account.  They said that I needed to contact their fraud department.  \n\nI wanted to talk to my wife first to see if she knew anything about it.  She was outside in the pool where she spends most of her time.  She said she didn't know anything about it but asked if I could do something for her since I was already outside.  I said, \"Sure, what do you need?\" She replied, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was about that time that I realized that my wife of several years was actually a 500ft tall monster from the paleolithic era. I shook my fist and yelled, \"God Damnit Loch Ness Monster! I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\"  \n\nAnd that's how my marriage ended.  It's sad but true.

{"body": "In all seriousness I used to have a friend who I worked with back in college on some services for his up and coming boat tours company. Real small operation. This guy was suspiciously handsome. In a way that made you wonder why he didn't consider a modeling career. \n\nAnyway, one day we were working and he kept asking me what that smell was. I honestly couldn't even smell anything, but he described it as a creamy smell with a hint of oak. \n\nHaving no idea what could possibly smell like that other than maybe perfume of some kind, we walked into the room next to my dorm room, which led to the laundry room. When we went into the laundry room, he turned to me and said \"don't you smell anything?\" I honestly couldn't. \n\nAt this point, I noticed that the laundry machines were all shut, which is weird. Nothing was in the dryers, but you had to open up the lids of the washing machine to see what was inside. As we opened up the first lid, the smell washed over us like someone had shit an oak tree into this washer. The entire inside of the dryer was horrendously coated in wax and metal pieces from the wick. At this point I notice that my friend looks a little angry. He tells me that it was his candle and that someone, whoever did it, owed him three dollars and fifty cents. This super model looking dude had suddenly appeared to me as an eight story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "When I was 20, I started dating a girl who there was instant chemistry with. We had similar interests, a similar outlook on life, and she was low-maintenance. I swore after the first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance.\n\nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. I won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. Besides the fact that I was studying for a medical-related track (kinesiology) and therefore had to take classes in that type of thing, I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable.\n\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime.\n\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives.\n\nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\"\n\nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\"\n\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed.\n\nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that. We ended up going our separate ways, but I think everything turned out for the best.\n\ntl;dr - The greatest night of my life rapidly turned into something much different than what I was expecting\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368028825", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 100, "controversiality": 0}

Things seem like they're going well (as well as it can go for a high school relationship), and I figure \"Hey might as well take her home to meet the parents.\"\n\nThis was most definitely the wrong move at the time.

I thought that they would be excited to meet her seeing as it was my first relationship. \"Hi HandOfBl00d's girlfriend, could you excuse us for a moment?\"\n\nAt this point I was getting kinda pissed off, I had never had a girl over before and my family wasn't accepting it her at all. When my parents pulled me aside to talk to me, it turns out that they had dealt with her before, and wouldn't you know it, it was that god damn Loch Ness monster!

My parents owned about 200 acres of farm land outside the city that we would spend the weekends at. Typically we'd ride horses, ATVs, play in the woods etc... Pretty much everything you'd expect to do on a large piece of land in the country. \n\nIt was a nice clear summer evening in which you felt you could see every star in the sky. I decided I wanted to camp out this night, none of my siblings wanted to join me; so I grabbed a tent and a sleeping bag and headed out to the lower field beyond the woods. \n\nI spent most my time staring at the stars trying to see meteors; however I saw none.  At about 11:30 pm I put the fire out and went to sleep. \n\nAt some point I woke up to the sound of my tent shaking as if a strong windstorm had come through.  I had checked the weather before I went out and there was a 0% chance of rain. As I finally came to I noticed that my tent was lit up like a truck had it's brights shining on it; except the light source seemed to be directly above the tent.  I laid there trying not to move for what seemed like 30 minutes, finally I noticed some shadows moving outside my tent. I decided I needed to see what was going on so I opened the tent door....\n\nThis is the point in the story where I don't remember what happened. I woke up the next morning about 100 feet from our farmhouse and roughly .10 of a mile from my campsite. I couldn't figure out what happened the night before. \n\nAs I wandered back home and I decided to get in the shower I took off my wallet and set it on the dresser.

Two friends (one guy, one girl) went driving out into the Appalachian mountains to go hiking, and we ended up getting way more than we bargained for and stayed out way too late.\n\nWe ended up going WAY back in the sticks to this old house that looked like it was built back in the 1930s or 1940s and was in pretty bad shape. Looked like it hadn't been kept well in quite a few decades, and people had spray painted it and all sorts of stuff. Well, we didn't go inside because it looked like the roof was pretty caved in, but we did decide to keep exploring around because the strangest thing was there were no apparent roads that had ever been made to this place, be it dirt, gravel, or paved.\n\nWe ended up finding a graveyard (at this point we've been back in the mountains for several hours, and it's getting slightly dark - we have flashlights and generally know our way back though). Creepiest thing was though this girl was just sitting in the middle of the graveyard. Looked like she was about 20, black hair, pretty pale complexion but not ghostly or anything like that. We called out to ask if she was OK, what she was doing out here, etc. She said she was fine, but she wanted to be alone. OK, fine. Probably was a relative died and she was visiting their grave.\n\nWe end up leaving and we make it back to our car. Suddenly after we make a turn, there's headlights behind us. We're being followed. Oh crap. We hear someone yelling from the car behind us, and they're actively trying to run us off this mountain road. We're trying to think of a way out of all this - I'm driving, male friend is in the back seat, girl is up in the front. She has an idea and says \"Hey, I've got a plan.

Unfortunately, recent events have unfolded and we will soon be divorced. \n\nWe met freshman year and immediately became close friends. Both of our families each moved to town around the same time, and the local kids never had too tough a time making us feel like utter shit (my shyness and introversion were as big of targets as her height and dry complexion). It's likely that our mutual exposure to ridicule was the common ground that we initially began to build our relationship on. We began dating shortly after Christmas that year. \n\nHere's where things took a turn. She was an exceptional swimmer, and an absolute monster at diving. She quickly made it onto our varsity dive team and picked up an award or two that first year. Fast forward to senior year...we had been dating for about three and half years before she suffered an injury at practice. Something about her entry into the water caused her to strike her head on the graded bottom of the pool. She didn't become paralyzed, thankfully, but the use of her legs was still affected. She also began to develop a quick temper and often felt paranoid. Even when I only spoke to other female friends of mine, she would become green with envy and threaten to end things immediately. \n\nWe sorted out most of these issues and continued dating through college, and married shortly after graduation. I knew at this time that I did not love her, but she was still the only person who treated me decently and I did not want to lose that. \n\nMost recently, however, things began to worsen. I began to take on the role of caregiver as the effects of her previous injury began to worsen. Our mutual relationship slowly shifted to one of her constantly take, take, taking. It may have been the catalyst for the end of our relationship, but I finally had to ask her what it would take to make her happy. What did I need to sacrifice in order to make her feel satisfied? She looked at me coldly and said, \"I need about tree-fiddy.\" It was at about this time that I finally realized my wife was actually a 500-foot-tall creature from the paleolithic era.

I could hear some sounds from inside, I'm sure worried about what awaited them on the other side of the door, I know there were plenty of nights he thought the police would be the one to rouse him from his sleep with bad news, but tonight that was not the case. When he opened the door and saw me standing there, I had grown some since I last saw him, I just stood there silent. After what felt like forever he just said to me, \"well what?\" I looked down and asked him, \"you got about tree fiddy?\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368047134", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

The closest big city was about 2 hours away and the small town closest to the camp had about 2000 people in it. We were out in the middle of a forest and had gone into the city for the day to pick up supplies.  \n  \nWe had spent a great day in Brno sightseeing and had gotten everything we needed loaded into the trunk of our car. My youth pastor and the camp director were in the front and mr adorable summer fling was in the back with me. We had a long day and I fell asleep on the way back to the camp. All of a sudden, I woke up due to a thud that had shaken the car. My pastor and the camp director got out of the car and called my fling out. They told me explicitly to not get out of the car. The next thing I knew there was a big thump on the roof of the car and I scrambled out to see what it was.   \n  \nThe sight that awaited me was a deer that had been hit being tied to the roof of this small car on a deserted road late at night by three agitated and debating Czech men. I could only catch snippets of the conversation due to my limited knowledge of the language but they were arguing about whether to take it or leave it. In the end, we took off back to camp with the deer on our car. Two days later, I tried venison for the first time at a barbecue where the main dish was our poor little road kill friend.   \n  \nThat is just one of my favorite stories. Some of my other ones involve a last minute trip across the UK to go look for the Loch Ness monster, snorkeling at the Great Barrier Reef, seeing an elephant for the first time as a child in Africa, and a surfing contest in Costa Rica.

{"body": "Not from me, but a story from a very close friend of mine. He was called to a rather... gruesome murder. Those in the UK might remember hearing about it.\n\nHe first got the impression that something was wrong when he approached the front door; there was the head of an axe wedged very firmly within the woodwork, the axe stained quite red. The actual crime scene itself was silent, only his partner was with him for company. Together, they entered the property.\n\nThey first came across a shadow moving back and forth in the darkness of the stairwell. They nodded in unison, before switching on the light. As the stairwell illuminated, they caught rather sorry sight of a lifeless, limp body of a man hung almost still, suspended from the ceiling by a length of rope. He said he would never forget the look on the man's face, as if death itself insisted on being there after the fact.\n\nVery slowly, they moved past the dead cadaver, and started to browse the upper level. The first three rooms were empty, devoid of interest. Almost with a sense of foreboding, they approached the last door. On the count of three, my friend opened the door... and to this day, is still deeply traumatized by what he saw; a small girl and a middle-aged women, both very dead, were in the room. The small girl, no more than 9 years of age, was impaled against the yellow wall of the room. Her arms, legs, and genitalia, had been clearly mutilated; the forensic team would later establish that this occurred prior to death.\n\nThe woman was on the bed, with slightly more textbook. She was on her back, her face oddly peaceful for a women who had been stabbed 17 times in the chest. The callous and brutal nature of the murder were plain to see, the bedclothes and carpet soaked with blood. It was then, that my friend heard movement from the wardrobe; a mixture of adrenaline and sheer panic caused his partner to demand that the occupier vacate the wardrobe, and put his hands behind his back, while my friend radioed for another squad car.\n\nIt was then that the mystery assailant burst out of the closet, wielding a mace of unparalled craftsmanship. He spoke to my friend, and said, \"I need about tree fiddy\". My friend exploded at him, and said \"God Damnit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain’t gonna give you no tree fiddy!\", then kicked him in the face.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368055149", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Kind of obnoxious, a bit of a know-it-all. A ginger. She liked me, though. A *lot.* Something drew her to me, like flies to shit.Every time we worked together, she would ask if I was going out that night. I never would tell her when I actually was going out but sometimes she would just show up anyway. Real awkward because she would just shadow me all night. Not that I had much game but she probably had successfully blocked my cock at least once. \n\nShe also got my number through work. For weeks, I would get random texts or calls from her. Nothing to do with work, just \"Hey, I'm bored\" or \"How was work?\" I didnt know how to tactfully explain that I just wasn't interested. This went on for quite some time.\n\nEventually, the \"perfect storm\" of events conspired to push me towards getting intimate with her. I had been out one night. She as there. I had been rejected by one girl at the bar that I thought I had a shot with. When that girl left, I decided to just get wrecked. That's when my stalker coworker showed up. My friends had left. I was feeling vulnerable. She wasn't unattractive. Also, I hadn't got laid in over six months so I was just horny as fuck. \n\nWe hung out for a bit. Eventually, we started making out. She was rubbing my leg. I kept trying to stick my hand up her skirt. It was probably 2AM. I stumbled outside with her.\n\n\"Let's go to my apartment. We'll watch a movie, maybe have sex. See how it goes...\" I slurred.\n\n\"Why should I go back with you? What are you gonna do for me, huh?\" she laughed, running a finger across my cheek.\n\n\"How about a...a...a [humpty-hump love pump?

I sat her down on my couch and slapped her boob for about twenty minutes while Ghost Adventures played in the background (total panty remover, gents). She told me to take off my pants. I stood up, slipped them and my undies off in one motion and, [while my dog dog looked on in silent approval,]( http://i.imgur.com/h5GYaFq.jpg) I stuffed my semi-erect intoxicated penis into her mouth.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I had enough tequila to sanitize the genitals of every NBA player at this years All Star game after party. The little guy was having some issues standing up. I told her to get two popsicle sticks and some warm jello. She said she didn't need props. Sure enough, she got everything in operational and, before I knew it, I was bottoming out on her cervix.\n\nThanks to how inebriated I was, the sex lasted about three times as long as usual. Truthfully, I thought she would be raw after four minutes of my humping. Well, I finished on her purse, like a gentleman, and **instantly regretted what had transpired**. Not knowing what to do, I then offered her some beef jerky. She declined. I was sobering up fast. This was *awkward.*\n\n\"There *is* one thing I need, though,\" she said.\n\n\"Uh, what's that?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this time that I realized that I had promised this girl some pizza. At some point, she had mentoned her favorite slice was bacon ranch, which cost about $3.50. I gave her $5 and she went on her way. Work was awkward for some time afterwards.

The point is, she was fairly attractive, but she also had a bit of a reputation for being a real bitch and psycho.\n\nAnyway, me and a few friends were at a party on the saturday of our high school's homecoming week. It's been a tradition for a very long time. So about two hours in I got straight hammered. Of course, now that my guard is down and my judgement is at a weak point, Susan just so happens to show up. I was young, so please forgive me for being such a dumb ass. We continue to drink, and it gets to the point where she is hitting on me, and fortunately, I didn't miss the hint.\n\nSo at this point she wants to take me upstairs to the bedroom of the party thrower. So we're making out and things start getting intense. I am ashamed to say I had sex with this woman (don't worry, I always have a condom in my wallet).\n\nI cleaned myself up, and soon after my designated driver takes me home, and I don't remember anything else up until the morning. I wake up to twenty straight texts from this girl. She misinterpreted the situation, and insisted that I was her \"soulmate\". Enough is enough, so I politely text her that what we had was just a one night stand and nothing else. No text back, I thought I was in the clear.\n\nNow this is where the story takes a turn for the worse. She shows up at my house with a knife. I realize she probably looked at my driver's license in my jeans while I cleaned myself up. So, my heart is racing, and she demands that we go into my bedroom. She then tells me to get naked, and lay out on my bed in front of her.

But i digress, the night really got started when we played pool in the room of the irish pub, I was beating all of my friends, just game after game, usually I am terrible at pool. Finally my friend told me to make it interesting, whoever lost the next game had to go up to that group of dogs (ugly girls) and attempt to seduce at least one, I had no idea how to seduce women, I had barely had three girlfriends in my life time but i felt confident. I took the bet, and after about nine, maybe ten turns, I made the unfortunate mistake of sinking the eight ball in the left corner pocket. As I lost, my friends selected the blonde haired one for me to try to seduce, I asked her what her name was but she just rambled on about how this was  her first time in San Francisco. Eventually we got to talking about more interesting stuff and after an hour she took me to her apartment, as I entered her vagina, I thought I felt scales I then realized she was not just ugly, she was a reptile from the proterozoic era, I asked her if I could just leave, she told me not to and I begged her, she said in order to leave she would need about tree fiddy.

{"body": "Alright alright, let me tell ya'll about the Captain Party. Captain Party was the alter ego of my friend and college roommate Gordon, who despite being a historian by day, was the craziest person anyone could hope to party with by night. His shindigs were legendary, and the mere act of his moseying on down to the store brought forth great expectations.\n\nOne day, Gordon got drunk whilst home with us. The great pirate, Captain Party, reared his head. He stood up, and in the familiar piratey voice yelled, \"ARGH, LET THERE BE A PARTY!\" And so there was.\n\nOne of us went out to our premiere food and stuff destination to acquire some edibles. Another went to the premiere alcohol destination to acquire our booze. Captain Party and I went to acquire a party location. After a couple phone calls we found all to be busy or otherwise indisposed. This is when the Captain had an idea: \"Arrr, we must salvage us a vessel and use it for plunder!\" And so we did.\n\nWe found a suitable home, and called the various folks that could help create the party. The mere mention of the Captain aroused even the most studious of asians from their bookforts, in hopes of great events. And so they did occur.\n\nIt was an hour into the party, and half the block was filled with loud people. Kegs have been rolled up and rolled out, like drunken autobots following behind. Music has been played, with shrill requests of pop music being turned down on sight. No, men, for this night we know only the rock. People were fucking on the roof, too, because the Captain had claimed the bushes for his own nefarious purposes.\n\nThis was when Broheim Joe showed up. This wasn't his real name, but he was certainly a bro among bros. His brain filled to the brim with football, pledges, and whatever other dumb shit he knew, he was truly king of the Brocean. Broheim Joe didn't care for the Captain after he made out with his sister at his last party. Joe, of course, being a scholarly intellectual, tossed a chair at the captain from across a crowded room.\n\nHe rose from his drunken stupor, and with the fury of an angry god, shouted, \"WHO DARES LAY STEEL UPON THE CAPTAIN!?\" Not getting the hint of this fierce deity, Joe proceeded to approach the Captain with his friend, Brolittle. From across the silent crowd, only the words rang out, \"I'LL MAKE YOU WALK THE PLANK!\" I, as his First Mate, came to his aid.\n\n\"No,\" I declared, \"we mustn't soil this fine evening with blood. Come, sailors, drink and be merry with us, and let us fight at dawn.\" And so they did, because free beer. We partied until the night was done, and slept it off where we lay. The Captain had claimed the bushes, now covered primarily in cheese wizz, for his own habitat. I slept on the second floor balcony.\n\nDawn arrived, and it was time for our gentleman's duel. Gordon was the first to awake, the Captain having disappeared from him in the night. All that remained was his eyepatch. Broheim Joe and Brolittle were next, emerging like mighty bears from the living room and into the back yard. I, cursing at everything from A to Z, was awakened by the fierce masturbation of a nameless soul nearby. I stood on the balcony railing, getting my taste of the morning. The jovial jacker's mighty need for release soon proved helpful, as Broheim Joe started to pester Gordon for the Captain's nocturnal doings. \"This cannot stand,\" I cry, \"and stand it shall not!\" I proceeded to flop off of the second floor balcony, landing square on Broheim Joe's head. A 6'6 ~200lb man's ass landing on you is one way to start the day, but I prefer Aunt Jemima.\n\nGordon, too drunk to rumble this morning, ran off in search of a towel, for at this point he is covered by cheese. I stood alone, to face these two bros. Broheim Joe and Brolittle stood, the first recovering from my asstillery and the second recovering from witnessing the dreaded asstillery in action. It was at this moment that I knew: These Bros weren't bros at all, but three-story high crustaceans from the paleolithic era! \"Goddamn you loch ness monster, I ain't givin' you no three-fiddy!\"\n\nI left the party, leaving the burden of cleanup to others.

His only known alias is Nessie and he is going to kill the President's lovechild unless the President gives Nessie the Loch Ness Monster Tree Fiddy, which he refuses to do. We know that Nessie's normally kills his victims by going through the water systems and through showerheads to attack with the element of surprise. To combat this, we surveillance Batmanbossbattle's shower with state of the art mechanical fruitflies that can watch and protect the bastard lovechild while he showers. These human controlled fruitflies are worth 300 million dollars and the only reason you were working after breaking one of these devices was because your father did great things for the CIA.

{"body": "Yeah, I've heard this before. It makes a nice, logically consistent story. \n\nBut the evidence doesn't support it. First of all, if people were being fat-shamed because they didn't match a rich-person attractiveness standard, we would expect to see people being pale-shamed as well, to pressure them into tanning. We don't. \n\nSecond of all, look at their (ancient people's) art. Not their art drawn from life, but their art drawn from imagination:\n\nhttp://www.talariaenterprises.com/images_at/6308a.jpg\n\nhttp://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/39431469.jpg\n\nhttp://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/campidoglio-ancient-statue-rome-italy-13931596.jpg\n\nhttp://farm4.static.flickr.com/3398/3607519379_40ff9dae1f.jpg\n\nhttp://www.parosweb.com/media/static/photos/venus-de-milo_lp78sXov.jpg\n\nhttp://www.martimports.com/images/products/accupunture-statue-wood.jpg\n\nhttp://media-cache-ec2.pinterest.com/192x/c7/56/c1/c756c1a512f891ff202033ccd6d4f370.jpg\n\nhttp://farm8.staticflickr.com/7073/7232851746_5e288a5636_z.jpg\n\nhttp://www.ganeshmall.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/h/shiva.statue.jpg\n\nThird, look again at art specifically of their deities. There are only two deity-images that I am aware of that are consistently portrayed as fat. These are mother-goddess images from the paleolithic era, and Buddha statues from Asian cultures. Even the latter isn't universally the case. Contrast this against the statues of the Greek gods (after all, what does it mean to say someone looks like a \"Greek statue\"?), and images of gods from Europe, India, southeast Asia, and so forth. Sometimes they ripple with defined muscle, and sometimes the sculptors are more restrained. But there are very few fatties. \n\nI think people make too much of the paintings of Peter Paul Reubens. Yes, the [Three Graces](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/The_Three_Graces%2C_by_Peter_Paul_Rubens%2C_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg) are fatties, but look at [how he depicts men](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Peter_Paul_Rubens_068.jpg), and you see it's pretty clear we are dealing with an individual painter's sexual fetish. \n\nAnd there are people today who like chubby women. But that's *real* chubby, not euphemism chubby. /r/thick isn't full of hamplanets, it's full of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/thick/comments/1dw1zg/wonderful/), and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/thick/comments/1dw1f7/in_the_shower/), and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/thick/comments/1duihq/pretty_mirror_shot/).

{"body": "My last boss.\n\nThe last company I worked for I stayed for about a year at. I finished my work on time, always showed up at 9 AM sharp, etc. etc, and generally considered myself to be an above-average employee. The pay wasn't great but it was enough to get by with on one job, which was especially good for someone fresh out of college (as I was when I started working there.) I honestly did like working there for the most part, and although I had no intention of working there forever, until I was able to get a job relevant to my degree, I felt that this was a good gig.\n\nExcept, of course, for my boss.\n\nMy immediate supervisor was a middleaged dragon of a woman, about twice the age of many of her coworkers. About half of them were like me: wannabe yuppies who were stuck at the bottom of the corporate ladder, while the others were 50-year-olds who considered this job an *achievement*, and as such were content to keep plodding along until they molded up or retired. My boss, though, was stuck in some kind of limbo. She acted as though she felt she was superior to everyone else, especially the older guys. Not an uncommon sentiment, especially among the younger crowd, but one that wasn't advertised as blatantly as she liked to. The irony here of course was that she was mere years younger than them and had a (largely meaningless pay-wise) minor position of authority over them. And it wasn't like she tried to act all friendly to the younger guys either; or, no. She *hated* us. Most of us thought that that was because she was just jealous of our youth, future, or something similar, but I remain convinced that she was motivated by confusion and fear, as all great bigots are; this confusion being that she had once been like us, working at some meaningless low-level position at some point years and years ago, but at some point she'd fucked up and had never been able to leave that sort of job, with the kicker being that she never figured out *why* she was stuck where she was. She absolutely hated us and she made her contempt known in a plethora of your garden variety passive-aggressive asshole moves: hounding us over minor things, talking with a voice dripping with disdain, stuff that she could do without outright violating any company rules. She hated us and we hated her, which is why I was so thrilled to find her stealing from the company one night.\n\nIt was late and everyone else had already left, in fact, I had too, but I forgotten my cell phone and I made a U-turn after driving for about five minutes to go back and get it. Her car was still in the parking lot and the door to the building was unlocked, so I went inside to find her sitting at her computer. Normally I wouldn't have cared to even wonder why, but as soon as she saw me inside the building she flew into an absolute rage (supposedly about something minor that had happened earlier that day). This was something she'd never done outright before, so I realized something was up. I asked her what she was doing on the computer, and this just made her madder. She told me to mind my own fucking business, so I gave her a little smile and said okay, grabbed my phone and started leaving. As I got to the door she called over to me. She told me harshly (but not angrily) not to tell anyone I'd seen her there that night, as she claimed she'd been working overtime and that if the higher-ups knew that this was the case, they'd dock her vacation time or something like that. A stupid excuse, and I knew it was bullshit even then, so I just gave her my most insincere smile that I could muster, nodded, said \"okay\" again and started again to leave. She asked me to stop one more time, all anger gone from her voice.\n\nShe started pleading with me not to tell anyone that she'd been there. She launched into some sob story about how she needed this job and if she lost this one she'd be absolutely screwed, standard stuff. I was just about gleeful at this point. This woman, this old battle-axe, this bitch had been the only drawback to this job and now I could be in a position to make her go away forever. She started crying, pleading with me, and saying that there was only one thing that she needed and that that's why she'd been doing all this. Just for shits and giggles, I asked her what. \"I need about tree fiddy\". It's about that time I noticed that my \"boss\" was about 500 feet tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era! \"You god damn loch ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I told her angrily, then left the office and drove home.\n\n**TL;DR** Libellious leader lies like a lynx, fabulous functions follow.

This was a totally new experience for me - the quantity of bullshit I had to make up on the spot was exhilarating, and she was buying *every ounce* of it. I had been diagnosed right after I was born, it involved some sort of convulsions, was intermittent and unpredictable - it was a remarkably polished set of lies, looking back on it. I'm still proud of that moment, right up until she asked me what it was called.\n\nAt the time, I was a big fan of the movie 'The Santa Clause', starring Tim Allen. For some reason, this question stumped me - I had mo medical vocabulary. But my mind settled on something before I really knew what I'd said. I looked up at her and told her, \"I have key lime disease.\" I genuinely thought that was a disease. The teacher, who was clearly on to the ruse now, simply looked back at me and said, \"Well, I have a long-term disease as well, but thankfully there's a cure.\" I asked her, \"What's the cure?\" She said, \"The cure is about tree fiddy.\" It was at this point that I noticed that the substitute teacher was actually a 500 foot tall monster from the paleozoic era. \"God dammit you Loch Ness Monster I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I announced.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368151505", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

She tells me to come back after school to figure out what I can do. My teenage mind is running through all the things that could happen. I just hoped maybe one of those teacher student porn scenes would unfold. \n\nHoly fuck, I was right. I walked into the room and she is sitting on her desk, mountainous tits pouring out of her shirt. She sensually walks over to me and moves her hand down my chest and onto my pants. At this point I notice something is off, something just isn't right. She unzips my pants and I see something on her shoulder. I couldn't really make out what it was until she leaned in closer.

{"body": "I have once; some background. I live in the same state that the kabam headquarter is in. So about last month, I was going around with my family, having a little vacation and all. Out hotel happened to be in the more industrial side of the city. Lots of headquarters of big companies here, especially gaming companies. You see blizzard, Microsoft, Sony, you name it. But. As we were driving towards our hotel, a logo struck me harder than the other neon signs. A Giant bomb stared back at me, a bomb that I know very well. It was the headquarter of Kabam. That moment, I made a personal note to visit it tomorrow. So fast forward to morning, I'm pretty pumped about my visit. We hop into our little Honda, and drive to the building. The building it self wasn't that magnificent, in fact, it was quite boring. There was a pretty big parking lot, I'll give it that. My family wasn't very happy about my choice of visiting a company on our vacation, so I went alone. Walk in the front door, a cold jet of air condition hit me hard. I shiver in the sudden temperature change. There is a small fountain in the main lobby. Around the lobby, hangs pictures of kabam's successful games. Kingdom of canterlot, games like that. There were some chairs in the lobby, and they looked rather comfortable. So I did what a reckless teenager would do; ignore the glance of the lobbyist and pop a squat. As I sat and tried to look around for a painting of ROTMG, some one walked in. It was not an ordinary someone, it was... Mike Seller him self. How i know? All those Mseller memes. He was dressed comfortably, not what I expected. I rushed up, running on adrenaline. I said the first thig that came to my mind. \"Are you Mike Seller?\" He looked at me, stunned. \"Yes, I am Mike Seller.\" Excited, I tried to say, \"Oh My god-\" I was cut off by him. He quickly looked around, and ASKED ME: \"I have a question;\" \"Ask away!\", I replied! \"Do you... Do you have a tree fiddy?\" And that was when I realized that Mseller was not a human, but in fact an 500 feet tall lake monster.

{"body": "I win all French exchange stories. \n\nAbout 3 years ago we had this girl stay with us for a few weeks over the Summer. I was working in a different city but came back one weekend because of a family emergency. That evening we were just sitting around in the living room not really sure what to do, this girl was pretty much ignored because of said emergency. It's a shame, but under the circumstances there wasn't really anything else to do. People were coming and going from the house, lots of phone calls.\n\nAnyway, come the evening my parents were either out or had gone to bed but it was just my siblings, the French girl, and myself left up. Boning her was the last thing on my mind. We were on the same sofa, I had my legs up on the table and then she just stretched out and put her legs over mine... OK, I can handle this. Possibly an awkward boner or two but nothing major.\n\nOne by one my siblings left to go to bed (I'm 1 of 5) until finally it was just the French girl and me. She'd got up and down to get a drink or whatever and always reverted to the same place. I'd had my arms back around the sofa stretching out. I then move them and rested them on her legs which was a pretty natural position for them to be. I slowly started stroking them until we started holding hands, and then making out, and then she suggested that we go through to her room, which fortunately, was downstairs away from the rest of my family.\n\nWe started getting down to it and I realised that I didn't have a johnny (condom) on me, or anywhere in the house for that matter. She suggested that I go and ask my brother. Quite a sound suggestion because he had a long term gf so was more than likely to have one kicking about somewhere.\n\nSo off I go up the stairs in my boxers, with a massive boner, to get a condom from my brother. I hadn't quite worked out how I was going to go into his room and ask for a condom without him noticing my erection. I poked my head around the door and see he's asleep. I shake him gently and I tell him my request. Stiring slowly, and slightly confused, he saw his chance, \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was about this time I realised that my brother wasn't my brother and was about 6 yards long and had tentacles.

There was a company of infantry and a few enablers like the JTACs and medics, other than that we were on our own.\n\nNo showers, no Haji shops full of bootleg DVDs. Just this place hanging out on the side of a mountain overlooking a town. And anything nice we did have inevitably got destroyed. The MWR with 5 working computers? Hit by a PG-7 and burned to the ground. The chow hall? Fragged by a mortar and leaving us stuck with MREs for months. Helicopters never flew in during the day, and came screaming in at night because of the DSKH somewhere in the mountains. And the road was so heavily emplaned with IEDs that we went three months without a convoy coming out to us.\n\nNow I say all this in order to set a stage. The kind of place that was will make somebody a little bit, hmmm, *wacky*.\n\nWe started to laugh and develop our internal subculture. Now somebody had watched a Vietnam movie on his laptop and jokingly take. To calling the insurgents \"gooks\", because the term wasn't offensive to Muslims. He'd talk about looking for Gooks on patrol and such. Eventually the term caught on and people were saying it. At some point the word jumped from a joke to everyday slang for insurgents that was said without irony.\n\nNow, one day we went out on a patrol and bagged a number of IED emplacers red handed (thanks to X-spray, quite literally), but one of the platoon LTs was wounded. Not terribly, but enough that he needed to go back to a FOB for medical looksy. So he headed out at night and his replacement came in on the same helicopter. Now this new LT was your stereotypical new LT that had never deployed or seen anything but a big FOB. So when he hopped into our outpost, he wondered why, at 5am, we were all in bunkers and had full armor and combat loads on us.\n\nWell, see, we knew insurgents habits, and were expecting a retaliatory attack for rolling up their emplacers. So I sat in this bunker, explaining things to this brand new LT and pointing out where things had used to be before they had burned down or blown up. \n\nAnd he listened, kind of overwhelmed. Suddenly, some gunshots and the reaction guys running from a bunker towards part of our outpost that bordered a schoolhouse (protecting the school was part of our reason for being there). Apparently insurgents had gotten past the local police and into the schoolhouse, which could very easily allow them to jump our fence.\n\nSo the reaction soldiers are running by collecting up other people and shouting \" Gooks inside the wire!\" Without a hint of irony.\n\nI'll never forget the look on that LT's face as he tried to figure out what year he was in.\n\n\n**TL;DR** Loch Ness monster.

{"body": "CREEPY CRAWLERS!\n\nWhen I was a kid, those were the coolest thing. I wanted them so bad. My parents were poor, so when I begged, my pleas fell on deaf ears. Then, one day, I spot the box on the shelf in the clearance aisle at wal mart! I get excited, yell and grab the box and tell my mom how much they were, hoping it was a good deal (I had no concept of money yet). She says yes to the purchase, and I'm on cloud nine the rest of the time in the store. I'm sitting there smiling and holding the box, even though we have a cart, because I was so excited. We check out, get to the car, and my mom makes me put the box with all the groceries and other junk we had to get. So I'm on edge the whole ride home, which was only ten minutes but felt like a year. I grab as many bags as I can in one trip so I can go back and grab the creepy crawlers box and bring it inside. \n\nI pull up a chair to the counter and open the box, and pour out the contents.\n\nIt's just a mold, and only a little bit of the goo to make the bugs. I'm heartbroken. I guess I didn't realize the box was too small to contain the oven, too, because I was kind of a retarded kid. But still, I ask my mom if I can use our regular oven to make the things. She says yes (which, in retrospect, is a pretty brave thing to let a 7 year old do). I preheat it to like 400f and put the mold with the goo in there. \n\nThen I go watch cartoons and forget about it.\n\nAn hour later this crazy smell reaches me and my heart immediately sinks. I run to the kitchen and there's smoke coming out of the oven. I grab oven mitts, open the oven, and get the mold out. It had cracked open and gotten on the heating elements, hence the smoking (I later learned that the original oven was just a hot plate with a plastic case, so I should have made it on the stove instead. Oh well). \n\nAfter the mold cooled, I couldn't get it open, so I grabbed a flat head screwdriver from the garage, and tried to pry it loose. It popped open, and it was just a crispy mess in there, like what plastic looks like after its been set on fire. And that's when I realize that it's not plastic at all, but a 500 foot tall reptile from the Paleozoic era! The Loch Ness monster rears its ugly head and I stab it in the brain, instantly killing its physical form, only so that it would return more powerful somewhere else. Anyway after that I had to throw away the mold because it had been ruined :/\n\nTL;DR: severely disappointed by creepy crawlers.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368210886", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Look, it's basically a case of historic oversimplification. I think Huxley might have been the guy to popularize the atheist/agnostic/theist categorization system that a lot of people still use even though it tells you less.  \n\nThe second system (really more a reuse of ill-defined words) became popularized more recently. In it, gnosticistm/agnosticism refers only to whether you think you *know* your belief is true (emphasis also on 'think' since there's probably no way to actually know). The second is simply whether you believe in a god. If yes, you're a theist, if no, you're an atheist.  \n\nPart of the reason the second system is better is because it tells you more with only two simple yes/no questions than the other, which treats itself as some kind of one-dimensional sliding scale. So it's a bit like a binary Nolan scale rather than the oft-used \"left-right\" political scale, which is relativistic and sucks.  \n\nAnyhow, I suspect that aside from information and classification, the trend towards the binary scale is also simply one away from the linear one, which has shitoads of stigmatization from religious people (hence the reason 'atheist' is so loaded with tension and why people can lose their shit when they find out you are one, but yet agnostics on that scale are just 'spiritually lazy' or whatever).  \n\nAt any rate, I suspect it also has to do with null-hypothesis rejection in statistics and science. Essentially, atheism (the notion that, as Laplace put it, the model doesn't need a god; or alternately simply not believing in something without evidence for it) is the null hypothesis, whereas the hypothesis is that a god exists (let's be generous and say any god and not a particular one). Essentially, if you don't get enough evidence to reject your null hypothesis (*p* &lt; .05 in statistical terms, if you were wondering), you don't in the strictest sense *accept* your null hypothesis, you *fail to reject* it.  \n\nSo basically, even if I think it's most likely that a god (worthy of the term) does not exist for the same reason I think the Loch Ness monster doesn't: not only is there no good evidence for it, a number of instances of 'evidence' have been hoaxes. Now, technically Nessie, Bigfoot, invisible pink dragons, a god, or a celestial teapot floating around Saturn *might* exist, but I'm not going to believe they do until I've seen some convincing evidence. Disbelief is default in intellectual honesty (where faith is intellectual suicide).  \n\nSo anyway, I'm an atheist if you want to abbreviate it, and an agnostic atheist if you want to get a bit more relevant information.

(Examples for facts contradicting the bible: The earth is more than 5000(?) years old, dinosaurs did exist, countless \"miracles\" explained by science... these are FACTS as there is empirical evidence proving as such... \"God doesn't exist\" isn't a fact as it has yet to be proven, once it has been empirically proven... then we can call it a fact... until then it's just a theory.

She's smart, beautiful, and funny. She's also a huge tease. She physically flirts with me a LOT in my class (massages, grabbing my hand, playing with my hair) and she always ambushes me for a hug in the halls. Every Friday so far she's asked me if I had plans for the night, and everytime I say not yet, she tells me that she already is doing something. Last weekend, however, she was free and we arranged for her to come to my house when my parents weren't home.\n\nShe arrived that night around 7ish, and my parents wouldn't be getting home til 12 or later, so we had plenty of time to fool around. I put in a movie (Shawshank Redemption FTW), and we watched the first 30ish minutes cuddling together. Then she went in for the kiss. We madeout for about 15 minutes before things escalated. She had her hand on my clothes and I had my hand on hers. After all of this it was only 9:20, and she was planning to stay over til at least 11, so we finished Shawshank with some make out action in between scenes. She left and I was feeling great about myself because she told me how much fun she had/how good I am at kissing, etc.\n\nThe next day she didn't return my call, and me being the nonclinger that I am, I just decided to hang out with the boys for the day. We played some intense football, etc etc. Not really part of the story. On Sunday she told me that she wasn't sure if she wanted to be more than friends, and I was pretty bummed. Come Monday, however, she was back to her old flirty ways. She was being WAY more handsy than usual though, which was awesome. Today, she rode home with me (parents again aren't home), and we made out for a while and she stuck her hand on my clothes, only to take her hand out and tell me she had to leave. We stopped at a gas station on the way home and she asked me for some money for a soda.\n\n\"How much you need?\" I asked\nShe looks at me and she says \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it was about that time I noticed this \"girl\" was about eight stories tall and was a Crustracean from the Paleolithic Era.\nI said \"Dangit Nessie!

You'd think someone would have brought that up ...somewhere in the goddamn book.\n\n..And Jesus and the disciples walked down the path towards Nazareth but, oh, the path was blocked by a giant brontosaurus with a splinter in his paw.

Timothy nudged him. \"It was a big ******' lizard, Thomas!\" But Jesus was unafraid. And he took the splinter from the brontosaurus' paw and the brontosaurus became his friend. And Jesus sent him to Scotland where he lived in a loch oh, so many years attracting fat American families with their fat ******' dollars to look for the Loch Ness Monster. And oh, the Scots did praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.\n\n12,000 years old... I asked this guy- Come on, man. Dinosaur fossils. What's the deal?

Does it bother anyone here- the idea that God might be ******' with our heads? Anyone have trouble sleepin' restfully with that thought in their head?

I am killing me, oh, ho, ho!\" You die, you go to Saint Peter- \"Did you believe in dinosaurs?\" \"Well, yeah. There was fossils everywhere!\" BOOM! AAAHHH! \"What are you, an idiot? God was ******' with you! Giant flyin' lizards! You moron! That's one of God's easiest jokes!\" \"It seemed so plausible!

{"body": "I was studying with a girl in my dorm room Sophomore year of College. I had a huge crush on the girl, and had just gotten out of a pretty bad relationship hadn't gotten any since the break up. I figured I'd invite her over to study for our calc class, seeing how we were both having trouble with it. She lived off campus, and told me she should come to my place, stating \"It'd take too long to go to my place and back.\" So she came over for dinner and studying, showing up around 6:30pm. I opened the door and she was wearing a pink tube top, and a really small white skirt you could pretty much see her ass hanging out of. We ate dinner and headed to my room so we could use my computer to pull up old tests and reviews. \n\nSo we're sitting there as we're working, I at my desk, she on my bed, and she's not really on topic as far as the review, she was acting kind of flirtatious and asking me a lot of questions about my personal life and different questions about my room and so forth. Which I answer most of them.\n\nAt this point I'm getting pretty focused and really working hard on the review. Only thing was I didn't notice her look into my bag of sex toys where I had some handcuffs, a blindfold, some nipple clamps, and a few other things in there. She pulled the stuff out and was just asking me about it, poking fun at me for being a \"freak\" and all that. She went into one of the unexplored compartments in the bag where I had an unused vibrator still in the packaging (some friends got me as a part of an inside joke we have but it's too long to explain). \n\nI was extremely embarrassed about the find, and focused back on the work, trying to change the subject, and actually study. I once again became too focused to realize she had taken it out of it's packaging. I , still very focused on the initial task, asked her a question about the review, she replied in a very quiet, moaning sounding, \"not now\". Due to this, I turned and looked at her.\n\nThere she was on my bed using it on the outside of her skirt, diddling herself. It was pretty fucking hot too. You could tell she was really enjoying it, and it finally took my focus off the review, I now couldn't take my eyes off of her. As I looked, her eyes met mine, just as she finished, letting out a loud gasp. I took the hint and asked her if she needed anything to help her out hinting at sex. [She clearly stated \"I'm gonna need about $3.50.\"\n\nIt was then I noticed that my crush was actually a 6-story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic Era! I told her \"NOT NOW YOU GODDAMN LOCH NESS MONSTER. GTFO! I AIN'T GIVING YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\"]\n\n\nThe bracketed portions did not actually happen. Truth is, she responded \"of course\" to my question and we fucked for the rest of the night having pretty wild sex. \n\nTL;DR: Girl I had a crush on finds my sex toy bag while studying on my bed, proceeds to get herself off with a vibrator, then we have wild kinky sex for the rest of the night, don't study, still pass test. She was not actually the Loch Ness Monster.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368334402", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 666, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students. I heard most of the drama but there is one student that I will always be reminded of when people ask this question. \n\nThere was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip. She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't. Everyone could hear her, including me. Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about. She gossiped most days but one day was different. \n\nI heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom. I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not? It could be fun. \n\nAnyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with. \n\nMr.BundtCaek....\n\nI was shocked when I heard this. \n\nBut stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young. She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess. If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress.\n\nAfter class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work. It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head.\n\nAs soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, \"Hey Kathy. I heard you talking about me in class...\" she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, \"Oh my god! You heard me say that? I'm so sorry! And-\" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, \"I want to have sex with you too.\"\n\nShe stopped her sentence and smiled. Then she said, \"Do you know what my rates are?\"\n\nConfused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in. It turns out she mentioned that she would have sex with me... if I paid that is. \n\nI decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her. \"Alright,\" I told her. \"What do you mean?\" \n\n\"I'll do it, but I need some money of course. That's just how it works.\" she said. I replied, \"Okay, what do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had tricked me again! \"GODDAMNIT MONSTAH, I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" I said to her as she swam away.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368340602", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "One night that I will never forget started very porn-like, only to be blindsided with bitter disappointment..\n\nA few years ago I had a rather serious girlfriend, we'll call her Allison.  Allison's dad owned a local pizza shop and, even though she was/is spoiled rotten, she would work there from time to time, usually on weekends.  She wasn't very good in the kitchen(except when she was making me sandwiches) so as a result she mostly worked the register or delivery.\n\nOne Sunday night I'm getting home from hanging out with my best pal and I'm feeling toasty so I decide to order a pizza.  I called Allison's dad's place because the break up was fresh and I missed her.  I knew she missed me too, but I was holding onto my pride and moving forward with my life... or so I thought.  Her dad answered the phone, he didn't recognize my voice.  I ordered a medium spinach and pepperoni pizza for delivery, and he didn't recognize my address either.  \"It'll be about 35 minutes,\" he said, \"but it'll be hot.\"\n\nThose words.  \"It'll be hot.\"\nThat was the first time it ran through my mind, \"Allison might deliver this pizza.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it, see you then\" I replied.  I hung up the phone and pondered a bit on a few things; the pizza, the fact that I won't be seeing that guy I just said I would see soon, and the fact that I missed the shit out of Allison and she might show up at my door.  After a while I snapped out of it and turned on my 64.  I was playing Super Smash when the doorbell rang. Sure enough, it was Allison.\n\nWe stared at each other for a prolonged second.  From being with each other nearly every day for 18 months to not seeing each other or speaking, to this moment now.  That's when it hit me; I was about to get in the shower!  I had just turned on Super Smash Bros. to play while the shower got hot.  I was shirtless in front of my ex-girlfriend.  I was about to throw something on when she interrupted me, \"It's okay, it's nothing I haven't seen before.. Here's your pizza.\"  She handed the pizza to me, I opened the lid and gave it a look.  It was so hot, the steam attacked my face and caressed my chest, making my pecs glisten with conviction.\n\n\"Hah, is it hot?\"  I said sarcastically, backing my face away from the steam.\n\"It's really hot,\" she said softly, slowly.  My dick raised slightly in my pants.\nShe came closer to me, \"It might not be hot enough, let me check.  She inspected the pizza that lay in my hand in front of my face.  She sniffed a bit, looked me in the eyes, looked back down, and slowly sniffed her way up.  She went all the way up my neck and whispered \"It feels hot enough to me,\" while quietly thrusting her hand into my crotch.\n\nIt felt so good that accepted it at first. She nibbled my ear and fondled my manhood. \"What are you doing?\" I said, making a feeble attempt to be righteous.\n\n\"I've missed you so much, kevinthepillow.  I want you to just eat your pizza and let me do this.\"\n\"I've missed you, too, Allison.... Okay go ahead.\"\n\nI kicked the door shut with my foot and leaned against the counter.  I took out a piece of pizza and thought to myself, \"This is actually pretty fucking awesome.\"  But right as she was about to start she came back up.\n\n\"I want it from you first, kevinthepillow.\" She said. \"No, no, just keep doi-\" I started, only to be interrupted by my determined ex. \"No, kevinthepillow, I need it from you.\" She said. Giving in, I decided to play dirty; \"What do you need, baby?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nHowever, the good news was that I ended up getting the pizza for free.  Allison and I never had another encounter, which was probably good for my psyche.  I decided to never eat at that pizzeria again, as it just seemed unsanitary after all that.  I'll miss their good pizza, but hey, that's life.\n\n**TL;DR: I had a sexy encounter with the pizza delivery girl**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368348368", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

It was close to dark and kind of chilly out so I didn't want this poor guy to get hit by a car or freeze. This person gets in the car and takes off their hoodie and it's actually a pretty damn attractive girl. \"Hello\" I said. She said she had been walking over an hour and couldn't get someone to pick her up. Her phone was dead, so she couldn't call anyone. I told her maybe if she didn't look so sketchy in the hoodie, a cute girl like her should have no problems getting help! I mean, she was real good looking, blonde, had that \"girl next door\" vibe going on. She giggled, and told me her car had ran out of gas a couple miles back, and she just needed help getting to a gas station. I obliged and drove a for about 10 minutes to find the gas station. She filled up, and got back in my car. \"Thanks so much\" she said. \"You are such a nice guy, I can't believe nobody stopped.\". I told her it was no problem, and that I believe in Karma. \"You're a good person\" she said. Driving back she was getting real touchy, I shit you not. **I couldn't believe this was happening.** It was like I was in the start of a porno movie or something. She gets a little more feely and starts rubbing my crotch. \"Maybe there's something I can do for you to make this ride go a little faster\". HOLY SHiT. I was gona get a handy or road head from this cute blonde chick. I didn't know if she was scamming or was going to rob me, but I said \"I'll let you decide\" as I unzipped my pants. She took the hint, and nudged closer to me. \"Before I do, I just need one more thing from you.\" I told her \"ANYTHING!\" That's when she leaned over, and whispered in my ear.... \"I'm gona need about tree fiddy\". Then she took off her shirt only to reveal tons of scales and tentacles. That's when I realized I was giving a car ride to the GOD DAMNED loch ness monster. I'd been had!

{"body": "About a year ago it was the summer between my sophomore and junior years of college. In order to make money while I was in my home town I worked as a pizza delivery guy (seriously though). Over time, I would always run into people that I went to high school with and we would just say how we were doing and all that nonsense. One night, a little after the 4th of July (I remember this because I had some old bottle rockets in my backseat) I got a call in to make a delivery to the other side of town. It was pretty late at night and this house was out in the boondocks (I live in New England and there are some dense woods on that side of town). I'm driving down this dark road until I finally get to the house. It turns out that the person at this house was a girl I was friends with back in high school. I had the biggest crush on her but I was too much of a wimp to tell her. Her face lit up and she was really happy to see me. She invited me inside to talk for a bit to catch up on things. We were sitting on the couch in her living room pretty close to one another. One thing eventually lead to another and we went up stairs. Luckily for both of us, her parents were on vacation. We went all the way and it  was amazing. After when we were laying I was putting on my pants and she had a look on her face as if she had a question. \"Can I ask you something?\", she said. \"Yeah.. sure what do you need\", I responded (or along those lines). But what she asked me is something that I would NEVER forget. She had a look in her eyes and said \"I need about tree-fitty.\" After that I realized that it wasn't my high school crush but a huge crustacean from the Paleolithic Era and then I said \"I aint givn' you no tree-fitty. Get your own God Damn money Loch Ness monster.\" I left the house and got back to the pizzeria. All my fellow co-workers were asking me about why I took so long and why there wasn't any tips. I had to pay back the money for the pizza, but in my eyes, it was always worth it. Now whenever someone makes references to pizza guys in porn, I always tell this story.\n\nTL;DR I got laid delivering a pizza.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368379747", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So I was working for a company doing in home IT service, we will call them \"nerd squad\" I had about 8 service calls that day. The first of them was a simple wireless router installation, the second a printer that kept jamming, dumb crap like that. Well my last stop of the day I pull up to this HUGE house, easily had 9 bedrooms and just as many bathrooms, my house would fit in the swimming pool. I butler opens the door and I say \"Hi I'm Derp with the Nerd Squad I was told you have a issue with one of your computers\" he says \"yes my lord this way\" (creepy right) so I follow dude up to the 3rd floor where the computer is located, I guess it can't get online. While walking down the hall way I glanced into a room and saw a beautiful woman, long red hair, perfect tits, face like what I assume an angle would look like. Well I proceed to work on said computer, it doesn't seem to have a network connection, it's telling me the cable is unplugged. I check everything on the PC side and all is fine, replace the Ethernet cable and no change. So my next thought it to check the wiring into the switch, I go to find the creepy butler to tell me where the wiring terminates at, I walk by and there's the red head again, I ask her do you know where the butler is she says he went to the store but she would be glad to show me where the wiring is. She points me in the direction and proceeds to follow me, I glance back and I noticed she gave me the once over but I brushed it off thinking she just wanted to make fun of my \"nerd squad\" shirt. We go down to the \"wiring room\" and I start looking things over, she stays down there (weird). Well I'm power cycling the switch when I feel a hand rub my shoulders, she says \"you are so tense let me rub your back\" I turn around and that's when I realized shes no beautiful red head she's the Loch Ness monster and she asks me for three fiddy I said \"God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain’t gonna give you no tree fiddy.\" ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368382026", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1. I was studying with a girl in my dorm room Sophomore year of College. I had a huge crush on the girl, and had just gotten out of a pretty bad relationship hadn't gotten any since the break up. I figured I'd invite her over to study for our calc class, seeing how we were both having trouble with it. She lived off campus, and told me she should come to my place, stating \"It'd take too long to go to my place and back.\" So she came over for dinner and studying, showing up around 6:30pm. I opened the door and she was wearing a pink tube top, and a really small white skirt you could pretty much see her ass hanging out of. We ate dinner and headed to my room so we could use my computer to pull up old tests and reviews.\nSo we're sitting there as we're working, I at my desk, she on my bed, and she's not really on topic as far as the review, she was acting kind of flirtatious and asking me a lot of questions about my personal life and different questions about my room and so forth. Which I answer most of them.\nAt this point I'm getting pretty focused and really working hard on the review. Only thing was I didn't notice her look into my bag of sex toys where I had some handcuffs, a blindfold, some nipple clamps, and a few other things in there. She pulled the stuff out and was just asking me about it, poking fun at me for being a \"freak\" and all that. She went into one of the unexplored compartments in the bag where I had an unused vibrator still in the packaging (some friends got me as a part of an inside joke we have but it's too long to explain).\nI was extremely embarrassed about the find, and focused back on the work, trying to change the subject, and actually study. I once again became too focused to realize she had taken it out of it's packaging. I , still very focused on the initial task, asked her a question about the review, she replied in a very quiet, moaning sounding, \"not now\". Due to this, I turned and looked at her.\nThere she was on my bed using it on the outside of her skirt, diddling herself. It was pretty fucking hot too. You could tell she was really enjoying it, and it finally took my focus off the review, I now couldn't take my eyes off of her. As I looked, her eyes met mine, just as she finished, letting out a loud gasp. I took the hint and asked her if she needed anything to help her out hinting at sex. She clearly stated \"I'm gonna need about $3.50.\"\nIt was then I noticed that my crush was actually a 6-story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic Era! I told her \"NOT NOW YOU GODDAMN LOCH NESS MONSTER. GTFO! I AIN'T GIVING YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\"\n\n2. It looks like an amazing game that lots of my friends recommend. After playing Diablo 2 a couple times at friends houses and really enjoying, I was considering picking up D3 but heard about the disaster it was. I think TL2 would be an amazing game game that I could play.\n\n3. @bkster I think you have nice tits\n\n4. http://www.verybestbaking.com/recipes/18476/Original-NESTL%C3%89-TOLL-HOUSE-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies/detail.aspx", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368382520", "subreddit": "GiftofGames", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

So at about 1am when me and my mom are the only ones up and still watching tv we hear this loud crash outside, sounded like a grenade just went off, ever curious I get up and walk outside with my mom near by, and as soon as I get outside I see my dads car down the street with the engine on fire. So my mom pushes me back inside and tells me not to come out until she tells me to and proceeds to run down the street towards my dad, yelling at him knowing he's probably been out drinking and just destroyed our only car. I hear screaming and then sirens, followed by lights turning on all over the neighborhood, police show up soon after that and I see my dad get took away in a police car. Mom comes back into the house wiping away a tear, I ask her if everything's alright, and she softly says \"yes, everything will be ok\" and takes me up stairs to tuck me and my brothers into bed. Being the child I was though I still had questions mainly \"where's daddy going?\" She tells me that he's going away for a little while and that she won't let anything happen to us while he's gone. Everything felt like it was going to be ok in that moment too, only she could make everything seem fine. She kisses me on the cheek and says \"anon_alcoholc, I need you to do me a favor baby\" and I say \"yes mommy?\" She says \"I'm gonna need about three fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I realized my mom was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era I said \"damnit monster I ain't given you no damn three fiddy, get out of my house!\" Anyways a few days later my sad was released from jail and everything begin to get back to normal again, of course until the divorce. So this story probably has the happiest ending possible in this situation, all thanks to my mommy. \n\nTL;DR Dad destroys car coming home drunk, mom eases my worry and makes everything seem ok like only a mother can.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368402300", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh jeez, here we go. I was at a bar with my friends one evening. They were always the obnoxious drunks who liked to do some stupid shit to prove how macho they were and attract attention. It was absolutely stupid, but I enjoyed watching it, so I usually kept my mouth shut.\n\nWell one time, my friend whom we shall refer to as \"Dave\" said to the group of us \"Hey, I bet you I can steal us a bottle of rum from behind the bar\".\n\nBefore I go on, let me explain the bar layout. It was basically this enclosed rectangular area at the middle of the room with 3 or 4 bar tenders walking around taking drink orders. The drinks were on a shelf in the center of the bar area and the bar-tenders would walk around between it and the counter. \n\nSo back to the story. I gave the usual \"Yea, whatever Dave\" but another friend Matt was like \"Dude... You won't. Pussy.\" Now, of course, Dave had to be *that guy* and prove him wrong, but the bar was crowded and there were 3 bar tenders on duty at the time, so there was no way Dave could have gotten away with this. Dave realizes this too and says \"In a bit dude\", but Matt just says \"Yea, ok. I knew you wouldn't\".\n\nFast forward a few hours. We're all pretty drunk, but Matt and Dave are *really* wasted. They're slurring and everything and Dave is trying to get me to buy him more drinks because he knows they'll cut him off if he tries to order. I tell him that he should fuck off, but he just keeps nagging. After a final \"no\" from me, he decides that it's time to make good on his arrangement with Matt. At this point the bar has died down and there's only 1 bartender working. Dave gets up, stumbles over to the bar, and as soon as the bartender goes to the other side of the bar he dives head-first over the bar. He landed about half-way onto the bar and kinda just dragged himself over the bar but I remember him falling below the bar to where I couldn't see him for a moment with a big \\*crash\\*. The bartender of course heard this and comes back around the bar to see Dave with a whiskey bottle in his hand straddling the bar trying to get back to us. He gets over the bar, falls on the floor again and runs out side as fast as I have ever seen Dave run, which was actually quite impressive for a drunk guy. The bartender shouted \"Hey!\" and ran out from behind the bar and out after Dave.\n\nAt this point we're all looking at each other and thinking \"holy shit! did that just happen?\" but the story still isn't over. We grab all of our drinks and rush out of the bar to see Dave lying in the parking with the bartender crouching over him. The bartender had his bottle of whiskey back and it looked like Dave was bleeding from the forehead. We initially thought that Dave had tripped by accident because he was so drunk, but we saw the bartender talking really angrily at him and give him a shove while he was lying there. Dave was so far gone and probably had a concussion and had no idea what was going on, so we rushed over and got the bartender away from him. We had another friend call and ambulance for Dave while I went over to the bar tender and said \"Hey man, you got your bottle of whiskey back, what the fuck else do you need from the guy?\" The bartender looks back at me very angrily and says \"I need about tree fidy.\" At this point I realized that the bartender was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era! I shouted back \"God dammit Nessie! I ain't given you no tree fiddy!\"\n\n**TL;DR**: Drunk bets at a bar get us in trouble...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368412844", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 427, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "R Okay reddit, had a sort of bad encounter with drugs, and started this as a text message, to the girl I trust the most, and hope to one day marry. I'm adding a little bit more backround for clarity, and adding details that will explain the situation a little better as I proof read before submitting this.\n\n\n\nI am a mid-twenties male. been in the restaurant buisness since I could legally do it. Bartended, served tables, served banquets, and cooking.  I really like my job. \n\n\n\nwhen I was eighteen, and not getting enough hours at work, i had the resources to obtain near perfect cocaine, in a part of the US where it is damn near impossible to find anything that hasnt been cut a dozen times. \n\n\n\nI had no problem marking it up 40% after someone tried one line. I've tried some locally sourced blow twice, and both times it burned, and only kept me \"high\" for less than 20 minutes. My source could procure solid, sparkly chunks of smelly, non-stomped cocaine. Completely different high, no burn, lasted a long time, lets you down easy, and great consistency.\n\nI made a killing. I also partied a little bit on the weekends, and built up a fair tolerance to it, but never had a problem saying no, I still to this day have never spent money on it for personal use, and I never crave it when I tell myself I'm done for the night. I never had a problem with going to bed after doing it, or eating. I think I was some sort of cocaine anomally.\n\n\n\nI cut that shit out when I was 20, too much stress and pressure, but I would still use coke maybe once or twice a year, provided it was from my source, it was free, and we were going out for the evening. Everytime I did it, I regretted it the next day. Just that feeling of being worn out and spent, usually accompanied by a vicious hangover.\n\n\n\nI'm telling you all of this, so that you understand that I'm not just going through a really good coke high. this is different. wayyy too long. Not the same effects.\n\n\n\nand yes, I'm retarded for now positively identifying said substance before snorting it.\n\n\nAnyway, here is the text message I started (and eventually did send to my lady):\n\n\nI know you didnt reply because of work and everything, but i'm gonna tell you about this just because I'm on the verge of freaking out, and keeping my mind focused on explaining what the situation is, kind of keeps me calm. occupied.\n\nGet to work at 6am, busiest day of the year for breakfast joints. Sundays are usually jammed regardless, but mothers day just made it worse. My coworker (who i know is involved in some weird shit, drug wise) makes comments about how he has something to help us get through the shift without slowing down. I instantly think its either the really good hash oil I made for him previously, or maybe some blow. I figured I could handle a line or two seeing how as I hadn't done any in a little more than 6 months, and I could use a little extra energy rush through this crazy busy shift.\n\nWe started to get in the weeds starting at 6:30am, right when we open. Full restaurant. I see my sort-of boss-coworker, and my other coworker snort something off a plate. He offers me a line. Im not comepletely sure what it is at this point, so i say \"yes, just give me a few minutes to get some of these orders done.\"\n\nI  was infact balls deep in omelettes and benedicts, but what i really wanted was to gauge their reaction to see what this drug was. \n\nThey act mildly upped, and make remarks about how their faces are numb. I tell myself \"score! cooking while high on coke is fun as shit, and i havent touched that stuff for a long fucking time\". I know I even heard the word \"blow\" a few times. We couldnt talk very loud back there, because our line is basically open to the restaurant. I made the mistake of not opening my mouth for two seconds and asking what this substance was.\n\n\n\n\nI do a little tiny line. I got kind of mad about how small it was, but hey, it's free. It was broken out on a white plate, so I couldn't positively identify the contents, that, and I had to snort it extremely fast. Yes. We were snorting lines behind the line, where customers frequently walk by. W get even more balls deep when the church crowd shows up, right when I finish the line of unidentified narcotics. I start cooking orders, not even remotely paying attention to how I'm feeling. we had every table full, and a line out the door. I'm constantly eating and tasting stuff, so i had no flavor discrimination in mouth or throat, but I did feel my lips going numb.\n\n45 minutes later: We get somewhat of a lull in in the flow of people. We do another line. This time I taste it. It takes vaguely of blow, but does have a slight burn with it, that I am not accustomed to. I'm used to blow that goes down really smooth. I don't really care at this point, thats how busy we were. The place I work it is known as the best place to have breakfast in the city. We had every single chair and stool filled, still with lines of people waiting sometimes more than hour for a table. I witnessed two people just standing by the dish machine and holding their plates while they ate. That busy.\n\nWe all get in this upper fueled zone. No mistakes, food flying out the window faster than it ever has before, good music on the radio, perfect communication and timing between the three of us. If any of you have ever worked food-service, you know the zone. It's unlike anything else, and it doesn't happen often, most certainly not on a day as busy as this.\nWe were blessed by the zone. Otherwise, smart money has it that someone would have lost their job. THAT BUSY.\n\n\n I'm the omelette, poached eggs, salad, cold sandwich, sauce, toast, and general ingredients guy. There is a flat top guy, who runs the grill for all the potatoes, pancakes, french toast, shipwrecks, ect ect but i get all of his ingredients for him, and then there is a guy who calls out the orders and items from the ticket wheel (which was full all day), what both of us need, and runs the fryer, as well as helping the grill guy and myself at the same time.\n\n\nAll three of us, fucked up on drugs, doing said drugs 5 feet away from the people who's food we were preparing. I feel horrible about that last part, but I did insist that we wash our hands after handling/doing any kind of narcotic.\n\n\nIn all, I snorted three small lines of what I assumed was coke. The last line was about an hour before I left work, its been over eleven hours since then. I'm finally starting to come down.\n\nIt's my own fault for assuming, but now I'm accidently high on what I think was cocaine laced with meth.\n\nI am such a fucking idiot. \n\n\nTL;DR accidently snorted meth ( I think).

{"body": "&gt; To me, asking if there is a god is not a stupid or irrelevant question. Not because he necessarily exists, but because there are reasons for us to ask.\n\nYou mean like the Loch Ness monster or Big Foot?  Why is it important?  Empirical testing shows that god does not answer prayer and there is no other effect of his supposed existence.  What possible upside would there be to answering the question, even if it was in the affirmative?\n\n&gt; Of course, that in itself is not a reason to believe in one; but if you want to view religion as a social phenomenon, you probably should be intellectually curious about it.\n\nAsking why people have a delusion is an entirely different question from one that wonders if a particular delusion is true.\n\n&gt; What i tend to see instead is people who have had some disagreeable experience of religion firsthand (particularly Christianity) and then, after rejecting it, they only give backhanded comments about other religions.\n\nI highly doubt that's what actually happens.  A person who loses their faith and seriously considers atheism will go through the process of understanding why atheism is the most sensible position to take on religion -- at which point the other religions are simultaneously rejected for free.\n\n&gt; This I feel will get a lot of comments along the lines of \"i'm not going to waste my time with them\" or \"its going to be the same\".\n\nNo, the problem with other religions is that they are belief with inadequate justifiable reason.  I.e., 1) the onus is on the religion, 2) if any religion were correct, it would be obvious from an examination of nature as it is.\n\n&gt; But it should be remembered, that as atheists, I see a lot of you priding yourself in scientific pursuits, which are objective, whereas comments like these are subjective.\n\nDo you even science?  Science is about falsification, not about object/subjective philosophical nonsense.  The atheist position is inherently falsifiable -- just produce a god or sufficient evidence of one.\n\n&gt; Scientists will spend extreme amounts of time in pursuit of even the smallest variations for scientific accuracy and reliability,\n\nNo -- only if a crucial question relies on this.  The question of god's existence is the least relevant question even theoretically possible.\n\n&gt; and it is my view that many religions of today have earned themselves that same right\n\nLol!  No.  Not one of them has.  They can come to the atheist table if they have something to present, but otherwise there is no onus on atheists to pay any attention to them.\n\n&gt; This is why my path to decide my belief (or lack thereof) is taking so long.

And they can all talk and talk and talk without running out of words to say, when you can get about three sentences out if you're lucky and you've either run out of things to say, or you start waffling and repeating what you've already said, punctuated with ums and ahhs and more repetition of the same tired words that you've said so many times that they're starting to lose their meaning.\n\nAnd yet for some reason you reserve this level of criticism for only yourself, and don't realise that everyone around us is messing up just as much as we are. Those shirts you can't wear, they can wear and they look great. They can talk engagingly and interestingly and you wonder how they possibly got to how they are. You start trying to hang around them more to see if it will rub off on you and you'll start to morph into the interesting adult they are. And it works, at least, at first. But soon you find yourself slipping and you fall back into the hole of knowing the kind of person you really are deep down. If you're embarrassing like me, you may even go to the point of asking them subtly on trying to find out what books they read or what social circles they hang out in or what stores they buy their clothes from or what TV shows they watch. Not because you're interested in getting to know them more, but because you want to absorb all their influences and become like them. \n\nAnd if you're unlucky like me, they'll cotton on pretty quickly, and the one-sided weirdness will become mutual. They'll close up and go on the defensive, and will start bargaining with you every time you ask them something. They'll say \"I just need one thing,\" and you'll desperately plead \"anything,\" to which they'll reply \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" And it'll be around this time that you'll realize that your \"perfect, competent adult\" friend was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten you again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" you'll scream.\n\nAnyway, it's pretty cliched and obvious-sounding, but once we embrace the daily fallibility of ourselves and everyone around us, and give up the obsession with perfection, we can start to live meaningful lives free from this sort of inhibition.

{"body": "At approximately 3:00AM I was driving home from my girlfriend's house. Out of nowhere a car pulls up right next to me on the freeway and the drunk girl in the passenger seat yelled something incomprehensible out her window at me. Puzzled, but mostly apathetic, I smile and nod, and accelerate slightly to not be next to them. As they speed up and pass me, a beer bottle is chucked out their window, mere feet in front of my car. \n\nWithout even thinking, I began to pursue. This was no high speed chase, but it definitely wasn't a casual drive, either. He exited and got back on the freeway multiple times, probably checking to see if I was actually following. Then he took off into some residential areas a few miles from where I lived at the time. He would have lost me, too, if I didn't know the area so well. I was able to take a few shortcuts and meet him again a few blocks after he \"lost me\" more than once. Oh, and because my car was really old and I'd just replaced one of my headlights, my car looked very distinct at night, with one very pale, barely lit headlight, and a comparatively greenish and bright brand new headlight. I like to think he felt like he was in a horror movie, what with my car looking all sinister in his rearview mirror and with me inexplicably showing up at a crossroad on the right when he lost me to the left. \n\nAnyway, eventually he abruptly stopped his car in front of a house that appeared to be pretty full - there were cars everywhere, the lights were on, and music was playing. He stopped in the middle of the street and sprang out of the car, obviously prepared for a fight. He was wearing a wifebeater and those giant jeans that somehow hover at mid-thigh level, and he had that walk people have when they're psyching themselves out and getting ready to throw down. He approached my car, slammed his hands on my hood a couple times, loudly questioning what the hell I wanted. \n\nI put my car in park, turned off my headlights (so he could see I'm just a twiggy white guy), rolled down my passenger window and motioned for him to come to that side of the car. He struts/walks/stomps over, again loudly inquires as to why I'd been following him (which at this point is starting to draw a few people out of the house) and I say in my most earnest and innocently naive voice, \"Oh hey man, what's going on? I didn't catch what your girlfriend said back there, and I figured it was pretty important since she threw that bottle to get my attention, so I wanted to make sure everything was ok.\"\n\nThe relief on his face was priceless as the tough-guy front melted and revealed how scared he'd been. The absolute shock of who I was vs what he expected left him pretty confused as to how to act. Given that I was overly friendly, he kind of just responded in kind. I ended up getting invited inside and joined the house party - which was hosted by several former and active gang members. \n\nAnd that's the story of the night I drank beer over several games of chess with Bloods at a house party I crashed. \n\nTL;DR: Don't worry, there's no tree fiddy here.

It got to a point where in the dream I would realise what was happening, as it was recurring, so I would watch for him, and he wouldnt appear until I looked away. \n\nThe second nightmare also happened in the swimming centre, I would be getting changed, and all of the noise would stop, apart from one noise, which came from a toilet behind me, where at which point a giant crab would come crawling out of the toilet, and start attacking me, I would leave the changing cubicle, and find that the whole swimming centre was infested, and there were lots of dead people. I would run as far away as possible, but there would hunted me down, until I was cornered. I would scream \"What do you want crab monster!?\" and he would simply reply [\"i need about tree fiddy\". It was at that point that I realise the crab was a 6-story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic Era, and I said \"NOT NOW YOU GODDAMN LOCH NESS MONSTER!\"] That didnt actually happen, but the crab simply responded \"You!\" then charge me, at that point I would wake up.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368457938", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Anyways I was your typical naive 19 year old girl strapped for cash to pay for tuition and going out on weekends and this job supposedly tipped well. My manager was a real asshole though. She always treated me like shit and was always on my case about not doing something correctly and threatening to cut money from my paycheck everytime I made a mistake. Anyways it was late one day and I was closing for the night with her and a few other people. After closing she had me stay after the other coworkers had left to talk to her in her office. I fully expected her to fire me at this point so I was kind of angry going into her office. However as soon as I walked in she pushed me against the wall and started kissing my neck. I was pretty freaked out at this point, not only did she not hate me apparently but she was also into other women. I tried to ask wtf she was doing when she started kissing my lips to stop me from speaking. I'll be honest I had a boyfriend at the time but I had kind of been curious about experimenting with other girls since coming to college, so I kind of went with it. We made out for a bit longer and then she pulled me out of my clothes while I stripped her naked. She was only like 3 years older than me but her breasts made me think otherwise, I was a little jealous to be honest. well after more kissing she picked me up and put me on the edge of her desk and  started to eat me out and it felt sooooo good. She kept it up until I came, I was in shock because even though I had had boyfriends before and had sex before, I had never been able to cum. It was amazing. As I was still panting for breath she moved back and let her hair down. \"W-wait what time is it?\" I asked, I had completely lost track of time and my boyfriend would probably worried if i was out too late. \"Why?\" She asked. \"Because my boyfriend must be worried sick by now\" I said, panic starting to set in. \"Hmm\" she said looking at the clock on her phone\". \"Its about tree fiddy\". It was at about this time that I noticed my manager was a 500 foot creature from the paleolithic era.

It's too incompetent.\"\n\nYou are correct, they try to cover things up all of the time and eventually fail. The problem is, after they fail, most people never hear about it or believe it. Tons of people have exposed what they learned within the military/nasa but what reaches the airwaves are ancient aliens episodes about caveman drawings with large heads, and reptilian frankenstiens eating baby brains or greys extracting semen. \n\nNow of course these are people and all testimony is subject to skepticism, no evidence is conclusive because evidence can be faked or misunderstood. I could plant a weapon in your bag and create a video of you holding it, leave the gloves I used in your drawer- and then have my girlfriend give bullshit testimony... so even if I showed you the numerous astronauts who have admitted to seeing UFOs/being briefed on their existence (edgar mitchell/gordon cooper for example) you could say \"damn I guess space makes people crazy\" If I showed you the governor of arizona admitting he was forced to tell the public the Phoneix Lights were flares and that he saw the ship along with tens of thousands of others, and you could say he wanted some press after retiring. No photograph/video/testimony or even tangible evidence would probably sway you unless an alien landed down and handed it to you, so im not trying to persuade you or anyone to outright to believe what I do, I just think its much more effective to give any idea no matter how crazy some consideration instead of scoffing it as batshit. Im guilty of it too sometimes and if anything im sharing self criticism to anyone making the same mistake.\nIf I told you I believed in the loch ness monster, and you told me you believed I was an idiot, you might get a laugh and you'd even be correct- but if you gave me 1 minute of your time to explain how the entire lake has been sweeped thoroughly with radar and that most tourists get black out drunk when they visit scotland, you might still hurt my feelings a little but you would have convinced me. This is difficult in this discussion because aliens would be more intelligent than us and therefore can't be caught in a cage like other new species we find in jungles, so its a much more difficult thing to disprove (like disproving the existence of A god instead of easily refuting the absurd claims of a particular sacred text, you cant prove a negative but you can disprove a positive) Which is why I dont give you the burdon of proof, I just would rather you be less certain about something so mysterious. You could debunk every photo and every claim but lets not pretend we know for certain that we're alone in a seemingly infinite multi-verse.

If scientists assumed any observation with more than 50 people claiming to have seen the same thing reliable, scientists would believe the loch ness monster and bigfoot exist.  \n\n&gt;because only scientists were considered to be reputable witnesses.\n\nThere is a very good reason for this.  Sailors have been notoriously superstitious for centuries.  They also claimed to have seen mermaids, sirens, and poseidon.  Should we believe those accounts despite an utter lack of empirical evidence?  Of course not.  A claim is not to be believed until evidence is presented that it does.  That is all.  \n\n&gt;There are many trained observers - people with MDs and PhDs who know a thing or two about science and they believe that there is an afterlife and a God. Why don't you believe them? They're scientists.\n\nThey don't believe in god *because* of the scientific method.  They believe it in *spite* of it.  The claims of the existence of a deity are not testable, so they can not be demonstrated true or false by science.  If a scientist had credible evidence that a god of any kind existed, and it can pass peer review and publish, the Academy of Sciences would no longer be 95% atheist.  Until they do, there is no reason to buy their beliefs.  As of yet, no such evidence exists.  The scientists you speak of don't apply the scientific method to the idea of a god.  If they did, they would have no choice but to disbelieve, because the scientific method doesn't make claims without supporting evidence.\n\n&gt;there is plenty of documented evidence for all kinds of things that people like you refuse to believe because you reject the premise and therefore assume that any and all evidence that goes against your beliefs is fabricated.\n\nI am going to go out on a *crazy* limb here and guess that the \"evidence\" you think you have would not fall under the category of credible empirical scientific evidence.\n\n&gt;You aren't really interested in science, you are only interested in the science that falls in line with what you already believe to be true.

Then it grew back (she started wearing a wig) so I thought everything was fine and mommy was almost well.\n\nWe went to Cancun for a vacation about a year later.  I had no idea that this was my dad's way of making the most of my mom's time left alive.  I was 5.  I didn't know any of that shit.  I just wanted to swim and eat yummy food.  Mom spent very little time out on the beach with me though.  My dad went to breakfast with my two foster sisters one morning while mom and I were still asleep and I woke up to her violently shaking.  I had no idea what was going on and I ran to get help.  No one at the hotel spoke English that I could find and I got lost.  Eventually I found my dad and told him and when we got there, mom was asleep, woke up and had no recollection of her shaking. \n\nShe saw a doctor in Cancun and they said they couldn't do much for her and they'd treat her when we got back to the US.\n\nA month or two after we got back home my mom went to the hospital.

{"body": "Okay, this is going to sound strange but hear me out. I was about seven or eight at the time and had just moved with my mom and brother to a new house in Connecticut. We had been living there for about six months at the time and I had started going to grade school there, meeting new friends and what have you. \n\nSo this one friend named Pico who lived down the street from me started hanging out at my house more and more as time went on. He was a nice kid, very shy and well behaved, but he always wore Velcro shoes which I thought was odd since that was what little kids wore in my mind. I would tease him about it and he would just tell me to not worry about it. I didn’t think much of it at the time.\n\nOne afternoon after school, we were walking home together and we see a bright green car parked on the street about half a block ahead of us. I mean like really bright, like neon, which is why it stood out to us. We joked with each other that whoever is driving that thing must be radioactive or something. As we got closer, we realized that there was a woman sitting in the driver’s seat because we saw her move her head. It seemed odd to us that she was just sitting there at 3 in the afternoon, especially since we had never seen this car in the many weeks we had been walking home this way. \n\nWe approached the car and as we did, she sees us and gets out. She was about 30 or 35 from what I remember and was kind of pretty in a young Sally Field sort of way. Anyway, she approaches me and Pico and asks us if we know who lives at the house she is parked in front of. We tell her we don’t and she continues to ask us if we have ever seen another woman going into the house. Again, we say that we haven’t paid much attention. \n\nAround this time, we notice that she’s fidgeting with something behind her back and Pico asks her what she’s got. She pulls out a small handgun and shows it to us. We should have been scared but she calmly explained that she carried it for protection and only adults are allowed to carry them. We asked if she was a police woman and she laughed. \n\nWe thought she was kind of pretty and now we thought she was cool for showing us a gun so we didn’t think anything of it when she asked us if we wanted a ride to our houses. We joked with her and said okay, but asked if we would get killed from radioactive stuff in the bright green car. She got a serious look on her face and just told us to get in the car without really answering our question. \n\nLooking back on it now, I was a very lucky kid because my house happened to be closest so I asked her to drop me off first. Normally, Pico would have just hung out at my house until his mom got home but he must have been captivated by this woman because when she asked him if he wanted to go to his house he said yes. \n\nI never saw Pico again. A few days later our teacher came in crying and said she had some bad news for us. She told us Pico was missing and asked if any of us might have heard from him. I raised my hand and told her that I was walking home with him the other day and he’s probably sick with radiation poisoning from the neon green car. She got a weird look on her face and asked me to come with her to the principal’s office. \n\nInside the office, there was a policeman and our school principal. I was very nervous about being in the principal’s office and even more nervous when the policeman said he wanted to ask me some questions. I think I started to cry a little and he bent down to reassure me that I wasn’t in trouble. He asked me about the last time I saw Pico and I told him about the woman in the car. I remember he wrote down a lot of notes and then proceeded to ask me if I had heard from Pico since that day. I told him I had not. Then, with a very serious look on his face, he said he needed about tree fiddy. \n\nIt was at that time that I noticed the policeman was actually a giant seven story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. I said, “Dammit, monster, you quit bugging me! This is my lunch money and if I don’t get two chocolate milks I’m gonna be pissed off!” At that, he slumped back into the water and I never saw him again. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368544574", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -9, "controversiality": 0}

I didn't actually have a fake ID on me because I lived in Kansas and at that time, Kansas had really horrible IDs with almost no security precautions on them whatsoever. So I could do stupid things like changing a \"1977\" to \"1972\" with a stroke of a pen. \n\nYou'd think this wouldn't work, but it got me in everywhere. Everywhere. Bars. Las Vegas. Even fooled a cop once when I forgot about it and he stopped me. He wrote me a warning with 1972 on it! Damn, wish I'd kept that.\n\nSo I'm in this bar and I'm dancing to the music. Something random I assume, like, the Fugees. Because it's 1996 and the fucking Fugees are playing every goddamned place. Probably mixed with some random background techno beat, with Pulp Fiction quotes mixed in for good measure.\n\nSo I'm in this bar and I see a girl across the way. My heart immediately starts pounding at about twice its speed. She's beautiful in a nerdy sort of way. She's got glasses, which I'm an absolute sucker for. And she's got on a T-shirt for Magic the Gathering. Magic the Gathering! In a nightclub! So maybe it's the four glasses of tequila sunrise I've had (don't ask.) but I just know I need to go talk to her. \n\nI slide my way over. Which isn't easy because there are people jam packed around. The place is hopping. It's made even more difficult because everyone is sweating the place up and I don't want to get other people's body fluids on me as I'm trying to chat a new girl up. Kind of a rule I have.\n\nSo I'm almost to her when a guy from my dorm freshman year tackles me. He's drunker than I am and thought it would be fucking hilarious to do this. I go sliding to the ground. My tequila sunrise goes splashing everywhere (again. Don't ask). And when I get up, the girl is nowhere to be seen.\n\nFucking A.\n\nI nearly kill this dude. He's always been an annoying prick and this was icing on the cake. the only thing that stopped me was the bouncers coming towards us anyway to see what the commotion was. Also, the other thing that stopped me was he quickly apologized in a drunken slur and said he scored some killer weed and I could have some.\n\nIt wasn't the girl. But it was something. \n\nSo we get out of the stupidly hot and loud club and start walking down the street and this dude sees a hot dog vendor and goes absolutely apeshit. You've never seen a guy want a hotdog as much as he did.\n\nSo we wander by the place and the guy orders an extra large with relish and I'm about to order when I get this tap on my shoulder.\n\nIt's the girl from the nightclub! She saw me in line for a hot dog and came by to say hi! I was staring at her for a few seconds (or maybe a few minutes) trying to think of what to even begin to say, when I got another tap on my shoulder.\n\nIt was the kid again. He didn't have money for a hot dog. What a scumbag.\n\nSo I ask the vendor what was owed and the guy looked at me and said \"I need about tree fitty.\"\n\nWell it was about this time I realized that this hot dog vendor wasn't no ordinary vendor. He was 50 feet tall and lived in a lake. God damnit. I'm here trying to talk to the girl of my dreams and the goddamned Loch Ness Monster has to come and cockblock my scene.\n\nI turn around to the girl, but it was too late. She was already gone. Scared off, I assume. Ol' Nessy will do that.\n\nBut I'll never forget that night. Or that girl. Or those tequila sunrises (don't ask). Or that hot dog. Because without it, I wouldn't have this story to tell. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368554674", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

I would have led a happy life except for the past one year.  So here I was, a rope tied around my neck dressed in my favorite T-shirt and shorts, standing upon a chair ready to experience it.

Are you ready for knowledge? ...\" I gestured him to stop and said I did not want a dictionary as I will be leaving this world shortly.

After watching him leave our house, I locked the door and climbed back on the chair.\n\nI thought about everything in my life... the happy moments, the sad times, the day I had got admitted to a premier school, the first day I had a ride in my father's car..... all of the moments flashed before my eyes.

It was time.\n\nI tightened the noose around my neck. It dug in, and I felt it on my wind pipe. Breathing was somewhat difficult now, but I persisted. Did I really want to die? Yes, I told myself and closed my eyes and kicked the chair. With a gentle 'thud' I heard the chair fall and suddenly my breathing had become lot more difficult.

St Patrick got rid of snakes, St columba was raising people from the dead every other day and fighting the Loch Ness Monster. St Brigid could perform magical abortions. The miracles in the haigeographies of early saints would make Jesus look like a party clown.\nThe great feats of the pre-christian heroes were also preserved by the Christian monks, for example Fionn MacCumhall dug a lump of sod out his his hand and flung it into the ocean. The sod became the Isle of Man and the hole filled with water and became Lough Neagh, Ireland's largest lake.\n\nAlso, the St Patrick myth is not the only one which explains the lack of snakes in Ireland. From Leabhar Gabhala Eireann (the Book of invasions c. 1159 AD)\n\n&gt;in that very night a serpent stung the little son that had been born to [Nel], to wit Gaedil Glas, and death was near to him.

{"body": "When I was 20, I started dating a girl who there was instant chemistry with. We had similar interests, a similar outlook on life, and she was low-maintenance. I swore after the first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance. \nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. \n\nI won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable. \n\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime. \n\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives. \nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\" \nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\" \n\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed. \nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that.

{"body": "We guessed the paper might create some buzz [although we were taken aback by just how much]. So we wrote a [FAQ](http://gcbias.org/european-genealogy-faq/) on the paper, as a way of addressing many of the questions about the basic results in what we hoped was a more transparent style. Having done this, I think it is a really nice intermediate step between the paper, which is necessarily technical in places, and news reports, which are necessarily somewhat superficial. I'd definitely do it again for such a paper, as I think it really paid off. \n\nIn general I think scientists should be doing more writeups of their work as blog posts, popular science articles, etc. This could take the form of FAQs, or any format they want. Obviously we are not all great at popular science writing, I for one am not a great writer. However, we often are the people with the best understanding of the implications of our results for everyday life.Too often we, as scientists, complain about press reports on science and the public's perception of science, but without trying to engage in a meaningful way (I'm definitely guilty of this too).  As such we really should be putting our work out there, in as many different formats as we can. \n\nWe've also been working to help folks get early access to science, and open up the process of the discussion of science, through pushing for preprints. A [preprint](http://haldanessieve.org/faq/#q1) is where scientists release their work before publication through open preprint servers such as the arXiv. We've created a site ([Haldane's sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/)) to publicize these to other scientists (and the public), and to allow a site for scientists to talk about their work early on through blog posts (see [here](http://haldanessieve.org/category/our-paper/)). \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368720349", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

She agrees, and we meet at my hotel.  She was quite the looker - which was a nice surprise.  I was expecting much different.

{"body": "So, I think most of the traditional theistic arguments are quite bad, confuse terms, make inferences that can't be made, and are full of faulty reasoning.  *That being said,* I think a lot of the ways these arguments define God and the concepts they employ are quite good.  For example, I think Anselm's definition of God, \"A being than which none greater can be conceived,\" is a great definition (I actually think it leads to a sort of panentheism).\n\nHere's a few characteristics a naturalized God might be able to have:\n\n1.) The object of ultimate faith.  I can have faith in lots of things.  I can have faith that the Loch Ness Monster exists, but this is probably a pretty silly sort of faith.  If God exists, and I have faith in him, it’s part of the concept of God that this *isn’t* silly faith—it’s faith of a different sort than faith in the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n2.) The existence of him is *redemptive truth.*  To believe in “redemptive truth,” as described (and vehemently rejected) by Richard Rorty is to believe that there is “a natural terminus to inquiry, a way things really are, and that understanding what that way is will tell us what to do with ourselves.”  To know God is to know the truth, not just on the ultimate nature of what *is,* but also on the ultimate nature of what we *ought to do with ourselves.*\n\n3.) Perfect simplicity.\n\n4.)  The three omni's, but inverted (in the way I mentioned in the above comment), such that rather than God being \"all knowing\" in the standard sense, he is the ultimate grounds for any knowledge (and the same with goodness and action).  Important point here: obviously I wouldn't think that one would need to believe in God in order to know anything or be good, it's just that I'd interpret the knowledge and goodness of people as being a reflection of God.  \n\nCertainly, I'd have to do some explaining and justifying to argue that these things are something that a naturalism-friendly entity can have, but if that is possible, then these are some pretty God-like characteristics.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368737275", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My wife and I had planned for months to go to this fancy restaurant for our anniversary, but our babysitter decided not to show up. In a rush, we went on Craigslist and phoned up the one of the first babysitters we saw. He looked like a nice, clean young man that seemed to have a good background with kids and we thought it would be safe to leave our son with him. \n\nSo about halfway through the dinner, we get a call from our 5 year old son crying that he is scared and we need to get home. However the call was interrupted by someone yelling \"WHERE DID YOU GET THAT!\" And what sounded like someone grabbing the phone from him and hanging up. Scared out of our minds, my wife and I rushed home as fast as we could to see what happened (silly us didn't call 911.) \n\nWhen we walked in the home, we were greeted by that same babysitter holding a gun to my sons head, threatening to kill him. He said as long as we 'help him out', he would let my son live. When I asked what exactly he meant by 'helping him out', he said he was flat broke and needed money. I would easily give up everything I own to save my son's life, so I asked him exactly how much he needed. This sick fucker smirked, and replied \"About tree fiddy\" Thats when I realized this 'babysitter' was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. This goddamn Loch Ness monster had tricked me again! But unfortunately I had no choice but to give him his money. Needless to say, after that night I never trusted anyone I met off the internet, and only hired babysitters I know.\n\nTLDR: I hired a babysitter off the internet, it turned into a hostage situation.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368765757", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 526, "controversiality": 0}

She seemed undaunted, and the girls were excited as all heck to have her there, so we thought why not?\n\nFlash forward to three hours later, when we come home to the four year old running around the house screaming and half naked (way past her bedtime) and the babysitter shouting at the 7 year old through the locked bathroom door, looking as if she's aged a decade in a night. We felt terrible, and my wife swooped in to save the day, as I took the babysitter home, reassuring her it wasn't her fault and all that jazz.\n\nNow she only lived about a five minute walk down the road, but it being dark I thought the responsible thing to do would be to drive this newly mentally rattled young kid back home. When I got to her house I broke out the wallet to pay her, and told her she deserved a tip for the trouble she had gone through, and really helping us out at the last minute. She said the she only needed about tree fiddy.

She wasn't super pretty or hot or anything, but she definitely wasn't ugly either. What really attracted me to her was her personality, everything about her was interesting and I just couldn't get enough.\n\nHer dad was the manager at the local Mercedez-Bens dealership and one night she stole the keys to the place and we went there and got inside. There was this beautiful car, I don't even know what model or what but it was a gorgeous blue colored convertible and we hopped inside and were just chilling and being happy. She leaned over and kissed me and one thing lead to another and we were undressed and she was on top of me in the passenger seat.\n\nIt was crazy. I had never had sex before and I had no idea what to expect, but it was amazing. She absolutely loved it and I was driving her crazy with pleasure. After riding me for a while she opened the door, grabbed my hand, and pulled me out. I followed her to the hood of the car and she bent over and I fucked her doggy style. That perfectly washed and waxed car had some pretty obvious hand prints spread across the hood by the time we were done.\n\nAnyway, were fucking right, and she's telling me \"faster, faster\" and so I oblige and she's screaming and telling me she's going to cum and then I realize I am too and we both finish within a few seconds of each other and I just stayed inside her in the amazing moment.\n\nSuddenly there were loud sirens and 3 cop cars pulled into the dealership parking lot. We freaked the fuck out, we must've set off a silent alarm or something, and scrambled to get dressed and get away. In that moment of terror she told me she needed me to do something, a favor she said. \"What do you need?\" I asked. She yelled, \"I need about tree-fiddy!\" And then ran out the back door half naked. Wait a minute I thought... Tree fiddy? That god damn Loch Ness monster had tricked me again! I yelled back \"Damnit Nessie, I ain't got no tree-fiddy!\" I never saw her again but I ended up taking the blame for breaking into the car dealership and worked a *lot* of hours of community service.\n\nTl;dr - got laid in a car dealership, afterwards not so good", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368805009", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -31, "controversiality": 0}

I started thinking about trying to get a girl to come back to my room with me, even though I had a girlfriend. Fuck it, I thought.\n\n So I walk up to the nearest girl, and grab her ass.

She was making really loud and strange noises, but I could care less, all I know is I was making her scream.\n\nSo I wake up in bed with her, and she's under the covers. I hear her yawn, an she says, \"last night was so amazing.\" At this point, I'm extremely curious as to who the hell she is.

It's crowded, but we get our own front yard and it's close enough to our respective places of employment.\n\nMy fiance, at the time girlfriend, enjoyed gardening. She loved to plant flowers in front of our stoop because it's her and mine first house purchase and she really wanted to make it a home. I supported her in doing so because I thought it looked nice when I got home from work every day.\n\nNow my neighbors from across the street were a much older couple than us, and they had a pair of very rowdy younger boys. I absolutely couldn't stand these two kids. They were constantly shouting in the street, and throwing balls into ours and our neighbors yards. They would just trample all over ours and everyone else's yards. My fiance had to mend her gardening countless times because these stupid kids wouldn't be responsible on anyone else's property.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was when these kids were playing with those little stress-relief balls you can buy various places. The ones that were filled with sand. Well these kids were running around in the street throwing them at each other! I was surprised they never got hurt pulling this crap. Well one of them threw it at the other, but threw waaaay too hard and way too high, and it ended up hitting our front window and falling into my fiance's garden. I got fed up and ran out the door just as the kid stepped onto my lawn. I shouted at him \"No! Get out of here! I'm tired of you brats trampling all over my yard!\" I wanted to say something harsher, but they were just kids, you know? Well when I shouted at him, he definitely got scared. His eyes got all big and watery and he started to whimper back \"B-but.. B-but..\" I knew what he wanted. He wanted his stupid projectile back, but I wanted to make him say it. \"What is it? What do you need?\" He continued to look at me, and I could tell he was about to cry as he said \"I need about tree fidy.\" At this point I realized that the kid was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era! I shouted back \"God dammit Nessie! I ain't given you no tree fidy!\"\n\n**TL;DR**: If you fuck with my fiance's garden, I will make you cry.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368834166", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

They started getting it on when he went into the bathroom to but a condom on. When he came out he found her spread eagle on the bed jerking her clit. Apparently this was his first time dating someone with this clit and it was shocking for him.

Initially we landed on the surface, but our actual goal was a teleportation hub that would take us aboard the Citadel, which had been moved to the Sol system by the reapers. After hours of tough fighting, we finally made it to the \"space elevator,\" and the surviving ground forces made a massive push to get inside... Unfortunately, the reaper Harbinger was waiting for us... and wiped out almost all of us, and severly wounding me. With the few survivors making a hasty retreat, I hobbled forward into the elevator beam, ascending into the anchient space station... Once inside, I made my way to an obersavation area of sorts. There I found my brother in arms Admiral Anderson... and the Illusive Man. TIM, showing visible signs of indoctrination, tried to get me to join him on his power trip to reaper-induced omnipotence. I politely declined, instead offering him a bullet. By this point, I blacked out from blood loss... Everything was going dark... But then I felt something... I was rising... my eyes opened and... I was in space. I was laying on the outer hull of the citadel. In front of me, there was a ghastly hologram of a boy. A boy I saw die six months prior. He told me that the cycle could not go on as it always had, and that my presence there was proof that it had to be stopped. Weakly, I asked him: \"what do I need to do... What do I need to do to convince you to stop slaughtering us?\" He grew quiet... and he finally responded \"I need... about tree fiddy.\" Now it was ABOUT THAT TIME that I realized this little hologram boy was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the paedodoic era. I said \"Goddamit you Loch Ness monster! I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!!\" Then the monster stooped down and told me, rather unceremoniously, to fornicate myself. Then he pushed a button and all the reapers stopped shooting, and then the reaper fleet flew off into the unknown regions never to be seen again. Some say the Loch Ness Monster is leading them to another galaxy. I don't really give a shit, maybe the dumb monster will find his OWN goddam tree fiddy and stop bothering ME about it. \n\nAnyway, that's why I have this username. \n\n**TL;DR I MAKE SEX TO ALIEN CHICKS** ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368847616", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Now, I'm not saying that this never happens, but... again, it's generally a bad idea, because you really don't know what might happen. But, being depressed with the fact that I essentially hadn't earned *any* money that night, I said fuck it, and took him up on his offer, and followed him back to his place.\n\nThe place was filthy, which already got me worried. He was cleanly dressed, but the place sure didn't suggest that was his normal behavior. After closing the front door - I'm still looking around at the disaster of his living room and kitchen - he asks, \"Could you do me a favor?\" \"Proooobably\", I replied. \"Can I borrow about tree fiddy?\". \"W-what?\" I replied, trying to look back at him but not being able to turn my head around all the way. That's when I see - in the reflection of a dirty glass - that he isn't actually a cute ginger, but in fact a 2 1/2 ton mystical legendary creature: the loch ness monster! I quickly grabbed my purse which was close by on the floor, shouting at the beast \"God damn it Nessie! You know I don't have no motherfuckin' tree fiddy! Get the fuck out of here!\", bolted for the nearest window which was fortunately open, and escaped.

She would physically flirt with me a LOT in my class (massages, grabbing my hand, playing with my hair) and she always ambushed me for a hug in the halls. Every Friday she'd ask me if I had plans for the night, and every time I say not yet, she tells me that she already is doing something. This one weekend, however, she was free and we arranged for her to come to my house when my parents weren't home.\n\nShe arrived that night around 7ish, and my parents wouldn't be getting home til 12 or later, so we had plenty of time to fool around. I put in a movie (Shawshank Redemption FTW), and we watched the first 30ish minutes cuddling together (lel). Then she went in for the kiss. We madeout for about 15 minutes before things escalated. She had her hand in my pants and I had my hand in hers. After all of this it was only 9:20, and she was planning to stay over til at least 11, so we finished Shawshank with some make out action in between scenes. She left and I was feeling great about myself because she told me how much fun she had/how good I am at kissing, etc.\n\nThe next day she didn't return my call, and me being the non clinger that I am, I just decided to hang out with the boys for the day. We played some football, etc etc. Not really part of the story. On Sunday she told me that she wasn't sure if she wanted to be more than friends, and I was pretty bummed. Come Monday, however, she was back to her old flirty ways. She was being WAY more touchy than usual though, which was awesome. Today, she rode home with me (parents again aren't home), and we made out for a while and she stuck her hand in my pants, only to take her hand out and tell me she had to leave. We stopped at a gas station on the way home and she asked me for some money for a soda.\n\n\"How much you need?\" I asked\nShe looks at me, and I shit you not, she says \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it was about that time I noticed this \"girl\" was about eight stories tall and was a Crustracean from the Paleolithic Era.\nI said \"Dangit monster! Get out of my car! I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\nIt said \"How bout just two fiddy?\"\n\"Now it's only two fiddy? What is there a sale on Lochness munchies or somethin'?\n\ngeez, I was angry.

{"body": "Imagine a fourth dimensional view of three dimensional matter as kind of a worm. We only perceive three dimensions, even though we live in a fourth dimension. We only see the present section of 3D matter in 4D (time). But in 4D reality, 3D matter is tailing indefinitely backwards, and perhaps indefinitely forward. It would resemble a twisty ribbon-like noodle. \n\nA fifth dimensional view would be outside the realm of time. It would be dark, as light reacts in a 3D environment. If you could see light in a 5D environment, you would see it from beginning to end all at once, experiencing it's entire pathway from birth to retina as if it were one instant. You would see the entirety of human history, planetary history, and solar system history as one solid worm, writhing and twisting about through eons of space. But you would see it all at once. If you even saw the light it produced. More than likely, you would feel and hear 3D matter and light as waves and pulses. You would be washed in the song of the cosmos, and as time would have no meaning to you, as you are outside of it now, you would pass over that dark void of chaos and purgatory into the universe's birth into the sixth dimension. \n\nIn the sixth dimension, you'll experience 3D matter and space from every direction, both inside and out. Light and heat and sound will reverberate inside and out, as you experience time come to a halt, but motion and friction collide all around you unceasingly. There is no possible way to not feel anything other than pain and disjointed confusion in this realm. It is the literal stopping point of the universe. It is the inevitable end of all things, because time is ended and meaningless here. \n\nIt is an object and an experience as basic to you as the surface of a sheet of paper. You can look at it, but you see it from the inside out and the outside in at the same time, from the beginning to the end all at one point. It's like a mathematical point in space. Wholly target-able, but entirely intangible. If that makes any sense at all. In the sixth dimension, time is a building block of your existence, in the same way atoms are to us right now in the third. However, time does not pass in the sixth dimension, because it has nothing to move through. Right now in the third dimension, time is like a railway line that matter passes over. It's like a stream bed, and matter is like water coursing over it. In the sixth dimension, time is like the water, and matter is like the water, but there is no stream bed. This is the point where everything ends.\n\nExcept it doesn't. There's a seventh dimension where time sits in the middle and can be perceived from beginning to end. Instead of looking like a noodle, it looks like a bubble. And everything inside of it, from the beginning of the universe to the end of the universe (in 3D space) can be observed. And it's beautiful. And time has meaning, but no authority in the 7th dimension, because matter and it's movement can already be understood from an outside perspective. Seen at every angle. Every facet. It is the true halting point of energy. It's the absolute zero of the universe's charge. And it is the birth of the next one.\n\nAnd it's basically then that you realize that time and space is a 300 foot tall loch ness monster and it's asking you to give it back that tree fiddy you owe it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368855258", "subreddit": "science", "score": 26, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was around the age of 8, in the peak of my childhood. Spring had been underway; the trees were blossoming, bees were buzzing, and the cool breeze and warm air made the perfect environment for youthful adventures.\n\nMy best friend and I were at the park, enjoying the weather, throwing a baseball, playing on the playground. I had been going back and forth on the monkey bars like I was, well, a primate. My friend, however, could barely make it halfway across without falling. Annoyed by my gloatingly graceful graze across the bars, he decided to one-up me in a way. \"Hey Niggalis Cage, I dare you to jump off the monkey bars!\" I was not one to turn down a dare, and my spirits were too high to get plunged by my best friend making fun of me for being chicken, so I gulped and accepted his dare.\n\nOnce I was on top of the monkey bars, I could tell that this wasn't the smartest thing I would ever do. If it weren't for my best friend egging me on, I would have been able to avoid this whole mess. I bucked up and leaped off the monkey bars. The second and a half before I hit the ground was the most suspenseful and fearful moment of my entire life.\n\nAs I hit the ground, I felt something in my ankle snap. Here's where it starts to get ugly. I looked down to my foot, and saw that a bone in my ankle had punctured my skin and was sticking out. I immediately began to go into shock. \"Got up, you pansy!\" My friend shouted. However, once he came over to me and saw my ankle, he screamed and vomited on the ground. Then he screamed some more. Drenched in sweat and fading out, I told him to call 9-1-1. He must have not heard me, because all he could do was keep screaming and crying.\n\nLuckily, a woman who was on an afternoon walk came running to my friend and I, and asked us what she could do to help. Here's where it gets even uglier. My best friend collected himself and swallowed his saliva, and told the woman, \"Well, first, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time that I realized that my best friend was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. The damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster, I ain't given you no tree fiddy,\" the woman screamed.\n\nI never spoke to my best friend after that incident at the park. The woman was able to call an ambulance and bring me to safety. I still have quite an impressive scar on my ankle from the bone itself and surgery. I was never able to thank her properly, and that is most likely my biggest regret in life.\n\nTL;DR I learned something new about my best friend at the park.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368892202", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I got a switchblade comb that looked similar to the ones at http://www.switchbladecombs.com (sorry, I'm on my phone). On the bus ride back me and my friends were sitting near the back. I was messing around with it, and one of my friends wanted to see. I flipped it like a badass so that the part where the comb comes out was facing me, and held it out to her with my hand closed. She pulled it, and one of those little metal things you can see near the comb sliced open my middle finger, almost to the bone. It didn't hurt very much for some reason, so I didn't notice it until I opened my hand. Everyone who was looking at me flipped their shit, and I was the only one who remained calm. I said something along the lines of \"Oh shit. I should probably get help now.\" I went towards the front of the bus, and explained that I probably needed medical help. I was told to just hold tight for a few minutes until we got back. When we got back, I told the nurse, and she said I probably needed stitches. My mom picked me up, and I went to the emergency room, where they pumped my finger full of anesthetic until it was at least 2 inches in diameter (which was ironically the most painful part of this whole thing). I got two stitches, and was the center of attention for the next few days. The best part is, the stitches cost upwards of $2000, and the comb only cost about tree fiddy.

{"body": "I'll never forget what happened. It's kind of a long story, so forgive me for the long read. Ok, so; I was 23, and I was just starting out on my career as a Foreign Services Officer. For those of you who don't know, it's a government job, and you work in embassies and stuff. I was working at the American embassy in Hong Kong. There are markets there that sell cheap knockoff clothes and things that are made in the mainland; think Nike, LV, etc... I had a little extra money so I liked going there and buying things on the weekends. This one seller noticed I came back often, so he offered to give me a discount for my frequent service, but I had to buy from him. I was okay with that, and I got some good deals for a few months. We weren't really friends, but he valued my patronage. Anyways, this one day I went into his shop (think of a store at a mall, but smaller), and he's with two other guys in suits. He's talking with them, and when he sees me, he points at me and mutters something in Cantonese; I think it was 'that's him.' I asked what was going on, but the two guys grabbed me and covered my mouth. We went into the back room of his store, and there was a young Chinese girl tied to a chair and her mouth was covered. I was tied to a chair next to hers, and they pointed a small handgun at my head and started asking me questions in broken English. Apparently someone, rumored to be American, had given an anonymous tip that a cargo crate with counterfeit Air Jordan shoes was coming into HK from the mainland, and the authorities found it and disposed of the shoes. The man (a hired thug) said his boss lost around $400,000 USD. I was absolutely terrified, but I did my best to explain to him that I had no idea what happened and that I didn't snitch on anyone. Maybe he didn't understand me or didn't believe me or something, but he got even more angry. The thug with the gun pointed it right at my forhead and started yelling. All the while, the seller just sheepishly grinned at me and the girl tied next to me was just shaking and listening to the whole thing. The guy realized I knew Cantonese and asked me, \"Do you know how much we lost, you pig?! Either you give me something, or I'm going to splatter the wall with your brains!\" I nervously asked him what it was what that he wanted, and he suddenly became completely calm and replied, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" Well, it was about that time I realized this angry thug was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said, \"Damn it monster, leave me alone! I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nTL; DR- Got falsely accused of being a snitch, threatened at gunpoint.

{"body": "&gt; Things may be logical but that is an assessment of an intelligent mind.\n\nAnd an assessment that we operate as if it is an objective truth.  Merely having this conversation presumes that, despite our potential for differences in brain chemistry, there is a real right and a real wrong, and that truth is knowable.\n\nI'm familiar with the evolutionary take on morality.  I do my best to keep up with science publications, many of which attempt to explain such things.  However, I'm not as concerned with what evolutionists profess, but rather how they live, and the only humans I can find who truly live out the implications of subjective morality are what medical professionals would label as sociopaths.\n\nYou're right, the New Testament does not contain the phrase, \"Rape is wrong\".  Jesus never used the word rape, as far as I know.  The truth is, his moral commandments went so far above and beyond rape that it's unthinkable to be familiar with them and even try to argue that he did not object to it.  In Mathew 5:28, he said, \"I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\"  So based on Jesus' standard, even entertaining the thought of sex outside of marriage is a sin.  I hear arguments like these all the time, and it's sad, but all I can do is realize what a machine of ignorance perpetuation media like this and do my small part to rectify it.  \n\nYes, I keep using the word immaterial, because that's what laws are.  They are not physical things that can be sensed.  They are constraints on physical things that tell us how we must (in the case of physical laws) or ought to (in the case of logical and moral laws) operate.\n\nI'm not going to defend the Hovinds.

Then that got boring so I started throwing here around, changing positions aggressively, pinning her against things etc, until that type of sex was all we did anymore. \"Love making\" just didn't cut it for her anymore. Again, I could tell she wanted even more intensity. So one time we're in the middle of fucking doggy-style and I spin her around, and backhand her across the face. She came instantly, and then another four times after that (our record). \n\nHer tastes seemed to grow even darker after she wanted me cover her mouth while I banged her.

I broke up with her instantly and she went batshit fucking crazy. Broke my things, trashed my apartment. That was all fine.

I had no phone and not a lot of people knew the shortcut. Thank god I had a spare canister of gas, but before I remembered I had it I was already waiting for like an hour. So I fill up my tank and speed it to the market. The market was closed of course. I was really pissed and needed to vent some frustration. So I drove back into town, through some shady area. And like out of f*king nowhere this guy just starts slowly walking next to my car and tapping on the glass. I  opened the window and asked what he wanted. He asked if I wanted to hire one of his \"assistants\". Since I had the money left from what I would have spent on the market I said fuck it payed the man the last 50$ I had on me and he gave me a key to a room. I walk up to this shitty building, I was about to turn around when this girl walks up behind me and asks if i'm here for her \"services\". So I'm thinking to myself this is messed up but whatever I already paid for it. So I go in lay on the bed and she gets undressed.

One night my mom and dad go to their school reunion (they both met in school). I sat down watching T.V. while my sister is upstairs doing whatever. Out of no where, sister comes into the living room wearing barely anything.\n\nI got so fucking hard. She sits next to me, my boner showing no signs of stopping. I can't help it and keep staring at her boobs, they're so fucking huge. So I talk to her about her day and, just casual . When out of nowhere she rests her shoulder on me and strokes my hand.\n\nI stare at her in the eyes and smile. She smiles back. I've been drinking a bit, so I try and make a move, knowing I can blame it on the vodka I've been drinking. Funnily enough she fucking let's me.\n\nI begin groping her boobs and I swear - I'm about to cum in my fucking pants. She pulls away and says she can't. I ask her if it's because we're brother and sister. She says no, because she needs something first. \"Anything,\" I say grabbing both of her hands.\n\nShe stares deeply into my eyes and in the most seductive way.\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNow it was about this time I realized this beautiful sister of mine was a 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Well, this one time me and my buddies were on a camping trip. I'll call them Fred and Jeff. So we all pack up everything and get ready to go, each person was in charge of bringing certain things. Personally I was in charge of making sure we had enough food, smores, hot dogs, firewood, that sort of thing, Jeff took care of our fishing supplies and Fred took care of the tent stuff. So we drive out to the campsite and set up camp. We only had 3 days there so we wanted to make the best of our time (Jeff's wifey is kind-of the strict type). We're out at this campsite for a few hours and we notice that there is only us and one other group camping in the vicinity. Lo-and-behold, we find out that the other group is a group of 5 reasonably hot college girls on a summer-getaway. Jeff was the only single one of the group so me and Fred were pretty stoked. The next day we go over and greet them. Me and Fred aren't EXTREMELY attractive guys, but for whatever reason these four girls (one of them was out on a run when we went over) found us pretty damn interesting. They were laughing at our stupid jokes, seeming more and more interested in us by the minute, and had that flirty giggle going. So later that day we all decide to go fishing on our boat. We didn't catch much, but we sure did drink quite a bit. We weren't drunk per-say but more tipsy. After that, one of the girls suggests we go back to their tent to eat and even offered we sleep with them there because they were \"scared a bear might get them\" (I think you know where this is going). We all went back to their tent and I started making out with the blonde one, Fred took one of the Brunette's. But then she stopped and seemed troubled for a moment, and I asked \"What's wrong?\" and she said \"I need you to do something for me\" so I said \"sure whats up?\" and she looked me dead in the eyes and responded \"I need about tree fiddy\", and lo-and-behold I took a second glance and she was the god damn loch ness monster.

Those are easily identified, reported, and removed if mods are inclined to do so.  \n\n2)Being disruptive.  This is a **community** issue, not a bot issue.  /u/linkfixerbot is not always disruptive (aside from the fact that there is a person behind that account who uses it, too. It's not a set-and-forget bot like some of them), but the community chooses to flip their shit of them.

There are several bots/accounts with scripts to trawl a users history and dig up pictures or other personal info and post them wherever and whenever, those are definitely as bad, so it would be nicer to have a method to keep track it, but going through all the extra measures and creating a registry for mods to keep up with might be excessive.

True love is not abusive, it is nurturing and kind, so both sides submitting to each other fully, equally, continually feeding and supporting one another while remaining separate selves, is a an activity that makes both parties stronger.  Think of it like two parasites feeding off of each other, with the sum being greater than the whole of the parts.  \n\nSo, in conclusion, the meaning of love to practice self sacrifice while maintaining autonomy and Independence and receiving the willingly given support of another, which you kindly return, which gives you both happiness, stability, and strength.

{"body": "Wow, I'm excited for your game. I actually grew up in a forest with my grandmother. We would take hikes all the time, deep into the forest. It seemed like there was always something new to find in its infinite vastness. Once, we stumbled upon a small stream that wasn't on any of the maps. The water, despite its muddy banks, was crystal clear, with a bed of smooth pebbles. I remember plunging my hand into its icy depths and clutching a handful of gravel, just to hear them *plunk* as I let them each fall back in.\n\nOf course, this paradise of mine was too good to be true. While I was playing in the stream, I hear a splintering sound - and then this explosive, sickening *crack* that felt like a physical blow. As though in slow-motion, I turned to see a massive pine tree, falling, falling... My grandmother, my dear sweet grandmother - she always had been mostly deaf - sat there as the tree's shadow grew bigger around her. I tried to call her name, to run to her side, but I was too slow. Too slow. I could only watch in horror as she - \n\nI can't even say it.\n\nI just stood there. I don't know why. I rejected it. It had to be false. For a moment I almost felt like laughing. This must be a dream, right? The world felt unstable. On shaky legs, I lurched towards where I saw her last. There, peaking out from under the tree, half of my grandmother lay in the forest grass, wrinkled fingers reaching out for the sun. Something broke within me. I didn't even notice the tears as I rushed to her side. Her neck - once strangely long and graceful for one her age - the place where I used to rest my head when I was tired, or lonely, or afraid - now lay forlorn in the underbrush. I desperately held her, touching her face, my tears dripping onto her wizened skin.\n\nI almost didn't notice the noise.\n\n\"Jack,\" she said.\n\n\"Grandma?\" I ghasped, astonished. Her eyes flickered open.\n\n\"Jack,\" she smiled.\n\n\"Grandma, don't talk. I need to call the hospital. They'll send a helicopter and...\"\n\n\"No, jack,\" she said, calmly.\n\n\"But Grandma -\"\n\nShe interrupted me again, eyes bright. \"Listen to me, Jack. I need something from you.\"\n\n\"Anything grandma. Just say the word...\" The tears are coming again.\n\n\"Jack... I need...\" I could barely hear her. Her words were starting to fade. I leaned in close, ear almost brushing her lips.\n\n\"Jack... I'm gonna need about *tree fiddy.*\"\n\nWell, it was about that time that I realized my grandma was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damn monstah had gotten me again! \"Goddamn it monstah, I ain't givin you no damn tree fiddy! And that wasn't even a good pun!\" I yelled as she slithered right out from under the tree, jumped into the stream and swam away.\n\nSometimes I wonder if things would have gone differently, had I stayed by her side instead of wandering off into the stream on my own.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369196970", "subreddit": "IndieGaming", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

My brother was always more outgoing than me and often had better luck with the ladies, and I'd be lying if I wasn't a bit jealous about it. He was always cool about it though, and he would often invite me to hang out with him and whoever he was seeing at the time, so I got to know Kate quite well. I should mention that as well as being super hot, she had a great personality and we got on really well.\n\nSo this one time, my brother had arranged to take Kate out to dinner to celebrate their 6 month anniversary, but at the last minute he got called into work (he sometimes had to work late). Panicking, he asked me to go instead and pretend to be him! I agreed, and drove my brother's car to pick Kate up from her house at 7pm, wearing my brother's suit. I took her to the restaurant and it was honestly one of the most amazing nights of my life. We ate, we drank, we laughed, and before I knew it we were back at her place in the bedroom. Things were getting physical fast, and my socially awkward self didn't know how to tell her that I was the wrong twin. Finally, we were both naked in her bed, about to do the nasty, when i finally cracked. \"Look,\" I said, \"Before we do this there's something you should know...\" But before I could finish, she put a finger to my lips and said \"I know, you're Gingrel, not his brother. I want this. I've wanted this for a long time.\" I couldn't believe this! Nerdy, awkward me, about to have sex with this super attractive girl! \"Are you sure?\" I asked. \"Yes, but there's one thing I need first.\" \"What do you need?\" She leaned in close and whispered in my ear \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was about that time that I realised that Kate was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. That goddamn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again! \"Dammit monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I exclaimed, and she swam away into the distance.

For those that don't know, it's when you're walking and you're holding a gallon of something ( I was using milk, but i've seen water and other juices), and you throw them up, or pretend to slip on the ground and the liquid goes everywhere, and when people try to help you up, you pretend to slip and fall everywhere and all over the place. So, que me walking down. I have my friend with a video camera hiding, and me walking with two gallons of milk. There is a good amount of people shopping, so this should be perfect. I throw the milks as high as I can, and I slip backwards. This is where things go bad. I can't see where the milks are, and they flew to my left. Well, there was a person to my left. A girl about my age, around 17-18. She was just innocently picking out some dairy products. Milk is about to ruin her day. The milk comes crashing down, and lands right on her head. She collapses with a shriek. I'm looking at her in horror. I'm so nervous, I abandon my prank and go over to her. I see her laying on the floor, and people are looking at us. I am trembling, I though I murdered this girl. When I get up to her, I notice how beautiful she actually is. Flowing blonde hair, great rack and legs. That's off topic though, I was too scared to care about getting with her because I thought I was going to jail. The milk came down crashing pretty hard too, milk was soaking her clothes. I kneel down next to her, and her eyes slowly open. She croaks out a few words that I can't tell. Then she gets up slowly. I ask her if she's okay, all of that. She then tells me she needs something. I ask, what? I had no idea what she could possibly want from me after I almost killed her with milk. She leans in to my ears, and whispers \"i'mma need about tree-fiddy\". It was then that I noticed that this beautiful girl that I almost killed with milk during a prank was actually a pre-historic loch ness monster.

{"body": "Alright, I'll guess I'll put mine on here. I'm in a community-service based fraternity at my university, and met her through that. I had met her my freshman year, a year before we started dating. She was in charge if making sure the campus was flyered for done event we were doing, and I had volunteered to help out. A year later, we are at another project together, helping build paths to walk dogs on for a local animal shelter. She apparently thought I was cute then, but didn't make a move. \nThat night we saw each other at a party, and played boom (drinking game) next to each other, and again, thought I was cute but made no moves. The next week, my best friend and I are at these on campus fraternity lodges (basically clubs) and she and I saw each other. My friend and I, along with her and her friends, all group up in a circle or whatever and start dancing. My friend starts making out with one of hers. She and I start dancing. Then we're kissing up against the wall. After a while, she asks quietly if I have a condom. I don't reply, because she seemed a little drunk (I was at least buzzed). Just keep kissing/dancing. A few minutes later, she asks again, and for the same reason, ignore it. She asks a third time, and I finally tell her yes. \nWe go back to my room, have sex. Was fun, she was a virgin at the time. Apparently, she just wanted to lose it that night and she knew I was a nice guy and wouldn't be a dick about the whole thing. \nNext day, we have an event (for my fraternity) where she was supposed to take attendance of the people that come. At the end of the event, she hurries away, avoiding contact with me. In doing so, she forgot the list of people who came. I volunteer to take it to her (in hopes to talk with her and such). She gave me her number the previous night, and so I ask her where her room was. That night I head over with the list, and we start talking, then that starts to lead on from there into other fun things.

{"body": "A few years ago, I picked up a new Charger R/T.  Not even a week into driving it, I stopped at a convenience store, and headed home.  I still had the temporary tags (no license plate).  I noticed a car staying a few car lengths behind me, and I did 2 separate right turn circles.  They were following.  I drove to the Police Station and they continued on their way.  I thought that by NOT going to my house, I would be okay.\n\nTwo nights later, I was woken up at 2am by our house alarm.  I grabbed my shotgun, told my wife to get back in the bedroom and lock the doors and call the police.  I waited in the hall, and didn't see/hear anything.  \n\nThe police showed up and saw that my back doors were cracked, it looked like they tried to pry them open.  There was one sneaker print on the door frame.  I mentioned that I was followed 2 days prior and they suspected they used my car/information to get my address, and figured it was a nice enough car to risk finding out where I lived...\n\nI wasn't quite sure how I felt about someone knowing where I lived AND attempted to break in...  It's very unsettling.  I felt better knowing that I have the alarm AND protection in the home, but still.  Additionally the back doors were weakened, so they could be easier to bust open later.  I was assured that they likely wouldn't show up again (and they haven't), but it was still unsettling.\n\nThe police officer suggested that I get the doors repaired as quickly as possible, just in case.  I asked if he had any idea how much it would cost and he just smiled and said \"about tree-fiddy\".

The yard was fenced in with a pretty tall wood fence, and I always wondered what was on the other side, wondering if things were nice there, maybe a little backyard with a pool and a nice garden and a beautiful lawn. My backyard was fairly ordinary to me, just grass, and I always compared it to the yard of my imagination on the other side of that wood fence. My yard was never as good as the one over the fence, even though I had never seen what was on the other side. My little head built this idea that what I had was inferior to what was on the Other Side. I never actually saw the Other Side, I thought I would see it after a terrible storm knocked down part of the fence, but while I was at school the next day, a repairman came and fixed the fence. I arrived home after school and as I walked to the backyard, I saw the fence repairman put the last piece of the fence sealing off my chance at finally knowing what was there. As the repairman was cleaning up, my dad came out and asked \"How much for the repair?\" The repairman responded \"About treefiddy\" \n\nThat's when I realized he was actually a five story crustacean from the paleolithic era and there was no grass on the other side.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369251072", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in high school there was this girl I really liked for almost 2 years we'll call her Sally. We were pretty close friends in a group of about 8 boys and girls. My 'best friend' in the group we will call Sean for the sake of name alliteration. I pined over Sally for what felt like forever. I was very shy and not quite sexually matured so I was nervous around her when I did talk to her. High school dragged slowly on and she was always on my mind. I wrote sappy poetry, helped her out when I could to 'be there' for her...I didn't do her homework or anything but if she needed help I would show her how to get the answer. Anyways all the guys in the group knew that I liked her and I have to assume the girls knew as well. The guys always bugged me about it and the girls would drop hints that I should just ask her out already and they knew she would say yes. Still I was too nervous to say anything.  \nUntil one night I was hanging out with Sean in his dad's basement drinking from his father's supply of beer. His dad was divorced and obviously lonely so he liked when I came over and I liked that he let us drink his beer (we were 17 and the drinking age in my country is 18 so it's not that terrible). So it was a Friday night and I will always remember it...as best as I could...I was pretty drunk. Sean was bugging me to just ask out Sally. I told him I was too nervous. He pushed for me to just go on ICQ (I am a bit old) and message her to ask her out. He basically did this by telling me to stop being a pussy already and he was sick of me always talking about her. So sure enough I went onto his computer, opened ICQ and messaged Sally. This part was clear as day, as drunk as I was I remember clearly typing. It started out normally. 'Hey how r u?' I kept drinking my sixth beer as I typed. Finally after Sean kept drunkenly calling me a pussy I typed 'Do you want to see a movie sometime?' My heart dropped...but soon her reply ' :) Sure! How about tomorrow at 8? We can see that new Adam Sandler movie.' I didn't know what movie she meant but it didn't matter. I had a date! Sean congratulated me but something seemed off about him that night. It could have just been the beer...but no it wasn't.  \nThe next day I woke up on the couch still at Sean's but he was nowhere to be found. I was a bit hung over and it was already past noon. I went upstairs and his dad was there looking surprised. 'oh hey empathyx you are still here? I thought you left with Sean.' I asked if he knew where he had gone but he didn't so I rushed home to get ready for the date.  \nAll the time I was getting ready I started to feel less awkward and thought about the positives. She had said yes to me. I took it as a win. All the time wondering where Sean had gone. I called his house later (no cell phones) and his dad said he hadn't come home...he sounded a bit worried and told me if I saw him to get Sean to call him. I told him I would.  \nSo I walked to the cinema that night because I thought being dropped off by my parents would be lame for our first date, after all this was Sally! I got to the cinema a bit late and I didn't see Sally anywhere. The usher told me the previews were already playing. Being the gentleman I hope I am I bought two drinks and a popcorn before going into the cinema. I assumed Sally was already inside...and she was...with Sean.  \nYea you all saw it coming. Sean was on the date with Sally. Funny thing is looking back I learned that I was logged into Sean's ICQ account when I asked her out so she didn't even know I was coming. I could not just let this go. I was furious and I had two drinks and a popcorn. So I went over to them. Sean looked at his feet when he saw me. Sally looked down at me and said 'empathyx? What are you doing here?' I looked up at her and I said 'Sally. You must know I like you why would you agree to go out with Sean? What do you want from me?' She looked at me with cold eyes and said 'I need about tree-fiddy.' Well it was about that time I noticed this girl I had been in love with for all of high school was a giant monster dinosaur from the Paleolithic Era who only wanted money. So I stormed out and laughed. Laughed at everyone! Sean deserved to be with her. She would have only broke my heart. She would have been a HUGE waste of my time. I never spoke to him again after that night. I do miss seeing his dad though.  \nTL;DR: My friend got married to the girl of my dreams and moved to Scotland and I always wanted to do this.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369254426", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Lived at home still, so parents were still pretty protective. Whenever I wanted to go out, I still depended on them, and that really irked me. I didn't have a job, and couldn't get one because of the amount of schoolwork I had, so all money also came from my parents. It was really hard for me to depend so much on them, because I really, really wanted to be independent.\n\nWhen I finished the Abitur, I was 19. Took the first flight available to Germany. I'll never forget that excitement I felt right when I was going to board the plane. To quote The Shawshank Redemption, it was \"the excitement only a free man can feel\". I boarded the plane and felt truly amazing. I was finally going away, independent, and hoped to never have to go back to that life.\n\nUpon my arrival in Frankfurt, I instantly knew I was in love with the country. I stayed in Frankfurt a few days and just walked around, doing whatever I liked. If I wanted to, I could stop by a store. If I wanted to, I could buy a 30 euro shirt. I could do whatever I pleased. I left Frankfurt, but I haven't forgotten the love I have for the city. I stayed in a small town called Haar, next to Munich. Funnily enough, the town's name means \"hair\", and it's something that had always represented the repression I'd grown under. I had always wanted to grow out my hair and paint it blue.\n\nAnd that's what I did.\n\nI started my studies in the Technical University of Munich. I wanted to become an electrical engineer. I'd always liked building things. I spent five years studying basically nonstop. Now I live in Hamburg.\n\nSo, all in all, I don't regret my decision of moving. I like being free. I like doing whatever I want.\n\nIn fact, I'm so free that I wasn't even constrained by my degree when looking for a job. I'm an architect now, which doesn't really have too much in common with electrical engineering. In fact, my boss came up to me today and told me he'd need some help with the electrical cables we were changing in his office. He called me into it and I asked him, \"was brauchen Sie?\" which basically translates into \"what do you need?\". \"Ich brauche Baum fiddeln\" was his response, which means he needed tree fiddy. It was then that I realized that my boss of six years was a 500 foot tall reptile from the paleozoic era. That damn Loch Ness monster had had me again.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369290026", "subreddit": "Braveryjerk", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

It's a weird loaded sort of question.\n\nIn regards to evidence, I will side with that over my own inner belief. If someone walked up to me and handed me tangible proof proving my beliefs unerringly wrong, I will change them accordingly.\n\nConsidering my belief has no actual tangible affect on other lives, or even my own to be honest, yes, having my own beliefs and hypotheses to insert into the void of not knowing is perfectly justifiable.\n\n&gt;If, despite years of trying, no strong evidence or argument has been presented to show that there is a Loch Ness monster, it is rational to believe that such a monster does not exist\n\nThen this one... I think our ability to observe a lake is a bit more complete of a picture than our ability to observe the universe. While we are making strides, it's ridiculous to compare the two. So yes, in regards to this example I will say true, but because of the context of it, while if you were to straight out ask me if there could be something in the unknown pockets of the universe I'd be more inclined to say yes.\n\n&gt;The serial rapist Peter Sutcliffe had a firm, inner conviction that God wanted him to rape and murder prostitutes. He was, therefore, justified in believing that he was carrying out God's will in undertaking these actions.\n\nSure, *he* was justified in *believing* that he was carrying out God's will. Mainly because he has a serious mental illness. This doesn't make what he did morally correct, nor does it mean that he actually spoke to God. But is this question asking me if his murder is justified on the grounds of his belief? Or is he justified in believing that God told him to do this? No to the former, yes to the latter.\n\nSo, after saying false I received this message:\n\n&gt;Earlier you said that it is justifiable to base one's beliefs about the external world on a firm, inner conviction, regardless of the external evidence, or lack of it, for the truth or falsity of this conviction. But now you do not accept that the rapist Peter Sutcliffe was justified in doing just that. The example of the rapist has exposed that you do not in fact agree that any belief is justified just because one is convinced of its truth. So you need to revise your opinion here. The intellectual sniper has scored a bull's-eye!\n\nLets ignore that this is referring back to a fallacious question. There is a distinct difference in believing that someone can have a belief that is not backed up by evidence, but does not actively harm people and at the same time believe that beliefs that hurt people are unacceptable. These are not conflicting viewpoints, and you can see them quite often with the general hate for the WBC.\n\nNow it's asking me the same question and by answering the same answer it's threatening me?\n\nI escaped with one direct hit, apparently.

{"body": "I've been a good guy for most of my life, never really did anything bad like drugs or other illegal stuff, until that day. \nIt started like every other day, got up, got out of bed, got ready for work, and headed to the office. I walked in and everyone's eyes were on me. I walked to my desk and saw the pink piece of paper laying on my desk. Now I'm a very well to do guy, I make enough money for myself and losing my job wasn't a huge deal, but I was still upset. So at the end of the day I gathered my things and left, got in the car, and drove to the nearest bar I could find. I had never been to a bar before, but I've drank before and knew how well I held my alcohol and how much I could handle, so I went far beyond that. Not only am I absolutely hammered, I make quite a few bad decisions when I'm drunk. So, Lo and behold, a very scandalously dressed woman approached me and you guys know where this is going. Don't want to go to my place so we go to what I assume is her place. We go in and head back to a small room in the back. She immediately shoves her hand into my pants as she kisses me. We start having a good time when we hear a loud bang and a lot of footsteps as the door to the room then swings open with a man three very large other men walk in. A lot of yelling ensues as I confusedly pull my pants up and watch as a man pulls a gun out and aims it at the girl. I jump up to do something, but realise there isn't much to do. The guy orders her to go with them, grabbing her by the hair before the girl starts screaming. The guy, who is presumably her pimp, throws her on the ground and she crawls over to me. She says,\n\"Please help me...\" As she her eyes look pleadingly into mine. \nI look back at her and ask her how I can help. She looks deep into my eyes and grabs my hand before saying\n\"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"\nIt was at this time that I realised this girl was an eight story tall Crustacean from the Palaeolithic Era. \n\"GODDAMNIT LOCH NESS MONSTER!

{"body": "To give you an accurate measure of height, you'll have to specify what period of time we're talking about. The paleolithic era, when most cave paintings and petroglyphs we know of were likely produced, extends from roughly 2.5 million years ago till about 10,000 years ago. Anatomically modern humans arrived on the scene about 150,000 years ago.\n\nIf you're talking about the differences between the sexes, that's known as sexual dimorphism, and has been present in our ancestors (to my knowledge) at least as far back as hominid species as old as 2 million years ago (possibly coexisting / near ancestors: Homo erectus, Homo ergaster, and Homo habilis).\n\nSexual dimorphism is generally caused by intrasexual competition (eg. males competing with males for access to sexually mature females) but can also occur from strong division of labor or by closely related genes that change because of mutation.\n\nAlso, \"cavemen\" or \"cave people\" are obsolete terms. Most people think of ancient humans / hominins as cave dwellers, which isn't likely where they actually lived even if they occasionally used caves for one reason or another. The picture one often gets in association with \"cavemen\" is anatomically closer to Neanderthals.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n^^Edit: ^^fixed ^^autocorrect ^^mistakes", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369497406", "subreddit": "Anthropology", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

On this particular trip a young (and from what he described pretty hot) teaching assistant had come along with the teacher to assist with the kids.\n\nSo anyways, he parks the bus and just does his usual things (he brings a kindle and his smart phone so he was just reading a book or whatever).  After about a half an hour the teaching assistant comes back out.  He asks her why, and she said apparently the museum had staffed enough assistants to take care of the kids and she wasn't needed.  He doesn't really think much of it, but the assistant keeps asking him questions about what he's doing and generally making it seem like she's interested in him.\n\nAt this point he decides to test the waters and see if she's really interested in him.  He puts down his book and starts laying on his best game.  Before long she's sitting on his lap and just basically being flirty in general, so he goes in for the kill.\n\nShe was wearing some Jeans and a tight shirt that wasn't too revealing, but underneath he could see her nipples starting to poke out.  He grabbed at her waist and went in for a kiss.  She returned the kiss passionately, and they began making out in the front seat of the bus.  He's amazed at his luck, wondering what he can possibly do next.  The kissing starts to get heavy and he begins to pull off her shirt, but she stops him.\n\n\"I can't,\" she tells him.  \"If we get caught here I'm in big trouble.\"  Thinking quickly he grabs her by the hand and takes her out of the bus.  They find a maintenance shed or something nearby and resume the make out session.  This time she lets him take her shirt off.  Her breasts are bigger than he imagined, at least a D from what he described.\n\nHe picks her up and sets her on a desk nearby and begins to pull off her Jeans.  She begins letting out little moans, urging him to hurry and get them off, and he can barely contain himself.  Finally he gets them off, and reaches for her panties when she stops him.\n\n\"Hold on, I just need...\" she says.\n\n\"What?

{"body": "I am an atheist because I have found the claims of theist unconvincing. Also, I can't name a single positive, tangible benefit that religion provides that can't be attained through secular means.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith the Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many gods can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369528442", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

I was home from university for the summer and she had just finished a move out to Connecticut. Her fiance was a bit of a dick, but that's besides the point.\n\nSo anyway, she and her fiance stop down and my parents are going absolutely nuts over her kid. I mean, it was cute and all, but I hadn't had kids at the time, so I really didn't know what the fuss was all about.\n\nSo my sister asks me \"Hey The1RGood, do you wanna hold her?\" Now I'm not great with kids. I know basic shit like you should never attempt to dribble them like a basket ball and that they cry frequently, but I don't actively seek opportunities to hold infants. But because I didn't want to offend my sister, I said \"sure\" and took my niece into my arms. She was *adorable*. The cutest little bundle of joy ever. She was all smiley and reaching for my face and stuff. I said \"hey there cutie\". I look back up to my sister and said \"she's beautiful\". I move to hand her back, but just as I do, my niece reaches up to my face and says \"Need\". I stopped dead in my tracks and looked back down at her surprised. My sister runs over and says \"What did she say? Did she just say a word?\" As if on cue, my niece says again \"Need\". My sister shouts to our parents \"Oh my god! It's her first word!\" I just look down at her and say \"What is it? What do you need?\" Then my niece gets a very serious face and looks as if she's about to cry. She opened her mouth and said \"I need about tree fidy.\" At this point I realized that my infant niece was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era! I shouted back \"God dammit Nessie!

{"body": "This is going to be NSFW, if people didn't figure that out before coming into this thread.\n\nI've never worked in one, but stayed in them as I backpacked around south america.\n\nIn Peru, after returning from a hiking trip with some new friends we went to a local club and started having a great time - no inhibitions because nobody knew each other, so nobody was embarrassed to dance (or whatever). I was pretty reserved as a kid so this was a whole different side of me that I could let out with zero repercussions. This local girl was staring at me from across the dance floor so I went over and gestured to her asking her to dance; I spoke no spanish and her no english. We ended up dancing and drinking all night and having a really good time. As the night wound down we stumbled back to my hostel and I brought her into the large, 8-bed dorm that I had rented which was currently only occupied by me.\n\nWe started making out and fooling around pretty quickly found ourselves naked on my bed. I was a virgin at the time, so I was pretty excited that this exotic peruvian woman was going to have sex with me. I wanted to be cautious and not finish immediately so I focused heavily on her, trying whatever I could do to please her before I got on with it myself, and ended up going down on her as she laid across my bed.\n\nSo there I was, butt naked, crouched on the bed with my head in her crotch and my extremely white ass in the air pointing towards the door, when the manager of the hostel walked in leading a group of newly arrived backpackers that were planning on staying in the dorm I was occupying. This manager woman immediately started losing her shit, shouting at us (in spanish, mind you, so I have literally no idea what she was saying) and making a big, shooing motion with her hands as if she would fan us out into the street and purge the room of the evil deed that had been done. The new backpackers were just standing in the doorway looking in, with no clue what to do. The only thing that *I* could do was make the same overly broad shooing motion towards this woman while shouting back in english.\n\nThey eventually left and (apparently) found another room to occupy. We continued, had our night together, and my girl left in the morning. Checkout the next morning would have been awkward if I hadn't still been in the mindset of not giving a fuck what people though. She lectured me (I think) during the entire procedure and charged me double for having two people in the room. \n\n**EDIT:** Lots of references regarding a loch ness monster and tree fiddy, which I in no way understand. \n\nShe definitely had no D of her own.

I consider myself someone so kinky you could probably call me a pervert and be completely accurate. I could fuck three times and day and be a happy man. This is not the case with my girlfriend.

One of the fantasies I made her play out was just disgusting and I can't believe she can even look at me, much less forgive and still love me. \n\nOn the night in question, I was layering fetishes. I had her role-playing as my daughter the Girl Scout turning tricks as a whore. I know. I know. It gets worse. \n\nSo she comes to my door, knocks, says she's selling Girl Scout pussy, and that's all I needed. We went at it all over the house. I had her performing all manner of depraved sex acts, using her body as she called me daddy the whole time. She begged me to finish in her ass and I obliged. \n\nSpent and satisfied, I rolled over to pass out. But my gf wasn't finished. \"Aren't you going to pay me?\" she asked, still playing. \n\nThis wasn't like her. She usually only ever played bc I liked it. I'd never once known her to keep up the charade post-coitus. I kinda liked it. I played along and asked how much she normally charges for Girl Scout pussy, and could I get the daddy discount?\n\nShe flashed a smirk, then licked and bit her bottom lip a little. \"I need about 3.50.\"\n\nWell it was about that time I noticed that this \"Girl Scout\" was actually about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era!\n\n\"Get outta here Loch Ness monster!

She was really into 60s/70s rock, and would talk about 'real music' in comparison to rap all the time.\n\nMany of us in her class (English) were big rap fans, so she took it as her mission in life to teach us about the ills of our favorite genre, and how we should all just embrace the pinnacle of musical creation that was Led Zeppelin and The Who. She would take ANY opportunity to inject her dogma into just about any subject or conversation, even titling one quarter as \"Sex, Drugs and Renaissance poetry\" as a way to get us to appreciate Byron and at the same time see the genius of Meatloaf.\n\nSeriously, shit got old.\n\nAnyway, she had a tradition of staying late most fridays after school and debating with students about various topics. Despite having some annoying dogmas, she was actually a pretty cool person. So, on many of these occasions, myself or a friend of mine named Dustin would try and get her to see that a lot of rap music is just the same kind of poetry she was trying to turn us on to. This peaked her interest a bit, and she finally relented to allow us to give her a few songs to prove our point.\n\nSo, Dustin and I went home that weekend and complied a 5-song CD which we felt would cover some hip hop she might find accessible. This was in 2002, at the height of the 'bling' era, and we wanted her to see it wasn't all about that. So we had \"The Message\", of course, but also Blackstar, Mos Def, Talib Kweli and a fairly unknown rapper at the time, Immortal Technique.\n\nOn Monday morning we gave her the CD and she came back on Friday to discuss, ad we were quite amazed when she told us that while she enjoyed all the music, and wanted to hear more, she felt like one of the songs gave her, and I quote \"Literally chills\". \n\nSeriously. \n\nFast forward ten years and I'm at a show in Manhattan and this Amazing rapper gets on stage, and she's a white lady. And she's *killing it*. And after a few minutes, although I can't believe it, it's the same high school teacher of mine from years ago! \n\nSo after the show I go up to talk to her. I mean, honestly at that point I felt like she would be like \"Thank you for showing me how awesome rap is/can be!\" But when she saw me and came up, her face was more inquisitive and possibly even aggressive. \"Hey, can I borrow about tree fiddy?\" And that's about the time that I realized that my old high school teacher from my youth was actually a crustacean from the late paleolithic era, and I told her \"Fuck you loch ness monster, you ain't gettin no tree fiddy!\"\n\nTL;DR: Convinced my high school teacher that rap is good with immortal technique.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369618938", "subreddit": "hiphopheads", "score": -20, "controversiality": 0}

It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 69 pack of over 900 420 for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed ALL THE THINGS to the cashier, handed him tree fiddy and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged woman who thanks Obama for health care(I knew these people from Pap Johns, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, \"See that man? He's acting just like u/linkfixerbot wants us to.\" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Kony 2012 shirt, and a fedora, so it must have been a nice sight until she took an arrow to the knee. Very loudly, I said \"HL3 Confirmed!\" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to say Y U NO LIKE HL3, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier.

{"body": "I was on my way back from town, i live in the countryside, and was driving down the main dual-carriageway / expressway minding my own business. Suddenly a guy in a Subaru wanted to race me, I get this a lot even though im a girl, all people see is the fast car i drive. So at the traffic lights we stopped and we both knew the race was about to commence. i let him have the full power of my Porsche and he screamed at the side of me. we were both doing around 145mph and i was edging the lead, i checked my rear view mirror and thats when i saw him put his siren and blue lights on.\nHoly shit, it was a cop. I panicked and floored it even faster but Subaru's are fast and he was keeping up with me even when my speedo was edging 160mph, there was a school bus up ahead and i could see the road merging down to a single lane, but i knew i could get in front of the bus as it was stopped dropping the kids off.\nI swerved round the back of the bus, still doing well over 80mph and as soon as i overtook the bus out of the corner of my eye i could see this young kid about to run across the road in front of the bus and straight into my path.\nThere was absolutely nothing i could do, no way i could stop in time or swerve. I knew i was about to kill this innocent kid. In the blink of an eye I felt sick.\nLuckily the kid mustve seen me as he stopped just shy of my car as i went past. I missed him by a couple of inches.\n\nI decided to stop, probably the only sane thing i did that day,\nThe cop stopped behind me and was being really official, told me as i was going over 100mph i was going to lose my license and i would likely go to jail for dangerous driving too... I was in tears and really shaking, i tried to say sorry and i asked how much the fine was going to be, He said likely over £1000 if i went to court, or i could pay an 'on-the-spot' fine and avoid court and therefore jail.\n\nI asked how much it would be and he said \"tree-fiddy\"\nWell it was about this time I noticed that this cop was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era! I was like \"God-Damn Loch Ness Monster, leave me alone i aint giving you no money!\"\n\nI buckled though, i caved in and gave him a dollar, that was my biggest regret, he keeps coming back every god-damn week!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369735120", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Literally this reminds me of this time when a few years ago on my 19th birthday, me and my buddies decided to celebrate by going to the bars at my college campus (minimum age was 19). I usually don't drink too much, but, since it was a special occasion, I decided to get really fucking wasted. \n\nWe pregramed a lot before the bar, since it's difficult to obtain alcohol in a bar when none of us are 21, plus it's really expensive so I wasn't trying too hard to get my friends with fake IDs to buy me some. I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my fucking mind.\n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this really sexy chick dancing by herself. Being drunk as shit, I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance sexy? Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up grinding hard/making out a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes.\n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated. We were making out a lot on my bed, and we took off each others shirts and things were really escalating. I had her panties off, and I was starting to think me losing my virginity was a sure thing. I could tell she was really into it. She said \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". I figured she meant me going down on her, and me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\". Then the question came: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"I aint givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!

You had consistently beaten me in water wars as a child. So I concocted a plan, hatched a scheme, if you will. I decided that I would go to your party, as you had invited me, but my present would simply be a box with dog poo in it. Childish, I realize, but being a child myself, it was perfect. So, I waited, simply biding time until you came to open presents. \n\nAt this point, I noticed that my box was gone. I searched the present stack, but could find no trace of it. Had I forgotten it? No, but no time to fret about that. So, I decided upon a different plan. I excused myself to your bathroom, and looked at myself in the mirror. I knew that I would have only one shot at this. I climbed out the window, and went to your front door, taking off my hat as I went. I knocked on your door, expecting to see your mother open the door, but fate was kind. You opened the door, and saw me. You asked why I was outside, and I said that I needed to get something. You asked what, to which I replied that I needed about tree-fiddy. Only then, after that clue, did you see through the disguise I had so carefully crafted for all these years. I believe, had I not removed my hat and jarred my wig, you would not have noticed that I was an eight story tall prehistoric monster from the paleozoic era. Since then, I have heard, you have not recovered from that fright. I apologize for ruining your birthday party, but I must ask...

Just for fun, I figured I would take it to school and show everyone, but then the kitten started talking and stopped me in my tracks.

{"body": "So I’m from small country in central Europe. Loads of people have probably never heard of it. It combines small patch of Adriatic Sea and Alps, but landscape is mostly small green hills, each with a little church on top. Almost two thirds of land is covered with forests and capitol is famous for its middle age architecture. It is an adorable country in which most of the time nothing really happens.\n\n\nLike most of the population I live in the countryside, few hundred meters apart from closest neighbour, right next to the forest. I spend most of my childhood in that forest. I can still remember which the best trees for climbing were and where certain flowers grew. But the thing I will never forget happened in the summer of 2001. I was just around twelve back then and I was spending my whole afternoons in the forest. Most of the times I was roaming around with my best friend, but that day I was alone.\nAs I said before, most of the land around here isn’t flat. The hill behind our house is quite steep, right above our house is old orchard my great-granddad planted and when you come on the top of the hill you can almost see the capitol city in the distance. Then there is big forest that extends across the karst landscape practically right to the Italian border with a few smaller towns and villages in between. I never really went very far because I mostly stayed in the area my family owned, but that day I decided I want to see some more.\n\n\nI didn’t have much with me and I didn’t tell my parents I was going anywhere far. I always felt very safe in the woods even though bears were often seen in the area. In reality the most dangerous thing you can bump into are drunken hunters. Forest is pretty in the summer, leaves and tall trunks made me feel like I’m in a big cathedral. I started to sing a tune I have heard on the radio some time ago. At that point I was about hour and a half walking distance away from home.\n\n\nI decided to stray away from the main road that leads through the forest in big curves and to take the shortcut. Sun was setting and light was making leaves glowing in sharp colours. But soon all the light disappeared and I find myself wandering in the twilight on territory unknown to me. Wind was blowing and dry branches were making weird noises. I started to feel uncomfortable. And in one sheer moment I discovered I am lost.\nI could feel the panic in form of adrenaline that started to flow through my veins. My instincts were screaming to run away, but I forced myself to focus and tried to get orientation. It was all pointless; I had no idea where I was. I started to walk around aimlessly, hoping to at least find the road. Suddenly I saw a small figure standing far off in the distance. From what I saw it could only be a small child, with a long slender neck, scaly but smooth skin and deep red eyes. I started walking towards it, but the figure noticed me and ran away. I chased figure in forest for quite a long time, I never came enough close to actually distinguish any of its features, but it looked like I small girl, no older than I was at the time.\n\n\nIn one moment I was running and in the next the floor under me disappeared. I felt that dreadful feeling of falling, similar to one in very bad nightmare when everything feels like slow motion. Then that awful sound of body hitting the floor, a moment later also came the pain. For moment I motionless lied on the ground, finally I pulled myself together and opened my eyes, waiting for them to adjust the thick darkness in the cave, where I landed.\n\n\nFirst everything was pitch blackness. And then I saw. There was a single pair of eyes staring at me, for less than a few inches in front of my face. I quickly backed away, until I hit something dry and crumbly. Somewhere in the back, fires were lit. First there was one, and then more and more, until chamber was fully lit. There were thousands and thousands of eyes watching me. Dead eyes in dry sockets, skin that was stretched over the bones, mouths hanging open like in big shock, but that was only because lips rot in the time that passed.\n\n\nI stared, I wasn’t able to move or scream. I am not even sure I was able to breath. I blinked, hoping for dreadful image in front of me to disappear. As I opened my eyes all otherwise motionless copses moved. In the matter of fact, I didn’t really see them move, but when I blinked it was like everything got one step closer. I felt cold sweat slipping down my neck and my eyes began to water. I could help myself I blinked again. This time, I was completely surrounded. I simply closed my eyes, wishing for all to be just a bad dream. I didn’t hear a single sound; I smiled thinking that soon I will wake up. When I opened my eyes, there was a face, almost touching my face. I could clearly see dried and rotten face, eyes filled with numbness. I started to feel dizzy, I felt something like dust and bones grabbing my hair and tearing my clothes. I felt it and I didn’t feel it, because I became so damn dizzy and sick. I tried so hard to stay conscious, to fight, but I couldn’t move a single muscle. And then it was again pitch blackness all around me.\n\n\nI opened my eyes, trying to adjust to the lack of light. I was lying on the forest ground, not so far away from home. In that exact moment all my body started to function normally, I ran home like a wind. I had no idea how I got there and I just tried to forget about whole thing, but my peace didn’t last very long. Next night I dreamed about people I saw back there. I woke up to the face looking at me from the window. It was the face of a little girl, she was also dead, and her empty eyes watched me with wild anger as she was clawing the window, trying to get in. I am having the same nightmare for the past twelve years. It that time I visited many different therapists. They say it is just stress from school and job; that I should try to relax. But how can I relax, when every night as I open my eyes, a girl is one step closer to me? One night she finally got close enough to mutter just one sentence to me, \"Ima need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that moment that I realized this creepy female figure off in the distance was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.\n\ntl;dr Some scary shit happens when you witness a genocide\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369832276", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 745, "controversiality": 0}

Zipped it back up and looked up at the moon.\n\n\nBeautiful full moon, the clear sky I could almost see inside of the craters; I went over to a nearby tree to take a leak and enjoy this very majestic moment.\n\n\nThat is when I heard a sound, off to my right, far beyond where the hillside curved, it sounded sort of like a metal cable being streched beyond it's breaking point, yelling out in sorrow from being pulled appart.\n\n\nI looked to the three tents, nobody was awake, maybe they did not hear it.\n\n\nIt was a very dark night, inspite of the very bright full moon, I had just decided that the noise was nothing important when it happend again, only this time it was closer.\n\n\nI could not ignore it again, it turns out I wouldn't be able to even if I wanted.\n\n\nRight above me the sky began to glow, almost as bright as day, I remember it as if it was yesterday, the dark black sky turned a bright mid-day blue! Right before my eyes, night turned into day, I have never seen this happen, even using the brightest military spotlights for SAM sites. \n\n\nRight in the massive patch of blue sky that had just opened up above me a very bright light appeared, I remember feeling heat, so much heat that I thought my skin was going to boil. I remember sneezing like I had just looked into the sun, sneezed around 3 times, eyes waterd, this I can never forget.\n\n\nAs I wiped away the tears from the sneeze I see something that will forever be etched into my very soul.\n\nI look around to see if anybody was awake, it turns out my girlfriend at the time woke up and was standing right behind me, staring right up into the sky.\n\nJust to make sure I wasn't having some sort of nightmare, I stepped next to her and asked her if she too could see it.\nAnd it was about dat time dat i realized dat this \"girl friend\" was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the protozoic era! \n\nI said \"God dommit loch ness monster, we ain't got no treefiddy!\"\n\nWe ended up packing up the tents and calling our camping trip short and heading back to Rammstein early that weekend.\n\n***TL:DR*** : Camping in germany, the last time i've camped.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369836000", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Last year I was camping in Scotland near Inverness with two friends from school. We'd had one of those really nice days where everything goes well and you just feel great about life.\n\nAfter exploring the local area and pinpointing our nearest village, we decided to hide all our valuable stuff (you know what Scots are like), zip up our tents and trek to the pub.\n\nWe got a few rounds in, chatted to the landlord and a few of the locals, but all the while I couldn't help notice one chap who just didn't quite look right. I don't know what it was to this day, but something about him drew my gaze and I just couldn't help but stare at him as he sat at the bar on his own, ordering whisky after whisky.\n\nAs I proceeded to get more and more boozed, I began to ignore him. Anyhoo, last orders were done and we were all kicked out the front into the car park. At this point, one of my buddies, who will remain nameless (you know who you are Will), was finding it very hard to stand and/or talk (God knows why), and so hiking back to the campsite was proving difficult.\n\nSeeing that we were having trouble leaving the pub car park, the same lone stranger from the bar came over and offered to give us a lift in his landy. To this day, I wish I'd never gotten in that car, but I did. Not only was he drunk, but there was something very off about him. Now that he was standing, I realised just how tall he was. What's more, his skin seemed to be wet. Not his clothes, just his skin.\n\nAnyway, we got in the car and I noticed that he was driving extremely fast. I asked him to slow down, but he didn't reply. Instead he just stared at me with hollow eyes and a vacant expression. I asked him to pull over, and he obliged. We all got out and watched him speed away. It was at this point that we realised that we were on the banks of a huge lake, and he'd purposefully plowed right in.\n\nPanicking, I ran over to see if there was any hope in rescuing him. Just as I got to the lake, he emerged from the water, not flustered, with that same vacant expression. Shocked, I asked \"do you need help?\". He replied: \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this guy was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam away into the distance.\n\nTL;DR: creepy guy gives us a ride, and ends up trying to killing himself right in front of us.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369844622", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout  \nChef's mom: And she was so adorable with the little pig tails and all  \nChef's dad: And she says to me \"how would you like to buy some cookies?\" And I said \"Well, what kind do you have?\" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things...  \nChef's mom: Raisin oatmeal  \nChef's dad: Raisin oatmeal, and I said \"We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?\" And she looks at me and she says \"I need about treefiddy\"  \nChef's mom: Treefiddy  \nChef's dad: Well it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the palezoic era  \nChef's mom: The Loch Ness monster  \nChef's dad: I said \"Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no treefiddy!\" It said \"how about just twofiddy?\" I said \"Oh now it's only twofiddy?! What is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!\"  \nChef's mom: Boy he was angry  \nChef's dad: Damn right I was angry  \nChef's mom: Not you, the monster. He was about to kick your ass!  \nChef's dad: Shut your mouth, woman    \n\n---  \nChef's dad:And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right. They was probing me and all that  \nChef's mom: We had taco salad that night  \nChef's dad: Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said \"What do you want from me alien?!\" and do you know what he said?  \nChef's mom: Treefiddy  \nChef's dad:Let me tell the damn story now! He said \"treefiddy\" And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that goddam Loch Ness monster again trying to trick me into giving him treefiddy by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!  \nChef's mom: I just given him treefiddy the week before  \nChef's dad: What?! You gave that monster another damn treefiddy?!  \nChef's mom: He tricked me  \nChef's dad: Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it treefiddy!  \n\n---  \nChef's Father: I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man, he came runnin' into me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he says to me, \"Poppa, poppa.\" I said, \"What do you need, Chef, my boy?\" He said, \"I need about tree-fitty.\"    \nChef's Mother: Tree-fitty!    \nChef's Father: Well, it was about that time I begin to get suspicious. I said, \"Chef, my boy, why do you need tree-fitty?\" He said, \"My imaginary friend Boo-Boo the dinosaur wants it.\" So I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was that damn Loch Ness Monster!    \nChef's Mother: Lord, it was scary!    \nChef's Father: I said, \"Dammit, monster, you quit bugging my children, now. We work for our money in this house - we don't just give money away!\"      \n\nEDIT: Formatting  \nEDIT2: Added the rest\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369849149", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Opening to Forbidden Fruit by Amy E. Yergen. Published by Pink Narcissus Press: *The first dish served is always the white amaryllis tart, looking somehow like a transparent hardboiled egg and yet also quite like snow. Their crusts are always perfect here—this one dark as espresso, yet more mysterious. Thin like paper, but sturdy and crisp as bark. It smells of cinnamon and sweet; all over shining with a glaze of autumn’s first frost. It’s paired with fire-currant wine sprinkled with gold dust and a Titania berry in a deep topazy yellow. The pear-shaped berry rests in the center of the goblet; leaning just upon the rim of the aged quartz glass—also edible if you dare that rudeness before the Lady. \nShe stares at me intently, though only for a handful of seconds. I clutch the rough, worn leather of my pack—so in contrast to the delicate gossamer of the table cloth—for comfort. There are many ways into fairyland: stumble into a ring of toadstools, sleep beneath the standing stones, lose yourself in the mesmerizing glow of a will-o’-the-wisp and follow it, pixie-led, into our Lord’s court. How I arrived is less important than how I will get back—perhaps one day I’ll awaken a hundred years from whence I disappeared. A female Rip Van Winkle.\nThe Lady stirs her spoon delicately in a dark, foggy bowl of Scottish moor. She ignores the tall tapering vial of weeping willow—pale green and hazy—just within reach. One sip to learn the language of trees.\nDusk fades to night. Still it comes. Filet of Loch Ness Monster speared with knives of lemon, marinated Saber-tooth ribs, Anansi legs fried in butter, rack of unicorn glazed with blood oranges, trunk of Bashe smelling of cardamom, Chamrosh roasted on a spit, and at the center lords digging into a veritable spectacle of fowl.*\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369854108", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was 18 years old, all bright eyed and bushytailed, I followed (what I presumed to be) the love of my life to University.  A side note for any redditors in young love, your results may vary, but everyone that did what I did met a similar fate.  I'll keep the story short, but suffice to say my high school sweetheart cheated on me and left me bitter, broken, and alone.  There would be another opportunity for love a year later, but I would blow it.  Warning - block of text incoming.\n\nI buried myself in school work and WoW.  I went from a fairly social guy with a good circle of friends to that introverted nerd in the darkened dorm room.  It slowly got worse - I was completely fine with the wake up, go to class, get a C, come home, drink, play WoW, and repeat life style I was slowly slipping into.  At the time, if you asked me, I wouldn't have called it depression, but man, hindsight being 20/20, that is absolutely what it was.\n\nIt was a whole year of this before Spring Break of Sophmore year.  I didn't make any plans, just came home and crashed at my parent's house.  I remember sleeping in till 11:30ish one day, and my Dad walking in.  He sat on the foot of the bed and didn't really say anything.  He finally asked if I was happy.  It was weird hearing him say that, and it was even weirding when I heard the words \"no\" come out of my mouth before I took time to process it.  We talked for hours about what I wanted out of life, where I was going, did I want to go that route... it was the most heart to heart talk we ever had.\n\nAnnways... I realized I had left my home to follow this girl, and then when that ended, I just stopped.  We had always talked about seeing the world, and when she left, my dreams of doing that left with her.  My Dad actually got mad - why was I letting her stop me?  Here I was in great health, nothing holding me down, and I was slipping in my childhood bed letting the sands of time go slip through my fingers.\n\nI had money saved up.  I had taken several AP classes in High School so I had enough credits to afford taking a semester off from college.  I never thought my parents would be the kind of people to say it, but they suggested I take the time to \"find myself.\"  So I did.  I had never been out of the States in my life, but I decided to Hell with it, I'm going to do this.  I did a little bit of research, looked into hostels, packed a bag with a few changes of cloths, and booked the first flight to Dublin.\n\nThe idea was they have good beer and I could get by with English, but other than that, I didn't really think it through.  When I landed, I hopped a bus and just sort of walked around.  I walked around Grafton Street, drank and Temple Bar, and just kind of soaked it all in.  I must admit the first day is a blur of stumbling from one bar to another.  It gets hazy, but the next clearest memory I have starts with me somehow wearing a Kilkenny jersey in Croke Park watching a Hurling game.\n\nTo my left are a group of rather... rowdy individuals in the Kilkenny Black and Gold yelling at some folks wearing blue.  They don't like each other very much.  I start freaking out a bit.  Apparently there was a bad call on the field or something?  I'm still not really clear if there are even *any rules* in Hurling, but whatevet it was, it was a major problem between the two sides.  At any rate, I didn't want to get involved in a fight.  I stand up to try and slink off, when I feel a soft hand on the back of my neck.  It was like lightening shot up my spine.  To my right was the most stunning creature I had ever layed eyes upon.  Green eyes, long curled red hair, and sun kissed skin.  I had no idea who she was, but somehow she knew me.  I will never forget her voice as she said:\n\n\"Skelp the wallaper rite in the geggy.\"\n\nOr something like that.  I didn't have a strong grasp of the Scottish vernacluar given that I was in Celtic land for *one day* at this point.  But it was clear the lady wanted me to fight someone.  And I'll be damned it I wasn't drunk and enamoured enough to throw the first punch.\n\nNo more than a few seconds later I had plenty of boys in Blue on top of me, but the Gold and Black guys (who I'm assuming were my friends?) jumped right back.  It wasn't a fantastic bout as we were quickly seperated and dragged out.  I was dragged off to a holding cell where they quickly seperated us.  Apparently the lot I had associated with had started this sort of thing before, because rather than just sit in a drunk tank at the stadium, we got dragged down to a station by the Garda.\n\nSo, it becomes pretty quickly evident to the local law enforcement that I'm not *really* associated with these folks as I lack both the Irish and Scottish accent.  I concoct an elaborate serious of lies and find myself being let out.  I think they felt bad for me as I was considerably younger and was beating significantly worse that the rest of them.  I'm starting to sober up, take stock of my situation, and have a holy-shit-what-am-I-doing-how-lucky-am-I-to-get-out-of-this moment, when I see the gorgeous thing that started my stupidity.  She was flailing about like a giant, angry beast as they moved her from one cell into her own private one.  \n\nI felt bad so I asked the Garda what was going to happen to all of them.  Apparently, everyone else was going to get to sober up and deal with the usual proceedings befitting a druken brawl, but she was being held at much higher bail.  Well, I was young, had a good deal of money (at least in a teenager's mind), and dumb enough to want to bail her out.  I asked how much bail was, and I could hear her call out from her cell, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"  Well, it was about that time that I noticed this girl was about eight stories tall \nand was a crustacean from the plethazoic era.  And I said \"Damnit Loch Ness Monster!  You ain't getting my tree fiddy!\"\n\nI got the hell out of that police station and never looked back.  Yeah, we could have had a good time together, but I needed to group up.  But some times, I still wonder about the love we could have had, and what type of opportunity I gave up.\n\n**TLDR - A young man's trials and tribulations overseas.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369855784", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I used to be good friends with a girl whose family was a bit unusual. Being young I thought nothing of the little things but now it all seems weird. They had satanic bibles on their family book shelves and her dad had satanic tattoos all over, things like that. Her mom is mentally insane and addicted to pain killers and shes the type of lady to you could picture laughing as someones dying. Lemme paint you a picture; she had skin issues so her face was always looking like she was burnt except for white circles around her eyes which were set deep into her head and were bright white and blue. She had an upturned nose and brownish green reeceding gums. And she was just saggy. She was just scary looking.  She had a white rocking chair on her porch she would sit and rock on for hours. Her satanic dad was bald and short with small black beety eyes and had a creepy nasaly laugh. Together they were a scary looking couple. \nI was extrememly close with their family so it wasnt uncommon if I was at their house when no one was home. After a blow up between mom and daughter that landed daughter in the mental hospital that night, I was left at home alone. (Her dad worked the night shift). I felt like something was watching me all night and just felt weird vibes. Little things freaked me out, the dog was barking at the basement door and I kept hearing slamming from down there etc. Figured I was just paranoid. I had fallen asleep watching tv but woke up to dog scratching wildly at the basement door. I mean he was butting his face against it because his paws were too bloody and torn up to use. This scared me to death already and being a 13 year old I grabbed something along the lines of a weapon or shank and started down the stairs. it took me a few tries to get down there because the slamming doors scared me and such. When I made it far enough down I saw every satanic bible in the house in a line leading up to something. On my final try I made it to the bottom of the stairs and the carpet was soaking wet. I heard what sounded like hysterical crying that kept turning into evil laughing. I fucking lost my breath when I saw the line of bibles leading up to Insane Mother herself rocking in her white rocking chair. I was in shock and God knows why I didnt just turn right back around and run. She stopped mid laugh and looked me dead in the eye and said my name in a low monotone voice that sounded of one in a demonic movie. I noticed the blue in her eyes was gone and she only had pupils. The lights were burnt out but the moon was full enough and came through the window so I could see her details like that. She laughed that god dammed creepy laugh again and kept motioning for me to come to her. Being in shock and not wanting to admit what was going on was really happening, considering she was gone and at the hospital, I must have been dreaming,  I moved toward her. I kind of nervously laugh and I noticed she was extremely sweaty. When I got close enough to her, she grabbed my wrist and stood up extremely fast. She looked down on me and that same demonic voice started laughing loudly and I was scared shitless. She got litterally nose to nose with me and through her gritted teeth said 'I need tree fiddy.' \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369857066", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

That he couldn't take the pressure of dying any day from such a horrific pestilence. That he would rather suffer in hell for eternity than die in this manner. All four also admitted that they had not actually seen what had happened as well, though. Their story had as much credibility as that of the Loch Ness Monster's. It was no matter.

{"body": "My group of friends from high school and I spent many nights at each other's houses, doing bro stuff - drinking, playing video games, watching movies, and so on. It became a ritual for us, until we started college and went our seperate ways.\n\nAfter our first few semesters, most of us were in town to reconcile for our nightly parties. They were full of stories, except mine. You see, I was an introverted Computer Science major, so my updates didn't really last me. One night, my secret spilled out - I was the only one that was still a virgin. I was the subject of much heckling, but also support. It was mostly well-received.\n\nI remember the night we were in my car on a beer run. With my attention on the road, I eventually honed in on the fact that one of my friends had been making lots of calls from the back seat, inviting people over to party. Unusual, but hey, I welcomed the prospect of meeting new people.\n\nJust before we reached the gas station, he lets out a triumphant grunt of a \"yussssss!\" \"What's up?\" I ask. \"You know a girl named Michelle?\" he asks me. \"Yeah, the name sounds familiar. Where would I know her from?\" He responds, \"I don't know, you tell me! Her number was in YOUR phone!\"\n\nAs it would turn out, all of the calls he had made from the back seat were from my phone, which he had snuck out of my center console without my noticing. He was trying to get girls to come over, so naturally, he was calling girls exclusively.\n\nThen, it hit me - I knew exactly who Michelle was. It was one of my lab partners from school. Besides the fact that she was in a Computer Science course (which is borderline-red flag enough,) this girl had everything going against her. I only had her number because she forced it on me. This threw a huge wrench into my plans for the night. I wasn't really in the mindset to be partying with any girls that night. Especially not THAT girl.\n\nI was trapped. There's no way of preventing this from happening, outside of calling back and uninviting her. I can't remember how we settled on this plan, but I had it all worked out: have her over for some drinks, \"pretty much ignore her the entire time,\" and if she tries to make a pass at me, I've got damaged goods. Literally; I was going to make up an injury which left me all but castrated.\n\nI wanted to punch my friend in his balls. I tried thinking of an alternate plan to get me out of it, but none that would've gotten me off of my own personal karma train scot-free. Then, my phone rang. It was Michelle. I answered. She was lost. I navigated her for upwards of 10 minutes, until she made it to my friend's house. Stick to the plan, I thought.\n\nImmediately, something was off. Was this even Michelle? It was dark, but her silouhette was all wrong. As she came up the driveway, smiling and waving, I realized it was, in fact, her - minus about 40 lbs, acne, and arm hair. She had totally made over herself. She looked great.\n\nThe night began, we hit it off, and at some point during all of the drinking and laughing and innuendo, something WAS off. Now, if this was the first chub I had popped in the night, I wouldn't even had given it a second thought. But it wasn’t. Then, as if we were mentally in tune, she slid over to sit in my lap. As her butt drove my chub into my thigh, I felt... warmth. \n\nLook, I won't mince words, I blew it.  It's not like this was my first time touching a girl or anything silly like that; it just happened.  I must had been thinking about getting laid for the whole damn night. That must be it. That's what did me in.\n\nI knew I had screwed up. For whatever reason, I could hear the faintest muttering of \"stick to the plan\" in my ears, and thought I had it all figured out by bashfully sharing: \"listen, something something, great girl, fun night, really attractive blah blah blah... but my dick is more or less broken. I fell on a handrail while skateboarding and really messed it up.\"\n\nThank god we were both drunk. Her first reaction was one of shock, followed by the most painstakingly adorable display of comforting and hugging and consoling. Needless to say, I was alright with this. I had gotten off of the hook, but still got to enjoy the company of a cute drunk girl for the rest of the night. Hell, maybe we could go out over the summer, when I've got more of a shot in me (pun intended.) During my introspection, she leans in close to my chest and says to me: \"can I see it? Is it bad?\"\n\n\"I mean you totally don't have to if you don't want to. It's just...\" She trails off.  What did I do to deserve this? A sexy girl just asked me to show her my penis, and I can't do it. All I can do is hang my head with a coy, ashamed smile. \"Are you sure it's like, broken? Like, is it really that bad? I hope it's not too bad. I bet it'll be fine.\" She's virtually prodding me for a mere glimpse of my dingus. There's that karma train, catching up to me. Didn't take very long; it must have left the station as Michelle left to come over. \n\nWhat a surreal night. I didn't feel much like myself; as if I were having an out-of-body experience. I started letting off of the intimacy. Am I in the process of blowing this a second time in one night?  Will she want to hang out and/or party with me again, or is this going to become just another college story for her? No, I thought, screw that. Definitely not. It's time for another impulse decision: \"well, alright, you can take a look if you wanna see, it's really not that bad.  Just promise me you won't laugh.\" There it was.\n\nWhat the fuck was I thinking?  What, exactly, did I just say?  Did I just agree to show Michelle my penis? What, did I think the \"don't laugh\" part would make up for something, like, oh, I don't know, a load of super sperm in my pants? Or maybe I was buying some insurance to protect me in the event that she finds out there isn't even anything wrong with my damned dick? \"Are you suuuure?\" She asks, concerned. \"Of course I'm sure, it's alright.\" Of course I'm not sure. This is going to be bad.\n\nSo bad, in fact, that I just thought, fuck it. Let's all get a good laugh at my expense. We got up, and a wave of clarity washed over me in my greatest time of need -- the incredible urge to piss. I couldn't remember the last time I had gone to the bathroom that night. Hell, I could even blame my accident on the beer! No no, stick to the plan: make a detour for the bathroom, relieve myself of both urine and boxer briefs, and then hit the bedroom. Even if she's still down and I can't get it up, who gives a shit? That's small potatoes, and I've been dodging bullets all night.\n\nDuring my approximately 30 minutes worth of peeing, I began to scour the bathroom for an inconspicuous place to hide a pair of underwear. I must have considered everything but the medicine cabinet before I realized that my friend kept his clothes hamper in there. Perfect.  I ditched the boxer briefs, warshed up, checked myself out a few times, and hit the lights.\n\nI gently knock on the closed door, and it creaks open. There's Michelle, sitting cross-legged at the top of my friend's bed. She beckoned as I approached, and began to rub me through my pants. Now, aside from the minor discomfort this caused due to my bare dangus being sandwiched with a zipper, I was pleasantly taken aback.  Maybe... Just maybe... Could it be that she didn't give two shits that I had allegedly slammed my dick into a rail?\n\nI look down with a sheepish grin on my face. \"Does this feel OK?\" she asks. \"Ye-yeah... it doesn't hurt too bad I guess...\" Tons of thoughts are crossing my mind, with the last one, but not least; I'm pretty damn sure I'm about to lose my virginity. Michelle had taken notice of my aloofness. She traced my manhood up my fly and rested her fingers on the button, looking up at me for approval.\n\nThoughts of \"surprise! No injured penis!\" rebuttals be damned; I nodded to her. Hell, the lights were off anyway, with the only source coming from the moon shining partially through my friend's half-shut window blinds. To my immeasurable relief, she wasted no time in unbuttoning my fly and taking my head into her mouth. She was slow and gentle, as if she were nursing a fractured cock back to health. My imaginary injury was clearly irrelevant. This was great.\n\nAfter an incredible session of oral fixation, she leaned back on the bed and reached out to me. This is it. Stick to the plan. As I leaned in to take her hands in mine, she recoiled back, and playfully flipped over onto her stomach, as if to hide from me. My first instinct was to do what I had seen in movies - kiss her neck, blow on her ear, all that corny stuff that might not even work.\n\nIt works really well. She responded in lip bites and moans, as she thrusted her hips back into my groin, almost violently at times. Just as I was feeling completely in touch with what was going on at this moment, I made the move. I reached under her shirt, rubbing the small of her back, rubbing higher and higher to remove clothing.  I must have gotten half way to her bra before I realized that she had incredibly dry skin, scaly even. Sunburn, maybe?  Before I could think a second thought, she exploded with energy and bucked me off of her back, as if she were a bronco.\n\nAs I tried to figure out what happened, she turned to me. \"Wait..\" she said, hesitantly. As my jostled vision sorted itself out, I could've sworn my eyes were playing tricks on me, as Michelle's silouhette in the moonlight resembled that of a 500-foot tall creature from perhaps the Mesozoic era, if I had to guess. \"If we're going to do this..\" she warned, \"...I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It all made sense now; the scaly skin, the bucking bronco hump on the back. Ol' Nessy had lured me in again - hook, line, and sinker. What had become my worst fear at some point in the night eventually became my saving grace, as we haven't seen each other again since.\n\n**TL;DR: This is the farthest I've gone for the sake of a joke.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369914648", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Imagine a sheltered young boy, growing up in the priveliged neighbourhood of /r/bestof, walking outside and seeing the true nature of humanity instead of its best and brightest. Imagine a superhero saving Reddit City itself from the goddamn Loch Ness Monster, the alien dragon known as T'reefiddy.\n\nWell written, I believe this idea can be entertaining, heartfelt and satirical, a love letter to and a playful critique of the wonderful website that granted us this opportunity.

{"body": "I was under the impression dementors were present in areas where that feeling was the norm, as if the dementor were being offered as a possible explanation for the feeling by the author. Rowling does this a few times, \"explaining\" mysteries the muggles would never understand, like UFOs and the Loch Ness Monster (though those were only in the beastiary she released, I can't recall the name of it... might have been the Monster Book of Monsters, named for the text in HP of the same name).\n\nYou're right, there's nothing in canon to support Dumbledore using dementors, but the mechanics exist in the story to allow for the possibility, so it would be unfair to ignore the strategy, even though it's not a conclusive one.\n\nI know a lot about Hulk and I'd be happy to answer any questions. I'm no expert, but I've done a lot of reading on him and even tried to [mathematically figure out his maximum logical potential](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1aw90d/discussion_hulk_limits_and_weaknesses_warning_math/) once. I failed miserably, but the post was fun and a lot of people enjoyed it.\n\nPetrificus totalus cast by Dumbledore might be enough to slow Hulk down, but not to stop him. Remember that Hulk is still resistant to magic, just not as resistant as he is to other forces. But you're right, it would at least buy Dumbledore some time. \n\nOff the top of my head, I only know a few spells. I'll go through their probable effects on Hulk in this situation.\n\n* Wingardium Leviosa- Nothing. Might be able to throw things at the hulk or move something into his path as a shield, Hulk would smash either.\n\n* Reducto- Hulk may take heavy damage, but it would heal quickly and would make Hulk angrier.\n\n* Diffindo- might cut Hulk's pants off, but that might just serve to distract Dumbledore. 'Cuz Dumbledore's... y'know.\n\n* Sectumsempra- might be enough to make Hulk bleed, but would hurt and make Hulk angrier. The nice thing about it is that the spell seemed to be resistant to even magical healing methods. This is another inconclusive one, but it *might* be something Hulk's healing would have trouble with. Still, it's a bit dark for Dumbledore to use.\n\n* Imperio- No effect, might cause damaging feedback on the user. Hulk's rage is so powerful, it usually kicks out any telepath who tries to bother Hulk. Hulk is also strong enough and smart enough to know that clapping and rupturing the eardrums of a telepath eliminates their ability to concentrate and thus renders them ineffective.\n\n* Crucio- VERY BAD IDEA.\n\n* Avada Kedavra- we discussed this above.\n\n* Any fire spell- useless. Hulk has taken a lot more heat damage than Dumbledore could produce.\n\n* Water Spells- maybe. Hulk *can* suffocate, but many have tried and it's never worked, so while it may be possible to drown Hulk, it would be a poor choice when on a time limit, which one always is when fighting Hulk.\n\nThe other spells I know are mainly non-combat.

{"body": "Not sure if at school count as I only finished last year but heres a long one..\n\nWhen I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\nOne day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\" I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies? I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy. The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free. So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence. I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\nNope.\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too. He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars. Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\nFast forward one year. I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\"What?\" I asked. He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again! I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\nSo yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst here.

{"body": "\nNot total nudity, but def upper body lady nudity and really embarrassing...\n\nWhen I was about 14 I was one of the \"good students\" that got to help the \"adults\" lead the chapel service at my episcopal school. There were these little changing stalls for us to switch into acolyte robes at the front of church. On this particular day they had appointed this new girl from the freshman class. Let's call her Sally. She was really sweet and nice but I don't think she was the brightest star in the sky if you know what I mean. Normally your just take the robes and put them over your school clothes and tie the rope around your waist. \nOn this day we weren't having normal chapel we were having one of the \"learning \" days which was a day to learn about other faiths an make people feel included that weren't Christian. We had a doctor from India ( this was a small west Texas town, resources limited) come to speak with us about Hinduism.\nSo everyone is gathered in the chapel and I looked over at the new acolyte (student helper) and notice her ankles are showing. Kind of weird since she was wearing jeans earlier. But we were busy greeting students walking in so I didn't think much of it. When our guest speaker arrived I realized it was this extremely conservative douche bag who was Hindu but had the personal beliefs of some nutty right wing douchebag republican. This guy made Rick perry look like Karl Marx\nSo they start the service in which we all have to walk along the aisles singing and all this horribly cheesy feel good shit.\n\nThat's when the worst thing that could happen to a young vulnerable teenager happened. I still can not believe this happened to the poor girl but the 300 students and 30 teachers who saw it never were able to forget. Sadly for her it also makes me laugh a little to this day.\n\nI guess Sally forgot to tie her robe shut properly because the rope snagged on the little metal candle holders that were at hip level on the front of the pews where they put the bibles and hym books. This girl had also failed to tie the inside ties on the robe that keep it shut if the belt falls off. Also, shockingly Sally had removed all her clothes except panties before chapel.\n\nBefore she really notice what happened she also tripped due to the rope that snagged pulling on her belt loop. \n\nWe all went dead silent as Sally fell to the floor right in front of the guests chair . He looked horrified. Everything went silent except for the organist who started playing softer and slower which just made it more awkward. Then Sally just looks up right into the doctor's eyes and says,\" I need...... I need about tree fiddy\"\n\n Now it was about this time that I realized Sally was seven stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "My high school was about 95% Asian-American. There's one thing you have to understand about the high school Asian-American mindset. We love everything Asian. K-pop, C-pop, boba, you name it. \n\nSo it was a big deal whenever we had an Asian teacher. Even bigger deal when it was a young Asian teacher. So imagine when we got not only a young female Asian teacher, but she was smoking hot (by high school standards).\n\nEvery boy in the school had a crush on her and hoped that they would be assigned to her English Lit classes. I was one of the lucky ones who got her for two classes, one honors and one AP. I would seriously pinch myself at the thought of being able to stare at her hotness for half of my high school tenure.\n\nShe would also offer extra credit for students who stayed after school to read books from a list she posted and discuss with other students, just as a way to get us to read more. I don't know whether or not she knew that 50% of her students were smitten with her, but if she didn't, she delighted in the fact that so many students were willing to \"read\" after school, when in fact most of us were there to spend more time in her presence. Gifts, photos, all a-plenty as well. It was a rat race for the slim chance of getting to know Ms. P \"better\".\n\nOne day, as I was leaving the after-school session, I noticed that Ms. P had dropped a pencil, and as glorious as a mountain-top sunset, she bent over and I got a full view of her bra-less bosom through the top of her shirt. Even if it lasted only for a half second, I felt like a god. Literally a top 3 moment of high school for me.\n\nAlas, that was the farthest I, or anyone, got with her... while in high school...\n\nSeveral years later I went back to my high school reunion. By then Ms. P had been erased from my memory. College happened. I had multiple girlfriends and sexual partners, most of them much more attractive than Ms. P. So I went to the reuinion just to catch up with people I had not spoken to or seen in years. There was a full bar, and we were happily reliving the good ol' days when suddenly out of the corner of my eye I see who else but Ms. P walk in, wearing a low cut dress, silver high-heels and a gorgeous hair-do. I swear every guy in the room must have remembered long-lost memories of English class wood.\n\nSomehow, we end up talking, probably because she knew I went to the same undergrad that she went to. Conversation started simple enough; is that intro astronomy professor still there? did you like that hot dog stand on the corner of bleh and blah? \n\nHowever, the more we drank, physical contact became more and more frequent. And then, finally, during one of the dances, she whispers to me, \"let's head out...\"  Of course I obliged the chance to live out a childhood fantasy. So I followed her as she lef me out of the gym and into the locked and empty teachers' lounge. Without hesitation, she shoved me into a leather couch and starts ripping off my clothes. Thankfullly, I was sober enough to realize that begetting a child with my former high school teacher wasn't the best career move, so I told her, \"hold on, I need to put on condom.\"\n\nShe replied, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Ms. P, this teacher I had a crush on for my entire high school life, was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as I ran out of the teachers' lounge and into my car.\n\nI have not been back to a high school reunion since.\n\n**TL;DR** - Nearly hooked up with hot high school teacher at a high school reunion", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370015883", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Anywayy, this didn't stop me from taking pictures and giving them out, and I enjoyed all the attention I got as a result. I didn't really get 'bullied' about it, unless you count guys constantly asking me if I'd have sex with them as bullying (the answer is still no, btw). I didn't actually want to have sex with them cuz boys are gross but I would make out with guys occasionally at parties, just enough so they wouldn't lose hope as a group and dismiss me as just a tease. I was kind of popular already, so the other girls never shit talked me to my face lol. A lot of the girls in the grades above me HATED me though, but thats just cuz they were jealous that their boys liked me ;)\n\nAs you can imagine, when I was by myself masturbating it was incredibly hot knowing that all the guys at school would kill three and a half or more people to be there. Just thinking about it got me halfway there.\n\nAll this fame and attention was great, but it wasn't making me money, which I needed. I didnt even think of charging money for sexual favors until one day at a houseparty one particularly drunk senior boy came up to me and he reeeally wanted me. He was cute but I didn't want to just hook up with people so casually like that, I wanted to at least have a date or something romantic first, idk. He was getting desperate and at one point said something like \"please! I'll give you all the money I have\" and I was like holy shit I could totally make money like this. I figured I'd extort him for as much as I could so I tried to be as sexy as possible. I bit my lip and pushed him up against the wall and whispered sexily in his ear \"I need about tree fiddy.\" That's when he realized that I was actually a fifty foot crustacean from the Mesozoic era. \"God damn you Loch Ness Monster!\" He exclaimed, \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked him again!\n\nI swam away, sexily of course.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370025278", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1434, "controversiality": 0}
