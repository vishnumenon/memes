Simply because men are more visual than women towards the female body than women are to the male body doesn't add any merit to the fact that \"women are more objectively attractive.\" \n\nPlus, let's consider the fact that less than a *third* of adult males during the paleolithic era passed on their genes, whereas almost every female passed on their genes.

{"body": "I returned from my job exhausted, and collapsed on the couch to watch some TV. First channel I flip to is reruns of the Dillionare. How about no. I change to some other channels – there’s a documentary about the failed ET video game, some news about a plane that crashed into an apartment building, nothing interesting. I decide to go on the computer and surf the web, maybe check my messages on Reddit. But before I can do so, I notice a package left in front of my keyboard. It is quite heavy. I slice open the tape sealing the box and am greeted with a miniature safe. I’m curious as to what is inside, but lacking the tools or knowledge of the combination to open it, I set it aside for later. Logging on to Reddit, I check for updates. Seems one of my submissions has gone viral – yay, more karma for me! I only have one message, and it is from a /u/MalevolentRubberDuck. Interesting username. The message consists of three numbers, “45 71 13.” I realize it must be the combination to the safe!\n\n\nThe safe open before me, I examine the contents. There is a small packet of Jelly Belly jellybeans, but unlike any I have seen before, they appear to glow in the dark. The bag they are in indicates the flavor is “Illusion-B-Gone.” Interesting. There is also a black disc about 2 inches wide and half an inch thick with rounded corners and a hole through the center. It appears to be monolithic except for a small button on the top. Lastly, there is a matte black cardboard box that looks the size of a tennis ball. However, shaking the box, it feels empty. I decide to check out the disc again and press the button. Something inside whirs to life and like something out of a Star Wars movie, a small hologram pops up! There is a stranger speaking, but he only says one sentence. “Your only hope is in the beans.” Beans? The jelly beans? Should I eat them? It probably isn’t a good idea to eat candy from strangers, though. I am interrupted from my thoughts when the disc beeps. Then again. And again, and again, each time faster. It’s almost like it’s … A BOMB! I chuck it across the room and hide underneath the table. When the beeping turns into a continuous tone, it ceases after a couple seconds and nothing explodes. Scared it is a trick, I wait a few more minutes in safety, until the hologram speaks up again. “Huehuehue, gotcha!” Gee, thanks, hologram.\n\n\nFeeling spooked, I decide to skip dinner and relax with a nice hot shower. First though, I need to take a dump. I lift the lid of the toilet, to see a rubber duck floating inside the bowl. Weird, considering I got a message on Reddit from /u/MalevolentRubberDuck. Coincidence, or something more? I pluck the duck from the toilet bowl, toss it in the dustbin, and proceed to go about my business. Done with that, I strip and draw back the shower curtain. There’s another rubber duck sitting on the soap tray. Doubly weird. I don’t care much for them, so I toss this one in the trash as well. But wait! The first one I threw out is gone! I try not to think about it too much as I take my shower. Finishing up, I step back outside to see…a third duck on the counter. It definitely was not there when I entered the bathroom. I look in the dustbin and see the second duck is gone. I start to panic.\n\n\nI run dripping wet and naked back to the safe, to get the bag of jellybeans, thinking I should take this strange hologram’s advice seriously. The jellybeans are “Illusion-B-Gone” flavored, so they must help with something like this, amirite? I tear open the packet and eat a single one. They taste good, but not like anything I have had before, so the rest of the packet soon follows. There is an almost immediate calming effect. As I place the bag back in the safe, my hand brushes against the box again, which no longer feels empty. Huh, how did I miss that? I open the box, and am greeted with yet another rubber duck. Groaning, I ask out loud “What do I have to do to get these ducks to go away?” But wait, that’s no rubber duck! That rubber duck is actually a seven story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era! She replies to my question, “I need about tree fiddy.” Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again! I stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.\n\n\nTo this day, I hate rubber ducks. And I especially hate /u/MalevolentRubberDuck.\n\n\n**tl;dr I really hate rubber ducks.**\n\n\nThank you, thank you. I would love, if possible to get a $20 Steam wallet code, but if not, then I would like a copy of The Witcher 2 ($20).

{"body": "There was a bit of an incident a couple years ago that I was involved in. Most of my friends know about it but I've never really talked about it in detail.\n\nI was at a house party with my roommates but we didn't know most of the people and nobody seemed to have any real interest in getting to know us so we left to go get some food after an hour or so.\n\nNone of us had a car so we decided to take a couple buses to a Jollibee's. It was kind of far but my friend had a craving for Filipino food and I was bit of an adventure junkie so we manage to get the other two roommates on board.\n\nI had a pretty decent knowledge of the bus routes so I told our group which buses to get on and when to transfer. Everything goes pretty well and we get off the last bus within walking distance of the Jollibee's.\n\nBasically, we just had to walk up the road for about half a mile and the restaurant would be right there. One roommate, \"Vince\", was notorious for being lazy/high maintenance and decided to chime in at that moment to complain quite vehemently about the walk.\n\nAfter a frustrating few minutes of arguing, Vince decides that he's going to call his brother and get a ride the rest of the way. The rest of us couldn't believe it. We had all known that Vince was needy but this seemed ridiculous\n\nThe other roommates and I decide to just go and walk the rest of the way without him while he waits for his brother. So we get the Jollibee's and order our food before he gets there. We wait for about an hour before we get fed up and start heading back to the bus stop.\n\nAt this point I was mad. We had been trying to reach him through text messages and phone calls but he wouldn't answer. We all believed that he had ditched us and turned off his phone.\n\nWe talked shit about him during the walk down the road until we saw police cars. There was a wreck in the middle of an intersection where it looked like a coupe and a SUV hit each other. We kept walking for a bit until my roommate yelled that he recognized the coupe.\n\nIt was my Victor's brother's car. We sprinted toward the scene and saw body bags down there. As we went down I couldn't help but feel like I was in a movie or a dream. The whole thing was surreal. I saw Vince's brother sitting on the ground but I couldn't see Vince.\n\nOne of the police officers asked us to stay back but we all started telling him that we know the brother. They started telling us that we needed to stay back for now and that the brother was in no condition to talk so we started asking them what happened.\n\nThe officer told us that the coupe had run a red light and hit the SUV. We asked about Vince but he wouldn't give us any more details other than that the brother was going to be taken to the station for a breathalyzer test.\n\nAnother officer came up and started asking for our names. Then he took us off to the side and started asking us questions about why we were there, how we knew the victims, etc.\n\nAfter my questioning, I told the officer that if I could help in any way to let me know. He looked me in the eye and got really quiet for a second. Then he told me that he did need something.\n\nHe said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that's when I noticed that the police officer was about 500 ft tall and from the paleolithic era. And I said, \"God dammit you Loch Ness monster! I ain't giving you no fucking tree fiddy!\"\n\nAnd then we went home and ate chicken and spaghetti and shit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370074849", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I know you said \"not stalked\" but it's part of my experience... sorry (DAE Canada)\n\nWhen I was a teenager there was a teacher who I used to be obsessed with. She was in her mid 20's and I lusted after her every day. Mrs. Scott. I still remember that Mrs. Scott was around 5'11, single, and she had the most perfect body ever. Holy hell. Every single boy in the grade did whatever she said because we all wanted her.\n\nAnyways, my obsession got to the point where I decided I'd begin to stalk her. Kind of for excitement, but at the same time kind of because I lusted after her.\n\nAfter a month of stalking her here and there I knew a lot about her. I knew she was single, I knew where she lived, I knew which Starbucks she went to every morning before she came to school, I knew a ton of things about her.\n\nI'm trying to make this kind of short because it's really a long, long story, but I got the dumbest idea ever after about a month of obsessing over her. I decided I'd try to ask her out at her home after school.\n\nI know, it's a really dumb idea, but at the time it sounded like it'd work and I was obsessed with Mrs. Scott and in my little teenage head it sounded like a good idea.\n\nAnyways, so during school one day I decided to sneak out early and make my way over to Mrs. Scott's house. I got there about 10 minutes before school ended and it took her 20 minutes or so to get home, so I waited there for around 30 minutes before she finally got home.\n\nShe got out of her car and walked up to her doorstep where I was standing. I remember she dropped her keys in surprise and said, \"Oh, hello (my name). What are you doing here?\"\n\nI cringe thinking about it, but I replied, \"Mrs. Scott. I just want to tell you that I think you're an amazing teacher and I think I have a little crush on you. I know I'm only your student, but would you like to go on a date sometime?\"\n\nMrs. Scott looked at me for a moment and started to giggle. She explained to me that we couldn't date because I was her student, but in truth she had a little crush on me too. We could have sex and stuff, but no one could know.\n\nI couldn't believe it. She invited me into her house and into her bedroom. When she walked in the room I kissed her and she kissed back. Things got pretty heated up and we were about to start stripping each other when she said, \"Wait.\"\n\nKind of annoyed (because I wanted to make out) I said, \"Yes?\"\n\nShe said, \"I need something before we make love.\" Kind of confused I said, \"What do you need?\". \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Mrs. Scott was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had tricked me again!\n\nI went back to school and acted like nothing had happened. Mrs. Scott wasn't there anymore unsurprisingly. I don't know where she moved to, but I can only assume she had a lake side home somewhere or something...\n\nNone of the students ever questioned me about it because they didn't know. (Though a few friends did know about my obsession..)\n\nTL;DR: Obsessed over teacher.

It's more as if I strongly believed in saving the Loch ness monster. Yeah, I'd feel disrespected if you called me stupid for throwing dog food in the Loch every weekend, but I'd still be wrong and my actions would still be foolish.\n\nNow you can point out all the reasons why the Loch Ness monster doesn't exist, but no matter how nice or rational you are, if I'm dedicated to saving Nessie, I'll still be annoyed and angry that you're telling me that I'm being silly. \n\nHopefully though, if I'm not convinced by reason, then jokes and prodding will keep other people from dumping dog food into the lake or believing in an imaginary creature. \n\n\"Hey guys, everyone's making fun of Sweet_baby_cheezus's Loch Ness monster belief. I guess it is kind of silly when you think about it.\"\n\nAs for why I feel ok with trying to convince people, it's because religion feels it has a right to convince people *and* intrude in their lives. You don't see too many jokes about shintoism on here because shintoism has fairly little effect on our lives. I still think it's silly, but I'll leave it alone because it leaves me alone.

I wasn't saying his joke had no basis, but the push back he got was for saying prayer has no value, which it doesn't.\n\nA hate group is a group that hates people for who they are.

Pretty tall guy, I didn't really think anything of it as I had my headphones in and I was jamming pretty hard. \n\nAfter a few blocks, I had realized the dude with the hood had crossed to my side of the street and was following behind me. Again, I didn't really think anything of it. I continued walking and decided to just turn back and see what was up with this guy and realized he had picked up his pace a little bit.\n\nAt this point, I was starting to get a little nervous, but I didn't want to let it show in an unfamiliar city in the middle of the night. The dude behind me was getting closer and closer and I could feel his eyes on the back of my head. I was scared by now, and decided to take a shortcut down a little side alley. \n\nWhat I didn't realize was that this alley was a dead end and as soon as I reached the end, it was too late and this guy was right behind me, definitely following me. I faced the wall at the end of the alley and all of the sudden I could feel his breath on the back of my neck.\n\nThat was when he uttered his first words to me and scared me so bad I literally shit myself. He grabbed me and put me in a headlock and whispered in my ear \"tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that was when I realized the strange tall man with a hood following me was just the Loch Ness monster the entire time.

One day I was out sailing with my dad, and the boat just went up and down like a cork among plastic bags. I asked my dad a lot of questions about tears. Then my father told me to go down to the water, and see the women weeping there. Afterwards he told me to go up into the mountains: The men there are weeping too he told me.\n\nI guess he wanted to tell me that everyone cries at some point. But I still couldn't quite get it into my head. I asked: \"Father, why are all the women weeping?\". He answered: \"They are weeping for their men\". \"Then... Why are all the men there weeping?\" I asked back. His answer? \"They are weeping back at them\".\n\nWe went out sailing again later and once again I asked him the same thing. Only I was wondering why children cry more than adults. This time he answered that children don't really tear their hearts out from tears. They don't weep - they merely cry. As he said it \"True weeping is yet to come\".\n\nLater, after a long silence in the boat, I noticed that his face seemed wet to touch. I asked him if he was weeping, and what he was crying so much about? It was at that point that I noticed that my father was actually 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era. He started singing [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqhOVY58zIo), and asked if he could borrow about three fiddy.\n\nI never truly recovered from that.

{"body": "So once I had to sub for a teacher who got put on administrative leave for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15 year old girl in his class. He hasn't been formally charged yet, but there had been a long history of rumors that he had been doing this sort of thing with his more impressionable female students over the years. From what I learned the school board had received word that someone had proof of what was going on and was planning to come forward, so they put him on leave and started an investigation themselves before the formal charges were dropped to cover their asses.\n \nAnyway it was awkward as fuck when the students inevitably asked \"Where's Mr. So-And-So?\" And while we all *knew* what was going on, if I were to say \"he was diddling one of your classmates\" I'd be in a shitload of trouble. So there was a lot of dancing around the topic that made teaching his English Lit classes that much more difficult. Besides the fact that he was a shit teacher who left me with no real lesson plan or overview of what he had covered so far. I'm guessing that was out of spite, but it made my job that much harder.\n \nAfter the first day of covering his classes were over I was sitting in his office trying to hash out where to go with his classes based on what I had gleaned from asking the students about what he'd taught so far. Then I hear this pounding on the classroom door. It sounded like someone had taken a 10-lb frozen turkey and was slamming it against the wood. I opened it, and to my surprise there was a huge, angry man there. I guess the girl's dad hadn't got the memo that the guy who had probably taken advantage of his daughter was on leave, as he started spewing obscenities at me while describing the ways he'd painfully end my worthless life at a pretty high volume. I kept trying to stammer that I was just a substitute, but I was kinda terrified and he was kinda on a roll. I finally just shouted \"I'M THE SUBSTITUTE TEACHER!\" and his face just turned beet red. He apologized profusely, and I told him not to worry about it. I was just glad I wasn't about to get my ass beat in on the first day. Then I asked him, \"We'll since you're here, is there anything I can do for you?\" To which he sheepishly replied \"I need about tree-fiddy.\"\n \nIt was about that time that I realized the girl's  father was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Godammit Loch Ness monstah, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370200900", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1180, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I did a Disney-sponsored/themed pageant when I was eight. Honestly, my family and I were and still are *far* from those sparkly showbiz types, but my parents decided \"hey, could be fun\" and I joined.\n\nMy talent was singing (note: I can't actually sing, but I couldn't dance, twirl batons, etc. either so singing it was!) I was taking lessons from a nice voice coach (just a regular voice teacher, not those pushy, competitive types) at the time, so I took weekly lessons, and my song was Colors of the Wind from *Pocahontas* (even though my first choice was Reflection from *Mulan*. Grr). I can still remember every word of that song...ah, memories.\n\nAnyway, since I wasn't a pageant-bred girlie and entered just for shits and giggles, the whole thing went over pretty nicely for me. In comparison to a lot of the other girls, my parents did not spend as much stress and money on dresses, makeup, talent coaches, etc. My Pocahontas costume was thrown together at home and I wore a total of two formal dresses during the contest--one was my mother's old gown, tailored to fit me, and another was a newer one borrowed from a fellow contestant who didn't make it as far. I remember having my hair and makeup done a lot and being given lots of cool Disney-themed clothes and being asked questions by a pretty lady. :) All in all, it left me with little to no emotional trauma and I ended up placing 2nd runner-up, which was pretty surprising considering the lack of sparkles and complexity in my pageant entry. (Prize was a $500 check, a gift basket, and all the Disney clothes I modeled/catwalked in). \n\nThe first place winner though--I remember her quite clearly. She was a gorgeous little girl, and I found out she *did* do the whole beauty pageantry thing and had been in competitions around the country. Her gowns were substantially more elaborate than some of ours and she was trained to do the whole wave-and-smile, catwalk-and-prettiness shebang. Her talent piece was a dance routine performed to the Prince Ali Baba song from *Aladdin*--and she did the whole thing in a belly dancer's costume, gauzy harem pants and face veil and belly shirt, the whole thang. Naturally, it wasn't much of a surprise when she got first place. \n\nHopefully that answers your questions. :)\n\nEDIT: While I wasn't *forced* to do the pageant, it wasn't my idea to begin with. My parents decided for me, and I was all \"cool, I'll roll with it\", or something along the lines of what eight-year-old me would say.\n\nEdit once more: So the first place winner definitely knew what she was doing throughout, but maaan did her \"talents\" shine brightest at the last moments. In the last round when the final three winners were to be announced, she put on these \"oh woe am I\" airs and began to become very overwhelmed with emotions--or as overwhelmed as you can be when you're an eight-year-old pageant princess. As the names were called she seemed to grow more anguished, putting a trembling hand to her throat and holding back tears and wibbling her lower lip and oh!--when her name was finally announced as first-place winner she gave this cutesy little choke/cry/*hrk!*/hiccup/sob sound (that only twee bedazzled kiddies can pull off) and was all \"OH MY GOD NO WAY\". And she managed to do all that without her mascara running, natch. So she looks around wide-eyed with awe and wonder (but appropriately graceful, too--wouldn't want the audience to think this was her first time winning pfft) and smiles all pretty-like. She takes her \"victory lap\" on stage, princess-waves all around, and seats herself on the glitzy \"throne\" in the center of the stage. As she is crowned with the tiara she blows kisses to the audience, waves to her mom, all stuff she's been taught what to do. Then the announcer lady asks how she is feeling, what she plans to do with the prize money, all that good stuff, and Pageant Princess answers, \"I wanna thank my mommy and daddy, and I wanna give them something back for making me their little princess in their hearts.\" Everyone AWWWWs collectively. Such a sweet little girl with sweet, obviously-scripted answers. Bless her soul. \"Aww, that's so nice, honey. And what are you gonna give back to your mommy and daddy?\" announcer lady coos. Princess looks right at the audience and in the cutest voice that would melt a heart of ice, she says, \"about tree fiddy\". It turns out the pageant judges had crowned a towering green plesiosaur the new Pageant Princess. Announcer lady *snaps* and she bursts out \"GODDAMMIT LOCH NESS MONSTER, I AIN'T GONNA GIVE YOU NO TREE FIDDY.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370210559", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 444, "controversiality": 0}

We encourage women to be submissive, we tell females that it's ugly and unfeminine of them to try, strive and achieve.  We willingly suppress the intelligence and determination of girls to adhere to a concept of womanhood which completely cripples females today (and I believe has for a long while).  I think that without the yolk that all modern post-agricultural industrial societies throw onto the shoulders of women, the field would be much more balanced than it is today, and women wouldn't stand at such a huge disadvantage to men in terms of hierarchical societal position.  \n\nI think that, taking away all the variables that have shaped the way women are treated and behave today, you end up with a state of humanity wherein agricultural doesn't exist and set sexual divisions of labor don't exist either.  \n\nWe know that both of these circumstances were met in the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "&gt; the point of Paleo is to eat nutritious food that won't do you harm, not to play some game of finding a strict list of things to eat/not eat based on history instead of health. \n\nYou can't just arbitrarily come up with a subjective \"point\" of what Paleo is and then extrapolate your definition of paleo to encompass that point. Really paleo is short for \"paleolithic\" for the reason alone (stated in the latter part). It's not about *finding* the list, it's about eating them. We let the scientists do the leg work of finding what cavemen ate.\n\nAs an analogy, saying that potatoes are paleo is like equivalent to saying the following: The point of \"Starting Strength\" is to make people strong, therefor changing it in way that will still make you strong will still be considered \"Staring Strength\". So if I change the rep scheme to 3 instead of 5 (which will still make you strong), and then say that a 3-rep scheme is *part* of a Starting Strength - that's wrong. It's a *similar*, sure, but Starting Strength is not 3-rep program, and so a 3-rep scheme is *not* a part of Starting Strength - even if it makes you strong still (which is the point of Starting Strength).\n\nYou can say, \"I'm doing Starting Strength, except with a 3 rep scheme instead\" but you still have to accept it's not starting strength. Likewise, you can say \"I'm eating Paleo, except I include potatoes\" is still valid, but saying \"Potatoes are paleo\" is wrong.\n\nAnd well yes, obviously Paleo doesn't need to have a *only strict* criteria in the sense that something is either 100% paleo or not paleo at all. You can still eat Potatoes and say you eat Paleo if you're comparing yourself to people who eat processed food, milk and toast in the morning. But the core, the essence, of paleo is replicating the paleolithic diet, which is logically very healthy, but paleo is not necessarily coupled with eating healthy.\n\nPotatoes are *not* paleo for the sole reason that humans in the paleolithic era did not eat them. They may be healthy, and you can still say you eat paleo when comparing yourself to the average day folk, but potatoes themselves are not paleo.\n\nI eat vitamins (in pill form I mean) because they're healthy. I don't tell people that vitamins are paleo though, because they're not.

You may not have mentioned it but every other person I've ended up talking to from this subreddit is adamently in favor of it.\n\nRegardless, whether the decline of religion is due to an active process or a passive one, it would be on the same slippery slope. Assuming people stop believing for a reason, then there's nothing preventing that reason from being applied to other areas of life. What defense could a person have for believing in aliens among us or the Loch Ness monster if it is commonly accepted that God doesn't exist? Surely the same reasoning applies. The same goes for superstition or the interpretation of dreams.

{"body": "Here's my standard response;\n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims of theist unconvincing. Also, I can't name a single positive, tangible benefit that religion provides that can't be attained through secular means.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many gods can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370297105", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**PRELUDE:** *When I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.*\n\nSo this one day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\" I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies? I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy. The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free. So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence. I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\nNope.\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too. He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars. Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\nFast forward one year. I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\"What?\" I asked. He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again! I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\nSo yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst here. But I haven't eaten smarties since then, that's for sure.\n**TL;DR: Kid wants drugs, I give him some, sort of.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370300348", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This one night, when I was about 12, I was home alone becuase my parents were out at dinner. That whole night I felt like I was being watched by someone, or something, but I just shook it off and told my self to stop being stupid. Right about then, a streetlight made a sound and went off across the street from me. I look out the window, and suddenly the light came back on, and there was a figure standing there in a trenchcoat and sunglasses looking at me. I thought it was kind of creepy, but nothing to get really freaked out about, so I went back to the living room and continued watching a football game on TV.\n\nFast forward to about three weeks later. I was still thinking about the extremely peculiar occurence of that night. I wondered why that guy was standing there, and why he was watching me. Well, I that night, I really got a craving for a bag on Funyons. So I set out on my journey to the convenience store that was about half a mile down the road. Keep in mind, this convenience store was in kind of a sketchy neighborhood. \n\nWell, I get down there, and while in the store I get that same uneasy feeling that I got that night three weeks ago. I paid for my chips and walked out. That was when I saw him. There, about 20 yards down the road, was that man, still wearing the trench coat and sunglasses, watching me. If I was to go home the the way that I had come, the quickest way to the store and back, I'd have to pass him. This was out of the question at the time because I was alone in a sketchy area and was really freaked out. \n\nSo I turn left at the next intersection and I'm walking really fast and nervously at this point. I get to a dead end, and turn around to see if I was being followed. I saw nothing, so I turn back around. The man was right in front of me, with an insane grin on his face. I was trapped. \n\nI looked him in the eye and yelled \"What do you want from me?!\" He then leaned down and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370310929", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My friend thought that the ovaries of women were on the outside of their body, like 'female testicles'. I told him that he was completely mental to think this, but he actually did. He was home schooled in a Conservative Christian family down in Texas, and had just moved up to New York a few months ago to go to Columbia University, (I saw an ad on Craigslist about someone looking for a roommate for their apartment, and when I answered the ad we ended up becoming buds,) so I soon realized that he was completely serious. I tried telling him, no all the womans stuff is internal, the penis has to go into the vagina and the egg comes from the fallopian tube from inside the womans body. He kept insisting that “no, I know the penis goes inside the vagina, but they store the eggs in the ovaries outside the body, that way if women get hit in the stomach, they wont lose all their eggs.”\n\nThere was no changing his mind about these facts, so the discussion got pretty heated and we both got pretty pissed off at each other. Some words were said that I would not like to remember which eventually caused me to storm out of our apartment building. While walking outside, a woman of the night walks up to me and accosts me, saying “You look like you need a good time.” I began to give the dismissive “Thanks but no thanks” I had grown accustomed to saying, before an idea popped into my head. I looked at her and asked her if she would be interested in settling an argument. She asked what argument needed settling, and I gave her a brief description of my predicament. She did not believe me at first, but after I assured her that I was dead serious, she decided she would help educate a clueless Texan.\n\nWe got up to my apartment and as I walked in I called towards my roommates room to get out here to see someone. I told the prostitute (she told me to call her April, but I doubted that it was her real name) to get behind the kitchen table so my roommate could not see who was there. So my roommate shuffles out of his room, and I said, “[Roommates Name], let me introduce you to a hooker who will prove me right, please meet Miss. April!”\n\nAt this point, the prostitute stands up all showgirl like, and everything just freezes for a second before both the prostitute and my roommate's faces change to looks of horror. My roommate looks at the prostitute and says “Aunt May?” to which 'April' replies “Wait, it's not what it looks like, I just needed some money after your uncle...” at this point my roommate rushes out of the apartment, presumably to clear his head. After an awkward moment of silence I clear my throat, and ask Aunt May, “So uhhh, do you need anything? Something to eat? Should I call someone?”\n\nShe said, “Yes I could use some money for a cab. I should only need about tree fiddy.”\n\nAt this point I realized that the prostitute was actually a 60 foot tall creature from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "Well before I launch into this, I must point out that **I do not believe in the loch ness monster**. I have to say that up front because it seems like every time I open my mouth on this subject I get called some gullible fool who believes in the paranormal and rejects science. With that being said .....\n\nThe Surgeon's Photo is an otter.\n\nWhat is not widely known is that there were actually two surgeons photos. The [second one](http://www.loch-ness.org/images/surg2ndpic.jpg) is not shown too much and it is clear why. In the second photo its quite obviously an otter and looks nothing like the classical messie shape. If the second photo were more widely known, it would be obvious to everyone that this is just a picture of an otter.\n\nYou can see for yourself by comparing it to [this video of an otter](http://www.naturefootage.com/video_clips/TSC03_252) displaying the same head positioning. And most sightings of nessie can be explained by otters. [This other clip](http://www.naturefootage.com/video_clips/MB06_111) shows multiple otters swimming single file and therefore giving the appearance of being one creature with multiple humps.\n\nThere are several reasons to doubt that the picture is of a toy submarine with a prop strapped on top. Most obvious is that in the second photo, the shape is totally diffident than in the first one. If it was a prop, they would be the same shape in both pictures.\n\nMore to the point, toy historians and toy collectors state that toy submarines did not exist until nearly 30 years after the photo was taken.\n\nThe \"confession\" that it was a toy submarine should have some scrutiny applied to it. First of all, the \"confession\" did not come from the guy who took the photograph. It came from a guy who said someone else confessed it to him. And that other guy was not the photographer either. It was someone who this guy claimed had it confessed to him. And THAT guy wasn't the photographer either, but was a friend of the photographer. So in all the confession came from the brother in law of the son of the friend of the photographer.\n\nThe \"death bed\" part should be put into context. Nessie researchers were desperate to track down any scrap of detail they could find. So they found this guy, who knew this other guy, who knew the guy who took the photo. They came to him while he was dying of a terminal illness and demanded \"Admit it! It was a hoax!\". The guy who was dying told them to fuck off and go away. But they kept hounding him and pestering him. \"Look, cant you see I am on my deathbed here? Leave me alone.\" he tried to say to them. But they kept on pushing. Finally out of desperation he asked \"Ok, so if I confess will you go away and leave me alone?\" they said sure so the guy ~ confessed ~. \n\nThe motivation should also be suspect. The theory goes that the friend of the photographer wanted revenge on a newspaper that had made him out to be a fool. He would fake a photo, sell it to the newspaper, then when the newspaper published it he would get his revenge by making the paper look bad for publishing a hoax. But after the paper published it, the guy never came forward. If he wanted revenge enough to go to tall the trouble of MAKING the hoax, why stop halfway and never REVEL the hoax and actually embarrass the newspaper. Why stop the hoax halfway?\n\nAgain. I am not saying that the loch ness monster is a lost dinosaur or a seamonster. It is not. It is an otter. Im going by occam's razor here, and \"the brother in law of the son of the friend of the photographer claimed it was a hoax using technology that didn't exist until 30 years after the photo was taken all for the purposes of revenge that was never carried out\" is not the simple explanation. \"Its an otter\" is a simple explanation.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370352641", "subreddit": "RedditDayOf", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was that child. I swear that this is a true story and while I don't expect people to change their views, I saw what I saw.\n\nWhen I was in sixth grade, my friend Roger (not a real name...well, it is a real name, but it's not Roger's real name) had a sleep-over birthday party at an abandoned hotel that was rumored to be haunted. The owner of the hotel was Roger's dad's college roommate, so this was not a normal thing that people got to do. Roger was really into ghosts, UFO's, sasquatch (he still goes on squatch hunts), and other paranormal stuff.\n\nAnyway, the hotel was a masterpiece in its day and was still a really cool piece of architecture. The rumors are that the hauntings involve the people that died in several mysterious \"accidents\" over the years. A woman jumped to her death from her 8th story window; a busboy was decapitated in a freak elevator accident, a little boy was poisoned by his father, and a dance floor collapsed in the 1950s, killing about 80 people. \n\nWe set up camp on the dance floor and after about an hour of waiting for something to happen and nothing happening, we decided to play hide and seek. \n\nWe had been playing for about an hour when Roger's little brother David (his real name...screw David) was it. Being several years younger than the rest of us, he was terrible to play with. He was slow and the \"hiding\" went on for ever. I finally decided that I was going to let David catch me so we could move on, but I decided to scare the crap out of him first by sneaking up on him and yelling as loud as I could. I waited inside one of the guests rooms near the stairwell and waiting for David to come that way. I heard him coming up the stairs and as he skipped my floor, I started following him up. I thought I was moving quickly, but I lost David somewhere on the stairwell. At the 8th floor, I peek out and see David standing at the end of the hallway. I move stealthily from doorway to doorway, trying to get to him before he hears me. As I get to him, I put my hand on his shoulder and scream \"BOOOOOOO!\" as loud as I can. David doesn't flinch. Also, I'm not touching David. I should be...my hand is where David's shoulder should be, but there is no solid contact. Just air. It's not like a scary movie or anything, the boy didn't turn around and look at me. He just vanished. I had never seen anything like it and I probably would have stood there, stunned, for hours if hadn't heard Roger screaming \"HELP!\" \n\nI heard Roger's screams and ran down five flights of stairs until I found him in the middle of the hallway with his foot stuck in the floorboards. He said he wasn't hurt, but he couldn't get his foot out. I asked him how I could help him and he said, \"Can I get tree fiddy?\" It was at this time that I realized Roger was actually 8-stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.\n\nTL;DR: \"GAWD DAMN YOU, LOCH NESS MONSTAH, I AINT' GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370358427", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Forgive me if I'm completely off the mark here, as I'm still a newbie to Paleo, but I was under the impression that the reason a Paleo diet worked was not just because of the food you are eating. I've read several articles like this one, and read through several discouraging posts about a Paleo diet not being effective. None of the posts, and rarely in the articles do they say anything about physical activity. The Paleo diet works because hunter-gatherers were EXTREMELY active! Hunting, running, and building shelter to name a few, are incredibly demanding. Mix that with a solid, protein based diet and you are going to have very healthy people. In my opinion, to fully take advantage of the Paleo mindset, you have to mimic the physical side as well.\n\nPeople say the diet is \"extreme\" and potentially unhealthy. Well, yeah, it can be. But not if you are working out enough to justify eating this way. All I'm saying is, there is too much focus on the diet part of it, and not enough on the amount of physical activity that the Paleolithic era man was doing as well.

When I was about twenty I used to work at a gas station to make help make ends meet. It didn't pay very well but my pantry was stocked with food so I didn't really care. There was also this cute blond that I worked with but nothing came from that. Back to the story. My boss was heading out and in the last seconds he told me I had to work the midnight shift. I tried to argue but he simply wouldn't budge. I was stuck for several more hours at this god forsaken gas station. To help pass time I did numerous things. I took stock, cleaned the station, counted money, played snake on my phone, I even called up an old friend just to talk. By the time all that was done three hours had passed with two more to go. It was about two A.M when some guy walked in the store. He wore jeans and a simple coat. At first glance I didn't think much of him. He started to peruse through the chips and various candies. After watching him for a couple of minutes I simply went back to my phone and played snake more. I turned around to grab something for the desk behind me (probably a drink) when I heard the click of the hammer locking into place. I slowly turned around to find a .357 pointed at my head. The man had a scarfed pulled over his mouth to mask his identity. I looked into the mans eyes and saw no mercy. He didn't care that I was just some poor kid, all he cared about was what was in the register. He sternly told me to open the register and pull out all the money. I asked him what to put it in and he motioned his gun towards the plastics bags on the counter beside the register and then snapping back, pointed directly  in between my eyes. I slowly opened the cash register and pulled out the cash while he stared me down like a lion stares down it's next meal. Before I put the money in the bag he told me to count it. So I did. I slowly counted each bill and even the coins. I told him it added up to 112 dollars and 37 cents. He muttered to himself that it wasn't enough. I hastily started to pull out my wallet and ask him how much more does he need. He yelled at me to stop moving and I froze. He looked at me with his piercing eyes that seemed to gaze into your very soul and uttered one sentence. \"I need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that was when I realized this wasn't a gumen at all but an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Godammit Loch Ness Monstah, I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370408686", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied.\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\n\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.\n\nThey were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.\n\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\n\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.\n\ntl;dr: Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370432542", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The time when I was air lifted to the hospital.  When I was 6 I received my first cut requiring stitches, and since it occurred in a pile of dirt I was proscribed penicillin to take \"just in case\".  Normally when you take penicillin its no big deal.  Well I had never been on penicillin before, and come to find out I was allergic.  Not \"Oh its just a bit of swelling\" allergic, like full blown, no joke, stop breathing, make everyone around you shit your pants (but not me) anaphylactic shock. If any of you have never gone though anaphylactic shock I highly recommend not doing it.\n\nSo being as this was the first time I was ever found to be allergic to anything there was nothing, no epipen, just my mom's basic techniques.  Now I remember passing out right as the paramedics arrived (via ambulance).  From what I'm told they brought the epipen injected me and all that.  However I didn't react as quickly as hoped and they decided to airlift me to the hospital.\n\nOn the way to the hospital I wasn't breathing on my own and everyone was really scared (again this was relayed to me years later, I was unconscious probably riding a unicorn in my dreams or something). When the helicopter lands at the hospital the decision is made to inject another epipen (if you work in the medical field you know this is generally a no no).  Well through some fluke of modern medical science I start breathing again and wake up a few minutes later.  As I wake up I'm tied to the bed (for a reason that was never explained to me), I look around and see a bunch of people in white that look very scary (i was like 6 at the time).  The doctor or nurse says \"Citizenkane86, your fine, just try to stay calm and breath normally\", to which I responded \"where are my parents and who are you?\", he said \"I'm (whatever his name was), you're at the hospital, your parents are outside, would you like to see them?\", I replied \"yes\", still breathing really heavily and being generally out of it (I only know this conversation because my mother was actually in the room), so he said \"Okay Citizenkane86, before I can let them in I need you to do something for me, think you can do that champ?\", I said I hope so, he replied \"good I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\".  It was at this point i realized the doctor was  8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  To which I started screaming, and my parents came rushing into the room to see what was the matter and calm me down.  It was a really long and traumatic ordeal, that I still have quite vivid memories of to this day.\n\nTl;Dr don't give people penicillin who are allergic to it", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370454625", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Damn I've got a story. K so I used to do contract granite installation. I had this one job with my boss for a big countertop company. It was a hotel. The entire thing. We had been working like 70 hours in 5 days a week. It was bollocks. So I had been understandably tired. I remember whenever we came back to the shop all the sales people and the bosses would harass us and joke about us not working hard. We were never commended on our efforts. I don't work for commendation but its such an easy thing to do and it makes your job so much more pleasant when people do. There was one woman at the office who would be nice to us. She was so sweet and endearing. We loved talking to her; she was always in a good mood. So one day, I came back to the shop and fell asleep sitting in a chair and this douchebag boss guy comes up to me and starts yelling at me calling me lazy and pathetic. I was tired beyond belief and I just started to walk away when I hear SLAAAAAP. I turn around and the women is there defending me and yelling at her own boss. Man she slapped the shit out of him. Seriously, you could see the finger marks. It's like someone propped her hand open, attached a rocket and lit it. The boss started freaking out obviously and she started losing her shit too. Turns out the had it out earlier that day over an issue with her car insurance injury claim (she had been hit in her car by some dude that ran a red, doing about 70kmh/40mph). She was yelling at him, he was yelling at her. I swear he was tearing up, the receptionist started crying cause she was a fragile girl (very sensitive and timid, I would never get mad at her, poor girl had a hard life growing up) and then the other boss comes out and is like hey wtf is going on we need to settle this right now! They go into a conference room and start yelling more. I go over to the receptionist who is about my age and just sit there and console her as best I can. Sent her out to get coffee cause she couldn't be the face of the company crying and scared. So I was sitting down just turning customers away from the showroom. Meanwhile my boss (since I was a contractor, I worked for another guy as his assistant) had gone out to get fuel and lunch. He comes back and starts to question me as to what happened. The sales people are all accusing me of being a lazy fuck and they told him I fell asleep in a chair. My boss starts freaking out and yelling at the sales people because I am not their employee technically. He had asked me to get some tools and that was it and then said just take er easy and visit with everyone. Then one of the sales people beaks off and says that no you're both lazy and useless. My boss goes up to speak with the company bosses. But they are in the conference room. He don't care. Bursts in and everyone is yelling now. Now what happens next is the meltdown part. My old boss is this short little man. But he is straight jacked, packing muscles like no tomorrow. Second in comand made racist comments about my boss (a mexican) and his wife. my boss called him a puto (fag) second in command slaps my boss. my boss decks him. The top boss, who yelled at me, goes to clock my boss. Before he can do that though, I caught his punch. He threw another with his left and I Bane'd (the part where him and batman first fight) the fuck outta him. I caught his other punch, both hands in my hand now. I pulled him as hard as I could towards me and just headbutted the living shit out of him. I turned and kicked him into the wall. I went to punch him and missed cause I got pushed by a salesman. My hand went through the wall and got stuck. I couldn't get my arm out and the salesman was coming to wrestle me to the ground to subdue me or something. My boss was pulled off the second in command in the meantime and that was being dealt with. So this salesman was coming for me and I had my arm in a wall. Out of nowhere, the woman who had stood up for me just annihilates the salesman with a fold up chair. She just came across his face with it. Dude gets dropped immediately. Finally I pull my arm out. Big boss gets up and is spewing blood from his nose. The salesman is on the ground and my boss is out in the shop and the second in command is on the floor. This happened over the course of about a minute. The receptionist comes back and starts screaming and calls 911. She runs off terrified. Cops come. Take statements. Everyone lies except me, the receptionist and the woman who stood up for me. My boss, the two bosses and salesman lied. Fortunately there's CCTV footage. The office park we were in had security cameras installed and the cops checked those. Towards the end of it all, the woman who stood up for me was suspended from work (not fired, because the head honchos were in the wrong, but she couldn't get away with slapping him), the second in command got fired and charged with assault because he hit my boss first, but he dropped the charges there. The big boss had nothing happen to him and the salesman was in the clear. However they were required to go to counselling to deal with their anger issues. The receptionist quit (I ended up taking her for dinner) and then there was me. I didn't get pressed with charges, but my perceived actions were what started this whole shebang, so I lost my job as a result. The cops were taking a statement for the record and eventually they came to me. They explained my rights and then asked what happened. I described the stress from the hotel job, the hours worked, the fuck ups from the factory's mistakes in fabrication and how it caused more stress and I told them who I punched and what happened. Four hours later I'm about to leave and go home and just sleep. As I get in my bosses car, one of the constables approaches and tells me, I need one more thing. I say yes officer, what do you need?\n\nAbout tree fiddy\n\n\n\nAt this point I realized that the police officer was actually a 500ft crustacean from the Paleozoic Era and that everyone that fought were actually smaller crustacean a from the aforementioned era. \n\nAH DAMNIT. Now he got his friends in on it!!\n\nAs an ocean randomly appeared, I shook my fist screaming at that Loch Ness monster and his friends, as they swam into the sunset.

Imagine Bugs Bunny raping Porky Pig\".  It was a joke, it was funny, it in no way contributed to an increase in rape or a reduction of society's abhorrence for violent crime.\n\n&gt;...IMO\n\nI think that's the most important part of your argument.  You're entitled to your opinion, but when your opinion is being utilized to coerce a performer into self-censoring to avoid offending a minority of persons in a diverse audience then you're fast on your way to becoming the oppressive force.  You would be better served to avoid situations, like comedy clubs with comedians who use adult themes, where you might be offended.\n\nAlso, comedy is overwhelmingly more popular than ever, and violent crime has dropped dramatically.  Rape and violent crime are down to a third of what they were 17 years ago.  Maybe comedy and the free discussion of ideas has increased societal awareness of a crime and made people more comfortable reporting it because the word isn't stigmatized.  \n\nMy mother was very fat, and was discriminated against all her life.

{"body": "Paleolithic societies were all polygamous. Actually, that's a stretch. Marriage wasn't even a thing. It was closer to how Bonobos live. People lived communally, and children were raised by the entire community. People didn't have a lot of resources. They were obliged to share everything, so \"inheritance\" wasn't a concern. \n\nConcepts such as \"fidelity\" and \"Monogamy\" were invented because of the changes to the economy. After the Neolithic Revolution, individuals had enough resources to not share, yet still survive. Wealth was hoarded on a personal basis rather than shared communally. In order to keep personal wealth in the family, concepts like \"marriage\" and \"inheritance\" and \"fidelity\" were invented. Inheritance was impossible to employ in the Paleolithic society since nobody knew whom the father of a particular child was. \n\nYour assumptions that the purpose of marriage is to \"profoundly appreciate\" and \"accept another human being's flaws\" are inherited from a romanticized view of society. And when I say \"romanticized\", I am implying that the Romantic Era (as in the era that followed the Neoclassical Era) arguably had the greatest impact on our modern ideals of \"love\". \n\nThe Romantic Era was all about spontaneity, irrationality, impulsiveness, creativity, mystery, etc. This might sound redundant, but the Romantic Era was literally romantic. Preceding the Romantic Era, marriage was still monogamous, but love was generally less quixotic. Arranged marriages were more common than not, similar to the plot of *Pride and Prejudice*. \n- - - \nThe Paleolithic Era was vastly longer in duration than the Neolithic Era and anything after that combined. Our biological drives evolved during the Paleolithic Era to favor promiscuity. Our recently invented economic system, on the other hand, favors fidelity.

{"body": "Oh boy do I have a story for this one! \n\nIt was Boxing Day, and I was having lunch with my dad and sister in town. We were at a pretty nice Italian place. After lunch I excused myself and went outside for a cigarette. I sat on a perch somewhere about 4 ft up. I can't really explain what I was sitting on, I guess it was a bit of architectural wank. \n\n\nI was playing with a deck of cards in one hand whilst smoking with the other (I'm a magician). This strange guy approaches me. I'm sitting with my legs crossed and his head was at about the height of my feet. He stands near me for some time, looking up, shaking his head and then looking away. Not to sound like a douche but I get a lot of people staring when I'm doing my card thing (look up cardistry for an example). He eventually musters up the will to mutter a soft 'hi'\n\n\"Hey.\" I respond. \"How's it going?\" He looks up at me, and then away again. This happens a few times and I work out he's a bit odd. I ask him if he wants to see a card trick. Not that I really felt like performing but sometimes I feel that if I've piqued someone's interest for long enough I should perform directly for them. He shakes his head and looks away.\n\nLooking up at me again, then away, then up, then away. He mumbles barely audibly 'I wanna ask you something.' I offer him a cigarette. He looks at the pack in my outstretched hand, shakes his head and looks away again. He repeats 'I wanna ask you something.' I had endeavoured to be polite to strangers at that time so as friendly as I could I told him to ask me whatever it was he wanted to ask me. He repeated himself again. This went on for some time, until couldn't think of a more comforting way to say 'Sure pal, you can ask me anything! Just ask me.' \n\nEventually he muttered 'not here.' I wasn't quite sure what he meant. But I got down off my perch and said 'what about over there?' As I gestured to a bench. He reluctantly nodded his head and I went over and sat on the bench. He slowly followed. \n\nAdmittedly as I lit my second cigarette I was getting a little frustrated trying to work out what this stranger wanted from me. I continued to reassure him that he could ask me anything. I was so desperate to know what he wanted to so desperately ask. \n\nWe continue the \"I wanna ask you something\" 'sure pal, just ask me!' Dance for a while. My mind racing over the possibilities. Eventually he says \"I wanna see you.\" I was taken aback but didnt really understand what he meant. 'You wanna hang out sometime?' I ask confused. He elaborates \"iwnasyonkd\" 'sorry, can you repeat that' my mind jumping to weird interpretations of that blurted sentence... Not believing what I thought I heard. I shit you not, these were the most audible words he spoke to me in this 15 minute exchange: \"I want to see you naked.\"\n\n\nI put my cigarette out and quickly went back inside. \n\n\nEdit: no trees or Loch Ness monsters.\nAlso male.

{"body": "I went to a wedding for a former roommate from college. This roommate, lets call him Tod, was a total drug addict. I'm talking hard drugs - heroine, cocaine, acid (though he was a regular pot smoker). Tod attempted suicide twice (once by ODing, the other time he was preparing to jump out his dorm window while high on all sorts of shit). When he OD'd it was me who found him and resuscitated him. I tried to call the police (I was pretty sure I'd broken a rib while attempting CPR, he was coughing up blood and all that) but he actually told me not to because he didn't want them to find his drugs. This event was what brought me to being his best man at his wedding. He was getting married to a girl I'd never met before, so he must have met her after dropping out of college. It was a simple church wedding but they had a picnic setup outside the church and all of the guests were wandering about there before the actual ceremony. While Tod was talking to his parents, I got a chance to talk to the bride. She seemed like a nice enough girl and based on the conversation I found out she had *no clue* about Tod's past. She didn't know about the drugs, about dropping out of college, about the suicide attempts; she though that Tod was getting a job as a journalist in NYC. I was shocked. So, the wedding ceremony starts, they say their \"I do's\" and then the minister says \"speak now or forever hold your peace.\" Tod is a friend, more or less, and this girl seems infatuated with him, but I've got to speak up. I can't let this woman walk into a marriage with a drug addict. I take a few steps forward and tell Tod that he has to let this girl know about his past, his addictions and his problems. Tod just looks at me, and says these five words: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time that I noticed Tod was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Yeah but buddy, doesn't it seem kind of odd that dramatic supernatural things are reported only in places where it's difficult or impossible to get reliable, testable data? I mean, the biblical verse you pointed out has God saying that you should only believe in this stuff if it can be verified as true. But for whatever reason, it seems to only be happening in places where the evidence is at best, anecdotal. Why is God so camera shy?\n\nAnd for that matter, reports of dramatic supernatural activity which are equally well attested to come from almost every religion. Surely you don't find this to be legitimate evidence of, say, the miraculous power of Hindu gods? What about reports of UFOs, Fairies, mermaids, the Loch Ness Monster, glowing-eyed hairy bipeds, and all manner of strange phenomenon, all of which we have no shortage of reports on (and many reports which are actually significantly *better*-attested to than their religious counterparts). It's clearly possible to experience all manner of strange things, but is it rational to then assume this is evidence of all manner of varied supernatural phenomenon?\n\nAs for your own personal anecdote, I think we can explain it rather easily. Your brain is an amazing pattern-seeking machine, and it constantly seeks to impose patterns of meaning on experience. Sometimes it identifies real patterns, and sometimes it can identify arbitrary ones, too. You perform a million small actions during the day without note, but once your brain identifies one which it focuses on, it will appear to overwhelmingly meaningful and self-confirming. This is a combination of the [Confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) and [Recency Illusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_illusion) (also sometimes called the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon). Hence, meaningless random chance becomes significant only when you've trained your brain to identify mundane things as signs of a higher power.\n\nI should stress, I'm not trying to say that you're experience is invalid. Your experiences are your own, an it's certainly possible to *subjectively experience* a great deal of weird stuff in this crazy world. The problem is, as you well know, your senses and your brain can be misleading... that's why we rely on testable data to give us good objective information about the world. And when we look at this sort of information, suddenly evidence for supernatural phenomenon evaporates. \n\nI only bring all this up because your initial post actually has God asking for something similar: check out the claims, and see if it pans out. Problem is, if we subject his own claims to this criteria, it seems to come out lacking. So, doesn't it seem like there's a pretty logical, obvious possibility you're ignoring when it comes to claims of the supernatural?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370557339", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The poor teenager just trying to pay for car insurance didn't appear to have the energy or gusto to make this cockbag regret helping himself to the express lane when he exceeded the item limit, so I was sobered to realize that I had some ass to kick.\n\nI cut off the limpdick in a polo as he began to tell the customer his total and enable this unspeakable bullshit. \n\n\"HEY,\" I cried out from further back in line. He shot me a startled glance, but began to pull out his wallet to pay. I was at the point of no return now. \n\n\"Just who the FUCKING SHIT do you think you are, motherfucker?!\" \n\n\"What are you talking about, man?\"\n\n\"Can you READ?! JESUS GODDAMN CHRIST, it says 12 ITEMS OR LESS. HOW MANY ITEMS DO YOU HAVE?!\" He was trembling now, realizing just who he'd pissed off.\n\n\"I... uh... I...\"\n\n\"YOU WHAT? SPIT IT OUT, BITCH.\"\n\n\"I don- I don't know.\"\n\n\"YOU ILLITERATE NEEDLEPRICKED FAGGOT, YOU HAVE THIRTEEN ITEMS. IS THIRTEEN LESS THAN TWELVE?\" I could see tears welling up in his eyes now, but my blood was a boiling sludge of adrenaline and testosterone. I'd never felt more alive. He started to speak, but I shut him down.\n\n\"NO. NO IT'S NOT. ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED?! WHAT THE SHIT MAKES YOUR ARROGANT NIGGER ASS THINK THAT THE PEOPLE BEHIND YOU IN LINE DON'T HAVE PLACES TO BE? WHAT IF EVERYONE BROKE THE ITEM LIMIT, DICKNOSE? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN? RULES EXIST FOR A REASON!\"\n\nAt this point, I was foaming at the mouth, flecks of spit flying everywhere. I was seeing red. Just then, I lost control. I was tired of being stepped on by pompous jackoffs like this guy. It was time to make a point. I pulled the Smith and Wesson X-Frame revolver from my waistband, and by the expression on his face, I could tell that he knew what was going to happen next. I simultaneously frightened and impressed myself with a sudden sense of pure, unadulterated calmness.\n\n\"Get on your knees.\" The tears were flowing strong from his eyes now. I'd been so focused on him that I looked around for the first time in a few minutes, and everyone in the store was agape in complete silence.\n\n\"Get on your goddamn knees or I'll kill you right now.\"\n\n\"Oh God, please, no.\" He quietly whimpered. \"I have a family. I have kids!\" I cocked the hammer slowly, and the soft click was deafening in everyone's ears. He dropped immediately and started feverishly praying amid desperate sobs. I bent over and whispered in his ear, almost too quietly.\n\n\"No God can save you now.\" I pulled the trigger.\n\nIn a flash of light and a crack of thunder, he exploded on everyone in the express aisle. This broke their silence, and the screaming chaos began. The building emptied out relatively quickly, with only the clerk behind the \"12 items or less\" register frozen in place because he was now at gunpoint.\n\n\"Check me out\", I said bitterly. \"I have shit to do.\"\n\nHe fumbled the box and managed to scan it. \"That... that'll be tree fiddy, sir. Cash or credit?\"\n\nAround this point, I noticed that the minimum-wage kid was actually a 350-foot-tall sea monster from the paleolithic era.\n\n\"Goddammit Loch Ness Monsta, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370557473", "subreddit": "CrazyIdeas", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, after we broke up she kind of went on a rampage because she wanted to get back together and I didn't. Apparently she thought that making me jealous was the best way to get me back, and she decided that fucking my best friend was the best way to accomplish that.\n\nIt was summer here in California, and the three of us were just hanging out in the shade at a park near my house. Probably not the best idea to hang out with her after the breakup I suppose, but we had only been split for about a week and I still cared about her a lot. Anyways, I decided to walk down the street and grab a smoothie to cool down but neither of them wanted to go so I ended up walking all the way there by myself. It was nice and air conditioned in the Jamba Juice so I stayed there for a while to keep out of the heat, drinking my smoothie and talking to the people that worked there. After a little while I picked up a second smoothie for my ex and started walking back.\n\nBy the time I got back, the sun had gone down and it had cooled off considerably - to the point that, while I had been sweating on the way over to Jamba, I was now shivering from the cold air and the freezing smoothie. I got back to the park and looked around for them for a minute but couldn't find them. I started walking back to my car, and was dialing my best friend's number when I looked up and noticed that the windows of my car were COMPLETELY fogged up, utterly opaque. I just kinda stopped and had a little panic attack. I knew exactly what was going on, but at the time I was a very anti-confrontational person. I sat there in the cold for a minute trying to figure out what I wanted to do, then decided to call him and tell him to fucking knock it off. So they got dressed and got out of the car (out of which billowed the most nasty, sweaty, summer-sex-stank that I've ever smelled). He thought it was really funny, but I was pretty pissed about the whole thing. I got in the car and wiped the windows down with a towel I had in the trunk so that I'd be able to see, and told her to get in the car. I started driving her home, left him there to fucking walk to his house.\n\nOn the way there she kept trying to talk to me in some bullshit manipulative tone about how like... it was my fault because I wouldn't take her back and that she loved me and was just trying to get me to reciprocate her feelings I guess. I wasn't having any of it, I just blasted music all the way back to her house to drown it out and try to calm down. So I pull up to her house and tell her to get out but she won't, she just keeps going on and on about how we're supposed to be together forever and how much of a mistake she's made and all the typical post-breakup bullshit. I'm really feeling like shit at this point, so I told her she needs to get out of the car or else I'm just going to drive away and she can walk back home just like my friend. She says, \"Fine. One last thing, and I'll go.\" She had just fucked my best friend - in my car, with my condoms, and even after all that this bitch looks me STRAIGHT IN THE EYES, and says to me, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nI didn't talk to either of them for quite a while after that, but eventually we made up. To the best of my knowledge, neither of them either saw each other again, but I'm now casual friends with both of them. The funny thing was, if she hadn't fucked him then I probably *would* have taken her back. I guess life's funny that way, a backstabbing friend saved me from a continued relationship with her. Any feelings of love I still had for her died that night, and while it certainly hurt, it was nice to be free again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370563549", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I work in an office complex and I regularly go out for lunch at a Panera Bread just a few blocks away from the building. I always walk except when the rain is coming down hard. Every day, half way between my work and the Panera Bread, there is this homeless guy sitting on a turned-over recycling bin. I don't know if he is always there or what, but he always asks me to bring him back something. Always. He has grown to calling me \"tie guy\" because I'm usually wearing a tie. \"Hey tie guy, bring something back for me, will ya?\" \"Hey tie guy, spot me a sandwich!\" I'd been ignoring him for the past two months but one day I'm feeling generous and tell myself fuck it, I'll get him a panini. Walk back to the homeless guy's spot, he looks up at me and opens his mouth as if to say something and then I hold out the sandwich for him. He closes his mouth and takes the sandwich, unwraps it from the bag. **This is where it starts to get weird**. Homeless guy gestures with his hand to have me come closer. He takes off his shoes and puts the panini inside one of the shoes, spits on it, and then puts it on the ground. I shit you not this guy takes a piece of chalk out of his coat pocket and draws a circle around the panini-shoe, takes out a knife, and CUTS HIS OWN HAND. He rubs the blood on the panini-shoe and then gestures me to come closer again. I shake my head 'no' and back the fuck out of there. This guy is clearly bat shit crazy. The next day, I take a different (longer) route to get to Panera, and do the same the day after. This longer route resulted in me arriving to work late so I decide \"fuck it he's a harmless homeless guy/satanic acolyte who cut his own hand and probably died of an infection\" and take the short route. Come up to the spot where the overturned recycling bin is. Homeless guy is no where in sight, but his decomposing hell-panini is still there. Suddenly I feel a hand on my shoulder, feel hot breath on my neck and recognize the homeless guy's voice whispering in my ear five words: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I noticed the homeless guy was an 8-story-tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Couple of years ago I was on my lunch break and was sitting on a bench in a street mall. Noticed a guy standing off to the side pacing around and looking a bit angsty. I assumed he might have been lost or something, ignored him and ate my lunch. About ten minutes into my break the guy comes towards me and kinda stops about a metre off to my left. He then sits down on the other side of the bench, pauses, then shifts a bit closer to me. I look at him and he leans in, but doesn't say anything.\nI'm weirded out but just try to ignore him and sit in awkward silence. He then speaks and says \"I've been watching you.\"\nI was taken aback and say \"umm, ok.\"\n\"I was standing there watching you and you didn't see me.\"\nI don't know what to say, but eventually ask him why.\nHe shrugs his shoulders and says he just felt like it. I think he said he was doing an experiment or something.\nI nervously laughed and said \"ok I have to go back to work now\" and just bolted for it. I looked back to make sure he wasn't following. He had stood up and was watching me walk away.\n\nI saw him one more time after that. I went to the local library one day after work to study. It was just around the corner from the bench, so just behind the mall.\nI went in and went upstairs to the study area and as I went up, he was coming down. I didn't recognise him immediately, but thought he looked familiar. He had a look of shock on his face and ran down the stairs really fast. As I was walking I was trying to convince myself that it wasn't him. I sat at a desk facing the stairs, but then lo and behold he suddenly comes up the stairs really fast, looks around, doesn't see me as I've leaned forward and am hiding my face between the desk walls, plus other people's heads in the way. I see him go into an aisle to get a better look around, and then I lose track of him.\nI'm freaked out, but I've got a uni assignment to hand in the next morning and I need to finish it. I look around, move to the other side so I can see the whole room and then continue studying. \nI forgot about him until I started walking back to the train station, but no-one was around.\n\nHowever, I think he may have stolen my course book. That night, I accidently left my course book with my assignment in it on the seat next to me at the station. It was late on a weekday night, no-one else is on the platform and it's a pink poetry book (yes I did a poetry class at uni- twas pretty cool), and I was exhausted and hungry. I'm on the train when I realise what I've done, so I get off the next stop, speak to the station staff there and when they contact the other station, they say there's nothing there.\nSo I reckon he followed me and took my book. That or the tree-fiddy Loch Ness monster.\n\nTL;DR: Guy watches me eat lunch, tells me; follows me into library, probably stole my poetry book.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370571292", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Why is God so camera shy?\n\n[He is?](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201:20&amp;version=NIV) I see him very plainly, everyday, on the way to and from work. When I see the sky or the trees, I get the impression that I have been secretly allowed access to some great museum of some sort.\n\n&gt;And for that matter, reports of dramatic supernatural activity which are equally well attested to come from almost every religion. Surely you don't find this to be legitimate evidence of, say, the miraculous power of Hindu gods? What about reports of UFOs, Fairies, mermaids, the Loch Ness Monster, glowing-eyed hairy bipeds, and all manner of strange phenomenon, all of which we have no shortage of reports on (and many reports which are actually significantly better-attested to than their religious counterparts). It's clearly possible to experience all manner of strange things, but is it rational to then assume this is evidence of all manner of varied supernatural phenomenon?\n\nWhy, good sir, you seem to think that I consider such things illegitimate - but I do not. I consider them illegitimate only in the following sense: The people who report such things encounter the supernatural, but then conform it to what they know. A man in the amazon may, for instance, encounters a thing that can walk through walls and read his mind, and then he claims it is a spirit guide. I don't *doubt* he had an experience, and I don't doubt that it may have been supernatural; I merely question that it was a spirit guide.\n\nI say this because the fortean, the paranormal - is a topic I find *terribly* interesting; I once interviewed a ton of people on reddit regarding their sleep paralysis experiences to this end. \n\nNow, are all claims legit? No. Experience has shown pretty clearly that that a lot of reports are misidentification, and some portion are frauds. But, of this pool of reports, I am fairly certain that some of them are legitmate supernatural experiences, and I am furthermore, convinced that the broad spectrum of paranormal experiences, are in fact, mostly all the *same* phenomena, played out in *cosmetically* different ways. This is, in fact, not too far from the conclusion John Keel came to regarding the mirad of paranormal occurance he investigated:\n\n&gt;“Thousands of mediums, psychics and UFO contactees have been receiving mountains of messages from 'Ashtar' in recent years. Mr. Ashtar represents himself as a leader in the great intergalactic councils which hold regular meetings on Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and many planets unknown to us. But Ashtar is not a new arrival. Variations of this name, such as Ashtaroth, Ashar, Asharoth, etc., appear in demonological literature throughout history, both in the Orient and the Occident. Mr. Ashtar has been around a very long time, posing as assorted gods and demons and now, in the modern phase, as another glorious spaceman.” \n\n- John Keel, UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse, p. 230 \n\nSome interesting links: [1](http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2005/12/spirit-of-beehive_04.html), [2](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cienciareal/cienciareal07.htm), [3](http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/UFOs/UFOs_Aliens_Contactees.htm)\n\nTrust me when I say we could have some *very* interesting conversations about this, you and me.\n\nAs for the chance of bias on *my* behalf - I tell you, you're right! I *defintely* have had some false positives in the past, and I have become more aware of such possibilities. However, my position is very simply this: You say that *all* of my experiences are false positives, and I simply say that only a *portion* are; which means that yes, while I have been mistaken in the past, there have been other times when God *certainly* has worked in my life. (for instance: the time, when, over a series of years, I got [physically ill](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1fcxhm/we_get_sick_because_the_lord_spanks_us/ca97q2w) everytime I engaged in using pornography.) I am only a man, and frankly, men can make errors; it happens. Nevertheless, I do not believe that my entire mental process is one giant *continual* error, which it would need to be in order for all the strange things I (and let's recall, others) experience, to be illegitimate.\n\nIn short, I believe there are three possibilities regarding my answered prayers and other spiritual experiences:\n\n1. God exists.\n2. I, as well as others, are insane.\n3. A crack team of commando/spies are following me around, for unknown reasons, and have done so for the last decade, to play the world's most complex practical joke on me.\n\nAnyways, look at those links and and tell me what you think.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370614633", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, so this one time I got stuck in my house with bees.\n\nWe were moving to go to a new house in the country and were beginning to start packing. So since we were leaving my brother decided it would be a great idea to throw a beehive into the house(he's not very bright) since we were moving into a new house later in the month.\nWe were stuck in the house with bees coming around the house everywhere we looked even before we knew what was going on. I was running around the house and I thought it would be smart to go run into my room and close the door. Little did I know that's where he had thrown the hive into the house through the window.\nI ran into my room and closed the door, only to realize to late that I was trapped. I was stuck in the room screaming my head off with  a few hundred or so of the bees stinging me in my room, buzzing around like mad. I tried to wrap myself in a blanket and roll around on my bed to protect myself. I ended up going to the hospital with about 200 bee stings. The pain was agonizing for about a week and I still have a few scars from some of the stings.\nWe ended up having to call an exterminator over to the house before we moved to get the rest of the bees out of the house, because we still weren't going to move for another week. He exterminated all of the bees that day as we went out into the town to have fun and take our minds off of what had happened the previous day.\nWe returned from our day out to the exterminator having done the entire job, telling us there was likely no more bees, and that if we found any more to call him again. My mom walked up to him and asked him what the price was. He said, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" That's when I realized the exterminator was an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic Era.

{"body": "Oh I got this one.\n\n\nSo I met this girl through a mutual friend of ours at a gathering at his house for Memorial Day weekend.  We were talking over drinks and sitting by the pool and I thought \"man she's got a smoking hot body.  I'd love to see her again\" but I didn't want to be the creepy guy from the party asking for a chick's number.  Especially considering she was a friend of my best friend's wife.  I didn't know her story and I wasn't going in blind.\n\nSo I ask my buddy to talk with is wife about this girl.  He says he'll get back to me.  A week goes by and I hear no word back so I ask him again about the hot chick who I hit it off with.  He says he talked to his wife but she works a lot so it might be difficult.  I told him to just have her give this chick my number.  If I never hear from her, no big deal.\n\nA week goes by... nothing.  I figure nothing of it and then I get a text.  \"Hi, it's April.  Meet me for drinks Thursday night?\"  \n\nFuck yes I will.  I get ready that evening and head down to the bar we agreed upon.  It's a nice little neighborhood bar and grille not that dissimilar from an Applebees or a Fridays... but with better food and no douchebag bartenders with faux hawks.  We meet in the parking lot and she's just stunning.  She is wearing this tight little dress that shows all the right curves of her body and her hair is beautifully flowing off her shoulder.  I honestly thought for a second that I may have been under-dressed and that I didn't belong with this chick.\n\nWe walk in and sit at the bar.  We begin chatting again and catch up on what's been going on for the past few weeks.  After a few drinks, things are getting kinda serious and I figure I might want to take a stab at getting her back to my apartment.  I asked the bartender for my tab and, to my astonishment, the bill comes to $3.50.\n\nI look up and that's when I realize the bartender is a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era looking down at us.

{"body": "This will probably get buried, but I've got a story of the time I was getting interviewed for a job at a film/camera company (production of actual cameras, not movies). A bit of background: the night before, I had gotten black out drunk because I was celebrating a friend's birthday and completely forgot I had an interview in the morning. I'd also smoked a bit of pot so I was praying they wouldn't be doing drug tests or anything. Needless to say, hungover and exhausted as fuck. I get called into the interviewing room and the first thing I notice is a desk completely covered in gashes from knives. Then I see the scariest looking motherfucker I'd ever seen sitting behind that desk. He is an enormous, bald-headed white guy, covered in tattoos (no swastikas fortunately). He has got a wifebeater on and his arms are all inked up in daggers and what looked to be ex-military shit. I sit down in the chair and in the deepest, raspiest, deadliest voice I'd ever heard he says this: \"Did I tell you to sit down?\" I'm instantly on my feet blubbering \"sorry sorry sorry\" when he takes a switchblade out of a drawer and puts another gash into his desk. \"Strike one. Shut the fuck up and sit down.\" Right, so I'm hungover, I don't want to be here, and I don't want to deal with these mind games. I sit down and tell him to cut the shit, interview me. He takes a drag from some alcoholic beverage on the desk and then stands up. He slowly walks over to me and gets down on one knee; we're eye level. Let that stand to show how huge this guy is. I'm sitting, he's kneeling, and we're EYE LEVEL (and I'm not a short guy, 5'11). He is staring into my very soul and he must have seen it tremble because he started laughing. Not a tinkling, fun laugh, just fucking hatred and death converted into audio. He takes the switchblade and makes another gash right next to the first one. \"Strike two\" he says. I've no intention of seeing what happens on the third strike, so I just remain silent. He walks back behind the desk and starts talking about qualifications for the job. Mid sentence, he stops talking and looks at me. He says something like this: \"I'm going to ask you a question, and if you get it wrong, that's strike three. You don't want to know what happens on strike three.\" By now I was fairly positive that I'd wet myself, and I think I might have shit myself when he leaned over his desk so that our faces were no less than a half foot apart. And then, he said those dreadful words, which I'll never forget: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Now, it was around this time that I noticed the interviewer was an 8-story-tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \"Dammit Loch Ness Monstah,\" I said, \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" And with that, the beast swam off into the distance. The real interviewer came in and admired my handling of the monster and put made me the CEO of the company a week later.\n\n**TL;DR: Shit/pissed myself while getting interviewed by the scariest  son-of-a-bitch I'd ever met.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370645382", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "TL;DR: I refused to give the interviewer any money...\n\nThe Story:\nI had been looking for a job for a couple of years. Living off of unemployment was okay, but I wanted to do something with my life. I found a company (which will remain nameless, for privacy sake) that I thought would be  a good opportunity to further my career and I might like it. So I submitted an application, and to my surprise I got called in for an interview the very next day. (Pretty happy at this point, practically cloud 9)\n\nThe day came when I had scheduled for the interview, I arrived 15 minutes early, with my resume, and all things that I might need for the interview. I greeted the receptionist. Nice woman, very attractive. Then I sat down and waited for them to call me in. While I waited I tried to get a lowdown on all of my surroundings, such as the style of wallpaper that the company had, the style of furniture and the design of the counters, or even the type of flowers that were on the receptionists desk. I also reviewed the questions that I thought I might be asked and tried to think of good, well-thought out answers.\n\nIt felt like an eternity, although it was probably more like ten minutes, but I finally saw the boss walking toward me with a stern, but welcoming look. He offered his hand and I took it. He said his name was steve (not his real name, privacy sake) and invited me into his office to begin the interview.\n\nHe started off with asking for my resume (which was pretty impressive, if I do say so myself) and then asking me questions focused on that. Then he moved on to the questions that you woill hear at all interviews. Mostly ones like: \"what is your greatest weakness, and what have you done to overcome it?\" or \"what do you feel you might contribute to this company?\" I answered them all and steve seemed pleased. We were getting close to the end and I felt that I had definitely gotten the job.\n\nThen came the fateful question. Steve said, \"I have one final question to ask you. Can I have about tree-fiddy?\" It was only then that I realized Steve was an 80 ft. monster from the paleolithic era. I yelled at him, \"God Dammit, Loch-Ness Monster, I ain't givin' you no tree-fiddy.\" I stormed out of there, and I never heard from them again.

I was the TA in charge of the library inside our study group period at shool and signed in and signed out books to people.  One day, I was going through and noticed that one table had done a bunch of funny names, like  Pat McGroin, Seymore Butts, Mike Hawk, Heywood Jablome, Hugh Jass, Hugh G. Rection, Dick Hertz, Hugh Janus, and more.  Well I thought i could do it too so i started working on my creativity and came up with such names like Harry Weener, Dixie Normus, Dixie Rect, Howie Feltersnatch, Jack Offalot, Halotta Fagina, Patty O'Furniture, Harry P. Nass, and more.  Well it was not too long before I was found out and was in big trouble.  they sent me to the principal's office and there they made me fill out some forms about what i did and talk to the principal about why i did it and how disgusting and childish it all was.  I was also told that I would have to either remove the pencil markings myself or pay the school to have them put in new name cards in the books.  Being lazy i just said i would pay the school and be done with it.  besides, they would be damaged anyway if i had to go and erase them individually.  The principal said that the cards were  35 cents apiece and since i had damaged 10 of them that i would owe him about Tree-Fiddy.  Well it was about this time I noticed that this principal was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era!  So i says, \"God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\" as he swam back to the depths of a nearby lake", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370660310", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So happy that another one of these threads came up, kept this to myself for far too long.\nHad one when I was 8 years old. Parents went out to do some shopping and a neighbour also a father offered to take care of us for a while, they were good family friends. \nSo as it was on a summers day we went out with our bikes and rode around where we lived, in the suburb, quite place. I decided that I wanted to impress the neighbours daughter so I went out without a helmet or knee pads in the hope that I would get a reaction out of her.\nThings went great for an hour or so, we were having a good time. We reached the section of the road the kids called \"the black corner\" at the bottom of the hill, basically the building on the corner didnt have a sidewalk along its length so people couldn't see what car was coming from the right ( this is in straya). I was a reckless kid back then so I rode down it in the middle of the road and that's when a car decided to get in my way, hit just in front of the tire and went sailing over the hood and landed on my neck and out cold. \n\nWhat followed freaked me out for ever. The whole place was dark, I don't know how to describe it, not the black when you close your eyes, just nothingness. I couldn't see my body or had any sense of touch at all. All of a sudden a bright light shines a bit out in the distance and I can see a silhouette of a lone figure there. I don't know how I could tell but I knew right then that it was a woman, from her to my point to me there appeared a blue stream, like smoke. What I felt from it was I can only describe as love, like an intense love. The woman made no gesture to get me to follow her but I could feel that she loved me unrequitedly. I got right up to her within a metre, and asked her what did she want from me.\nThere was a pause before in a beautiful voice she says \"I need about tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370678948", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Then I go onto their Website to cancel autopay, and the Website gives me an error.\n\nI'm annoyed, but I go back the next day to try again. Another error. The next day? Same thing. I tried different browsers, other people's computers; all with the same result. I updated my credit card and tried again.. same thing. \n\nSo I went to the customer support page and clicked on 'contact'. Then they asked for the reason, I said I wanted to cancel my account. It took me to a page to cancel it - the same one that didn't work. I tried again, to no avail. I then went back and chose another 'cancel' option, it took me to a different cancellation page! I was excited, I clicked the options to cancel.. somehow I then ended up on a screen to RENEW MY ACCOUNT FOR A YEAR. \n\nObviously, I said no, backed up; went back to 'contact'. I finally found an option that offered for me to have THEM call ME. (I still couldn't find a phone number for them at this point..) So I clicked it, figuring 'why not'. Guess what? It was a dead link. \n\nSo I went back, went to support, went to Contact and other reasons for needing help, I clicked for a different account issue. Guess what it gave me? An immediate option to chat to a live person. I clicked it, it opened a chat box. \n\nI talked to the representative and they were polite. I told them I wanted to cancel my account and they said they could do that for me. But then they said, 'I have to tell you though, just so you know, we really need your support.

I honestly had never talked to him long enough to find out what his major was, never wanted to really; I'm not even sure he took real classes. Finally, I came home late one night to find him in the room, which had been ruined even more than usual. He'd had some kind of party based on the empty solo cups and pizza boxes and spilled booze... on my computer. That was the last straw. I had had it. This son of a bitch had gone too far. I kicked him awake and screamed at him, not just about the computer, but about all of it. To my surprise, he broke down and cried, apologizing. He said that he came from a totally different place than this urban, pristine world and that he was having such a hard time fitting in. After that, we started working out our differences, being friendly. I even went with him to his parents' house over thanksgiving break. Dinner was lovely, but his sister was even lovelier. All night she was giving me that look. You know the look I'm talking about. \"The Look.\" The \"I'm going to do illegal things in your pants\" face. After dinner, I went up to the guest room, claiming an \"early night.\" A few hours later, his sister snuck in. We went at it like animals for hours until *creak*... *creak*... the hallway floorboards shifted. Before we could react, my roommate bursts through the door and starts yelling incoherently. It wasn't even English!  He was screaming and shouting, flailing around and bashing the walls; even the ceiling wasn't safe from his rampage. After calming down a bit, he sat down slumped in a chair next to me. I apologized profusely to him, but he would have none of it.

Slow, painful, and a lot of people were losing hope that the season was pretty much done.  That screw up from MVO was so inexcusable, I would have pulled him for it.\n\nAs for the second half, they came out SUPER aggressive.  We had maybe 14 shots on goal to their 3, and we pressed very hard.  The problem was, the Strikers have some incredibly fast, tiny forwards, who were just amazingly on point.  Their passing skills are also top notch, so they outgunned us on the fast breaks quite often.  With that being said, it's only because our individual talent is that much greater, that we were able to pull off the comeback.\n\nPablo was amazing.  He handled the middle well, and his header was a thing of beauty.  He had one called back for a bullshit offsides from the line judge who was WAAAAY back behind the action, but the biggest outrage was that the ref missed an obvious handball in the box only seconds before.  Ft. Lauderdale was playing VERY dirty - 2 yellow cards, and 14 fouls to our 3.

{"body": "Finally my time to shine! I clicked on one of the adverts and it brought me to the all too familiar site Adult Friend Finder. This was last year around Christmas time and I recall the hologram lady had a sexy Santa hat on and everything. Anyway, the site was mostly riddled with older women and not so good looking younger ones but there was one profile that stuck out to me. Her name was Ashley and only had one picture but I messaged her anyway(because why not). A few days go by and I forgot all about it until I get an email saying that I have a new message from Ashley! After a few messages back and forth she gives me her number and we continue flirting back and forth, everything was going really great. We made plans to meet at a theater that weekend and were going to see Silver Linings Playbook. I got their a little earlier than we agreed and bought two tickets and waited inside for her to show up. A few minutes later she comes up behind me with a bag of popcorn and says \"You're thesadstoner right?\" And much to my surprise she wasn't an ugly cow and was actually kind of pretty. And she had a softness about her voice that I wouldn't have expected from someone on AFF. So we entered our designated theater, and sat in the back row right in the center. There were maybe 10-12 other people in the theater, mostly couples as you might assume. The night was going by pretty well, and about halfway through the movie I worked up the courage to attempt putting my arm over her shoulder. It was an awkward fake yawn and reach and she didn't seem to be protesting at all. My heart was racing until at one point she gently laid her hand down right on top of my junk. I got excited fast and she could tell, her hand starting to squeeze softly. She turned to me and looked me dead in the eye while her other hand unzipped my jeans and slid into them. I couldn't believe what was happening, I couldn't speak. She wrestle my now solid member out of my boxers and into plain view when her head descended and kissed the tip before taking a big lick up the length of my shaft. Then I saw her lips open up as she took me into her mouth and let out the faintest moan - my wildest dreams were coming true and I couldn't believe what was happening. Then the screen went black and I felt her head coming back up as if she wanted to kiss me, a bright white light on screen lot up her face right beside mine. She whispers into my ear ever so quietly the words \"Im'ma need about tree fiddy.\" And that's when I realized that cute little Ashley was 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370765835", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I once dated a porn star for about a month.\n\nI won't give her name, but I can tell you that she is relatively well known European starlet, and rather popular in West Europe. Sex was pretty nice in general, really about what you'd expect. She was well \"trained\" from her job so in bed it similar in a lot of ways to how you would see her in her movies, except she was a lot more sensual, less over-the-top flirtatious, much more intimate and caring. But damn, she knew how to handle a dick.\n\nAfter my last incident with her though I ended up having to leave her. She was a little bit kinky and wanted to go to a beach to have sex right on the wet sand. Our sexual relationship was fairly private, so I initially told her no, that isn't really appropriate, but she convinced me that if we go there when no one is around at night then it should be ok. \"Don't worry so much, it'll be fine.\" Being driven with the promise of sexytimes, I went along with her and drove out 3 hours to the beach to spend the day there. It was hot, she was dressed pretty normally for a beach, I was enjoying the sun and ocean, and everything was pretty fun. However, as the sun started to come down people began to clear out the beach very slowly. I wasn't sure exactly when, but I knew that my girl was going to sort of pounce me, and I was fairly excited. I think she could tell, looking at my shorts the closer and closer that it came to night time.\n\nSo eventually the sun goes down, and save for some few stragglers and some hobos strung out along the beach me and my girl are pretty much alone. She turns to me and says \"come on key_lucas_beast, let's go to the water again.\" So she comes up to me slowly and starts dragging me out to the water by my hand. I was pretty ready for some action at this point, and didn't really care about who was around. As we got to where our the waves was splashing around our feet with the tide, she suddenly leaned in and started making out with me, carefully and intimately. At the same time, she started slowly rubbing my member, and by this point in our relationship she really knew how to please me well. She started taking off my pants, rubbing the back of my head as well as my dick, and next thing I knew I was down on the beach getting head with the water still rising and falling around me, greatest experience of my life.\n\nThat went on for a little while, until eventually she started crawling over me. Usually I would go down on her after she goes down on me, but this time I think she was way too excited by this whole beach thing to wait. I guess this was some personal, romantic fantasy of hers she had never gotten to fulfill. So we start having full on sex, every position we could, as discreetly as we could. It was the best sex ever, but it didn't last as long as normal.\n\nShe got pretty close to climaxing pretty fast, and so as she got closer I started picking up the pace. Then, she starts moaning more and more, and I'm thrusting harder and harder until suddenly a light shines on us. There's about 4 fucking cops patrolling the beach, catching us making sweet love on the sand. It was worse than any other experience I'd had getting caught doing anything, even more than being caught with a girl in a car in high school by her father. Sex on the beach is a serious case of public indecency.\n\nSo my girl is right about to orgasm, and then the light shines in her eyes. I'm frozen like a deer in headlights, but she's too far to stop, and I'm horrified that she won't quit moving. So she leans in and keeps fingering herself with me still inside while these cops are running toward us, and I try and hold her still and stop her, which she does not like very much at all.\n\n\"key_lucas_beast,\" she's moaning as she starts shaking and leaning onto my chest, \"I... I,\"\n\n\"Shh, we're already caught, don't make this worse!\"\n\n\"But I, I need... I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nThen I realized that I had been dating a loch ness monster porn star. That damn monster, I didn't have the money since I'd left my wallet in the car! She got kind of pissed, and then slid off of me as the cops got closer and dove into the water, and swam off into the night.

{"body": "So I used to work for this company that did road construction. How this wasn't obvious to everyone else, I don't know, but here goes.\n\nFirst, some back story. My job wasn't on the road crew, but I dealt with those guys regularly. I was a mechanic for the equipment. It was typically cheaper for me to go out to the job site and repair the equipment there, becaue as anyone that does this kind of work knows, moving heavy equipment is difficult, time consuming, and often requires special permits. So when a call would come in from one of the job sites, we would talk with the equipment operator, take our best guess at the problem, and load up a truck which was basically a mobile repair shop, and go to the jobsite to fix whatever was broken.\n\nAt this point I had been there for several weeks. A paver went down and we needed it back running immediately. When a paver goes down, it can be expensive because the trucks with the asphalt have a limited time before the load cools off and it can't be used anymore. Before leaving for the jobsite we knew the paver needed to come into the shop, a track tensioning cylinder failed that we knew was getting ready to go. We had just finished maintenance on the other paver, so we loaded it onto a truck and had it sent to the job so they wouldn't lose any truckloads of asphalt. We got to the site, helped unload the replacement paver and load up the bad one. We got it into the shop and I went in to tell my manager the news so we could get approval to order parts. When he asked how much it was going to cost, I told him I needed about tree fiddy.\n\nHe replied \"God damn it, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy.\" Only then did the other people I work with realize I was an 8 story tall paleolithic era monster. I don't see how people don't realize this. Repairing these things isn't cheap. It takes a better part of a day just to remove the track tensioneing cylinder and rebuild it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370850444", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**PRELUDE:** *When I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.*\n\nSo this one day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\" I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies? I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy. The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free. So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence. I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\nNope.\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too. He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars. Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\nFast forward one year. I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\"What?\" I asked. He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again! I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\nSo yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst story about drugs here. But I haven't eaten smarties since then, that's for sure.\n**TL;DR: Kid wants drugs, I give him some, sort of.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370912273", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 633, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok so This is when I took my ACT. I get up early to go to the testing room, and me not being a morning person I stop by a local gas station to get a monster. The gas station is right next to a highway and just as I walk out of the store a semi-truck flies off the highway and into oncoming traffic. There is a huge pile up involving 5 or 6 cars and the semi-truck. I call 911 and they ask me to wait there. It happens right in the intersection that I need to cross to get to my test so I decide to wait it out. The police and ambulances arrive a few minutes later and begin to help the people out. Eventually a cop finds me and begins to question me about what I saw. Moments later federal agents arrive and they start asking me questions. The federal agents secure the truck and make sure nobody opened it or otherwise tried to look into it. After questioning me for several more minutes I realize that I'm about half an hour late for my test. I start freaking out and the agents decide to let me go. I take some back roads to the school and by the time I walk in I'm 45 minutes late. I get to the door of the testing room and the teacher tells me that I'm late and can't take the test. I start begging her asking if there's anything I can do to take the test. She thinks for a few minutes and them says \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\". It was about this time that I realize that the teacher was an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. It was that god damn Loch Ness monster again!!

{"body": "PRELUDE: When I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\n\nSo this one day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" \n\nKind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\" I could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\" I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies?\n\n I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day. I went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy. The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free. So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.\n\n That was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence. I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way. Nope. I got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\" This is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too. He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day. \n\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way. This goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars. Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house. Fast forward one year. I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me. He solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\" Shit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her. I'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO. We started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone. \"But I do need one thing...\" he says. \"What?\" I asked. He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\" \n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again! I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance. So yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst here. But I haven't eaten smarties since then, that's for sure. TL;DR: Kid wants drugs, I give him some, sort of.\n\nThank me later.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370922077", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"Grhrhrrhrammr\" With a groan Bob starts to wake. His head is pounding and his throat dry. What on earth was he doing last night? With a start he realizes that he doesn't remember. The last thing he remembers is walking to his work.\n\nHis vision clearing up a bit he looks around. He seems to be in a living room. He's sitting upright on an armchair. Looking closer it seems to be the house of a stereotypical crazy cat lady. There are cat themes everywhere. Cat figurines, baskets, paintings etc.\n\nHe stands up and tries one of the doors. It's locked. No problem, it seems like the one on the other end is open.\n\nWith a surreal calmness Bob walks across the room. Just before he reaches the door he steps on something. He hears a crunch and looks down. There's a hand sticking out from under the couch. With a sick feeling he kneels down. The hand is tiny. There is no doubt that it belongs to a small child.\n\nDesperately he tries to feel for a pulse. There! The child is alive! Bob is filled with a sense of relief. He grasps the arm and tries to pull the child out from under the couch. It doesn't work. The child seems to be stuck under it. Bob tries to look under the couch, but it's too dark to see anything.\n\nJust as he's about to attempt to shove the couch away a voice fills the room.\n\n\"Hello Mr. Bob.\"\n\n\"Who's there! How do you know my name?! And what's wrong with this child..?\" Bob asks desperately. Gradually he gets more panicked. This isn't a normal scenario. People don't just wake up in a random house with a barely alive child under a couch.\n\n\"You don't need to know me. I just want to play a little game with you Mr. Bob. All you have to do is retrieve the key to unlock the living room. Then you're free.\" \n\n\"And how do I get the key?\"\n\n\"That's why it's a game now, isn't it? I'll give you a hint though: the child won't speak to help you, the child has the key. You'd better hurry though, you have one hour before it's game over for you.\" With that there's a click and the room is covered in silence once again.\n\n\"Fuck oh fuck a duck... The child has the key? What am I supposed to do with that!\"\n\nTrying more desperately Bob tries to move the couch. It seems to be bolted to the floor however. With one last effort he tries to pull the child out again. The arm twitches, but otherwise stays still.\n\nEvery minute his panic grows.\n\nTrying to find another way out has ended with nothing. The kitchen is bare with the exception of a butterknife. It's with dread that he finally walks back in the kitchen to grab it. \n\n\"Child has the key, child has the key... GIVE ME THE KEY!!!\" With that roar he grabs the arm with one hand and starts stabbing it with the other. It's only when the arm has become a bloody stump that the reality of what he has done has settled in.\n\n\"No... noo... What have I done...\"\n\nA click is heard. The voice speaks again.\n\n\"Mr. Bob... I'm disappointed in you. It's been an hour and you haven't found the key yet.\"\n\n\"WHO ARE YOU?! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME!?\" Bob yells out desperately. \"I just wanted to play a little game. It wasn't hard. All you had to do was lift up the pillows and you would've found the child. Bound up and gagged, but otherwise unharmed and with the key in it's pocket. Go on, take those pillows and see for yourself.\"\n\nFrantically Bob does what the voice has instructed. Indeed, they covered an open area. Underneath he sees the child. His eyes widen. It's his little niece. His little 4 year old niece. Bile threatens to escape his throat. He slashed his niece's arm and probably killed her too, looking at the amount of blood pooling on the floor.\n\n\"You failed, \" the voice speaks up again \"and because of that you will die too.\"\n\nBob doesn't try to move when his niece suddenly moves again. His mind doesn't register it when she asks if she can have \"tree fiddy\" even though he automatically replies with \"no Nessie, you can't have tree fiddy!\" He does wonder vaguely if his niece had always been a large reptilian creature that likes to hide in lakes.

{"body": "Hi. I'm an Ex-D&amp;D player. I used to play D&amp;D every day, I guess you could say that I was addicted. I first realised that I had a problem when my parents caught me in my room all alone attempting to enchant a dagger to be a +1 keen dagger of returning. Their reactions were extreme and I should have let it go then and there but I just couldn't. Like I said, I was addicted.\n\nInstead of seeking help like I should have I learned to hide my actions better. Slowly, through the influence of D&amp;D, I learned how create fire with my hands and a pinch of bat guano. I leveled myself and became able to summon basic creatures, dogs and birds and the like. Of course, I wasn't content with just summoning the creatures, because of the influence that D&amp;D had on me I NEEDED to sacrifice them to my dark overlord.\n\nAs my life advanced, I found myself less inclined to be involved in anything that wasn't D&amp;D related. My grades slipped and some of my friends started to separate themselves from me, they didn't want any part of this. Still, I had a few friends who, like me, were addicted. Together we leveled ourselves, getting more and more involved in the dark world that D&amp;D had drawn us into. The feeling was incredible, the power that D&amp;D had shown me was beyond belief. Our rogue was caught trying to assassinate the local cleric and jailed for a time. We knew what we had to do, we had to break him out and finish the job. After all, our all mighty dark lord D&amp;D had commanded us to kill the opposing cleric and like hell we were going to let it slide. I know this sounds crazy to all of you reading this but at the time it made perfect sense to our addled and crazed minds.\n\nWe formulated a plan, I had leveled up to the point where I could cast the almighty GATE spell to summon and avatar of D&amp;D itself. It would be glorious. We would crush our enemies under the evil might that was D&amp;D. I prepared myself and began the incantation. A plume of smoke burst from the ground, the acrid stink of hell permeated the air. The Dark Avatar of the almighty D&amp;D appeared.  \n\n&gt;&gt;What is your request?\n\nIt asked me in booming voice that sent a shiver through my spine. This shiver came close to shocking me to the point where I knew that I needed to stop this but I was too far gone and the sensation remained as a small niggling feeling in the back of my mind, one that I ignored.\n\n&gt;&gt;Almighty Avatar\n\nI said\n\n&gt;&gt;I request your help in the raid on the jail in which our rogue is currently imprisoned. Our fighter and our monk will create a distraction at the front gate while you and I go in the back to get him out. Will you assist us in our endeavor?\n\nThe Dark Avatar of my almighty lord, D&amp;D thought for a moment before summoning its breath to reply\n\n&gt;&gt;As you wish, it will be done but I will require one thing, one small sacrifice before I will help.\n\n&gt;&gt;What is it LORD?\n\nI asked, my heart sinking, wondering what sacrifice my dark master would demand of me today.\n\n&gt;&gt;I need about tree-fiddy\n\nAnd that is when I realised that D&amp;D was actually the Loch Ness Monster and began the long road to recovery ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370957780", "subreddit": "rpg", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sorry, but when it comes to aliens and UFO, in a time where photo and video manipulation is increasingly easier for the average joe to use, the only proper evidence of UFOs or aliens is actual physical evidence, which we have none.\n\nI've linked a video before on reddit, but I am having trouble finding it now. It was a 90 minute documentary from either Discovery or History channel that was all about the crop circle myth. They also debunked a lot of photographic and video \"evidence\" of alien UFOs.\n\nThey even went as far as to have a guy make a fake UFO video with cheap editing software and they took it to some UFO \"experts\". All of the experts claimed it was the most compelling evidence of alien existence. Even when they were told that it was fake, some of them didn't believe it and kept arguing that it had to be real. \n\nThink about the Loch Ness monster. The photographer admitted on his deathbed that it was a hoax. However, there are still plenty of people who have heard him admit the hoax, but still believe the monster is real.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370974749", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"No man ever said no to my Loch Ness monster turkey roll. Put your jelly bean coffee pot on the hot granny knickers,\" crooned a female jazz singer in the distance. \"Rubber band beer toots tumbler bats, yeah yeah yeah. Set the bump on the barnacle bacon.\"\n\n\"Fuckin' love that song,\" said Voltron Basil to no one in particular.\n\nThis was Voltron's first time attending the big competition, and he was enjoying the festive atmosphere that lead up to the announcement of the winners.\n\n\"Jackhammer harlots shipping dildo booze hounds. Oversea romance chop shop pressure cooker, yeah yeah yeah. Set the bump on the granite labia fan mail,\" Voltron sang along with the jazz singer.\n\n\"Right,\" he said as he stood from his stool and grabbed a sack loaded with various vegetables. \"Time for business.\"\n\nA deluge of rain had set in shortly before the competition got underway, leaving the area a drenched mess of mud and sod. Hundreds of people were in attendance and many of them were trudging through the slop on their way to the main stage where the competitors would showcase their entries.\n\nWhile Voltron made his way to the stage, a tall, slender man had taken up his station in a small tent. Chip Chipperson was his name, but the competition veterans knew him as \"The Boss\", though others secretly referred to him as \"God\" and \"that fucker\".\n\nEtiquette around Mr. Chipperson was known by all. After all, he was The Shit in this place. Newcomers to the competition often made the mistake of not introducing themselves to him. They were rewarded with no chance at victory.\n\nSuch was the case with Voltron. He strode by The Boss' tent unknowingly and found a spot near the stage. Even from this distance he could see that his bosom-shaped pumpkin was far larger than any other. As if that wasn't enough, each mound of the pseudo-breasts were capped by a stem that any man would find arousing like stiff nipples. The pumpkin was a once in a lifetime specimen.\n\nVoltron's confidence blinded him to the goings-on just meters nearby, where The Boss was finally prepared to fulfill his part of the competition.\n\nHe picked his nose openly as he walked to the stage, then flicked a booger at a young boy who was being dragged past by his mother. He hated children and often went out of his way to taunt them with candy and soft drinks. Once he made a girl named Grassy O'Scheister piss her pants because she was throwing a full body tantrum when he denied her a piece of toffee. He was proud of that particular occasion.\n\nUpon reaching the stage he pretended to be impressed by the entries. Oversized vegetables were of little interest to him, though he did get a boner when he saw the bosom pumpkin because it reminded him of a portly nun at the school he attended as a child. Sadly, the other vegetables were so boring that his penis quickly retreated to a size that might garner him plenty of mockery should it be exposed to those around him.\n\nThe Boss was The Shit and he had connections in all places. Once a competitor asked him how he got so important, and he replied by telling them to fuck off. He was a farmland gangster, a powerful bastard who wouldn't flinch at the idea of releasing a thousand locusts on any field in the country. Piss off Chip Chipperson and you might as well dig yourself a grave.\n\nThe competitors began to trickle toward where he stood, generously shaking his hand and smiling pleadingly while making small talk. They'd always walk away without waiting for him to peek at their gift. Within ten minutes he had pocketed several hundred quid, an IOU note for a blowjob from a chap named Campy Muffcamper, and a speeding ticket on which was written, \"FUCKING WANKER!\"\n\nThere was only a small window of opportunity for the potential winners to greet Chip. He was soon walking to the rear of the stage where several other important people stood waiting.\n\n\"So what's the takings ol' Chip?\" said a lanky, gray-haired man named Dick. No one knew his last name.\n\nChip silently handed over the offerings and his notes on who had paid, though he kept the IOU note. Dick eyed the note and nodded, then handed it off to another of the small group. Soon the note had been seen by them all and the order was given to begin the announcements.\n\nSuddenly there was a ruckus as someone pushed their way through the security guards. \"Wait! Please, I have something for The Boss!\"\n\nAll eyes went to Dick who crossed his arms and looked at the intruder, a muck covered man who had an impressive beer gut. \"What is your name?\" Dick asked.\n\n\"Wallaby,\" the man whimpered.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Wallaby, the time to pay off Mr. Chipperson has come and gone. Tell me, peasant, how badly do you want to win?\"\n\n\"Bad. And when I say bad, I mean really bad.\"\n\n\"Let's see about that,\" said Dick.\n\nThe frail old man walked over to Wallaby and pushed him to his knees. Dick then pulled up one of his pant legs and exposed his knee that had a disgusting lump of a zit on it. The top of the massive pimple was crowned by a white spot indicating it was at optimal condition for popping.\n\n\"I've been letting this thing fester for an occasion such as this,\" Dick said as he gently ran a finger in circles around the mound of pressurized puss.\n\nSuddenly, and with surprising agility, he bent his leg at the knee and the zit exploded right on Wallaby's face. Upon seeing that Wallaby didn't flinch, Dick nodded. \"I see you are a man of your word - you do want this badly. Let's see just how serious you are.\"\n\nDick hiked his pant leg up even further and exposed a large patch of raw, pinkish skin that was decorated by white flaking skin. \"Lick it,\" Dick said.\n\nWallaby hesitated before sticking out his tongue and slowly leaning forward. As soon as his tongue touched he pulled away. \n\n\"LICK IT!\" Dick yelled with such passion that slobber flew from his mouth.\n\nThe message was received by Wallaby and he immediately began to massage the entire pink patch with his tongue like he was going down on a beautiful woman. Dick sighed several times before smiling and stepping back.\n\n\"Your effort is noted,\" Dick stated flatly. \"Now get out of here, filth.\"\n\nWallaby's slobbering had no influence on the outcome of the competition, nor did the sensual shape of Voltron's bosom pumpkin. In the end, the winners were women with jiggly breasts and those competitors who had handed over the most cash.\n\nSeveral weeks later Voltron was arrested placing a six foot tall cock shaped shit sculpture in The Boss' driveway. Wallaby returned home and developed a fetish for dandruff which proved to be a bigger obsession than the growing of impressively sized vegetables. And Campy Muffcamper eventually did fulfill the promise of his IOU note, though it also had made no difference in his success in the competition.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371011499", "subreddit": "worststory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

We told her and she asked why we got sent to Oregon instead of Africa or some place that 'needs' Christianity. We explained a little bit and she seemed really intrigued by the idea of still having prophets, so we asked if she would want to learn more, she said yes, we found out her name was Regina (or however you spell that), and set up an appointment to meet with her.

{"body": "&gt;What points specifically?\n\n\nFor one thing, your ignorance of what constitutes peer reviewed evidence. I am still waiting for you to justify using an apologist website - which has the same factual basis as an issue of X-men - to justify your claim. Where is the actual demonstrable, peer-reviewed evidence that dinosaurs and humans lived side by side?\n\n\n&gt;my ignorance to the truth is overwhelming\n\n\nAt least we agree on something.\n\n\n&gt;in fact i like that you disarm my statements with just as much links/referances to the truth of witch you speak of as i do to my, how did you put it asinine consperacy theories.\n\n\nWell you see, here's how it actually works....\n\n\nYou have made a positive assertions. i.e.: that there is evidence that humans and dinosaurs lived side by side. I do not **need** to present an alternative to invalidate your statement. You are attempting to shift the burden of proof. There is no obligation upon me to disprove your statement - you, as the claimant, instead have the obligation to present your evidence to prove it.\n\n\nThat's called burden of proof. Look it up. Science is fun.\n\n\n&gt;Just know that nothing you can teach me will convince me that jesus wasnt the sun of god.\n\n\nLet me get this straight....\n\n\nAre you saying that, even if I was to present actual demonstrable evidence that Jesus did not even exist, you would still believe that he was the son of god?\n\n\nIf so, what's the point of speaking to you? You have just admitted that you don't care whether or not what you believe is true - you intend to believe it regardless. If that is your stance, then you are officially a total waste of intellect.\n\n\n&gt;some evidance is out there im sure but ive still never seen good enuf proof to detour my beliefs.\n\n\nAgain, you're attempting to shift the burden of proof. That isn't how it works. If you actually cared whether or not your beliefs were true, you would require demonstrable evidence that Jesus **was** the son of god. You would not be challenging others to prove he wasn't, and be willing to believe it until they do.\n\n\nIf you are willing to accept something without evidence, then you have no reliable means of seperating fact from fiction. Indeed, you have no reasonable excuse for not also accepting unicorns, the tooth fairy, the loch ness monster, bigfoot, and the invisible pixies dancing in your colon.\n\n\nNobody can prove they don't exist either.....why reject them, but accept god?\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371076133", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "a.) Buy a bus pass.  3-day 'Strip area' pass is $20.  There are vending machines to buy them.  Top of my head, right in front of Bally's/Paris. Good for the entire strip and downtown. Usually crowded, but sit on the top of the double-decker Deuce bus for a slow(-motion) strip overview.  The SDX (Express) bus works with the same ticket but has limited stops. \n\n2.)  Cheap drinks at mid-Strip:  Stage Door Casino, behind Flamingo, about a block from the strip.  Not kidding at all about CHEAP, we're talking 'Hot Dog and a Bud Light for a (EDIT: wrong price) two fitty.' This is an TURBO-SCARY DIRTY FILTHY DIVE BAR.  You will probably have a great time. Talk to people, they have like, stories and stuff.\n\niii.) Leave the Stage Door, walk Diagon Alley two blocks to Ellis Island.  Another slightly less flashy casino (giggle).  Wander over to the bar in the center of the casino and order a decent micro brew (brewed on-site, I think) in a huge glass for tree fitty or so.  Order another one.  Get Hungry, go to the cleverly-named 'RESTAURANT', get a table, order the 'not-on-the-menu-but-not-a-very-well-kept-secret' Steak Special for $8, including a beer.  It's not the best steak in vegas, but it's ok. \n\nD.) Stagger back to the strip, travel north, stop at Casino Royale (there's a trend, this is a dive).  One dollar beers (Michelob, IIRC) or frozen drinks from a machine.  I think the frozen drinks might actually contain some small amount of alcohol.  But it's eleventeen hundred degrees outside, they're ICE COLD.  \n\n5.) South Strip area:  MGM Grand -- find the Sigma Derby machine.  Go to the cashier's cage, trade a crisp $20 for a roll of quarters.  You're not just playing the best game (with a terrible house edge, and I just don't care) in Vegas, you're officially gambling.  You get free drinks (slowly) when you're gambling.  Trust me on this one... Really.\n\nvi.) http://www.cocktaildoll.com/orderingtips.htm  Read it, feel less like an idiot.

About a month into living together I started noticing little things, she wasn't as fit as she used to be and seemed be eating more and more.  After morning after of her nausea I finally realized, she was pregnant.  Assuming the baby was mine I asked her to marry me and we would start our own little happy family.  The engagement was about 4 years long for a few different reasons, but on the wedding day we had the joy of seeing \"our\" oldest daughter as the flower girl at our wedding.  \"Our\" 2 year old son crawled down the aisle as the ring bearer and we seemed to be riding off into the sunset into our new lives.  Fast-forward another year and we went to the grocery store on a routine trip when I realized I was a little short on money.  I turned to my wife of a year and asked her if I could have about tree fiddy.  It was about this time that she realized I wasn't her husband at all, but instead a 3 story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.  She said \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy monstah.\"  I argued that she had given me a dollar the week before so I just assumed she had more.  I needed loche ness munchies and with the sale they cost only $3.50.  I turned to my 2 kids and asked if they had tree fiddy and she just berated me in front of everyone yelling \"God damnit monster, you quit bugging my children, now.

{"body": "Years ago I was running sound for a dive bar downtown and it was a lot of fun.  Full of drunk women on the downhill slide of their prime that loved to get liquored up, flash their tits, and grind up against just about anybody they could, along with their pussy whipped men that seemed to get off on watching.  The house band was halfway decent and mostly played a lot of classic rock and R&amp;B that took advantage of their horn section.  Sometimes other bands would play and it was always a smaller group than what I usually ran for so they were always pretty easy.  On this particular night though it was the house band.\n\nUsually, the manager of the bar was in one of two moods, grumpy which meant keep the volume down, or the \"Let's Get Fuckin PISSED!\" mood, which was always much more fun.  On these nights he would randomly swing by with bourbon on the rocks for me, which was my drink at the time.  This night he was ready to party and it was a good night for it because the crowd was good and the band was killin it.\n\nWe had started up around 10pm and the night was winding down around 2am.  I was fairly liquored up from the multiple bourbons he had brought me along with the multiple free beers I had been bought by various regulars.  For a dive bar, it was a pretty friendly place to hang out.\n\nThe owner of the bar was particular to high end whisky that I wasn't educated about at the time.  His go to was of course Johnnie Walker Blue but he also had a locked display case that had Macallan 18 and 25 in it along with his Blue.  There were a couple local business owners that liked these so he kept them in stock.  So this was a particularly rare night because the owner was there and hammered, the manager was hammered, the two HOT bartenders were hammered and high and the band was hammered and you get the idea.  So since the owner had been drinking his Blue, the case was unlocked and as we often did after chasing out all the customers, we all continued to drink.\n\nIt is somewhere around 4am and the band is gone and its just the manager and owner, both who are passed out, one of the bartenders who is getting fucked on a pool table in the back by the cook, and the other bartender who I could have had on the other pool table, but the big cold sore on her lip said, \"Stay away fool\"\n\nNot knowing anything about the Macallan 18 or 25, I asked her for some of either and she got this evil look on her face and mentioned how the owner always gave her shit about how she should never touch it or serve it unless he was there.  Since he was there, albiet unconscious, she decided to give him a little \"Fuck you\"  She went to the open case, grabbed the bottle of Macallan 25 which was mostly full, put a couple ice cubes in a rocks glass and filled it to the top with a big drunken grin.  As I picked up the glass and inhaled, it smelled better than virgin pussy.  As I closed my eyes and took a deep gulp I hear from the darkness from the bartender, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy for that\" and I was surprised to see that her name tag said Nessie and I can't believe you just read all of that.  I did used to run sound there though and get a free bourbon a night.  Except for the Mac25 everything is a jumble of actual events, even the pool table fuckin'.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371189507", "subreddit": "Scotch", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "At a friends house for a good game of truth or dare. 5 of us in total. 3 guys, 2 girls. Both girls are an easy 9/10. Me, being the 7/10 awkward 15 year old, I was willing to do anything to impress the ladies. Or in this case, show them my penis. The dare was to run around the neighborhood (just a few streets) totally naked. If I did this, they would agree to show their boobs. Sounds like a plan. My friends also agreed to run with me, because we were solid bros and i didnt want to be arrested alone. So there we were, standing outside at 4 in the morning, ass naked, trying not to stare at each other, in front of 2 bangable girls. With a collective \"fuck it\", we were off. We bolted down the street, the girls a few behind us. My eyes were pealed forward, observing all that I was running for. I ran cross country at the time, so I was a bit ahead of the guys. I looked behind me and they were a good 20 ft behind. I never ran so fast in my life. I didnt know why I was running so fast. Maybe because I didnt want to be seen or maybe because I wanted to see some tites, probably the tities, but I was still having a ball. I turned onto the final street, not a single pant or short of breath. I looked behind me and my friends were a good 30 ft away. I eyed down the house. The girls walked back to the front porch, waiting for us. I could see them. I held back my boner as hard as I could. I didnt want to run the final 50 ft with a raging hard on. That would probably hurt. I ran into the drive way and ran up to them. They threw me the towel they had and I wrapped it around myself to cover up my half-erection. \n\n\"Nice job Rsurect, didn't think you'd actually do it!\" The one girl said.\n\n\"Ya well, ya know. I'm a man of my word...\" \n\n*fuck the cringe...*\n\nMy friends jogged to the finish and were both handed towels. We all kinda stood there for a moment, starring at each other. To break the awkwardness, I said:\n\n\"Well lets go inside?\" Trying not to sound to desperate by reminding them that they had to pay up. We walked to the basement, trying not to wake the parents, and we got dressed. I walked into the room where my clothes were (kind of a secluded room in the basement, has doors) and behind me walked in one of the bangable girls. This girl, we'll call Kate, was the girl I was crushing on. She had some massive knockers and a pretty nice backside. Me, being the awkward beta that I am, I said:\n\n\"Oh hey, im just getting dressed *nervous laugh*\"\n\n\"Oh I know\"\n\n*closes door*\n\n*takes off shirt*\n\n*climbs on top of me*\n\n*I take off bra*\n\n*go to town on dem boobies*\n\n*receive greatest bj of my life*\n\nIt was a pretty greet night. We dated for two years after that, had a mild breakup, and are now still friends. Streaking gets you everywhere, kids.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Fuck spelling\n\nEdit no.2: What the hell is the Loch Ness Monster story?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371197856", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2129, "controversiality": 0}

NICDERP stirs in her sleep.*\n\n&gt;*Enter VB, on the phone.*\n\n&gt;VB: Oh em gee I KNOOWWW it was crazy! I can't believe they broke out the ice tonight!\n\n&gt;The door slams behind her, waking our three heroes\n\n&gt;VB, *visibly intoxicated:* Oh, sorrryyyy guys! *On the phone* I can't believe he punched her in the FACE!\n\n&gt;VB heads into the bathroom.\n\n&gt;Me: Every.

I have class early tomorrow. Can you guys go to the lounge to chill?\n\n&gt;They vacate with dirty looks\n\n&gt;Lol fuck you too\n\n&gt;Sleep tiem\n\n&gt;Enter NICDERP\n\n&gt;NICDERP: Hey, Ladytron, who's purse is this?\n\n&gt;Me: Uuhh, I have no idea\n\n&gt;NICDERP: It's on my bed....\n\n&gt;Me: Oh, VB's friend was sitting on your bed. It's probs hers\n\n&gt;NICDERP is visibly irritated, has asked VB to seat her friends on her own bed\n\n&gt;Obviously, VB is a big ol' rebaaalll.\n\n&gt;NICDERP puts the purse on the floor. \n\n&gt;Hour later, I'm sleeping when--\n\nWHERE'S MUH PURSE?!?!\n\n&gt;Fuuuuuck\n\n&gt;NICDERP: Is that yours? It's on the floor there.\n\nU TUCHED MUH PURSE?!?!\n\n&gt;NICDERP: You touched my bed.\n\n....(VB's friend shiftily takes the purse. VB is nowhere to be seen)\n\n&gt;The two burst back into the room. Goddammit it's midnight for fuck's sake\n\nU STOLE TWO DOLLA FRUM MUH PURSE U TUCHED IT ND U STOLE TWO DOLLA\n\n&gt;This has my attention\n\n&gt;Me: No she fucking didn't. That's bullshit and you know it. I was here the whole time.\n\n&gt;Enter, RA\n\n&gt;RA know's what's up\n\n&gt;RA: What's going on here?\n\nSHE STOLE MUH TWO DOLLA. I HAD FIVE DOLLA ND FITTY CENT  BUT NOW I ONLY HAV\n\n**TREE FIDDY**\n\n&gt;RA: You sure about that VB's friend?\n\nI SWERR.\n\n&gt;RA: I just watched you buy and pay for pizza delivery here\n\n&gt;RA: You tipped with two dollars. You kept one. And you paid by card.\n\nShocked silence. Fucking right. Finally.\n\n&gt;Exchange nods with RA. He's got our back.\n\nThis was after an incident in which VB decided to leave her computer camera on a skype call to her mom. Her mom sat behind the computer and WATCHED US through her camera. I took pictures of the camera light on (for proof), sent it to her asking what kind of shit she was trying to pull. Yeah, that never happened again, and the RA's got a copy of those pictures. \n\n&gt;Sweet, merciful sleep once those cunts leave to fill out \"disruptive behavior reports\"\n\n---------------------------\n\nEpilogue\n--------------------------\n\nVB gets moved to a different room. We have a normal amount of people for the space in which we live for once... For about twoish weeks until BBC shows up. And to show her appreciation for the time she spent with us, while we cleaned up after her move out, we found she'd left a massive hair ball pulled straight from her brush in the middle of the shower and the sink.\n\nI was livid.\n\nI was seeing red.\n\nThis is one of the very few times I have ever gone full Irish on someone\n\nI grabbed the hair, because I'd passed her in the lounge, went straight to the lounge and *threw that shit at her face*, tore it up in strands and dropped it all over her stuff, in the food she was eating.\n\n\"What the ever loving fuck is wrong with you? You think this is ok? We have been nothing but reasonable and respectful to you, and this is what you do? NONE OF US HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT CIVIL TO YOU AND THIS BULLSHIT IS WHAT YOU FUCKING DO? What are you, 5? You have your mother spy on us in an open skype call? You steal my fucking snacks? You fucking concoct a goddamn plan with your shitty friends to get Nicderp in trouble for stealing? You come home drunk, and high, and you're confused about the 0s you get for the classes you don't fucking go to?\"\n\nCoolmate watched in envy. She is much better with words in the heat of the moment, and I'm sure I was saying things she'd been wanting the opportunity to say for a while. But she grabbed me and pulled me to the room once I got really fucking personal about it.\n\n\"You are a stupid, selfish, cunt, and you and your mother are so disillusioned about your bullshit, you are going to grow up and die an old, alone, ugly hag with nothing in front of her or behind her but your devaluing fucking presence.\"\n\nI don't remember saying much of anything, I was so mad, but this is according to Coolmate.\n\nThe end.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371203011", "subreddit": "fatpeoplestories", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There was a kid in my grade who was always a little quiet and brooding. One of those ones you sort of look out for, because you're not sure if they're just asocial, or they're about to fly off the handle. Anyway, one day near the end of freshman year, he gets in trouble. From what I hear, he had written a note or something that threatened suicide, and a teacher caught him with it. After that, he has consistent appointments with the school psychologist. A few kids started tormenting him, but most people just stayed out of his way and acted like he wasn't there. That might have been worse. \n\nFast forward to sophomore year. We have a new school psychologist. No idea why the old one quit, but it probably had something to do with the problem kid. New psychologist is this strict-looking woman in her late forties. Anyway, about a week into the year, the kid just stops showing up to school. Nobody really thinks anything of it, but then he shows up two or three weeks later walking with a limp. Most people figured his dad beat the shit out of him when he stopped going to school. The usual assholes start harassing him again while he's at his locker, and he flips out on them. Yells \"Don't TOUCH me!\" Half the school hears him and just instantly goes quiet. Everyone thought he was going to get violent, but he just slams his locker and hobbles away. Nobody wanted to fuck with him after that.\n\nA couple of days later, the kid is leaving a class when a teacher sees blood on the back of his leg. A lot of blood. The teacher asks if he's okay, and he tries to hurry away. The teacher grabs him and drags him to the school nurse. The nurse finds this spiked leather belt wrapped around his leg, like the psycho monk had in the Da Vinci Code. The nurse asks him where he got it, and he says it was from the school psychologist. Nurse phones up the school psychologist and asks what's up. I think the psychologist just hung up the phone then and there, and the nurse goes and gets the principal and they go to the psychologist's office. They find her tearing apart her office, packing up what turns out to be a collection of insane torture devices that would make an inquisitor queasy. The principal is a big ex-army guy, and he grabs the psychologist and drags her out of the office. She starts screaming, telling him he had no right to go into her office like that. She breaks free, tries to run back to her office, and a teacher blocks her way. The principal tells her in this quiet but forceful voice, \"You need to leave now. I'm calling the police.\" She screams at him that her car keys are in her office. \"Call a cab,\" he replies. She shrieks at him that she doesn't have money for a cab. Heads are poking out of every classroom door at this point. Principal pulls out his wallet. \"How much do you need?\" he growls. She says, \"I'll need about $3.50.\" It was at this time that everyone watching realized that this sadistic freak who had conned her way into a job as a school psychologist was in reality 500 foot tall and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371350205", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;As I said, just because you cannot do it correctly doesn't mean it can't be done.\n\nAnd as I said, it's rarely done properly.\n\n&gt;And based off what you're saying, I'm getting the idea that you don't actually know much about it. You mention deer over and over again. It's possible to get organic, grass fed/wild meat from farms. Directly from the owners. Even if not, many stores now begin to carry grass fed beef.\n\nIt's incredibly hard to get legit grass fed local meat. Not to mention 'wild' as you say. Big companies like Tyson's have crushed most local meat businesses. Also getting a licence to be an independent butcher these days is almost impossible.\n\n&gt;You comment on fruit is off. Where does it say every three days? The whole point is to eat real food. Are you going to tell me that bread is healthy, now?\n\nIn the paleolithic era they didn't have mass production sprayed to death vegetables and fruits. A lot of it was gathering what was available in season. Most people on Paleo don't even know about the era.\n\n&gt;Too bad it's not placebo. You wish it was though.\n\nSounds like a playground insult.\n\n&gt;Look unless you're even lean, don't bother with me. I have enough fat \"health experts\" quoting studies at me all the time. My clients and I laugh, walk away, and continue to get healthier and stronger. Your argument just makes no sense.\n\nI'm currently in Tokyo, Japan cycling between 3 and 7 hours a day. And no I don't have 5% body fat, I'm not obsessed with every inch of my body.\n\n&gt;Unless you have actually tried it, and I know you haven't since you don't know what you're talking about, take it someplace else. You're more religious about it not working than me religious about it working.\n\nI watched my mother try it, and force me into it for years. It's called a low carb diet... And there are a million variations of it that have been around for decades. So please feel free to make assumptions. I'll rely on actual facts. Your small study group that probably works out all week long could eat a wide variety of things and still look the same.\n\nNews flash, working out a lot makes you pretty healthy. Yes if you eat shit food three times a day it is bad for you, but saying bread is bad is just a crazy mentality.

{"body": "When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms. She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet. His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name. Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.\n\nJoe didn't give a shit. He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either. Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom. His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\". His name was now legally Adam Adams. Why? All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\n\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe, my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it. He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember. But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage. The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me. Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son. This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\n\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.\n\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on. She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does. My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\n\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.\n\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story. She does. Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words). While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out.\n\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved. After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad. I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story. When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her. She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again.

{"body": "I don't think it's *resentment* it's just that we (Speaking as a Scotsman) are a bit more apathetic to the whole United Kingdom idea than the English tend to be because we have a strong national identity.\n\nEngland does too but I think for most English people it's tied quite closely to United Kingdom. For them it's interchangeable, to be English is to be British and there is no (or very little) disconnect. This idea is true around the world, what you might see as British stereotypes (Tea, Scones, Roast Dinners, Bulldogs, Men in long furry hats) we see as distinctly English things. \n\nThat's not to say those things don't exist here, there is a huge amount of cultural overlap, but since England is by far the largest part of the Union it's understandable that they are the main driving force behind how it's portrayed. \n\nThis leads to a kind of disconnect for everyone else, a separation of identity. I can't speak for all Scottish people but for me I am absolutely certain that I am Scottish first and British second. I don't identify with the 'quintessential' British things because from where I sit they are predominantly English things. Further to that, despite being a United Kingdom there are plenty of things within the isles that English people don't identify with that I do. Shortbread, Tartan, Loch Ness Monster etc. This widens the identity gap even more.\n\nAgain, it's *not* resentment. I don't dislike English people and I don't think they dislike Scottish people. There is simply a disconnect in how we view ourselves within the United Kingdom and that sometimes causes friction. \n\nIt's very difficult to explain I think. The brothers analogy comes up a lot and I think it's a very good one. Scotland and England (as well as NI and Wales) are very similar in a lot of ways and agree on a lot of things but we do still have our own unique personalities and sometimes we think it might just be easier for us all if we just moved out. After all our cousins Canada and Australia are doing quite well and they still send letters and come to family gatherings so why don't we do that and we can stop bickering over who used the last of the milk?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371380640", "subreddit": "AskUK", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Day one, this fucker pulls out the bunk bed in the room saying, \"it's too new age\" or some other hippie bullshit like that. He made a huge goddamned mess every time he came through the door to the point where I just stopped caring. He just had no boundaries. I honestly had never talked to him long enough to find out what his major was, never wanted to really; I'm not even sure he took real classes. Finally, I came home late one night to find him in the room, which had been ruined even more than usual. He'd had some kind of party based on the empty solo cups and pizza boxes and spilled booze... on my computer. That was the last straw. I had had it. This son of a bitch had gone too far. I kicked him awake and screamed at him, not just about the computer, but about all of it. To my surprise, he broke down and cried, apologizing. He said that he came from a totally different place than this urban, pristine world and that he was having such a hard time fitting in. After that, we started working out our differences, being friendly. I even went with him to his parents' house over thanksgiving break. Dinner was lovely, but his sister was even lovelier. All night she was giving me that look. You know the look I'm talking about. \"The Look.\" The \"I'm going to do illegal things in your pants\" look. After dinner, I went up to the guest room, claiming an \"early night.\" A few hours later, his sister snuck in. We went at it like animals for hours until *creak*... *creak*... the hallway floorboards shifted. Before we could react, my roommate bursts through the door and starts yelling incoherently. It wasn't even English!  He was screaming and shouting, flailing around and bashing the walls; even the ceiling wasn't safe from his rampage. After calming down a bit, he sat down slumped in a chair next to me. I apologized profusely to him, but he would have none of it. He only asked one thing, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was about this time I realized that my roommate was actually a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. \"Goddamn Loch Ness Monster I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"\n\n**TL;DR: had awful roommate, banged his sister months later.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371396580", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

After all of my questioning (which she handled quite poorly), I asked her how she thought she had handled the interview. She thought she did excellently and should absolutely get the job. I then proceeded to tell her exactly what was on my mind, how rude she had been, how she wasn't as great as she thought she was, how her past work experiences weren't at all relevant to this line of work and so on and after all of this she asked what her chances of employment were. I simply looked at her an said \"nil\". But before she left, she had one more thing to say to me, she looked at me with pure intent her eyes and said \"I need about treefiddy\" it was around this time that I realized that my candidate was a 500 feet tall creature from the paleolithic era. I said \"God dammit loch ness monster, I ain't gonna give you no treefiddy\".

My friends and I would spend our summers attempting to build rafts to try and cross, using whatever we could scrounge up out of our parent's garage. One of our neighbors was (justifiably) very concerned that we were going to get hurt, or worse drown. One day he saw us outside, launching our latest construction. He came down to us, and said \"boys, before you launch that into the water, I need to tell you about the pale child.\"\n \n\"Years before your mom and dad moved here, a young family lived in a house next to the lake. The mother and father of the family had a favorite son, who they never punished, no matter what he did. One day the boy was playing by the water, late in the evening, and the parents let him stay outside because he was the favorite child. The boy pushed a log into the pond and tried to ride it like a canoe. As he was balancing, something dark and black reached out of the water and pulled him under. His body was never found, but late at night, if you look at the far edge of pond, you can see the boy's spirit struggling to escape the water.\" \n\nI believe he told us this story to scare us from trying to cross. However, being a strong willed child, I ignored his warnings. We continued laboring on our new raft, and when it was finally ready we launched. About 20 feet from shore, our little boat came to a sudden stop, and we were nearly jolted into the water.

I really didn't want her to say that I beat her or abused her, and then call the cops and have me arrested.  Some of you were saying that she might pull shit like that, or even say that I abused my son - WTF, no thanks.  \n\nI spent most of the afternoon crying and shit at my brother's place, I didn't drink because I knew that I was going to talk to her tonight and I didn't want to risk anything.  Someone in the comments suggested that I don't have any more coffee either so I didn't!  Around dinner time I was all cried out and just kind of numb to the whole thing, but I could feel a slow anger building in my chest as my brother and I drove over to the house.\n\nSo my brother and I pull up to the house, my son is at my mom's.  My wife's car is in the driveway and we go inside.  She is sitting in the dining room alone at the table, calm as could be, fiddling with her iPhone.  She seems a little shocked to see my brother, I guess maybe she was planning to piss me off and take pics with her phone?  I don't know, but she says hi, he says hi, I say hi, and sit down. Fucking surreal.  \n\nThere's a long pause and I don't know what to say, and she doesn't say anything.  It's quickly apparent to me that this bullshit is for real, because I can tell she's actually angry (or scared, sometimes they look the same on her), and she's just kind of staring at the table.  I finally can't deal with the silence so I ask her, \"Ok, what the fuck is going on?\"  \n\nShe doesn't answer but instead she holds up her phone and shows me that the phone is on speaker.  She then says to me, \"I have [best friend who is an attorney] on speaker so don't fuck with me.  She is helping me.\"  And then her friend chimes in over the speaker and is like \"Mike, I think we all know why we're here tonight.\" and she keeps talking but I cut her off.  \n\nI tell my wife's friend that this is bullshit, that I've done nothing wrong, and I can't believe my wife pulled this shit on Father's day, in front of our kid no less.  Her friend starts saying \"You need to calm down, you shouldn't be threatening anyone right now.\"  So I tell her that my fucking brother is in the room and he's a witness and I'm not threatening anyone, so she can fuck right off with that kind of talk.  \n\nSo I go back to my wife, and I ask her point blank, \"Are you fucking someone else? Is that what's going on here?\"  And she doesn't answer, which is a good enough answer for me.  I'm pretty pissed at this point, so I throw the stupid divorce papers on the table and tell her that there is no way IN HELL that I'm paying any fucking alimony or giving her my house when she is the whore who CHEATED on me.  She just turns up the volume on her phone so that I can hear her friend telling me that I can't threaten my wife and blah blah blah.\n\nSo I quiet down, and her friend starts talking about the separation agreement and \"it's just best for everyone, including [my son], if we can solve this amicably and up-front.\"  I tell her to fuck off and I'm not paying anything.  \n\nAnd yes, that's when my soon-to-be wife finally chimes in and says that she'll tell everyone that I abused her and our kid unless I agree to a divorce.  She tells me that she'll also tell all our friends about my sexual preferences and then she starts talking about our sex stuff right in front of my brother, what the fuck.  I tell her that I'm not paying $40,000 a year to her when she is the cheater and I've done nothing wrong.  I tell her that I'm going to hire a damn good attorney and the shit she pulled today is going to ruin her in court.\n\nHer friend chimes in over the phone that the money is negotiable but that if I hire an attorney, they will make sure that the divorce costs me as much money as possible.  I tell her that I'm not paying $40,000 grand in alimony, that's bullshit.  Her friend says that I will have to pay child support, there's no way around that.  I'm a good father, I love my son, of course I'm going to support him.

{"body": "Warning: Fairly long, and written like I tell it.\n\nIn 2005(ish, sometime around then, anyhow) I was living in a block of apartments with a crazy bint for a neighbor. This bitch wasn't 'you so *crazy*-zee', she was 'holy shit, here we go again' crazy. Near as we could tell, she was schizophrenic. And a crazy bitch on top of that. On multiple previous occasions, the 'crazy lady', as we had dubbed her, would get loud and try to pick fights, or other odd behavior, like smashing her way into one of the other apartments because she was couldn't find her milk powder and KNEW that the neighbors had taken it.\n\nAnyhow, one relatively boring night, she won't stop yelling at no-one in particular to shut up and leave her alone. The neighbors beside us, above her, got sick of it and yelled back. This was a mistake. For the next half-hour to hour, they exchanged threats and insults, both parties insisting the other shut up and go back inside, while I sat on my balcony recording the exchange. \n\nWell, the crazy lady did what crazy people do and took it too far. She grabbed a knife from the kitchen (one of those long, triangular carving knives) and a brick and came upstairs to make her point *really* clear. She'd already learned how easy it was to smash her way into the apartments when she went in search of her missing powdered milk a fortnight or so earlier. So, armed with a brick and knife, she smashed the door until it was broken and let herself into the neighbors place. They jumped from the first-floor balcony and hoofed it out of there. Can't blame them really. At that moment, I'd stepped out the front to see what the hell was going on, which, as it turned out, may have been a mistake. The neighbors ran below me yelling for people to call the cops and then she stepped out of their apartment, deprived of her target but still full of crazy and angry. She saw me, and, target acquired.\n\nI 'oh-fuck-no''d back into my own place, locking the door in one smooth motion, and grabbed a stick that we had for a replacement broom-handle, thinking to make a show of force, should she try anything. Well, she tried anything. The brick was gone, so she used the butt of the knife against the glass in the door. The third hit sent a spray of glass shards and blood onto me, as I stood in the entranceway. She opened the door and said something along the lines of 'give me tree-fitty' It was right then I noticed the scaly green skin, yellow eyes and realized that she was a 500 foot tall reptile from the paleolithic era. \"God damn Loch Ness Monster! Get the hell out of here! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!\"\n\nWait, no, that's not what happened. What actually happened was she said 'ooh, think you're a big man eh?' Then she grabbed the stick and thrust the knife at my midriff. It was at about that moment that I realized 'fuck this with a well-lubed nope' and got the fuck away from her. I moved with the grace and fluidity brought on by a massive adrenaline dump and got a door between me and that crazy bitch. Unfortunately for me, the door opened outward, toward her, so I couldn't just lean against it. Worse, it was where we had hung the 'Mr T' chains from a recent dress-up (I'm so not even kidding) so holding onto the doornob was even more tricky. She tried to pull the door open, but hell no that wasn't going to happen. My friend and flatmate finally opens his door which was beside me and we both barricade ourselves in his room and try to find a phone to call the cops with. \n\nShe, losing out on putting holes in yet *another* target, is quite pissed, and takes out her anger all over our apartment. The sound of pretty much everything we own being thrown from hell to breakfast can be heard as we try desperately to get in contact with police on a cell phone from a generation before text messages (the only one that wasn't in the lounge). We eventually get through and they're very 'yeah, we've already had a couple of calls about that, we'll send someone as soon as we can'. WTF!? \n\nAfter a while, the drama dies down, but ain't no way we're going to venture out to see if she's being quiet and sneaky, or if she's actually had enough. No cops still. We wait about 10-15 more minutes in darkness and silence before we decide to venture out. The lights are off, and no-one seems to be around, but even then we could see the place was pretty tore-up. A neighbor came by at about the same time to see if anyone needed help, saw a lot of blood and was worried about who she might find in what condition. \n\nThe aftermath. \n\nEventually, like 45 minutes after all the drama had blown over, the cops arrived. Crazy lady had returned to her place and was bellowing about how it wasn't fair, how everything wasn't fair. The neighbor who'd come over to check on us offered us a couch to crash on for the night, and a bathroom to get cleaned up in. Turned out despite being sprayed with broken glass, I wasn't cut. More interestingly, we found a clear impression of the knife the crazy bint had used on my shirt, painted on in her blood (from reaching through a broken glass window in the door to open the door from inside). Ninja reflexes for the win, I guess. The next day, the cleanup began. TV thrown on the floor with a standing cabinet thrown on it, two computers thrown, card table, piled high with Magic: the Gathering cards upturned, posters and clocks ripped from the walls, and blood spatter all over the place. She even went out onto our balcony and threw all our laundry at the neighbors below us. The kitchen was full of dirty dishes, but that was our fault. We blamed her anyhow, and laughed. \n\nAs we cleaned, we learned just how lucky we'd been. The TV was thrown on a fold-out latex-sponge couch we'd not bothered to fold away, so that was fine. The cabinet was undamaged, but we had to throw out a couple of broken CD cases, the CDs were fine. Because our computers were under the desks, and only the monitors (and peripherals) were on top, they were fine. What's more, the cables stopped them from hitting the ground, so even the monitors were fine. The valuable cards were safe in the folders, so we only lost a few dozen unlamented cards to damage, and the card table landed safely. The posters and clocks were easily replaced. All in all, nothing was severely damaged, aside from the crazy bint that cut herself up in an attempt to cut other people up. \n\nShe'd said to us in a previous episode 'I'll stab someone, and I'll just plead crazy then I'll get out and do it again!' She was taken to the local psychiatric hospital and was out in a matter of days. My mate and I didn't want to press charges, just get her away from us, and the other neighbors didn't want anything to do with her ever again. She was evicted, and the other neighbors that she had a go at moved out even sooner than that. Last I heard, she kept her word. She'd moved somewhere down south, had smashed her way into someone elses place and had a go at them and, for that one, she was locked up. \n\n**tl;dr \"You want crazy from the crazy lady!

The club scene is crazy, and X seemed to be just \"part of the deal.\"  There were scantily clad ladies walking around selling little bags of the pills for $100.  Everyone was taking them and seemed to be having a great time.  I didn't try any, but it was insane at how this was \"the norm.\"  \n\nI remember this one particular night very vividly.  A small group of late teens were on the glass dance floor and one of them starts convulsing, violently.  He drops to the floor and his girlfriend starts freaking out.  The bouncers come over and just pick the kid up and drag him out the doors (assuming they called an ambulance).  The girlfriend continues to freak out and the owner (i'm assuming) took her back to the office.  The music never stopped, and the party never died down.  Next day, we read in the paper that the guy that dropped was found in an alley, dead.  Not necessarily foul play, but they didn't see how he got there, just that he OD'd.  Which made me wonder about his girlfriend.\n\nI'm not one to jump to many conclusions, but if the bouncers just ditched the poor kid in an alley, what happened to his girlfriend.  I talked to my friends and we decided to go back to that club and see if we could find out what happened, who the kid was, who his girlfriend was, etc. (I know, not the smartest thing).  We get to the club and the bouncer was immediately on edge.  We walk up and ask pretty bluntly that we were \"looking for a friend\" that was there last night.  He got defensive, and asked for our IDs.  We told him to cut the crap, that we were there last night, and saw the kid drop (again, not the smartest thing to say).

{"body": "I'm sorry if this is full of typos, but it's rather late here. \n\n==========================\n\nThe answer is that we got extremely lucky. If you do some research on human evolution you find that, despite the journey to \"homo sapiens\" starting over 2 million years ago, there were a lot of periods of stalemates.\nEarly humans were literally running around doing the same things for hundreds of thousands of years. Modern humans emerged around 200,000 years ago, but it wasn't until around 35,000 years ago that there was any real breakthrough in technology. This led to two distinct time periods: the Paleolithic era and the Neolithic era. Now, I'm too lazy to go into depth, but **TL;DR** paleolithic was a move to more sophisticated tools (so from like sticks to chisels), and the Neolithic was an even further advancement of that. \n\nNow sophisticated tools are all fine and dandy, but keep in mind that these early humans were still living unpredictable nomadic lifestyles. They traveled in small tribes/packs, and roamed large areas of land for sustenance. They didn't have time for things like art, culture, writing, because their only focus was on survival. Things like infanticide were extremely common, but necessary for survival.\n\nThis is why the agricultural revolution was arguably the most important part of human evolution. It was a guaranteed food source, and because of this humans were finally able to settle down. They were finally able to focus on things other than survival, and as a result art/culture/language/technology began to emerge.\n\nHumans got a giant advantage, because unlike other animals that are constantly migrating for food/shelter/survival, they have a sustainable food source, advanced shelter, and free time. They didn't have to travel in small packs, but began to form large cities/towns. They weren't all required to find food, and began to have specialized professions. They developed culture, and as a result, religion. You get the idea.\n\n**TL;DR**\n \nBasically, the development of technology is exponential, and since humans were able to devote so much time to the pursuit of knowledge/development of technology, we ended up with the most sophisticated technology. Mortality was still quite a problem, keep in mind that germ theory wasn't even conceived until the 19th century, but the intensification of agriculture allowed for them to settle down. \n\nBut it all comes down to luck. Just like how our ancestors spent hundreds of thousands of years without making a single breakthrough, many species go about their lives doing the exact same things, and never questioning or diverging. Why should they? It's worked for their species so far.\n\nHumans got to where we are today because, in a struggle for survival, we got creative and tried lots of unusual things. Life doesn't always reward risk-takers, but in our case it did, and that put is in the lead and helped us stay ahead.\n\nThe rich get richer and the poor stay poor.\n\n\n**ALSO OPPOSABLE THUMBS**\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371534924", "subreddit": "skeptic", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Why do theistic/atheistic people have such pronounced opinions.\n\nAs opposed to? Theistic/atheist covers everybody.\n\n&gt;I'm sort of a believer in god --- I'm not an atheist, *a theist*.\n\nYou **are** a theist if you believe in god. Being a theist has nothing to do with specific religions.\n\n&gt;I also wonder how a group of people who believe in the complete inexistence of god, allow such an diea to envelope this much of my life around discussing the lack of god.\n\nFirst, most of don't \"believe in the completely inexistence of god\". There is no evidence for a god, so I don't believe in one. I don't claim one is impossible, or that one doesn't exist with absolution.\n\nSecond, I rarely spend time talking about the non-existence of god. What I find myself spending **most** of my time talking about is the effect that religion has on people. \n\nI'm of the opinion that people can believe whatever the hell they want as long as it doesn't negatively affect others. It's never been the belief that I hate, but the actions carried out for those beliefs.\n\nHere are a few reasons why I, personally, am outspoken about religion:\n\n- My state constitution explicitly says atheists can't hold public office (though this would almost never stick). \n\n- Neighboring states are using **taxpayer money** to teach that the loch ness monster is real (and disproves evolution). \n\n- Politicians in my state **officially** reject the teaching of critical thinking skills because they \"undermine beliefs\". \n\n- Churches throughout the country **blatantly** break the laws for non-profits and remain unpunished.\n\n- **Homosexuals cannot marry the person they love** in many places. I shouldn't even have to mention this, but it's a big one.\n\nAnd those are just a few.

{"body": "Just thought I'd throw in my personal set up as well, if you want to explore multiple options\n\nCapture device/software: [Elgato Game Capture HD](http://www.elgato.com/gaming/game-capture-hd)\n\nThe Elgato is incredible. It's very simple to use and comes with all of the cables you need. It's capable of capturing in 1080p which is a great plus. The software that comes with it is very easy to use and works very well. One of the best features of this capture card is that the files that it makes are remarkably small considering their quality. I'll record like an hour and a half of 1080p gameplay and only end up with an 18GB file but the quality still looks perfect.\n\nIt allows you to capture your voice from a microphone at the same time that you play, but I like to be able to change the volume on my own later so I use Audacity as well. The software also has integration with Twitch if you want to livestream, however I haven't used this feature yet.\n\nOverall, the elgato might be a little bit more of an investment but it's DEFINITELY worth it. You'll get great quality and it'll make recording a lot easier. It also has support for legacy consoles and since it uses HDMI/component it should be compatible with the next generation of consoles as well.\n\nMicrophone: [Blue Yeti](http://bluemic.com/yeti/)\n\nI use the Yeti but there are cheaper options by Blue that also have fantastic audio quality. If you're looking for something on the cheaper side, go for the Blue Snowball hands down or maybe the Blue Nessie. [The Snowball is one sale right now on amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-Microphone-Textured/dp/B000EOPQ7E) and it's definitely worth that price. A lot of commentators over look audio and just use their headset or laptop mic. In my opinion thats a huge mistake and for many people that will make or break whether or not they enjoy your video.\n\nAs far as video editing goes, g4video is right, Vegas is the way to go. But its expensive software. Elgato comes with editing software as well which seems like a good start if you can't afford Vegas as well.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371566982", "subreddit": "letsplay", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Up 2: Down**\n\nIn this Disney Pixar instant classic Russel sets out on his own adventure. Even though Russell has gotten much older he has gotten more and more fascinated with what is underground. He decided he needed to find out for himself using the house. Everyday he would put an extra drill underneath the house, to get closer to his goal. \n\n**20 years later**\n\n\"It is Time\" Russell though before looking at the big red button. He had spent the entire afternoon wiring all the drills up to that button. Not to mention all that duct tape that he used to secure the drills. He is just about to press the button when he hears a knock on the door.\n\n*knock* *knock* *knock*\n\nHe then walks over to the door. Upon opening he finds no body to be there. \n\n\"That was odd.\" he thought before returning to the button\n\n\"This is it, finally after 20 years I will accomplish my dream\" before pressing the button.\n\n**SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECHH**\n\nIn an instant the drills started to grind through the ground. The sound caused him to go almost completely deaf. As he looked through the window outside he saw everything. He felt the sensation similar to descending in an elevator. By now the ground was at eye level.. \n**^^^CLAAANNGNGNGNGNNGNNGGNNGN**\n\n**^^^CRASH**\n\n\"There goes the water pipes\" He could only barely hear it over the constant wurring of the drills and the ringing in his ears. Water started to rush into the house. Dirt started to fall through the cracks in the ceiling. \n\nThen there was silence.\n\n*knock* *knock*\n \n\"OH NO WHO WOULD THAT BE\". Russell rushed to the door. He opened it to find a small child was sitting on the porch. His hearing had only just recovered and he didn't want to have to deal with some annoying kid. The child opened his mouth to speak but was interupted by a loud crumbling noise. \n\n**CRUMBLE**\n\nThen there was complete silence. \"The ground must have given way and there must have been a hole beneath the ground\" he realized. The change in speed caused the house to rotate. \"Quickly get inside.\" The two of them bolted for the door. Russell opens the door. But as he opens the door, all the water from the inside rushs outside to the already rotating house. \n\n**SPLASH**\n\nThe Russell and the child slide back closer and closer to the edge. The child falls off the edge. \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\" he screams. But Russell grabs him just in time. But as he does so he slides to the edge. \n \"Why did you come to my house?\"\n\"I will tell you if i can first ask you a question\"\nThey kept on falling.\n\"What!?\"\n\"Could i have tree fiddy\"\n\n\nThis was not worth the time i spent writing this", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371649876", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

My big thing is I really don't like being straight up lied to. \n\nThere was this lady asking me for some help with her car because it broke down. She needed $5 for a part from the AutoZone across the street. I asked her what the part was. She couldn't tell me. I told her that I could meet her at the AutoZone, and speak with the rep that was holding the part for her, and she told me no. I asked her what type of car she drove and she started getting really defensive. She started speaking really quickly, and ended up saying something like \"just give me the fucking $5 already.\" Yeah, I'm not giving you a dime. \n\nPeople asking for change for food, I offer to buy them food and they say no, just give me the money. There's this guy outside my work, that has been begging for the 5+ years I've worked there, that always asks \"any change to help me buy a sammich?\" I've offered the food, and he rejects it. After the first time he rejected, I simply started to ignore him. He's there every day, for going on 5 years, he's not helping himself... \n\nHowever, on a dozen or so occasions, I've picked up a sandwich and offered it up and it was greatly appreciated/accepted. So it really depends on the person begging. \n\nI recall one instance where I grabbed lunch. On the way back to work, I saw this really attractive, albeit a little dirty (unshowered), woman in her 20's asking for change. There were a couple guys suggesting she go with them for a quick tug for $5, but she turned them down and keep walking. I felt bad that she was automatically labeled as a prostitute, and I offered her my lunch. She took it and thanked me. I asked if she knew of any shelters near by and she said she did, but was a bit far from the one she normally went to. Apparently she needed to take the light rail to get back.

{"body": "So basically, last year (grade 10), I had this stupid bitch of a science teacher who cared about nobody and didn't even know half of the material. Just to prove her stupidity, I once asked for help on something. Her response? A long, drawn out \"Laaaaaaame\", followed by telling me that I should have been listening. But that's getting off topic. \n\nWhat happened was, we had this electricity ball thing in the classroom for the day. When you touched it, it would zap you enough to really hurt. So there was this one girl, let's call her Moshaniqquahtae, who showed up late. She showed up after the teacher explained what this ball thing does and didn't even notice it when she came in the class. My teacher told her to get a late slip, and still without noticing the ball thing, Moshaniqquahtae left to go get her slip. \n\nWhile Moshaniqquahtae was gone, my teacher had the brilliant idea to, when she came back, tell her to put her hand on the ball because all it would do is make her hair stand up. I mentioned that this probably wasn't a good idea and that she could probably get into a bit of trouble for this, but she wasn't having any of it. She basically told me to shut up and not to ruin it for everybody. So Moshaniqquahtae gets back and the teacher proceeds with her devious plan. She tells Moshaniqquahtae to put her hand on the ball and it will only make her hair stand up. She's about to put her hand on ~~my balls~~ the ball when I jumped up and shouted, \"Moshaniqquahtae NO!!!!!\" \n\nShe then turns around, stomps towards me and looks me dead in the eyes. \"What do you want?\" I ask her. After a bit of a pause, she comes in even closer and replies, \"about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this point I realized that she was eight stories tall and from the paleolithic era.

I was convinced that if I walked next to a sewer grate that I would get sucked in by that damn clown's creepy hands. Eventually, I got over this, because the other kids wanted to play in the storm drains near our neighborhood. \n\nWe would go and explore the drains for hours, but I don't think we ever realized just how far the drains went. I can imagine it went under some major streets, now that I look back on all of the signs. But, at the time, we didn't care, we were just exploring.\n\nDuring the same time period, there was a guy that was picking up kids dressed up like a clown. A little girl that lived across the street from us got molested, and said that it was a man dressed like a clown in a red pickup truck. In my mind, we were safe as long as we didn't run into a pickup truck.\n\nOne day, my brother and I were exploring the drains and decided to check out a path we hadn't ever explored. Now, normally you find things like pop cans, cigarette butts, but we were finding blankets, magazines, lots of nasty looking bottles. I remember thinking that we were going to find treasure, and was completely unprepared for what came next.\n\nWe weren't thinking about people coming from behind us, only in front. By the time we realized what was happening it was too late. We heard the footsteps first, but he was right up on us before we could turn around and grabbed both of us by the arms. He asked what we were doing there, and I told him 'nothing' and that we needed to go home. He told us that we were trespassing, and that we shouldn't be there. I said sorry and that we needed to go, but he wouldn't let us leave, I asked him why not, and he said that he needed something first. I asked him what it was.\n\nIt was about that time that I realized this man was a three story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era, and he said, \"oh, about three fiddy.\" And I said, \"goddamnit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no damn three fiddy!\"\n\nAnd the he raped and murdered us.

{"body": "My parents were out for the night when I was 15, so being the only child still living at their house I was alone, with the exception of three dogs. \n\nWhen it was getting to be around 10:30 and I was dosing off in the chair watching TV like I had most of the night when the dogs act strange.\n\nThey act as if they are getting anxious. Like when they know a storm is coming or my parents are driving up. But neither of those things are occouring, it is a cloudless night and my parents will be gone for at least another hour. \n\nSo I peek outside, assuming it's my neighbors working in their garage or talking outside to see a siloette seemingly in the street. This was at a quick glance so by the time I looked again it was gone. So I easily assumed it was someone walking or just my imagination anticipating someone.\n\nAbout that time I decided I should go lay down, seeing as I'd end up going to some friends house the next day and staying up all hours or the night. So I shower and get ready for bed. But as I lay down I hear the handel jiggle at the back door. \"Oh, they are back.\" Easy enough to forget and blow off. But as time passed (I was very unsure if I could have fallen asleep or not by now) but I didn't hear any of the usual sounds of my parents getting in with happy animals greeting them. \n\nSo i get up cautiously to see whats up, and i find the back door wide open. My heart fucking drops. I'm frealing out so i immediatly shut the door and search quicjly fir ny phone in the dark and I just glance up. The same silhouette I barely saw earlier is about 3 feet from me so I jump strait into bed and get as close the the wall as I can\n\nI just hear its footsteps get closer. I try my hardest just to say \"What do you want....\" while completely shaking. I faintly hear \".....about......tree fiddy....\" and by the time I flip over I realize the shadow is about 6 stories tall and a district fish smell in the air and I look up and shout \"Ya gawd damned Locheness monsta you ain't getting' no tree fiddy from me!\" And proceeded to chase the monsta down the street with a free branch from the front yard. I had to explain to my parents sometime later why I was running down the street in my PJ's with a branch when they came up the driveway.

It was at a church camp thing that I went to every year, I think I was like 12 or 13 at the time so I was just barely getting into girls. Her name was Megan and we became really good friends *really* quickly. She was probably the sweetest girl in the universe, I don't think I heard her say a single swear word the entire time I was there. About halfway through the camp, we all had to partner up for some sort unguided hiking thing. The idea was that we were taken to a random spot in the brush and we had to make our own way back to the camp. Take one guess as to who I chose to be with. Out in the woods. Unsupervised. We were doing just fine for about half an hour, so we stopped to rest for a while. I seriously don't think there has ever been a quieter lunch ever in human history. By this point, I had already decided I liked Megan as more than a friend, but I didn't really know how to bring it up. Luckily, I didn't have to :). When we were packing up and getting ready to go she stood up right in front of me and asked \"Can I ask you something?\" Of course, I said \"sure, that's what I'm here for\" Then, she smiled and said in the sweetest voice possible \"Can I borrow about tree-fiddy?\" That's when I realized that this whole time I had been crushing on an 8 story tall sea monster from the Paleolithic era! I looked at her and I said \"Dangit loch ness monster, I an' given you no tree-fiddy!\" Then she say \"Well what about two-fiddy?\" so I say \"OH, so now it's only two-fiddy? What's *that* supposed to mean? Dangit, Loch Ness Monster you can find your own way back to camp!\" So I just turn around right there and start walking back to camp, I was so mad at the Loch Ness Monster for tricking me like that, I don't think I said I single word to her for a week.

After a little while in this house things started to get strange. we have this little room that is intended for a maid or guest we decided to just leave it empty. One day though my little brother, who was 6 at the time, comes up to me and asks me why the old lady was crying. I was genuinely confused and asked what he was talking about. What do you know, he lead me to the maid room and said the old lady was crying in here. After this event we would occasionally find my little brother in the room just sitting on the bed occasionally mumbling. My family just tried to play it of as a 6 year old's imagination, but things changed quickly. One night i had some friends over we stayed up late to smoke some shisha. There were three of us in total and it was about 1:30 am when we heard a slam like a door was closing. We thought it was one of my parents about to find us smoking their shisha. So we tried to hide the hooka and hide around the corner. After 5 minutes of nothing happening we went back and continued smoking until 2 am. We finally called a night and were on are way back up stairs when we heard a wail from the maids room. It sounded sort of like my little brother so i went to see what was going on. I was the only one with the balls to go check it out so i went in. My brother was sitting on the edge of bed whimpering, i couldn't quite tell what he was trying to say. I asked him if everything was okay. He looked me dead in the eyes and said no. I asked him what was wrong, and this is the creepiest part, hw said the old lady needs something. I asked him what she needed, he proceed to tell me she needed about tree fiddy... thats when i realized there was no ghost only a 300 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era....\n\n**TL;DR** Brother see's ghost and i find him conversing with ghost at 2 am.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371754530", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Oh Goodie!  I love telling this story!    \n   \nSo the wife and I are in bed one night. She's asleep and I'm drifting off and I remember that I was supposed to send an important email.  So I sit up and open the laptop and this stirs the wife, who has long entertained me by attempting to do awake things while sleeping.  She sits up and reaches for the jug of juice that I moved from next to the laptop.  She finds the nearest object to the spot it was in, which happens to be my wrist, and pulls it towards her, turning my hand, trying to unscrew it like a lid.  When that doesn't work she says 'Gimme the juice- GIMME!' and pulls my hand into her face. Hard. 'Asshole, Gimme Juice!'  At this point I'm giggling to the point I'm not able to sustain muscle tension, and he smacks herself in the mouth a couple times.  The juice is on the other side of her and behind both of us, and I'm using my right arm to try and reach behind me and get it for her while she keeps pulling on my arm.  \n   \n 'I'm not the juice Hon, lemme get it for you.   \n'Shut up!  Asshole!'   \n   \nShe finally throws my arm down with a noise of disgust and I manage to turn and grab the bottle of juice.  This is very difficult as in addition to the uncontrollable giggling, being tangled in blankets and wife, and being slapped in the head parts and told to shut up.  I get the juice and turn back to hand it to her just in time to see her get hold of a dipping cup of marinara sauce leftover from dinner and sort-of drink from it.  I say sort of because while she did get some sauce in her mouth, most of it ended up on her face hands and lap because she smashed it more into the side of her mouth than any drinking motion. What can I say?  Her eyes never opened the whole time.     \n   \n'Chicken!  That's not the juice either! Here!'   \n'I JUST WANT JUICE! Why are you being such a jerk?'   \n'Just take the juice, here you go, in your hands.'    \n   \nSo I put the juice in her hands and she chugs a bunch of it, sighs heavily, and flops back down to her pillow.  At this point I completely lose it and roll onto my side laughing tears down my cheeks.   \n   \nShe. Starts. Kicking. Me.   \n'Shut up shut up you're an asshole stop laughing at me'   \nThere is absolutely no chance of me not laughing harder at this.   \n'Fuck you, get outta here. Get out, Jerkface.'   \n   \nAt this time we lived in a crazy home-built cab-over camper on a mountain while we built our cabin. 16 miles from Canada. It's February. It's about -15F outside and snowing heavily.  Also there's very large cats prowling around.   \n   \n'Get out?  Where should I go?'   \nShe's still kicking and hitting me, but not really hard and without much conviction.  I'm still earning it, straining to breathe between guffaws.   \n'I don't care just shut up and get outta here. Why are you laughing at me?'   \n'Because you're hilarious, Baby, go back to sleep'   \n'Fuck you! Shut up! *nothing about this is funny!*   \n   \nThis only fuels my fit, and brings another flurry of poorly aimed flappy slapping.  I manage to stop laughing. She rolls over and Harrumphs and after a minute starts snoring.  I remember, again, this email I'm supposed to send. And after picking bits of styrofoam and tomato off the laptop, I send what I need and lay back down.   \n   \nOnly to have the Wife-Bird roll over, throw an arm and a leg across me, smoosh her marinara mouth into my hair and mumble 'I love you.'   \n   \nIn the morning she remembers *nothing*.   She does want to know why there's sauce on everything and why her hand hurts (she hit the ceiling several times in her flailings) but *I won't tell her*.  I tease her about this for several months ('You don't know what you did.') before telling her family at her birthday dinner while she went to the bathroom.  Do *not* put sauce on me.   \n   \nThat is all.   \n   \n**TL;DR:  My wife became an 8-story crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.**\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371754785", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, firstly, as a veteran of US private schools, I have seen them give aid to low-income students. This wouldn't change with the voucher system. Secondly, moving to vouchers is part of moving away from these nationalized standardized tests. As it stands, 90% of funding comes from states or communities rather than the Feds, and most states have more stringent standards than Common Core. In other words, the federal funding has been more of a compliance measure than a means to force states to have higher standards. I'm not billing vouchers as a silver bullet, but in all the years we've tried to throw money and federal programs at education, we're no better off and we're spending far more per student than ever before (even though we're spending less on things like arts, music, and technology than twenty years ago). Blame the unions, blame the parents, it doesn't matter. What matters is holding educators accountable for educating children, and creating a system in which schools that educate children the best are rewarded with funding can't be bad. The only people who stand to lose their shirt are administrators making six figures who are phased out in a more decentralized, local approach. And trust me, I'm attunded to the fears of teaching ID in schools, but given the choice between a system that allows fourth-graders to be illiterate and one that teaches them that Nessie was a dinosaur fashioned by god, I'll probably take the system that gives parents a choice in the matter\n\nEDIT: there's a Supreme Court case which allows for voucher funding for private schools so long as there are adequate secular options. I don't remember what it's called, but it was done around 2005 and sets a pretty clear litmus test for a parochial school to get voucher funding.

Now me being a fiscal little bugger saved those quaters to get more hotwheels or a better toy, I don't really remember why perhaps my Grandma told me to.\n\nHowever one day my mom took us kids with her to the grocery store. Now we didn't go to the grocery store with my parents much at this time, so this was a whole new experience for me. As we were walking up and down the aisles we came across something I thought was magical, a giant container full of candy; one of those fill a bag and pay by the pound things. To my young little mind this was freakin Willy Wonka's factory. I pleaded with my mom to have my go at this magical machine, and after a while she hesitantly gave in saying I could only get so much. She took me over to the scale a showed me how to work it, showing me where on it to stop filling the bag. \n\nAfter recieving these instructions I was let loose, like a dog being told \"go get it\" to the ball that was thrown only seconds ago. I picked all the candies I could, jelly beans, taffies, root beer barrel hard candies, etc... I was happy, as, well a kid in a candy store. Once I was done I carried what, at the time, seemed like a huge bag of candy all around the store. I was proud, look at this bag I thought, all my candy.\n\nFinally we get to the check out lane and I'm standing in line, I see the cashier, she smiles at me. I smile back, I know soon this big thing of candy is going to be mine. After what seems like forever, my mom lifts me up to put the bag on the conveyer. I watch intensely as the cashier puts it on the scale, I don't want her taking one single piece. Finally she say's with a smile \"your total is three dollars a fifty cents'. I started counting my money, and it hit me. I looked up again at the cashier and realize she's not a cashier, but a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\nI was sad.. depressed, all that hard work. Deciding what candies I wanted more of, but always making sure not to take too much so I'd be able to try them. All of this ruined because of this, the poor little child heart crushed.\n\n**TL;DR: Almost bought a dildo as a child.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371804102", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

We pre partied at my place and went through a bottle of vodka before we even went to the bar. There were 4 or 5 of us. The memory is a bit shaky. I've always had a desire to try tequila and when we got to the bar we ended up buying a bottle of it. At first we just had margaritas and the sort with it but eventually ended up with shots and shots and then some more shots. After we were lit like a Christmas tree we stumbled out of the bar and started looking for our car. We forgot we took a taxi. After not finding it we went into a convenient store to use their phone as we were all freaking out. We decided to get some drunchies while we were there and I ended up eating an entire bag of chips before I left the store. As we were leaving a man started following us. As stupid as we were we ended up stumbling down a dead end alley.

{"body": "I had an affair with my current wife while I was with my ex-wife. \n\nI had just gotten married to first wife, she was my highschool sweet heart. We had been together since the start of highschool, freshmen year to senior year. After highschool we decided to get married. It was going great until this one month when stuff started getting weird. I was still attracted to her and everything, but we just weren't clicking. \n\nOne day in the summer, we were having a family reunion when I notice one of my cousins. At first I didn't even recognize her, the last time I had seen her was when I was about 10. She was smoking hot and I didn't even know she was my cousin, so I started having a flirtatious conversation with her. Nothing serious, just playful flirting. She didn't recognize me either. In our family reunions my uncle usually calls all our family friends to have a joint family reunion with us, so they bring their families and everything as well, it's usually a huge gathering of people at his huge house. So one thing led to another and we ended up making out in my uncle's bedroom and then having sex. When we were done we came out of the room and started chatting with people. A few mins later my dad walks by and he's like \"I see you've met your cousin\" or something like that and I said \"My cousin?!\" I was shocked a bit when I first found out, she also was visibly surprised. I turned really red and just sat there thinking \"this can't be happening.\" The rest of the night was really awkward. We talked about it a little bit before she left and she said she didn't know we were cousins either. It turns out she was also married (I hadn't noticed the ring before). I just told her to forget about it and we could both move on with our lives.\n\nFast forward a few months. I get a phone call from her. She says she's pregnant, and she's 80% sure it's my baby. She said her husband thinks it's her baby. I was already having problems with my wife and I couldn't handle all this stress. I told her to just forget about me and just move on. I told her it wasn't my baby. She was upset and said she wanted to marry me. I told her that it wouldn't work out because we were both married and our family would be totally against it. \n\nA few months pass and she has the baby. Low and behold, he looks *exactly* like me. After seeing him (she sent me a picture) I couldn't bare the thought of some stranger raising my kid. My life was becoming miserable. I wasn't attracted to my wife any more and our sex life was practically dead. After much deliberation, I decided to divorce my wife. Before I told my wife, I told my cousin. She surprised me by saying she had already divorced her husband because he cheated on her. In my mind, at that time I had made my decision to marry her. I told her to get on the next plane to California and fly out here. She was afraid to come by herself so I flew out there after I divorced my current wife and was going to buy the plane ticket. I asked her how much the ticket would be and she said... \"about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized she was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Goddamnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away with my baby. \n\nI was shocked and had to end up flying back home alone. Sometimes I sit and think about that period of my life, just meditating on this whole surreal ordeal. \n\n**TL;DR: Had an affair with my cousin and had a baby with her, we divorced our SOs**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371849165", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

I was on holiday with my family in Aruba and it was the first day we had gotten there, so the phone was ringing off the hook with the resort staff begging us to go to those free breakfast buffet/time share meetings. So we decided, what the heck, let's do it. I'm pretty sure we just did it for the breakfast.. But anyway, at breakfast, I come back with a plateful of food and sit down. The timeshare guy just stares at my plate and says \"interesting choice,\" to which I respond, \"to which do you refer\". He pointed at the crablike piece of meat on my plate and asks \"do you have any idea what that is?\" And I say.. \"Well no, but it looked delicious.\" (I'll include a picture of it at the end). He looked at me and just laughed. I was confused as hell at this point, so i begin going around the room asking people if they knew what it was. Most people didn't know. But the staff stared at it wide-eyed, whispered among each other, and giggled like idiots. So I get tired of this. I finally go to the time share guy and demanded to know what animal it was. He sighed and looked serious all of a sudden. He said \"Ok yeah, i'll tell you\". You can imagine my relief, but then he said \"But first, imma need about tree fiddy\". It was at this point that I realized the time share guy was an eight story high crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "I know you guys are mocking this kid, but these type of hunters and hunts do happen. I once met a guy who invited me to his place in Alaska to go spear hunting in medieval equipment. Yes, you read that right. Spears, the big stick with a giant arrow head you thrust at the animal and metal armor. \n\nSo we did some trail work. Lots and lots of area around there to search. We found a good location and marked it off. About a week went by and we got our gear order in. \n\nI ordered items from Cold Steel, which uses modern machining and steel with classic designs. The Boar spear and Gladius machete were my carry items. I figured the spear keeps me at a decent distance to get some bleeding going and the gladiator sword was a good fit for finishing the job if the spear broke. \n\nIn terms of armor I did chain mail thinking it would be quieter and allow better movement. More on this mistake later. I found a shop in England and can't for the life of me remember the name, wish I could. When I got it I was more than a little worried. The quality is what I would of expected for a game of Dungeons and Dragons not actually going out in. I did some quick thinking and was able to put together some better quality chain mail using butchers items. Apparently it's still in use by commercial butchers and shark divers. Thank god.\n\nSo the big day comes. The group meets up at base camp. We ended up with myself, George  Spicer, William Fraser, and Luigne Min. We suit up, and head out to battle. Note at this point, we are entering remote Alaska without any modern comfort to hunt a bear. Yes, I was dropped as a child. \n\nDay one was spent mainly walking around looking for bear. I'll be honest, it felt amazing. I could have been hunting anything and felt invincible. I wasn't, more on that later. So we are now over half a day out clanging around in the woods. I don't really know what time it is since its almost always light out that time of year. We lay down and get some shut eye. \n\nSleeping in armor is not a bit comfortable or warm. Think bare skin on ground sapping your body heat. Not a good idea. So stiff and sore we set out again. There is a tussling in the brush, GAME TIME! We set up our prearranged formation to provide space for each of use to attack without impending the others. Out it comes but not a bear. Instead we are facing a far less dangerous Grey Wolf. \n\nWe came to hunt, so I was first to drive my spear. I missed horribly. William came in from the flank and stuck it right behind the ear. As William is trying to keep his pissed off dog on a stick under control I come in with the Galdiator sword swinging, I missed again falling onto the back of the beast. As it turns to bite into my bicep I manage to get my sword into its lungs. \n\nWhat I learned is that A) I should have been practicing on moving targets and B) chain mail is not as effective as I hoped. While it would have been much worse without it the tips of the teeth did make it in far enough to cut me up and the pressure from the bite was still felt. \n\nNone the less, we now had some experience and were already changing our plans on how to make it better effective come meeting up with a bear. Not to mention we had a nice piece of fur for the wall back home.\n\nSo, we head back to our base camp by the lake. Clean my wounds and the skin. Spoiler alert, bloody trail right into camp. \n\nWe eat and bed down. I'm woken up by George and Bill telling me there is a bear in camp. We quietly suit up and stick our heads out. Luigne is up a tree with a bear at his feet. He's got boots and boxers kicking downward at the bears head from his branch. Funny sight this early but frightening as hell because our buddy is going to be lunch meat if we don't act fast.\n\nI'm out first and moving in. The other two are on my heels. I come in and stick it right in the belly. The bear now knows we are there and it's pissed. I learned how insanely fast those bastards are first hand when it was down and  planting a hard blow to my side. I went down but kept ahold of the spear. Will was in next, he drove right into the chest below the neck. George also connected from the other side. \n\nI'm back up at this point. I seem pretty okay, so I'm back into the action. The bear slivers Wiiliam's spear like a twig. This is a solid ash wood. Gone in a swipe. Cue shitting of pants.\n\nI drive in and stick a heavy shot into the opposite side from George. We are basically holding this monster at bay. George pulls his axe and shield. He steps in, takes zero swings and is ripped into by the bear. I shit again. \n\nIn attempt to pull it my way hopefully saving George I pull my spear and start quickly jabbing with it. This works. Too well. I've got full attention on me now. George is scurrying to his feet. This is the first time I lost consciousness. I woke up a short bit later on the ground. I pick myself up and see Luigne and Will jabbing at it keeping it at bay. \n\nThere is blood everywhere. I'm bleeding, George is bleeding, Will took a few gashes, and Luigne is still in his boxers but strangely unharmed. I asked them how long I was out. This is where it got weird. The bear answered looking down with those big red eyes\"about treefiddy!\" And that's when I knew. It was the Loch Ness Monster and we were the hunted. \n\nWe all escaped with our lives thanks to the boots of running. I still look at the wolf pelt from time to time and think about that day. In Alaska. \n\nTL;DR: Yes, people hunt with bladed weapons but it rarely turns out how they wanted.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371940262", "subreddit": "Hunting", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There's a high chance of this getting buried, but I feel like it's about time I dumped my complete memory of this night somewhere. It's long and detailed, but that's what makes me treasure the memory even more.\n\nOne pleasant summer Sunday evening, I was in a local park with a few friends when a small group of people started playing football (the round kind) across the field. As chance would have it, the ball flew away from their reach and landed near us, whereupon a member of their group invite us to join them. \n\nWe enthusiastically accepted, imitating their infectious, child-like state of abounding energy and cheer. It had been a very long time since any of us had played football, let alone in this sort of atmosphere. As the sunlight waned, we stopped playing and our combined group migrated to the farthest portion of the park from the approaching shadows for an impromptu picnic. We shared stories and food, quickly learning that these group of people were exchange students from various parts of the world whose visit was quickly coming to an end. Eventually, some amount of alcohol was fetched and we all had a great time laughing getting drunk together.\n\nOne by one, pieces group retired to their homes, tired from the action and spurred by the responsibilities of the next day, including work, packing, and other social obligations. Eventually, only two of us remained, a British girl and I. It would not be bold to say that I was very content with this arrangement, as she was very pleasant to be around. \n\nIt would be dishonest to exclude any mention of her appearance. She was very pretty; her long black hair a stark contrast to her pale ivory skin, which seemed to glow in the moonlight. Although we were sitting without facing each other, it wasn't difficult to notice her figure. She was stacked, but it betrayed none of her lithe, athletic agility in the activities prior. I later found out that she was once a ballet dancer in high school.\n\nNow, I call myself an asexual, so I only admired her body as you would a good painting or fine sculpture. What truly killed it for me was her smooth, dulcet voice that made clear her British heritage. It's painful every time I think about it, but it was clear that I fancied her.\n\nStill buzzed from the alcoholic picnic earlier, we talked in depth about music and art, both being in the STEM field ourselves. It was soon revealed that she was a hobby photographer, whereupon she showed me her photos and we discussed our wishes for travel, and eventually life. This was the point where it came out that I did not own or use a phone. \n\nThe night went on and we slowly transitioned from talking to singing. Needless to say, this was an amazing experience for me. We sang things together from Classical to Pop, the most noteworthy being our ad-lib rendition of the soprano and tenor sections of Beethoven's Ode to Joy, which sounded heavenly (for want of a less cheesy word) on her part. Inevitably, the tiredness and alcohol took a toll on us, and we slept in the park wrapped in a picnic blanket like a kebab. \n\nI woke up at about 7am, much later than sunrise but far earlier than I'd normally wake. She was gone, which evoked less emotion and reaction from me than it should have. I simply took the blanket and went home, suddenly realising that I didn't remember her name (yeah...) nor her university and had none of her contact information. As far as the world was concerned, we'd never met. Of course I tried to fix this by harassing every one of my friends for any details on the other people present that night, but my efforts were fruitless. The full weight of the consequences of this situation hadn't yet fallen on me yet, so I went about the rest of my day moping but otherwise doing the normal things. I tried to assign reason to the pain by imagining that she didn't feel the same connection that I did, or that she wasn't attracted to me, or that she already had a boyfriend. All of these hurt but made things a little more bearable. Little did I know that I would feel *MUCH* worse later.\n\nAs my day came to an end, I decided to take a shower. While I was cleaning myself, I noticed that the soap scum was darker than expected, even for my usually dirty self. I checked myself to see the smudged and desecrated remnants of what I assumed to be her number written on the distal edge of my forearm in charcoal. It was at this point where the weight of the situation came crashing down on me. I yelled and screamed and languished for weeks, knowing that I'll never see her again. \n\nThere's no tree fiddy to this story, no happy ending, no clean break; just the crushing realisation that I will never find this person that I really want in my life. I sometimes lay on the grass at that park, on the first Sunday of the month, reminiscing on the most perfect Sunday of my life.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371976637", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This was last week actually,  I was walking down the street about 2 am, I can't sleep at night sometimes so I like to listen to music and feel the night air when I'm awake that late. Well every once in a while there are these group of kids drinking by this dumpster at the end of the street corner that enters the canyons. Every time they're there I always stand by them look around and leave so I don't look scared or suspicious. One time they tried to offer me a beer but I refused and walked away, they seemed a little frustrated and quiet when I didn't accept their offer . Well this time last night there was just a girl sitting down all by herself and it looked like she'd been crying her eyes out, or she was sick or something. I didn't know what to say so I looked around and asked if she was okay. She looked up at me in complete silence. She was real quiet for like 10 seconds just looking at me. said she was in trouble and needed to think. She kept on asking me where I lived. If I had any friends that lived around the area, she kept looking around like if she was waiting for something or someone, asking me where I was going and if I knew if any stores were open. I was pretty weirded out by that point and needed something to say to leave the scene immediately. Right when I was about to leave and say goodbye she Gets up. I can tell she was thinking if something to say, finally she asks \"do you think I can borrow your phone? I need to make a real quick call\" I look at her sadly, I felt bad and say \" sorry this is just an iPod I don't have my phone on me, I'm sorry\" she looks at me strangely. \"p-please halp m-me\" she seemed sick and upset stuttering her words slowly. \"what do you need lady\" I asked. Then out of nowhere she quickly grabs my arm, she looks at me and says \" I'm Gunna need about tree fiddy\", her hand looked green and scaly, I didn't know how I hadn't noticed before, her nails were long and sharp, green and slimey. That's about the time I realized that the girl was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "The reason they've been labeled as a hoax is that the vast vast majority of sightings HAVE BEEN hoaxes. There are incredibly few plausible photos, and those that do exist are a) blurry, and b) indistinguishable from a moving wake in the water.  \n\nBut let's set aside the purported sightings, because we could argue in circles about those all day. Let's just talk about biological possibility. I'll focus on Loch Ness, since Nessie is the most famous case, but you can apply all of this to the majority of these \"deep lake\" scenarios.  \n\nIf a plesiosaur population has survived, it would almost certainly be somewhere in incredibly deep ocean water. That's the greatest odds. But that's not where the claims are - they're in Freshwater Lakes.  \n\nWhen we posit an undiscovered animal, there are two main questions:  \n1) Does it have somewhere to hide (in this case, yes)  \n2) Does it have a sufficient food source to sustain a breeding population, given its dietary demands and the evident rate of consumption in that location? (in this case, definitely no)\n\nGlacial-fed, deep freshwater lakes simply do not have the carrying capacity to support an unknown 20-meter-long top level carnivore. The carrying capacity of a lake is directly proportional to the amount of light going into a lake. Light sustains algae and plant matter, which form the basis of a lake's food chain. Loch Ness is not only very narrow and deep (meaning minimal light per volume), but its waters are incredibly murky - light doesn't penetrate very far into the lake. And the waters are incredibly cold (glacier-fed, remember), further reducing the number of species that can survive there.  \n\nThere are only about 8-10 fish species living in Loch Ness, and their populations are very sparse. Conversely, a  sustainable breeding population of plesiosaurs would need a huge volume of food to survive. It's a TWENTY METER animal. A breeding population of even a dozen individuals would stretch the lake well beyond its limits - and would have major genetic issues within generations (much less millions of years).  \n\nAs to migrating, well, the waters connecting the Loch to the sea have numerous shallow rapids, and have been heavily inhabited by humans for a long time.  Even allowing for a plesiosaur to slip by... a 20 meter animal doesn't exactly SNEAK through shallow rapids.  \n\nThere ARE a few freshwater lakes in the world with rich biodiversity - Like Bical, for example. But in these locations STILL, a breeding population of 20-meter carnivores would leave a huge unexplained footprint on the lake's biodiversity, and that simply isn't the case.  \n\nSo, on the whole...  \n\nCould there be a plesiosaur alive somewhere? Yes. Assuming adaptations for cold, deep water, perhaps a modern day descendant is alive somewhere off the continental shelf.  \n\nBut in freshwater lakes? I won't 100% count it out, but that's only because it's nearly impossible to prove a negative. Lacking any solid evidence, whether in documentation or in secondary evidence, the burden of proof lies squarely on proponents. Until you show that there IS such a creature there, definitively... there isn't.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372031035", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hello, and welcome to Reddit!\n\nIntro: I am a *de facto* atheist, ex-Christian, and a proponent of knowledge seeking and keeping yourself informed of the natural world!\n(Love seeing talks by Dr. Tyson, Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, etc)\n\nMy family has always celebrated most holidays in more so the Pagan (or, rather, 'American' way). When my family and I were attending church when I was a kid, we celebrated more so the Christian side of it... but never really stuck. I suppose my parents still recognize the Christian aspects of holidays such as Christmas and Easter, but for me, I've done my homework in those holidays and recognize their Pagan roots and how churches (Catholic, mainly) during those times intentionally celebrated their religious holidays at the same time as the Pagan versions to try to convert them, despite Jesus not being born remotely close to December, for example.\n\nI don't aim to celebrate a holiday for a particular reason, other than its festivity, and leave out the religious stuff. Whenever I visit my family for the holidays, I respect their beliefs, whatever they may be, and take the opportunity to see loved ones as well as enjoy the over all spirit of the holidays in a purely secular manner.\n\nMy de-conversion was a gradual one. It began when I started to learn about other religions, and when I realized I never saw any actual proof of the god which I was raised around. Why should I believe in Yahweh and not Thor or Zeus? What if i was brought up during a different time period, in a different country? Would I instead have been taught to believe in Egyptian gods, or the JuJu of the mountain? The more I thought and learned about this, the more it became clear that, well, even taking Pascal's wager was a risky move.\n\nI used to date a Christian, but I was still a Christian at the time. Currently, I'm with the love of my life who shares the same beliefs as me. Difference is, she never believed, even as a child. We may have different upbringings and reasons as to why we came to (dis)believe, but the end result is still the same, and we have both fortified our beliefs for many of the same reasons.\n\nWe have both agreed that once we have children, we will not directly teach them atheism. Instead, when the time comes, we will begin exposing them to multiple religions, along side other things, like the loch ness monster, big foot, the tooth fairy, etc etc. We will equip our children with the tools and methods of analysis, questioning and inquiry. We will teach our children to be scientifically literate (not to be confused with scientists. The word science here is being used in its Latin derived meaning, knowledge - As Dr. Tyson quoted \"Science literacy is vaccine against charlatans of the world who would exploit your ignorance of the forces of nature.\")\nBy teaching our children how to inquire, how to question, and how to go about their lives with the tools necessary to filter what is plausible, what is myth, and what is fact, then they will be able to decide for themselves.\n\nI hope these answers give you some insight to how a lot of us think and view the world.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372063929", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Re-posting since it shows up as deleted:\n\n\nThis thread is seriously lacking some real responses so here I come (oh look, a pun?). Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nAs early as second grade, I started feeling something wasn't right with my body, as if something was holding me back. I always identified myself with the boys but my parents never worried or suspected anything because they just assumed I was experiencing a tomboy phase and it also helped that my mom used to be like that, too.\n\nWell, I kept the tomboy thing for some years until I hit puberty. It came late, by the way, I was over 15 years old I don't know if that's got to do with anything, but the few female friends I had, had it waaaay earlier.\n\nAnyway, I had no idea what was happening to me and felt completely alone, since there's actually very few people who can understand such level of confusion. Anyway, I started reading how sometimes your gender just doesn't match with your body and I was stocked since that was how I felt with MY body. I didn't really spoke about this with anybody, since I didn't have any close friends and my dad had died recently (but that's another story).\n\nI kept it like this until I was 18. By that time, I had decided I was gonna go through the procedure and my mom was being really supportive, although I don't think she ever understood.\n\nAfter the process, I wasn't sure anything had changed, but eventually everything started to fall into place. I now had boners! This might sound like nothing for you guys, but for me it was magical and stared ay my first one for an hour straight.\n\nAnyway, I moved for college as a guy and made some good friends (most of them I lost shortly after telling them my secret, but some, the best ones, stayed). They were as curious as anyone might be and they decided to help me out. One night close to my 22nd birthday we decided to go find some girls and went to one of the bars near campus.\n\nThis was my first time doing anything like this, I got rejected some times, probably because I was nervous as hell and chicks don't dig that (I would know), but since I kept drinking and am actually kind of attractive as a man dude I got lucky with a junior.\n\nI didn't tell her my secret, since I was keen on starting a new life (this is a mistake, I eventually learned that honesty is the way to go, specially in cases like this one).\n\nWe wen't outside for a smoke and suddenly she was all over me. I was worried I wouldn't get it up but my penis worked fine. She was also tipsy and suggested we wen't to her dorm.\n\nWe got there and stumbled around the room like young adults do. She asked me if I had a condom. I didn't! She told me not to worry since her roomate always had some spares (fuck yeah).\n\nThen things started to heat up very quickly. She started to take off my pants and rubbing my dick. I was proud of that boner, boys. I thought of asking her to be gentil, it even occurred to me that she could somehow rip it off but soon I forgot about that.\n\nShe started giving me oral, she did not commented anything on my penis, which was a great relief. I was standing there AMAZED at how good it felt.\n\nWe then took it to the bed where she some how had gotten rid of all my clothes. She offered to put on the condom for me and I said yes.

{"body": "So, there I am, standing at Chez Fromage. I've spent a nice few hours preparing for this, and I'm wearing a taut black dress and gorgeous drop earrings. A silver car pulls into the parking lot, and a handsome brunet steps out. The man nears the restaurant and walks up to me.\n\n\"Excuse me, are you Optimismoid?\" He gives a suave grin and I feel myself blushing, but I nod. \"I'm [Ryan], your date for tonight.\" Gently, he takes my hand and kisses it lightly. I smile, and his eyes meet mine. \"Would you care to introduce yourself, as well?\"\n\n*Shit. This is my moment. Make an impression, Optimismoid.*\n\n\"Try it with your anus instead!\"\n\n*Damnit! Why did I say that?*\n\nI giggle nervously and give a big grin, I'm trying to pass this off as goofy, but Ryan just gives me a strange, uncomfortable look. \"Erm, ha ha, sorry. I guess I'm not so good with comedy. I'm Optimismoid, pleased to meet you.\" I put my hand out for a handshake, but he ignores it and walks inside, for me to follow.\n\nA few awkward, silent moments pass before our waitress leads us to our table, a booth in the corner of the restaurant. \"I'll be few minutes to get your menus, okay?\" She smiles and rushes off, taking a refill for someone on her way. About a minute passes, still completely silent. At this point, I have to speak up.\n\n\"So, Ryan, what kinds of things are you into?\" I fold my hands under my chin and try to look extremely interested. \"Any hobbies? Interests?\"\n\nHe leans back into the cushy booth. \"I'm an avid swimmer, and a reader. I'm a writer, myself, and I guess I like video games a fair bit.\" He stares at me blankly.\n\n\"That's great! What's your favorite book? And what kinds of genres do you enjoy writing?\" He relaxes completely, and our menus arrive.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm a fan of fantasy. It comes naturally because it's so *incredibly* captivating. And my favorite book is Lord of the Rings, by J. R. R. Tolkien.\" He proceeds to tell me about how his dog, Moxie, tore up his copy of the trilogy that he got from his favorite uncle. From there we ease into conversation, and he's genuinely impressed when I told him how I once won a small writing contest. Before we know it, our meal is over. We order a sweet dessert, creamy chocolate fudge cheesecake, and decide to continue our date at his house. He's as stubborn as I am about who pays, so we split the bill.\n\nWhen we get back to his place, he puts on a romantic comedy. Some dumb Adam Sandler movie, but neither of us are too into it. We're busy getting frisky on his couch. He leads me to the bedroom, lights some candles, and begins to root around in his dresser's drawers. \"I have a surprise for you.\" He winks at me and pulls out a strap-on, and whispers into my ear. His voice is like silk. \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time that I noticed he was 500 feet tall and from the Mesozoic era.\n\nIt didn't really work out after that, but Ryan I did maintain a healthy friendship. He ended up with two beautiful children named Lily and Violet, and a kind wife named Jillian. I went to their wedding, and they went to mine. He moved to New York and got his dream job, as I did here.\n\n**TL;DR- I peg that bitch all night long.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372113548", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Except by the time we got there, division 2 was devastated and **we** were the assault.\n\n   Alpha was...is...my brother. My only sibling. *My only friend.* He was my medic and I was his sergeant. We were twenty meters away from the rally point inside the compound. We were coming up the hill and the Carb Artillery was firing like mad.\n   \n   Most of the team was wiped out but Alpha and I survived, plus two privates. One of which committed suicide after being torn apart by an additional artillery shell. I gathered my two compatriots and formed a plan.\n\n   There were two barricades; one manned by sentry pea shooters, and one by banana skirmishers. Alpha was to distract the pea shooters and we were supposed to disable them while they locked onto his heat signature. \n\n   The shooters were nothing but the bananas were what we were really worried about. We decided the best tactic was to lob grenades/spray and pray. The firefight ended with me and Alpha the only ones still alive and in the compound. \n\n   This is where shit gets heavy. We radioed in that we had taken the compound. *click* **\"Spud-Actual this is Spud 2-1, the compound is under our command, repeat, under our command.\"**.....nothing. We repeated the broadcast for a few minutes and assumed the worst. \n\n   After fifteen minutes of holding tight, the radio crackled and the saving words flowed out. **\"Spud 2-1 this is Killbox 3. The cavalry has arrived.\"**\n\n   Right then we heard the scream of two bombers overhead. They carpet-bombed the landscape until we couldn't see the sun. Cleanup was coming in 5. \n\n   Just then Alpha screamed my name. I whirled around to see him in a headlock from a skinned banana. I vomited from the sight of the banana and fell to my knees. \n\n   \"Don't hurt him. We can help you. The war is over, we will give you medical attention.\"\n\n   \"You just don't understand, do you...you dumb motherfucker.

I saw Alpha fall to the ground and convulse and then felt my sprout leg lose all feeling as the bullet dug in. The banana was long gone and on the stairs bleeding profusely. I crawled toward Alpha and he stopped shaking long enough to look up.\n\n   \"Delta, I need you to come here\" He wheezed.\n\n   \"You're going to make it.\"\n\n   \"No. I just want you to make sure one thing happens.\"\n\n   \"Anything.\"\n\n   \"Tell mom...I...\"\n\n   \"Yes Alpha!

Spring had come at last. \n\nThe news had set the small council to their tasks. Soon, relief for the battered and stalwart North and torn Riverlands would flow from the Reach. Lord Rickon would need to rebuild far more than Winterfell. In the Vale, the legitimized and victorious Alayne Arryn would be hosting the finest lords and knights of Westeros, to choose her husband. Peace was at last returning to the Stormlands, and the Dornish banners were finally coming home. \n\nDanaerys, restless, dreamed back on all she had overcome- the death of Drogo, the Red Waste, the wars in Slaver's Bay, and the winter- the long, cold winter.

They did not burn- they merely melted away. Cool water flowed from them, down to the banks of the Trident, over the rubies of Rhaegar, with blue rose petals swept in the water to the sea. The land would be replenished. \n\nShe awoke. Donning her Qartheen gown, she walked- past her Iron Throne. The stones of the keep were red- red as the blood of her grandfather.

Climbing the high tower, she stood overlooking her new home, familiar in its strangeness and strange in its familiarity. \n\nIn the west, the sun sank golden and red beyond the rain-swept ruins of Casterly Rock, beyond the bowed halls of the Iron Islands. Its setting rays shone through the gem-like glass of the great window, its crimson light penetrating through the seven pointed star as the flames of Rh'llor had penetrated through the Great Sept. The light danced across Danaery's skin. \n\n\"Love\", she said.\n\n\"What does my Lady require?\", asked Jon Targaryen, his hand moving across the swelling belly of his Queen. \n\nDanaerys smiled. \"I need about tree fitty\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372133695", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

It's this gut wrenching terror I would experience when having delirious night terrors when I had a high fever.  I was collecting wood, building shelter, setting up collectors for rain water, everything I would do in a real survival situation.  Everything appeared normal except for my emotion, which was one of pure terror.  That emotion went away whenever I looked out into the surf however.  Out in the distance, on the horizon, you could see the waves breaking over the reef surrounding the island.  Then, only the reef would pulsate quickly like the island did as a whole the rest of the time.  After I had experienced all this, I entered a semi-lucid state, where I knew I was dreaming but couldn't yet completely guide my dream.  I knew that I wanted off of the island but couldn't control how.  I focused out onto the horizon in hopes of conjuring a way to get off this terribly lonely island.  I managed to focus on the pulsing of the reef, and as the reef pulsed the reef took the shape of what I could only call a boatman.  The boatman approached the shore and held out what I think was a hand beckoning me to approach.  I walked forward and he stopped me, apparently demanding payment for passage.  I dug through my tattered shorts only to find about three dollars and fifty cents in random change.  It was about that time that I realized the 'boatman' was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era.  That goddamned loch ness monster woke me up from another lucid dream.

IKEA didn't have security so they called a bunch of workers and they temporarily restrained the daughter until they could calm her down.  Eventually though, she broke free of the security guys and started cussing like mad.  She ran up to her mom, grabbed her two crutches (at which point the mom crumpled to the floor in a sad heap) and proceeded to run out the door.  I had no idea she had thrown them in the trash, but that's obviously what she did according to this pic.  I did hear the manager asking the mom what had happened and apparently the daughter was pissed because the mom wouldn't let the daughter spend more than what was on the gift card that she was given for her birthday.  She was still on the ground, and although we all wanted to help her we were all just way too embarrassed for her at that point to do anything.  It was a really sad sight.

{"body": "First off, I suck at writing, so sorry if this is hard to read.\n\nSo I worked as a (female) flight attendant for a couple of years. The airline will go unnamed. But, here's the story:\n\nI was working a flight from SFO to Dubai, and was going through the standard motions. The flight was slightly delayed due to some weather concerns, seeing as SF is constantly foggy and cold and depressing in the summer (seriously, I lived there growing up and a few summers there will crush your soul). But nevertheless, the flight was set to go only about 30 minutes off schedule. It's a double-decker plane, one of the big ones. I'm on the second floor, where first class is. As the passengers start to board, I see the usual crowd. Old, rich, white guys, retired businessmen, a few younger men, but no one near my young age of 25.\n\nBut this one dude. This one guy. Young, good-looking, and he was actually wearing a fedora. However, unlike most people, he was able to pull it off and looked quite handsome. I was immediately smitten with him. Now, I know it sounds like a cliche, the whole \"love at first sight\" sappy story bullshit, but I immediately felt like I needed to be with him the rest of my life. \n\nHowever, I dismiss the feelings and keep working. About an hour and a half in, we go around delivering the first meal. I reach the guy's seat and hand him his meal but I slip up and clumsily drop his utensils. I bend over to grab them when all of a sudden we're hit by a little bit of turbulence, propelling me into his [space](https://www.google.com/search?q=first+class+international&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS456US456&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;authuser=0&amp;ei=GJnKUefIM8aYigLMpIHgBA&amp;biw=1745&amp;bih=890&amp;sei=GpnKUZ-zFePBigLC3YHABgA) and slamming my tits right into his face. As I tried to readjust, he grabbed my left boob and I immediately felt like a young kid whose crush had just talked to him for the first time. As I straighten myself and continue walking we simultaneously wink at each other. My heart melts.\n\nFast forward a few hours and he gets up to go to the bathroom. He slides into the cramped bathroom and as he tried to close the door I too slipped in and locked it behind me. He looked at me with wild eyes, and tried to question what I was doing.\n\nPutting my finger to his lips, I whisper, \"shhh\" and unzip his pants. His massive dick pops out ferociously. I can tell how horny he is. I open my mouth, slobbering at the prospect of blowing this random guy I've never met. I can't tell what's come over me, but it's some kind of primal instinct turning me into a Sexomatic Fuckotron 3000. Right as I get my lips around the tip of his massive, throbbing cock, he tries to push me away.\n\n\"Babe...I need something before we can do this,\" he says.\n\nGathering myself together, I respond, \"Anything for you,\" with my heart pounding.\n\nClumsily, he stammers and forces out the words, \"I.... I need about tree fiddy...\" I stare back, blankly, when I come to the sudden realization that I was sucking on the sexual organ of a giant 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I shouted back, \"gawdamn loch ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" With that, I ran out of the bathroom and into the aisleway. Stumbling to get away from this sea monster, I slip and my whole outfit comes apart in a massive wardrobe malfunction, revealing my tits and also waking all the passengers. A startled old lady immediately started shouting, \"DIRTY WHORES LIKE YOU ARE THE REASON WHY THIS COUNTRY IS IN THE SHITTER!\" and all I could do was be abashed. Eventually I was fired and now I'm unemployed.\n\n**TL;DR:** sucked a random guy's dick, ended with my boobs falling out of my shirt and I got fired on the spot\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372233922", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Everything has a scientific explanation. It's just that the scientists haven't figured the 'unexplained' out yet. If things like ghosts and ESP and the Loch Ness Monster can be recreated or explained using laboratory like conditions (i.e, using science, proof, evidence etc.) then science will evolve to include that now 'explained' stuff. \n\nHallucinations/ delusions/ tradition make up the a good portion of anomalous experiences. I'n my view, anyway. \n\nAdditionally, FountainsOfFluids made me think of something. Our 9(?) senses (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense) form our 'vision' or perception of reality, If you can touch something, it's there, if you can see it, it's there etc. The absence of which due to an error in our bodies causes our brains to go haywire (speaking technically) and try to string together what information it *has* to create the full picture, but does it badly, causing sensory hallucinations. I think this is a thing, I'll go research. \n\nEdit: Found something, I studied Anomalous Psychology this year, but sadly gave the textbook away, but I found [The Ganzfeld Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzfeld_effect). It's slightly different, in that the sense's were blocked in a way.\n&gt;The Ganzfeld effect is the result of the brain amplifying neural noise in order to look for the missing visual signals.\n\nIf anybody want's to try and oppose/ support this, feel free, I'm sure iIve got a ton wrong, other than my spectacular scientific terminology, which of course I know is top notch.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372259569", "subreddit": "intj", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My Grandfather and Grandmother once told me a scary yet brilliant story about my Grandfather. My Grandfather had been huge into sports and supposedly wanted to be a professional baseball player. He apparently knew plenty of the old greats and went to training camps with many of the huge players we know to date. Well unfortunately for him he never got to play in the Major Leagues, instead he got a call from his family one day and his Brother had been Killed in Action.\n\nSo after grieving and a month of thought he immediately decided he wanted to go into the armed forces to save his brothers name. He joined the Navy and was pretty instantly shipped off to the Korean War. He was their for a few months before he got shot 6 times being a med-vac and dropping from a helicopter to pick up a wounded friend.\n\nHe was brought back over to the U.S.A, via his cruiser ship. The attended to him on board since it wasn't anything life threatening (apparently). Either way the Nurse that was attending to him was a sweet beautiful lady. (Not my grandmother.) Yet still relevant to the crazy part of the story about who she is.\n\nWell she visits my grandfather every day, and then once he gets better they start to see each other day to day until he gets back to the states. She left him with her address so they started to write. Years down the road she is back and wants to visit him and catch up. My Grandfather flys all the way out to Colorado from Virginia to meet up with her and catch up for a week.\n\nThey meet up at my grandfathers hotel, and she gives him a big hug. They step outside and she has a limo waiting on them. They hop in and chat all the way to the restaurant that she suggests they go to. It's like an italian place or something like that he told me. Something really high class and expensive. \n\nThey start chatting and eat and get through the entire meal, before he realizes he has seen her somewhere else outside of the Naval ship. The check comes and she insists she will pay for it. And he starts to realize how wealthy she actually is but is questioning himself as to why she was on that ship.\n\nHe insists that she doesn't but of course the directions turn again since he is visiting her and he just flew all this way to see her. He pleads to at least leave a tip, and she laughs at him and obliges he can do that if it would make him feel better. He jokingly decides to ask how much would be appropriate for a place like this? Well she bats her eyes at him and says about tree fitty would be fine. And at this time it fucking hits him. This woman is about 16 stories tall and 50 feet long and it's that god damn loch ness monster and it's wealth has came from the prying of tree fiftys around the world. And that's why she was on the ship. The scariest thing was ol' nessie never once asked my grandfather for the tree fitty. He may have been the only one who ever got through to her, or it just may be he didn't stick around long enough.

{"body": "Happened a few years ago. This rather rotund woman surrounded by a group of friends walk in. From the moment I saw her I knew that it would not be a nice quiet night like I was hoping. She waddles her way up to the bar and orders a round of \"birthday blowjobs\" for her and her friends who then proceed to start cackling like witches at the full moon. \n\nWell the wonder off to find a booth and I have a waitress take their shots to them. All night they just sit there ordering the most rediculouse sounding drinks and proceed to get louder and louder.\n\nIt finally gets to the point that she can bearly stumble to the bathroom so I send a waitress in to check and see if she is alright. 30 seconds later she comes hustling out of the womens room and exlaims that the fatty has shit all over the floor of the bathroom and was trying to clean herself off in one of the toilets. /facepalm\n\nI send the waitress back in with another to help the poor woman out, only to hear the horrible banshi shriek about 10 seconds after they disappear through the door. The fat lady comes barreling out screaming and wailing and covered in shit. I call the bouncer in from checking Ids and we try and catch this lady. She was running around the bar yelling and screaming like a mad woman while her friends just sat there and continued to cackle maddly and shout encouragement to her.\n\nWe could have easily tackled her except for the fact that she was covered in shit. She then climbed up on the pool table and started to hop from table to table like a graceful shit covered fatass ballerina. Finally enough was enough I told one of the waitresses to throw us some towels and the bouncer that we were going to have to get dirty.\n\nWe put the towels in our hands, kinda like we were holding nets, and proceeded to corner her towards the back of the bar. As soon as she stumbled into the wall and turned to see what she hit we threw the towels on here and tackled her. She immediatly started to kick and scream. Her friends found this to be particularly amusing and graced us with high pitched, ear splitting wails of laughter.\n\nWell we finally got Fatty McFat Fuck calmed down and told her that she had to leave immediatly. She just sat there and mumbled to herself so I went over to her friends and told them they need to take her home. They flat out refused and said that they were not done parting tonight. I walk back to Fatty McShitface and tell her that we were calling her a cab and to ask if she know where she lived. She just mumbled at me something about needing something. So against my better judgement I lean in close to the shit covered beast and asked her to repeat herself.\"I just need me mumble^mumble^mumble...\" So I ask her to speak a little louder and that I couldn't quite understand her. Her eyes shot open and she bellowed \"*I need tree fidy*!\"\n\nI immediatly ripped off the mask and there was the Loch Ness Monster. I yelled \"Get out of here I ain't giving you no god damn tree fiddy!\"\n\nTL;DR Fat chick comes in, gets plastered, and shits herself in the bathroom. An epic chase ensues and we wrangle the shit covered whale.\n\nEdit: removed caps lock.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372273930", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -21, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well since this thread is dead I'll go ahead and give you my story, although I doubt it's as juicy as you'll all hope it would be.\n\nSo I've been on the force for about 11 years in a small town. I won't give the town's name away because it's honestly small enough that you could find out all the people involved in the case, etc. And we all don't want another Boston Bomber thing going on. Even though everyone here is a crime expert.\n\nSo about 3 years ago there was a murder in our town. For anyone who has lived in a small town this is usually very rare, and is often the biggest thing to ever happen so news and speculation spreads like wildfire.\n\nWell this wasn't a, \"drunk hillbilly kills his wife because he was drunk\" it was actually a first degree murder. This man was pretty much hated throughout the entire community. He was known to commit petty theft and just was a nuisance to most everyone, and on top of that he was an asshole. When he died a lot of people weren't really sad about it, so there wasn't a lot of effort put into solving the case. They figured he pissed someone off, they killed him, and it would be cut and dry.\n\nAfter about two days after his death while we were still investigating suspects another report came in about a murder, a nice old woman who ran a flower shop on the main street. She was killed the same exact way about 1/4th a mile form the previous murder. One murder in a few years is strange, but two in two days was just insane, and now I had to throw out all my previous ideas because this woman didn't have problems with anyone.\n\nSo with all this wide open I was trying to find some sort of reason to these and so was pretty much everyone in the town and department, and then's when I got the call. This was probably the most haunting call I have ever and will ever get in my life, and the fact that I heard his voice but still can't find him will haunt me forever. It went like this:\n\nMe: \"Hello, this is officer Its_be_a_spork.\"\n\nHim: \"Ahhh yes the authorities, well I have some news for you....\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, what is it?\"\n\nHim: \"It's about those... ehmm.. murders... I suppose.\"\n\nMe: \"What do you know about them?\"\n\nHim: *giggling* \"I have some stuff you want to know?\"\n\nMe: \"What, what is it?\"\n\nHim: \"Welll, you'll have to meet some demands of mine if you want to knowwww hehe.\"\n\nMe: \"Well we'll need to know what you know but we can't really help with demands..\"\n\nHim: \"Not even a small one?\"\n\nMe: \"Well what is it?\"\n\nHim: \"I'll just need... uhm... about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that point I looked out the window and noticed a three story creature for the paleotheric era standing at the payphone, and I said \"Get outta here you damn loch ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy.\"\n\nSo yeah that haunts me to this day and every once and a while I'll still look at files just torturing myself.\n\n**tl;dr I talked to the murderer on the phone and he mocked me**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372312383", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not a doctor, but I am the one who asked if there was a doctor on the plane.\n\nI was on an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Salt Lake City. One of those mid sized ones where everyone is cramped, and there are maybe 4 rows of first class seats up front. I was *not* sitting in first class. I can't afford it. I was however sitting on one of the exit seats. I try to grab these because I am 6'5\" and they provide a little extra leg room.\n\nAnyway, I brought my iPad along, and was watching the latest season of Dexter to pass the time on the flight. I had my tray table down, and the iPad was sitting vertically facing me. I have one of those smart covers so I can stand it up for hands free viewing. We are about 30-45 minutes into the flight, and the flight attendants are passing out the beverages and snacks from their cart.\n\nApparently they start their way from the front and work backwards. They are pushing the cart up to the front of the plane, and being the large individual that I am, my arm is hanging out over the arm rest. I guess the attendant wasn't paying attention because she just drags that cart right on by and smacks it right into my elbow. We are talking a full speed right in the funny bone type of hit. I immediately jump, and accidentally hit the tray table with my knees which sends my iPad tumbling to the floor between me and the passenger next to me.\n\nIn my confusion from the elbow hit, my jumpiness, and seeing my iPad tumble, I go for a reactionary grab to catch the iPad. This is when I ram my head right into the corner of the laptop of the person sitting next to me. If I recall correctly I believe it was one of the original aluminum unibody macbooks. So way too sturdy to be ramming your head into it. \n\nI must have been moving quickly, and hit just the right spot, because the contact with the corner caught just above my eye, on my brown, and cut a nice deep gash in my eyebrow.\n\nSo now my arm is tingling, my knee is annoyed, my iPad is on the ground, I am missing whatever is going on in Dexter, and my eyebrow is bleeding quite well. \n\nI have had my fair share of scrapes from soccer and basketball. I have had similar cuts, and seen cuts like this every now and then when players bump heads. I also know cuts like this bleed a lot, but aren't really life threatening so I see the blood, but I am not freaking out. I just grab a handkerchief from my back pocket and try to staunch the flow of blood. \n\nI am really embarrassed. I apologize profusely to the passenger, who now has some drops of blood on their laptop. I let them know I will clean it up for them once I check out the cut. I try to get up and go to the bathroom so I can check out the damage.\n\nThe attendant is trying to get me to sit down so they can check out my eye. I tell her I am fine, and would like to go check it out in the bathroom mirror. After some back and forth, she relents, but notes that she will need to break out the first aid kit to bandage me up once I get back from inspecting the wound.\n\nI head back to the bathroom.\n\nI take one quick look at it in the mirror, and I am fairly sure it will need stitches. It is a fairly deep cut, but nothing too crazy, I don't see exposed skull or anything. I am concerned it might leave a nasty scar in my eyebrow. \n\nSo as I am leaving the bathroom I stop, look around, and say, \"I know this is kind of cliche, but is there a doctor on the plane? I may need stitches, and would like to know what to do to bandage it up correctly so I don't have a giant scar.\"\n\nA tiny blond woman sitting about three rows up from me raises her hand and says, \"My husband here is a doctor.\" \n\nSo I walk over to her and her husband. The blood flow seems to have started to clot at this point so I pull the handkerchief down, and ask the doctor, \"What do you think it will take to make sure I don't have a scar?\"\n\nThe doctor takes a quick look, thinks about it for a second, and replies, \"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was only then that I realized the doctor was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.\n\n**TL:DR - Cut my eyebrow, and got some archaic advice on how to fix it.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372341702", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

My dad was standing next to me, keeping an eye out for jellyfish when I let out a piercing scream. He says the beach was fairly crowded that day, and all eyes were on me. He assumed I got stung by a jelly, and he lifted me by my arm to take me out of the water. As my legs cleared the water, everyone saw a 1ft+ long horseshoe crab hanging off my calf.\n\nI kicked and screamed, thankfully my dad reacted quickly. He got me out of the water, the demon spawned crab off me, and he said he would get me a treat too. So we get up to the pier, I'm just bawling my eyes out, and dad asked what I wanted. I told him \"ice cream\" as any self respecting child would, and he consented. We order our ice cream and dad was a little short on money, he asked if I could get some from my mother and I said \"okay, how much?\"\n\nMy father looked at me and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about this time I noticed that my dad was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era! I said \"No Loch Ness Daddy you ain't gettin no god damned tree fiddy!\" and I ran away. I didn't see him for some years since then.\n\nThose Horseshoe Crabs are pretty passive, so I must've rolled it over with my foot or something, but it was apparently latched on pretty well, and I was screaming my head off.

Luckily, the aforementioned homeowner had a phone.. And called the police. \n\nThe police officer showed up and cuffed me, asked me questions like what I was doing, who I was with, how much I'd had to drink. I answered as good as I could. They made me do a breathalyzer and didn't tell me what I blew. The cop told me she could take me to detox, but since I was respectful she didn't want to do that. \n\nShe banged on the windows of the house with me trying to wake someone. Then she let me use her cell to call the only numbers I knew - another friend in town- no answer. After that she asked where I lived so she could drive me home. I told her. She said, \"I'm not driving all the way over there.\" We sat down on the deck. She said, \"Do you have any money?\" I replied that I did. (I swear this is not a loch ness monster story) She ended up driving me to a 24 hour diner to get breakfast, told me to sober up and have some chocolate milk. Then I got some other diners to give me a ride back to my car and I passed out in the back seat until morning. \n\nIt was so much better than jail.

{"body": "&gt;I am not talking about a God of evidences, I speak of the one true God.\n\nI'm not talking about a god of evidences either, I'm talking about evidence of how we know God is real. I haven't heard any good reasons for thinking why God was real, hence I do not believe in him.\n\nIf the reasons for why you believe in God are shown to be wrong, are you willing to be an atheist.\n\n&gt;I invite you to show me that you can knowingly say that God does not exist.\n\nYou can't prove a negative. I can't say God doesn't exist any more than you can say the Loch Ness monster doesn't exist. \n\n&gt;Prove me wrong.\n\nReally? You make a bold assertion, expect people to go along with it, and play along the rules you've tilted in your favour from the get go? I'm sorry, first off I don't need to prove you wrong if you can't prove you're right, and second, I'll say your underlying presuppositions are wrong. I'm doing the same kind of assertion as you are, and it leaves us nowhere.\n\n&gt;I don't see how you can transfer one subjective thought from your brain into mine.\n\nI can't. What I am doing is changing my subjective thought, organizing it into ideas which I then communicate through words of a language we both share and understand. You hear the words, and your brain translates those words into ideas, and from those ideas you understand the subjective thoughts I had in my head. They are not the one same subjective idea going from the inside of my head to the inside of yours. If that were possible and true, there would be a heck of a lot less problems with communication.\n\n&gt;It's like having two bottles of bio matter and shaking them up, one comes out theist and the other atheist, nobody is really right.\n\nNope. If you say the same thing about one person thinking that gravity isn't real and the other thinking that gravity is real, you can easily determine who is right, by making experiments about the universe and checking with reality. Per religions, they do exactly as you just did, they change it from \"I say this, and I can prove it\" to \"I say this, prove me wrong\". They substitute their holy book for reality, and skewer the view of the universe. \n\n&gt;Let's try the law of excluded middle, how can propositional content be true or false? It just is what it is, if the law is just a reflection of reality then it has no bases in reality, it just is. There is nothing about it that ought to be right.\n\nHave you ever seen a ball that is both blue and not blue at the same time? Voilà, law of excluded middle explained from observable reality.\n\n&gt;Actually I find atheist very useful for getting rid of false gods, getting rid of them is peaceful. \n\nFunny, you find all gods but one false, and it just so happens to be yours, and you just so happen to be born into the right religion. Just like all the other people who claim their false gods are the real one, and that yours is a fake.\n\n&gt;Again, I don't think you can make normative claims.\n\nAbsolutely I can. If I consider a subjective value to be important to me, like health and avoiding pain, then I can make normative claims relative to that. It's the exact same thing you do, except the values you use come from the bible. How are they different?\n\n&gt;Really? Go find me Santa, I wanna rub his belly. :)\n\nAsk any kid about that, you'll see, they can find Santa anywhere, because they believe in him. If an adult were to truly believe in Santa as well, I'm sure he could make up some bogus excuse as to why you can't rub Santa's belly (can only see him once a year, he's really busy, the reason why you don't see him in person is because he's magic, etc etc etc) in the same way theists make up all kinds of excuse as per why we don't find evidence of a God, your video from InspiringPhilosophy being my case in point.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372365717", "subreddit": "ReasonableFaith", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is a story I always share with people I meet fishing along this river.\n\nI was out fishing in the river near my friend's place. I have fished there nearly every time I go to his place, just to kill time while he is at work, and normally pull up a nice whiting or flathead... Anyway, most times there are about 15 to 20 other people fishing along the same part, maybe 50 - 100 ft apart, and every so often it may be a bit less.\n\nFor some reason, there was absolutely no one fishing here today. It was a Saturday, beautiful sunny day in Summer and the tide was high. The beach near by was completely packed with people (I was there earlier), but not a single soul was along that river as usual.\n\nNow it had been about 3 or 4 months since I had seen my friend, so I thought perhaps there were new laws in place to say no fishing, but there were no signs as far as I could see.\n\nSo I fished there anyway, getting the occasional bite from using sea worms as bait. After about an hour or two of little bites, I started to get sick of it and was about to pack up when I noticed a small girl was now fishing a little further down. She looked about 4 or 5 years old and no parents seemed to be around, which is odd because this part of the river was a good mile or so from the nearest estate.\n\nI decided to reel in my line and go over to ask her if she was okay. She had her rod cast, a bucket of bait (also using sea worm) and had her tackle box beside her with an empty bucket.\n\nNow I am a little older, so in the world we live in now, it's hard to say anything to a younger child without being told off or labeled as a creep. So I simply asked the first normal question anyone would in this situation:\n\n\"Hi there, are you okay? Where are your parents?\"\n\nThere was no reply from her, she just looked on and kept fishing.\n\n\"My name is *blank*, I just wanted to make sure you are okay, this is a bad place to be on your own,\" I said to her. \"Have you caught anything yet?\"\n\nStill no reply. So I start to walk away and take my gear over to my car when I hear her call out to me.\n\n\"Excuse me!\" She yells.\n\nI turn around and she now had her line reeled in and was staring at me. She had short blonde hair, was wearing a pink dress with a fairy on it.\n\n\"Yes?\" I ask, confused at what she might say.\n\nShe then starts to walk over to me, in a dead straight line after putting her rod down, and now I was starting to freak out. Her face was completely expressionless and it looked like she was going to come over and hit me...\n\nI stood still in my tracks and she finally stops right in front of me.\n\nI look at her and say \"What is it you need?\"\n\nShe replies, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it was about that time that I realised this little girl was in fact 8 stories tall and a gigantic crustacean from the palaeolithic era!

{"body": "This is a story I always share with people I meet fishing along this river.\n\nI was out fishing in the river near my friend's place. I have fished there nearly every time I go to his place, just to kill time while he is at work, and normally pull up a nice whiting or flathead... Anyway, most times there are about 15 to 20 other people fishing along the same part, maybe 50 - 100 ft apart, and every so often it may be a bit less.\n\nFor some reason, there was absolutely no one fishing here today. It was a Saturday, beautiful sunny day in Summer and the tide was high. The beach near by was completely packed with people (I was there earlier), but not a single soul was along that river as usual.\n\nNow it had been about 3 or 4 months since I had seen my friend, so I thought perhaps there were new laws in place to say no fishing, but there were no signs as far as I could see.\n\nSo I fished there anyway, getting the occasional bite from using sea worms as bait. After about an hour or two of little bites, I started to get sick of it and was about to pack up when I noticed a small girl was now fishing a little further down. She looked about 4 or 5 years old and no parents seemed to be around, which is odd because this part of the river was a good mile or so from the nearest estate.\n\nI decided to reel in my line and go over to ask her if she was okay. She had her rod cast, a bucket of bait (also using sea worm) and had her tackle box beside her with an empty bucket.\n\nNow I am a little older, so in the world we live in now, it's hard to say anything to a younger child without being told off or labeled as a creep. So I simply asked the first normal question anyone would in this situation:\n\n\"Hi there, are you okay? Where are your parents?\"\n\nThere was no reply from her, she just looked on and kept fishing.\n\n\"My name is blank, I just wanted to make sure you are okay, this is a bad place to be on your own,\" I said to her. \"Have you caught anything yet?\"\n\nStill no reply. So I start to walk away and take my gear over to my car when I hear her call out to me.\n\n\"Excuse me!\" She yells.\n\nI turn around and she now had her line reeled in and was staring at me. She had short blonde hair, was wearing a pink dress with a fairy on it.\n\n\"Yes?\" I ask, confused at what she might say.\n\nShe then starts to walk over to me, in a dead straight line after putting her rod down, and now I was starting to freak out. Her face was completely expressionless and it looked like she was going to come over and hit me...\n\nI stood still in my tracks and she finally stops right in front of me.\n\nI look at her and say \"What is it you need?\"\n\nShe replies, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it was about that time that I realised this little girl was in fact 8 stories tall and a gigantic crustacean from the palaeolithic era! God dammit Lochness Monster! You don't need no darn tree fiddy!\n\ntl;dr Running out of money from fishing at this same river.\n\nExtra TL;DR People still can't catch this fish\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372395304", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 557, "controversiality": 0}

Anyway one day this woman walked in with an air of complete superiority. I had spoken with her on the phone where she came across as quite shy but in person she was a completely different person. She stormed into my office after treating one of our waiters like dirt, and without even so much as shaking my hand she slapped her cv on my desk and began to spew out reasons why she deserved the job (waitress). After being courteous and listening through all of her reasons, I decided not to demand she leave straight away, but conduct the interview as I normally would, disregarding all of her previous comments. After all of my questioning (which she handled quite poorly), I asked her how she thought she had handled the interview. She thought she did excellently and should absolutely get the job. I then proceeded to tell her exactly what was on my mind, how rude she had been, how she wasn't as great as she thought she was, how her past work experiences weren't at all relevant to this line of work and so on and after all of this she asked what her chances of employment were. I simply looked at her an said \"nil\". But before she left, she had one more thing to say to me, she looked at me with pure intent her eyes and said \"I need about treefiddy\" it was around this time that I realized that my candidate was a 500 feet tall creature from the paleolithic era. I said \"God dammit loch ness monster, I ain't gonna give you no treefiddy\". Anyway after this whole ordeal I learned that although it may be easy to read somebody's character it's not actually until you learn more about the person.

I immediately looked around, not quite sure where this noise came from. All of a sudden I see an all black escalade pull out of the side of the Tim Hortons it had just drove into. Without any thought I flicked on the lights, drove the gear into D, and floored it. I was certain this night was going to be a quiet Tuesday, but boy was I wrong. The black escalade had big 20\" rims, all the windows were tinted, and the license plate read \"Onetym\". I called it into my dispatch and this vehicle was from a few provinces east of us. I knew right away it had to be a stolen vehicle. The car pulls over out on the street after it had started to drive away. I pulled up behind the car not knowing what to expect, so I unbuckled my pistol holster just to be safe. I walked up to the window, which was right above chest level. The guy rolls down the window and, without hesitation, proceeds to say, \"What's the problem officer?\" I'm thinking that this guy must be nuts. I proceeded to tell him that he just ran through the Tim Hortons! I told him, \"Do you know how much damage you just caused to that building?!\" To which he replies, \"About tree fiddy.\" \n\nWith that, I turned around and walked back to my car, got in and started to drive away.

{"body": "I'm not so good at jokes, but let me tell you a story about how the finals of one of the locals I attended.\n\nI was nervous to enter the shady comic store, but this place had been known to have the most yugioh players in the area. Hesitantly, I double checked my pockets for my deck box and my bag for my binder as I entered through the revolving doors. The place had a familiar smell of freshly opened packs and the BO that comes with playing children's card games.\n\nNot seeing a single familiar face, I approached the counter and flagged down what seemed to be the manager. His goatee almost hid his crooked smile, but while his glasses hid the rest of his face away. \"Yes I'm here for the tournament\" I told him. In response, he asked if I had a COSSY ID or something like that. Leaving my wallet at home, I reached for my phone, where I had taken a picture of my ID because I knew something like this would happen.\n\nAfter signing up for the damned thing, I had a feeling that everything was going to go alright. I had my Gem-Knights in my pocket, with Hidden Arsenal 7 putting the finishing touches by adding Lazuli, who gave my deck its needed speed and consistency. \n\n\"THE PAIRINGS FOR THE YUGIOH TOURNAMENT ARE POSTED!\" the manager from before had shouted. It was time. I was ready. I took my seat at Table 19. The cheap plastic tables were stained black from what seemed a sauce of some sort. Sheepishly, I slapped my new Marvel Vs Capcom mat on it anyway, hoping the mat would protect my cards. I looked up at my opponent, he was a hulkish fellow, wearing a wife-beater tank top and an camo vest. After winning the dice roll, I allowed him to go first, just to see what he was running. Of course, he'd be running a HERO deck. Actually, the more I looked, the more he looked like Elemental Hero Wildheart. Anyway, he summons Stratos and then fuses it with a Bubbleman to get an Absolute Zero on the field then passes. On my turn, I drew a dark hole and a heavy storm, along with a lot of Gem-Knights! I was able to FTK him with it. The second game went more smoothly with another FTK.\n\nThe tournament went on without a hinge. My Gem-Knights were almost unstoppable now that I added my boss monster Gem-Knight Master Diamonds. You know what they say: From coals to diamonds. (Outrageous right?). \n\nIt was the final match. At the top table, I noticed my opponent was already seated. He had a blue and white low cut V-Neck with a sash holding it up. His hair was a dark navy color, that was spiky, but led into a pony tail that deviated at the end. I took my seat and asked him what he was running. Turns out I was up against an Atlantean Mermail deck, who were in their prime at the time. Figures. Game 1, I lost pretty much when Abyssgaios was summoned. With him on the field, all of my Gem-Knight Fusion cards couldn't attack. I didn't have any outs in my deck and I scooped.\n\nGame 2 I got desperate. Apparantly, it was in his culture to take off his shirt after a victory in the finals. Okay, whatever. He set his harpoon aside and ripped off his shirt... while I sided in 2 Bottomless, 2 Mirror Force, 2 Torrential Tribute, and 2 Evac. In exchange, I took out a bunch of random cards, but I took also took out the Lazulis that I treasured so much in the deck. They wouldn't be able to do much, so I bid them adieu and started. I drew into 3 of those traps in the first turn, and pretty much made the opponent overextend for an easy victory.\n\nGame 3 is where things got weird. Before we even sided, he beckoned me to come near. His breath smelled similarly to fish. Sea Bass or Monkfish... something similar. He told me he'd be willing to make a deal with me. At first, I thought he was going to bribe me to win, but he surprised me when he said that I could bribe him if I wanted to win.\n\nThe first place prize was a box of Abyss Rising, which I really wanted... So I was extremely interested. Eagerly, I asked him what he wanted in exchange for victory. He replied, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this duelist was not Mako Tsunami, but was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\n\n\"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam away into the distance.\n\nAnd that's the story about how my Gem-Knights ruled the world after become rust proof.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372481341", "subreddit": "yugioh", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

This suggests that if your diet is super shitty and you switch to paleo and start eating less (what usually happens in restriction diets) then you lose weight and get healthier; but it's not inherently healthier than a well balanced diet which can include grains and other stuff.\n\nBecause in the paleolithic era we mostly ate *insects and carrion* as our protein sources, not so big on the bacon + eggs + coconut oil.

If it's up to you, and you think you can handle it better than your parents then do these things:\n\nFind a time when you can chat for plenty of time without having to cut the discussion off.\n\nFind a safe space to talk to him.\n\nBegin by letting him know that you need to talk to him about something, but that it's because you care about him and not that he is in trouble.\n\nThen tell him that it's normal for guys his age to be curious about sex and it's nothing to be ashamed of. Tell him you know he has been looking up porn and you want to sort this out without making a big deal out of it and having to tell your parents, as long as he is okay talking about it. \n\n*Let him decide how he wants to deal with it*\n\nIf he decides to talk to your parents, respect that. Ask him if he wants to talk to your mom/dad about it directly or if he wants you to tell them about it first. Let him know that it needs to be talked about very soon. If he wants to deal with it, that's fine, though you should probably give your parents the heads up so long as you can trust them to let him bring it up by himself - if you can't trust them on it, then don't.\n\nIf he wants you to bring it up, call a meeting and let the parents know that he wants to talk about something. If they are going to flip out or yell, then just stay. If they are going to be okay, then ask him if he wants you to leave or stay. Then let them work it out.\n\nIf you are going to talk one-on-one, tell him that it's normal to be curious about bodies and about sex but there is some stuff in porn that can send bad messages - messages about how to treat women, what is normal, about what your body should look like, and about things that are okay to say. \n\nIt's the same reason he isn't allow to listen to x or watch y until he is older.\n\nTell him (if you are up to it) that you are willing to get him some age appropriate sex-ed stuff that should answer questions and explain things. If you aren't, you will need to handball it to the parents or if you would get in trouble for it with your parents you will need to defer to them. If it's going to be easier to tell your parents that they dropped the ball pretty badly and you picked up the slack, and they will believe you then do that - it will probably take the heat off of your brother.\n\nHopefully there is a local sexual health organization near you, or a national one you can call. Get in contact, let them know the situation and ask a counsellor or professional on what is the best way to deal with this. They are going to recommend bringing your parents into this because they have to, but whether you do or not is up to you (acting in your brothers best interests) and also your brother himself.\n\nLet him know that you are going to put a filter on his computer because you don't want him getting into trouble online, especially not with the law or with creeps online. If the parents are dealing with it, make sure they put a filter on his computer.\n\nAlso, it's about time that your brother becomes a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era and begins requesting tree-fiddy from people wherever possible. He will require appropriate disguises and excuses to do this, and it will be up to you to help him out as best you can. \n\nGood luck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372589261", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Some people will say this doesn't work, just because they don't want you to know or try it and then fuck yourself up with too much. But from personal experience with this exact combination I've had some totally out of body trips on peels'n'paste. My recipe and results follow. \nFirst buy 2 tangerines and one orange. Different citrus yields different synthetic psychedelics so try them all (EXCEPT GRAPEFRUIT THAT WILL FUCKING KILL YOU!!). Got your citrus? Good. \nNow get one pump of Mentadent toothpaste, and pump out all of the blue. We don't want that, it has peroxide and will destroy the salt tartare in the peels! So get your white left over Mentadent and weigh out 1.75 oz of it for each orange. Now get a tube of Colgate white, and weigh out .6 grams of it. Mix the two toothpastes together for at least 30 minutes. The fluoride in the Colgate needs to break down the soluble terpinides in the Mentadent, thus allowing the precipitation of the synthetic psychedelics out of the peel. Spread the paste onto the orange and massage it in for 3-5 minutes at least. Leave the orange for 4-5 days in the sun (window sill works best but keep it out of sight). \nNow everyone is different but following the recipe above I was able to trip from 8am in the morning to 3am the next day. The effects I got were light headed was, a lot like good weed, then followed by a numbness starting at my toes. About 30 minutes later I kicks, and I'm flying through my ceiling out, up up up up and up into space and then BOOM I'm shot out of the galaxy and into the space between stars. I met a beautiful woman made of stars, who told me that she had been waiting for me to show up. I caressed her star covered face and she kissed my neck. Colors and shapes explode all around me and I swim in the star goddess' hair, gazing at her perfect nude form floating in space. \nShe then leaned forward, whispering in my ear to take her now. I begin to grasp her breasts and I feel it all over my body. The joy you feel grabbing huge breasts was amplified to a degree that is unimaginable without the experience. As I trail my finger down to the star goddess' twinkling pubic hair she whispers again.\n\"Wait!\"\nI stop suddenly as the sound of her voice fills my head like a bell. \n\"I need something! Just one thing and then we can become one.\" \nI move my hand down further, muttering \"an...anything, please.\"\nShe leaned in again and whispered very quietly.  \"I need...I need bout tree fiddy.\" It was at this point that I realized the star goddess was a three story high crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Goddamn you, Loch Ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam out into the empty void of space.
