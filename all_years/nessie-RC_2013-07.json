We find that we have a handful of shared interests, and our senses of humor really seem to mesh well.  \n\nI pay the bill after you graciously offer and I politely decline, informing you that your company has been fantastic and that it's my pleasure to buy you dinner.  \n\nWe decide to extend our date for a little and walk around the city for a bit, because we're obviously both really digging each other at this point.  We walk around and I make it a point to covertly walk as close to you as I can to feel out how comfortable you are with space.

{"body": "**Chuck Klosterman's 23 Questions To Determine If You Can Truly Love Someone (Part 1):**\n\n*Because of some strange auto format process, I am unable to number these properly*\n\n1. Let us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn any more; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence.\n\n**Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?**\n\n2. Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots.\n\n**Would you attempt to do this?**\n\n3. Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical.\n\n**Which option do you select?**\n\n4. Genetic engineers at Johns Hopkins University announce that they have developed a so-called \"super gorilla.\" Though the animal cannot speak, it has a sign language lexicon of over twelve thousand words, an I.Q. of almost 85, and--most notably--a vague sense of self-awareness. Oddly, the creature (who weighs seven hundred pounds) becomes fascinated by football. The gorilla aspires to play the game at its highest level and quickly develops the rudimentary skills of a defensive end. ESPN analyst Tom Jackson speculates that this gorilla would be \"borderline unblockable\" and would likely average six sacks a game (although Jackson concedes the beast might be susceptible to counters and misdirection plays). Meanwhile, the gorilla has made it clear he would never intentionally injure any opponent.\n\n**You are commissioner of the NFL: Would you allow this gorilla to sign with the Oakland Raiders?**\n\n5. You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Creedence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it's being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it's being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a capella (but it will only sound this way to you).\n\n**Would you swallow the pill?**\n\n6. At long last, someone invents \"the dream VCR.\" This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR.\n\n**Would you still do this?**\n\n7. Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week.\n\n**You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?**\n\n8. You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson's gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film's \"deeper philosophy.\"\n\n**Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?**\n\n9. A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commerical success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man).\n\n**Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likliehood of you reading this book?**\n\n10. This is the opening line of Jay McInerney's Bright Lights, Big City: \"You are not the kind of guy who would be in a place like this at this time of the morning.\" Think about that line in the context of the novel (assuming you've read it). Now go to your CD collection and find Heart's Little Queen album (assuming you own it). Listen to the opening riff to \"Barracuda.\"\n\n**Which of these two introductions is a higher form of art?**\n\n11. You are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that--somewhere--your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill.\n\n**Would you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie?**\n\n12. You meet a wizard in downtown Chicago. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, \"I will now make them a dollar more attractive.\" He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But--somehow--this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can't deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though--you can only pay him once. You can't keep giving him money until you're satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front.\n\n**How much cash do you give the wizard?**\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372769484", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 223, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This was back a ways, sometime around '88, '89 maybe. I had a bit of a reputation as someone who knew his way around a tool bench; hell, I could take you on a guided tour of a tool bench blindfolded and half-cocked, I reckon. Not a bad skill to have, in my opinion, though it did have its downsides. You get some folks who get to thinkin just because you're on mostly amicable terms with 'em, that you'll come runnin at the drop of a hat any time their faucet is leaking or their AC is on the fritz.Same folks that'd just as sure as shine on chrome at high noon find one excuse or the other not to be around the second YOU have something that needs tending to. But, the upsides to bein handy with a wrench or whatnot generally outweighed the downsides. \n\nGenerally. \n\nNow, if you noticed I was referring to this job in the past tense, well, that's because it's just that. Past. I don't do that kind of work no more. I don't do it, not because I got a full time job, or won the lottery and live in a swanky mansion, no, none of those things. I don't do it because of her. \n\nHer and the damned frog. \n\nLookit that. Train left the station before it even got there. Let me get back on track. \n\nIt was 1989, now that I think about it, because that earthquake in S.F. had just hit not a week earlier. I remember seeing it plastered all over the headlines, in big bold letters, the kind the newspapers only use if something is incredibly wonderful or incredibly bad. I was driving to a little, backwater town down in Louisiana, don't quite recall the name, just that it was in Claiborne parish. Friend of mine ( a friend friend, not one of the leeches I brought up earlier) had an aunt, you see, lived way out in the middle of Podunk, nowhere. She was his only family, and him bein way out west and whatnot, well, he just couldn't always be there to help her out. I had mentioned to him a ways back that I would be taking a little road trip through that part of the country and wouldn't mind one bit checking up on her, him bein my friend an all. Lord above, wish I'da kept my big trap shut, let me tell you.\n\nAnyways, I show up at this lady's house, see. And I use the word house like you'd use the word lady to describe a whore. Tweren't much more than a bunch of boards and logs all strung up together with some old nails and paint and such. Knocking on the door I damn near thought I'd put my fist through. So imagine my surprise at the sweet, kindly old woman who answered the door. \n\nAfter some chit chat (more for her own peace of mind, makin sure I weren't there to do her no harm) she obliged that I could come in and take a look at her water heater, if it don't put me out too much. So I step through the front door. \n\nAnd there were jars. Jars, and jars, and jars some more, with some kinda yellowy amber fluid inside, and these strange looking vegetables floating around. That's what I thought at first. \n \nThen I spot it. The baby. In the biggest jar in the house, is a baby, surrounded by pictures and old dried flowers an such. \n I yell a little, and in my startled movement, knock one of those little jars onto the floor, where it just shatters all to hell, and that smelly, yellow stuff splashes all over my shoes. \n\nAnd a little frog, no bigger than a lime.\n \n Well, good god almighty, youd've think I knocked HER over, with the damn ruckus she put up. She starts screaming how could I come in and break her things, they're all her babies and I knocked one onto the floor, and is turnin redder and redder by the minute. I look around at those jars that I thought were pickled vegetables, and every one of the has some kinda critter in it, suspended in formaldehyde, just all hangin there. \n\n Me, I'm done. I do everything in my power to calm her down and defuse the situation, tell her I'll do the dishes, fix her floor, even offer her money. \n\nThe money did it. \n\nShe shuts up. Tells me she'll take cash only. Figure that! I come over to do some work and now I'm paying her! \n\n\"How much?\" I ask. \n\nShe replies \"I need about tree fiddy.\" \n\n\nWell at this point, I realize that ain't no old lady, it's a goddamn three story monster from the Paleolithic era! And I hightail it outta there, yelling at the damned Loch Ness monster that she ain't gettin no tree fiddy.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372811733", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, I immediately pulled out of her friend, and the friend and I proceeded to pounce on my girlfriend.  While I did my thing between her thighs, my girlfriend and her friend proceeded to sloppily make out while fondling each other's breasts.  The friend had large D-cups, so after a few minutes of tongue-wrestling, my girlfriend moved down and began exploring her friend's breasts with her mouth.\n\nI soon realized I was on the verge of orgasm, so I signalled that I was ready and the friend spun around and, in one slick movement, pulled me out of my girlfriend, removed the condom, and took me in her mouth.  While the friend deep-throated me, my girlfriend took it upon herself to begin sampling her friend's pussy.  Let me tell you - a girl moaning while deepthroating you is one of the best feelings imaginable.  I exploded in her mouth, and stepped back to catch my breath.\n\nAs I watched, my girlfriend increased her attack on her friend's pussy, and the friend decided that two could play at that game, so the two began an intense 69 that resulted in numerous deep moans from both of them that I'm sure were audible throughout the house I lived in.  After I had caught my breath, I jumped back in.  I pulled the friend's head up, kissed her deeply, and leaned down to use my tongue on my girlfriend.\n\nKnowing that my girlfriend deserved some TLC after falling off the bed, her friend once again shifted position so that, while I was going to town with my tongue, the friend was playing with my girlfriend's clit and sucking on her breasts.  The stimulation must have been unbelievable, as I had to hold my girlfriend's hips just so she wouldn't buck off the bed.  At that point, her friend began talking dirty in one of the sexiest ways I've ever heard.\n\n\"You like that?  Mmmm...do you feel that?\"\n\nIn between moans, my girlfriend would reply as best she could.\n\n\"Oh God yes, yes...more of that!  I want that!\"\n\nThe friend settled into a rapid-fire pattern of bathing one breast lovingly with her tongue, and then demanding to know how my girlfriend felt.\n\n\"Did that feel good?  You loved it, didn't you?  Do you want more?\"\n\n\"MMMM...don't stop, please...please!  I want more!!!\"\n\nThe friend picked up the pace, and as her movements grew more intense, more fierce, her dirty talk grew more feral, more animalistic.\n\n\"Tell me that you want this!  Tell me that you need it!  I know you need it!\"\n\nMy girlfriend, near delirious from pleasure, grabbed my hair and pulled me up, indicating that she wanted me inside her.  I quickly obliged, and began thrusting into her while her friend leaned down to tongue her clit.  Her friend decided to tease her some more just to send her over the edge, and as I increased the speed of my thrusts, the friend crawled up, planted a deep kiss on my girlfriend's lips, and addressed her.\n\n\"Do you want this?  Yeah, you do!  I know you fucking want it!  Tell me how much you want it!  Fucking tell me how much you need this!\"\n\nMy girlfriend, about to explode with pleasure, practically screamed out:\n\n\"AHHH MY GOD!  I want it!  I need it so bad!  I NEED IT!  I NEED IT!  I NEED...\"\n\nAs her orgasm overtook her and she bucked around on the bed, she managed to scream out one last exclamation of pleasure.\n\n\"I NEED...I need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time that I noticed my girlfriend was actually a 500 foot tall monster from the paleolithic era!  Of course, I still finished, but I made sure to tell that damn Loch Ness monster that she wasn't getting any money from me.  \n\nThen my girlfriend, her friend, and I all collapsed, exhausted, in a pile of naked flesh and shining, sweaty bodies.  I barely remember what I dreamt that night, but when I woke up in the morning, I still had two naked girls curled up with me and probably the biggest shit-eating grin on my face.  There are many things that a man should do with his life, but a threesome really is at the top of the mountain.\n\n**TL;DR - Best night of my life.  Words barely do it justice.

It's a fairly clinical term for what should be called 'Vietnam in my Head.'\n\n&gt;He told me he's going on vacation soon and the way he said it was very casual, just going to have fun with friends. It is difficult for me to integrate this vision of depression with the vision outlined in The Noonday Demon, unless his symptoms are in remission.\n\nIt's possible to find a weekend out enjoyable (or, at least, less dreadful than staying home) however, as said elsewhere in this thread, depression is very much a spectrum of disorder. Imagine a scale of 1-10. At the light end (1 or 2), you might go for years without knowing anything was wrong, but just everything you do seems blah or unfulfilling. A 3 is where you start really *feeling* it, you might suspect that something is wrong with yourself, or losing interest in hobbies you once enjoyed.\n\nFarther down (Maybe 4 or 5) it becomes impossible to ignore. Feelings of worthlessness influence your every interaction. You might recognize that you should get help, but your brain will be telling you that no one wants to listen to your bitching and moaning. You might alienate your friends and family, and start becoming withdrawn. Self-harm becomes a problem here, but suicidiality is still a few notches away. You might cut or burn yourself, but (IMO) it's more simply to prove that you still have the ability to feel, rather than trying to do yourself harm. This is where delusions and unfounded paranoia might start.\n\nAt 6-7, you start really and truly desiring death. Tall buildings, bridges, rafters, and blades all draw your eye, and you might idly fantasize about leaping to your death or slashing your wrists. You might have a plan in varying stages of thoroughness, from 'I'm gonna listen to song X right before I do the deed.' all the way to 'I am going to jump off this bridge at 5:30 AM on May 20th.' At this point, death by your own hand seems a foregone conclusion, but I don't think you'd actually go through with it, at least not sober. Having simultaneous access to alcohol and a gun is really dangerous at this point. This is the region where your hygiene really starts to suffer, unless you're one of those guys who likes to cry in the shower.\n\nAround an 8 is the 'Butter Zone' for killing ones self. You hate yourself and everything and everyone in the whole world, and you think you'd be much happier if you left it all behind. At this point, you might have several plans in varying locations, and even start planting your tools just in case you decided to do it on a spur-of-the-moment type thing (e.g. 'I'll keep a razor blade in my desk drawer so that if I decide to do it at work, I can just sneak off into the bathroom, but I'll also keep a bottle of pills in my car so I could do it in the parking lot, and there's a rope in my shed in case I decide...\") It becomes really hard to hide at this point, unless you are able to go for extended periods with almost no human interaction. You will be distracted by constantly scanning your environment for new and creative ways to kill yourself, and you'll be so thoroughly disgusted by other people that you won't want to deal with them anyways. What time your mind doesn't spend working out the problem of your demise, it will spend just hating. Hating life and all the petty bullshit we fill it with. At this point, I literally wanted to cry nearly every waking moment, starting from when my alarm went off in the morning to when I would cut myself just to get enough peace to fall asleep. I was able to drag myself out of bed and complete the barest of my duties, but only just. \n\nNow, I should say that everything I've said up to this point was based on my own experience with my last episode, a couple years ago. On this scale, I don't think I've ever gone further than an 8, and everything I say beyond that is based on my own reading, and extrapolating from my own experiences.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why I called 8 the 'Butter Zone' for suicide. I've never been lower than that, but I've read in multiple sources that it is possible to sink down so far, (9-10) that ones mind is completely wiped of motivation and replaced with just a dirge-like chaos. Catatonia and hysterical paralysis come into play here. The sufferer might not leave bed for days or weeks on end. Somewhere in there, they pray for death, but lack the mental coordination to even pick up a knife or load a gun. I've read stories of people at this point who, upon taking a new medication, found it picked them up just enough for them to motivate themselves to drive their car off a bridge.\n\nIn my experience, my 'baseline depression' is around a 2-3, and from there it took me about two and a half years to work myself up to a full 8. I am fairly certain I would have killed myself if a guy at my work hadn't told my boss he saw cuts on my arm, and my boss referring me to a doctor, who put me in hospital for awhile.\n\nDepression is a monstrous disease, in that it saps the sufferers very ability to seek help, or even to desire help. The very real social stigma attached to it certainly doesn't help. Even though I made it through my last episode, it has never left completely, and I'd say it's a rare day that I see myself as low as a 2 on this scale. I am very clearly better today than I was when I was at my worst, but I don't know if I will ever see it completely resolve. The biggest thought that gives me that old sinking feeling is the knowledge that, having had two major episodes in my life, statistically it's up to a coin toss as to whether I will have another one later in life. That's a fact that hangs over my head almost daily.\n\ntl;dr - Goddamn Loch Ness Monster took my tree-fiddy!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372872627", "subreddit": "depression", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Most atheists that I know seem to revel in it, and the only people I know to deny it do so on religious grounds.\n\nThe fact is for every single thing that *is* there are an infinite number of things that *aren't*. Dismissing dodgy claims is how we learn! You could use the same banal appeal to ignorance about any claim, well grounded or otherwise:\n\n\"What do you mean energy cannot be created or destroyed? There is just *so goddamn much* we don't know about physics to believe that.\"\n\n\"What do you mean France is in Europe? There is just *so goddamn much* we don't know about plate tectonics to believe that.\"\n\n\"What do you mean you are bored of this conversation? There is just *so goddamn much* we don't know about human psychology to believe that.\"\n\nThe god hypothesis isn't a good one, which is why atheists dismiss it. The reality seems to be that consciousness is intimately linked with the brain. You can see with a damaged brain almost always results in a damaged or limited conscious state, and the *more* damaged it is, the *less* conscious/aware the person seems to be. It seems to me to be a good hypothesis that consciousness ends completely when the brain stops completely, at least compared to the hypothesis that your consciousness returns to full capacity in another celestial plane.\n\nI think you are completely right if you are just dismissing those people who think that the gods have been disproven, but luckily for us, that is not the majority of atheists. Not even the infamous Richard Dawkins completely dismisses the idea of gods, and has stated that he would place himself on a scale of 1 (positive about the gods) - 7 (certainly no gods) at a 6.\n\nI don't only think you are misled in your idea though, I think you are being disingenuous.

Peterson.\n\nMr. Peterson is a man who considers his own needs alone. There is not a single action in his daily routine without the purpose of benefiting himself. In very many ways, he is like you or me. He ties his own shoes, brushes his own teeth, and he earns his own money at a job, but there is a selfish undertone to his personna. He does not give to charity. He does not give money to the poor. There is not a single altruistic trait that we can witness in Mr. Peterson. This is a fact about Mr. Peterson that would soon change his life, for the worse.\n\nMr. Peterson hated those who requested from him. He hated charities that would call and ask him to donate. He hated when family called asking him for favors. But most of all, he hated the homeless people of the city that would ask him for spare change as he walked to work. He could not imagine a more pathetic existance than that, and after years of seething hate for these people building up, he would one day snap.\n\nThe day was like any other. Mr. Peterson began his day and went on his way to work, just like every other day for years before. But today, wasn't just any other day. Mr. Peterson turned onto 5th street, and there were begars lining the sidewalks. He considered taking a different route to work, but no. He would not yield to these homeless peasants. He continued down the street and was asked after almost each step \"Spare some change?\", \"Help out an old vet?\", \"Have a heart mate, spare a quarter.\"\n\nMr. Peterson had enough. \"What's the matter with you people?!\" he shouted. \"Why should I have to be the one you mooch off of. You're all lazy and filthy human beings! You shouldn't be allowed to live on this planet, let alone on this street where you can bother me with your petty requests for *my* money!\"\n\nAs you can imagine, these words didn't sit too well with these people, the same way you or I would take such offense.

That's not an argument from authority fallacy, that's an argument of his *not understanding the goddamn subject matter*. \n\nI'm too lazy, so I'll just repost one small criticism, of which there are thousands:\n\n&gt;Dawkins holds that the existence or non-existence of God is a scientific hypothesis which is open to rational demonstration. Christianity teaches that to claim that there is a God must be reasonable, but that this is not at all the same thing as faith. Believing in God, whatever Dawkins might think, is not like concluding that aliens or the tooth fairy exist. God is not a celestial super-object or divine UFO, about whose existence we must remain agnostic until all the evidence is in. Theologians do not believe that he is either inside or outside the universe, as Dawkins thinks they do. His transcendence and invisibility are part of what he is, which is not the case with the Loch Ness monster. This is not to say that religious people believe in a black hole, because they also consider that God has revealed himself: not, as Dawkins thinks, in the guise of a cosmic manufacturer even smarter than Dawkins himself (the New Testament has next to nothing to say about God as Creator), but for Christians at least, in the form of a reviled and murdered political criminal. The Jews of the so-called Old Testament had faith in God, but this does not mean that after debating the matter at a number of international conferences they decided to endorse the scientific hypothesis that there existed a supreme architect of the universe – even though, as Genesis reveals, they were of this opinion. They had faith in God in the sense that I have faith in you. They may well have been mistaken in their view; but they were not mistaken because their scientific hypothesis was unsound.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373059215", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

You can tell I was pretty shocked when she pulled down my pants and starting rubbing my dick. Before this, I'd never gotten past first base. I never watched porn before so I really only knew basics. So there she was, giving me my first hand job and I felt selfish that she was doing all the work, so I tried to finger her. I had no idea what i was doing so i just did what i thought she would like, thrusting my fingers into her vagina as hard as I could. Before i knew it, she was asking me if i had a condom, I did not. She told me to just not cum in her. That proved to be the least of my worries. After and hour and half, I still was unable to penetrate or keep an erection. I just kept trying and asking \"is it in?\" Which was always received by a \"no.\" I finally got it in and then it fell out. During this time, I asked her to go down on me to help me get excited. I was expecting that to feel amazing, but it just felt wet. She ended up giving up on me. She also realized I was a virgin and felt really bad. I didn't want her to feel bad so I blamed it on whiskey dick. Then I asked her if I she needed anything before I went back inside the house and she said yeah....

When I moved out west (age 12) I lived with my rich family members who I never had spoken to and who wanted nothing to do with me. I was riff raff. I wasn't on their level, they were of an upper echelon. That's what drove me. I needed to prove to my uncle that I wasn't worthless. So I studied, and worked hard until I started my own business, which I am today currently operating. When I got my business off the ground the first thing I thought about was my mom. We were poor in Philadelphia, and I wanted to make sure she was gonna be okay. So I flew back, now that I could afford it on my own. I still go back regularly, but also to see how my (clandestine) son is doing. \n\nMy first trip home I got all nostalgic like. Saw the old sights, did the old things, etc. Ran into...some old acquaintances. Among them, a girl. She was part of the reason I left West Philly. She was part of a group that were basically just troublemakers. But I liked her as a kid (bad girl thing, you know how it is) and I was curious to see what that crowd was like; to get a glimpse of what I could have been had I stayed. It was abysmal. \n\nThese people had no future. My mom blamed me leaving on the fighting that was going on but now I saw it. These people were going nowhere. Including Gena, whom I ran into. I ain't sayin she's a gold digger but she seemed uncharacteristically interested in me once she realized I had come into money. But there she was still doing nothing, contributing nothing, being nothing. Pretty though. Dammit she....she was good. We had sex at her place. I felt awful and vowed to never tell anyone of it. I forgot the whole sordid incident and returned home with a black mark on my mind.\n\nYou can guess what happened on my next trip ~8 months later. Yep. Baby. Who's? Mine. What an awful vile piece of trash for a woman. I know she just brought him into the world to siphon money off of me, like a succubus. But what can I do? That's my baby right? I need to support him. The best thing to do would be to fly him out here to Bel Air to live with me and my GF but my pride just couldn't take it and I know she'd leave me. This is an awful situation. I want him here. But for now he'll have to stay there.\n\nIn west Philadelphia, born and raised...\n\n\nEDIT: this is a joke hence the last line. I don't think that was clear enough. Shouldda used Loch Ness monster.

It wasn't he was unattractive or anything, the luck just never came his way.  In fact, most people would have rated him at a 8/10 or an 8.5/10.  \n\nNear the end of the school year a girl named Tess moved into his math class. She ended up sitting next to him and they discovered they both had many things in common.  Not only that, but Tess was amazing.  She was definitely a looker.  She was a 9/10 or a 9.5/10 and was EternalRhapsody's dream girl.  One day Tess asked EternalRhapsody if he could help her out in their math class since she was struggling a bit.  \nEternalRhapsody wasn't particularly a math geek, but he did have the appropriate knowledge needed to pass the class and help out Tess.\n\nShe invited him to come over to her house so he could help her with her math homework.  EternalRhapsody was sure that Tess really liked him and he liked her back so he was going to make a move on her that night at her house.\n\nThe time came and he walked over to her house.  \n\nAs he got to the address he realized that something was very off.  It wasn't a normal house but a hotel instead.  He went to the room number she provided and knocked on the door.  She opened the door and welcomed him in.  \n\nHe asked, \"Tess, why do you live in a hotel.\"  Tess laughed and said, \"Everyone asks that, my real house is by a lake and is under construction right now so I live here in the mean time.\"\n\nWith that question cleared up, EternalRhapsody got to teaching Tess about math.\n\nAs the lesson went on EternalRhapsody scooted closer and closer to Tess and Tess scooted closer and closer to EternalRhapsody.  \n\nAs he was about to finish her homework with her, he reached over and grabbed her cheek. Then he leaned over and started to kiss her.  They kept on kissing for an entire hour and only stopped when EternalRhapsody had to go.  \n\nTess walked EternalRhapsody out to the front door and as he was about to walk out she said, \"wait.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" EternalRhapsody said. \n\n\"I just wanted to tell you that today has been amazing.  I got my math homework done and I have a new boyfriend.\"\n\nEternalRhapsody smiled and said, \"I liked today too.  If there's anything else I can do just tell me and I'll do it.\" He then began to walk out the door.\n\n\"Wait,\" Tess said, \"There is something else that you can do for me actually.\"\n\n\"What do you need?\" EternalRhapsody said.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time EternalRhapsody realized she was a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That goddamned monster had tricked him again!\n\nSo he went back to school and Tess was never seen again.

{"body": "&gt;That's why this is just spin. If you say, \"God doesn't exist; that's impossible.\" everyone on the internet is going to jump at the opportunity to point out that this cannot be proved -- OK, fine -- but to spin the fact that God cannot be proved to be impossible as the same thing as having knowledge that God is \"possible\" is ridiculous. \n\nI agree that \"because you can't prove X is impossible X must be possible\" is bad logic, but I don't see what this has to do with the possible worlds semantics for modality. \n\n&gt;If alethic modality has any legitimate uses I'm not aware of them. I've only ever seen it used for nonsense like this.\n\nI wouldn't judge any philosophical tool merely on the basis of its use in the ontological argument. Possible worlds give a very straightforward way of handling possibility and necessity. A very neat use of possible worlds is in making sense of counterfactuals. \n\nWe use counterfactuals all the time (\"If I had brought that umbrella I wouldn't have got soaked\", \"If you hadn't warned me, I'd have lost a lot of money\", \"If that guy had got elected we'd all be doomed\" etc.) but a big problem is how to make sense of them, to tell which ones are true. The problem is that a feature of the \"if P then Q\" logical operator is that  if P is false then \"if P then Q\" is always true (regardless of what Q is). However while, say, \"if it hadn't rained I wouldn't get wet\" seems true, \"if it hadn't rained then the Loch Ness monster would have swallowed your children\" seems clearly false.\n\nPossible worlds come to the rescue by allowing us to say that what the counterfactual \"if P had happened then Q would have happened\" means is that \"in the nearby possible world where P occurs, so does Q\" where a 'nearby' possible world means a possible world similar in as many possible respects to the actual world (same physics etc.) except in those respects which allow P to occur. \n\nThis framework allows us to gauge the truth of these counterfactuals (rather than have them all be trivially true) which is rather useful. Furthermore a very influential account of causation hinges on counterfactuals (i.e. A caused B only if had A not occurred neither would have B) so we need an account of counterfactuals for this to work. We see similar uses of possible worlds in epistemology, so they are in fact a very useful tool.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373309171", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So many fucking questions.  Let's break it down.\n\n&gt;How do I know if I'm straight, bi, or just a gay bro?\n\nIf you don't know it is ok.  Some of people find that the labels fit them perfectly.  Others feel that one word can't adequately describe the entirety of their sexuality.  And some find that their sexuality is always changing.  No says you have to put a name to your sexual identity.\n\n&gt;Also, does a bisexual identity exist?\n\nIt isn't like the Loch Ness monster.  If people identify as bisexual then bisexuality exists.  You don't need a blurry picture to prove it.  Lots and lots of people identify as bisexual and live in relationships with either or both genders.\n\n&gt;How did you guys figure out what to identify yourselves as?\n\nEveryone's journey to self discovery is different but for me I grew up always being accused of being gay.  Then one day a friend actually asked me with sincerity and in all seriousness and I considered whether I might actually be sexually attracted to men as opposed to women.  Then I realized that I was homosexual.  It took some time after to get over the denial and then get comfortable saying it. It took even longer to figure out that I fucking love being super duper gay.\n\n&gt;How long did it take you guys to figure yourselves out and choose a sexual identity?\n\nIdentity isn't a choice but we do choose the language that best describes us.  I started to use the word gay to describe myself at about 14 or 15 and I was sucking dick about that time too.  Then it all just made sense.  I realized I was bottom right after that time.  Being a bottom it becomes very obvious that you like dick because your asshole tells you so 12 times a minute.\n\n&gt;How difficult was it for you to choose what to identify yourself as and was there anything that helped you while coming to this acceptance\n\nMy identity wasn't a choice it was more like a realization that I had been living my entire life not knowing something basic about who I was.  When you realize everything makes sense.  What helped me to accept myself is just talking and reading about it.  In the 90s there wasn't the type of positive media coverage that there is now.  People accused us of being drug addicted, diseased pedophiles.  It wasn't pretty but I read books and met boys and realized that just like the rest of my existence I am my own person and am capable to making my own life.  The labels people put on me doesn't dictate how I behave or how I live my life.  I get to decide what I want to do and labels are just what other people need to understand me.  I realized that I get to define what it means to be gay and a man.\n\n&gt;How did those around you react once you've chosen a sexual identity and how did you break the news?\n\nOnce I was sure that gay was the word for me.  I made sure my mother knew.  She pretended she didn't know.  My sister thought I would use my asshole so much that I would have to wear a diaper by the time I was 30.  My brother stopped speaking to me for a while.  Once my father found out he went into the deepest kind of denial and rejection.  When I told my friends they all slowly started coming out too.  It wasn't a big deal.  And when I told my boyfriend he was not surprised because we'd already been fucking for a while by then.\n\nI think you're not straight and that's more than OK.  I think it's wonderful.  You sound like you're bisexual which means that you can see the beauty and sexual attraction that both genders offer.  I really suggest that you have some man-on-man interactions both romantically and sexually.  You don't have to put words to what you're doing you just have to be in the moment and allow yourself to feel what you feel without judging yourself for it.  If you want a stable long term relationship with someone else the first thing you need to do is know yourself.  Once the confusion is gone you need to learn to accept and love yourself for it and not despite what you are.  After you have learned to value yourself fully and completely then and only then can you give yourself fully to another human being.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373331538", "subreddit": "askgaybros", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's my standard response;\n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims of theist unconvincing. \n\nI was raised Christian, but, I can't say that I ever truly believed. When I was very young, I accepted what I was taught in church and Sunday school without much thought. When I was probably 12 or 13 I actually thought about my 'faith' for the first time and in an instant I realized that I didn't believe it.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim. \n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many gods can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise. \n\nAlso, I can't name a single positive, tangible benefit that religion provides that can't be attained through secular means.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373341304", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Part IV: First Contact**\n\n\"Captain, there's nothing I can do. I'm pretty sure they can't see or hear us, so that brings the possible senses down to smell, taste, and touch. I have no idea how to create smells and tastes, and even if I did, I would have no idea what I would be saying to them. And as for touch: I don't think these things even realize how big we are. They've only ever touched our feet and legs; nothing higher. Maybe they think we're just moving sticks!\"\n\n\"Well they're clearly expecting us to do something,\" the Captain said unhelpfully.\n\nI turned back to the crab. It hadn't moved since its little performance. I didn't want to touch the crab itself, for fear of frightening it. Murray was right: a camouflaged animal meant an animal with predators. I knelt down in front of him and tapped the hard ground in front of him with two fingers, the same way that it had done. Hopefully that was just a greeting. The only way to know was to wait for the mob to swarm over me, in which case I would know that I was wrong. \n\nInstead, the crowd parted and the communicating crab skittered away toward the base of the cone. He stopped, maybe 50 yards away, and turned back to where we stood. The Captain starting following him, and Murray and I uncertainly followed. We hadn't explored this far up, yet; I began to get worried that we wouldn't find be able to find out way back to our ship. \n\nThe terrain began to grow bumpy and ridged. The bulges where we had found groups of crabs clustered began to grow larger and more common.   We began to see strange formations, including some that were clearly unnatural, with gleaming metal and moving parts. Although we could only speculate as to what they were for, we assumed that they must had something to do with flying the ship. Their technology seemed to be an odd mix of biological components, structures grown into a pre-planned shape, and clearly artificial materials. \n\nWe noticed specialized types of crab, too. The ones we had previously encountered were the most common, and seemed to be doing routine maintenance, repairs, and tending the growths of mold or fungus that they ate and used for light. But we caught glimpses of others; some that ran incredibly quickly, but were about half the size of the normal crabs. Some that moved very slowly on 6 stout legs, carrying rocks and other items on their flattened backs. \n\nFinally, our crab leader stopped in front of a giant bulge, about three stories high. The walls here seemed about twice as thick as the others. Inside, we saw the usual phosphorescent bacteria, but also large clumps of what must have been eggs on the walls. They were perfectly clear, with dark shapes floating inside. The light from the bacteria shone through them, illuminating the eggs eerily. From across the chamber, we saw a shape moving slowly down a wall. As our eyes adjusted, we saw yet another species of crab, different from the others. It was the largest by far (about the size of a human), and had no shells. It left a trail of eggs on its slow path, using its pincers to find the perfect niche in the porous walls in which to secure the eggs. \n\nIt seemed to sense our arrival as the maintenance crabs that had escorted us here scuttled away. It shuffled over, moving slowly and deliberately. \n\n\"Must be some sort of hive society\" Murray whispered into the mic. \"This is clearly the queen, and the fact that they brought us to her indicates some kind of leadership position as well. Fascinating that they would have a similar social structure to our own hive-like cultures, like ants and bees!\" \n\nShe (I guess we were referring to it as a \"she\", although that might not be the least bit accurate) came to a halt in front of us and tapped the ground as our previous escort had done. I tapped the ground in front of her, which seemed to set off a frenzy of activity; she flailed around, arms waving and pincers tapping. \n\n\"Shit, shit, shit!\" I yelled. \"What do I do? I have no idea what she needs!\"\n\nBut, before Captain or Murray could respond, a deep voice emanated from the Queen: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was right about then I realized she was actually an 8 story crustacean from the Paleozoic Era! So then I wrote some extra text for people who just scroll to the bottom to check for this ending. Don't spoil it in the comments below.\n\nWe left the ship as soon as we could, with a horde of scuttling crabs on our heels. We had no time to find our original entrance again, and it had already been sealed up. We just had to hope that the crew of the Methusaleh would find us again on the surface. We cut a whole through the brittle rock as quickly as possible, and jumped through. The Methusaleh picked up our signal immediately and pulled us on board. The crew gathered around, eager to hear about our experience with the extra terrestrials. We couldn't begin to describe it to them.\n\n**Tl;dr: the story took me a while to write, so just read it.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373374596", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

As a college student who just turned 21 and was blowing through bar tabs like it was no one's business, I happily obliged. I wanted to drive straight through, but around the South-Carolina/Georgia line, I became really tired, and Redbull's allleged \"wings\" weren't doing shit.\n\n&gt;I usually avoid cheap-ass motels like the plague, so I was looking for a nicer-ish place like a Hilton or Marriott or some shit, but unfortunately, the closest one was about 45 minutes away, and I was literally falling asleep at the wheel, so I begrudgingly pulled up to a \"Super 8.\" As I said, I haven't been to many cheap motels, so in retrospect I can appreciate what a shiesty joint this Super 8 was, but at the time, I was so damn tired that I could not have cared less.\n\n&gt;Being one of about three customers at the time, I got my room, and tried to go to bed. I had the lights on for half a minute, barely unpacking any of my shit before I just laid on the bed because I was so tired. I didn't want to sleep under the covers, so I laid down a blanket and just sprawled out. As I was dozing off to sleep, I felt a weird thing crawling on my leg. I was half asleep and not sure if I was just imagining things, so I rolled around a bit and slowly fell asleep. A few minutes later though, I felt another crawling up my leg toward my thigh. I had a gut feeling something was up, so I hopped out of bed and turned on the lights.\n\n&gt;With the lights on, I noticed two things. First, there was a gigantic centipede creature still on my leg! It was HUGE...it had to be at least five inches long. I freaked the fuck out, swatted it away, and stomped on it (in just my socks, ugh). Then, I looked over to the bed. Crawling on my blanket, there were about two more of these things. They were monsters. I don't know what's in the water in Georgia, but apparently whatever it is, it breeds mutant bug creatures.\n\n&gt;warning: next part is not for the faint of heart\n\n&gt;I just had a terrible, terrible feeling something was up with this bed, so I slowly crept over to the bed and decided to look underneath the covers. I whipped them off quickly (like pulling a bandaid), and freaked out at what I saw. Not only were there about two dozen more of these centipede-beasts (beastipedes?) but there was:\n\n&gt;scraps of chicken meat(?)\n\n&gt;piss stains and mystery brown stains\n\n&gt;MAGGOTS ON MAGGOTS ON MAGGOTS\n\n&gt;I had a miniature heart attack, RAN OUT OF THE ROOM IN MY BOXERS AND SOCKS, and went down to the front desk. I demanded my money back and insisted that I was just going to sleep in my car. The guy at the front desk was an asshole redneck who argued with me, saying what I just described was impossible, since all rooms are thoroughly cleaned. I challenged him to check the room out, and after arguing with him for like ten minutes, he eventually went to see.\n\n&gt;He frantically came back less than two minutes later, apologizing profusely. He offered to comp me another room, but I was just like NOPE, I'M LEAVING. He said he couldn't give me a refund, though, which was complete shit. I literally stood in my boxers in the lobby of a shiesty motel arguing with an inbred redneck for about twenty minutes at 4:30am. Finally, he was just like I can't refund you, but Super 8 has a policy where we can give Visa gift cards, redeemable for gas and blah, blah, blah. I was so annoyed, I just said \"Fine, whatever.\"\n\n&gt;He entered shit into the computer, and coyly said, \"Ok, only thing is I'm going to have to charge your card with a processing fee of tree fiddy.\" It was at that exact moment that I realized the redneck guy working at the Super 8 was actually a ten-story crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I had enough: first fucking bugs, maggots, and pieces of chicken, and now 2.6 million year old sea beasts. I just growled, \"Fuck you, Loch Ness Monster, keep your own damn Visa gift card. I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I grabbed my stuff from the room, got in my car, and drove straight to Jacksonville, Florida without stopping. I have never been so mad in my life.

When I realized this was not an isolated incident, I went back to my apartment to tell my mother (who is VP of the tenant's association) that I was going to go door-to-door, (in a 19 story building with 225 apartments that are mostly occupied by seniors) to check on people and offer aid and information on how to get through this blackout. She strongly disagreed with my idea claiming that tenants would be scared shitless of an 18 year old dude that they don't know banging on their doors.\n\nI did it anyway.\n\nAnd I don't regret it.\n\nI t took 3 hours to get to every door and I made the same offer to everyone\n\n\"Hi, my name is John, I live in apartment 1811, I'm going door-to-door checking to make sure everyone's got everything they need. Do you have food, water, and fire? If you need anything from peanut butter to batteries, come knock on my door and I'll see what I can do to help you. \n\nAround the 2^nd floor a nice old lady with a portable radio filled me in on what was going on outside and that motivated me even more to not stop climbing to offer aid and status updates to every apartment that I went to. Every apartment I went to save for one was glad I came to check on them. When I finally got home, my feet were killing me, my knuckles were FUBAR from knocking on so many doors, and I felt good about what I did.\n\nAround 0030 I crawled into my bed worrying about what tomorrow was going to have in store. As soon as I pulled my sheets over me, the power came back on.\n\n\n***THIS REAL STORY IS 100% NESSIE, DINOSAUR, AND BEL-AIR FREE!***", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373431995", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Lovecraft kind of way, which is to say a very horrifying proposition if true.  \n\nOf course, souls only usually exist to explain things we can't quantify or understand yet, and that continues to shrink as time goes by. Plus, souls don't explain why our brain is so damned important.  Basically, the soul, like gods, is an explanation added to an already perfectly reasonable model.\n\nAs for ghosts, well, I suppose I am more open to the idea, though if there were such unexplained phenomenon, I'd be less inclined to think of them as manifestations of human will as something completely foreign that we simply don't understand.\n\nOf course, I haven't actually seen anything that needs explaining via ghosts or the soul.  Even all those ghost hunting shows I watch (drawn to them for how they illustrate exactly how NOT to be skeptical) have yet to produce anything requiring extranormal explanation.\n\nOn the other hand, while I don't believe in Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster, I'm definitely more open to their existence than anything supernatural.

{"body": "My friend and his wife were like any other couple in our small town. Charming, kind, and had a love that few couples ever achieve. Well, she tells this story that nobody else in our town believes is true, but ill tell you anyway. One night, during a low part in their marriage, they get into a really big fight. To help calm themselves down, they decide to go on a moonlit drive down some of the old country roads. Now, my town is really small, about ten thousand or so people, so we don't have the best lit road system. Right as they decide to turn back and head home, the car sputters and stops. My friend soon realizes his mistake and sees that he is out of gas, on a dimly lit gravel road in the middle of farmlands. He decides that they should wait until morning before heading out,because he knows that coyotes stalk these lands at night. Being the ~~bitch~~ lovely person she is, his wife forces him to run to the nearest gas station(which is miles away) and to \"come back to her with gas, or don't come back at all\". Dejected, he runs off into the night in search of gas. Hours pass and no sign of my friend, then off in the distance she see's the silhouette of a man walking towards the car.A little annoyed at her husband for taking so long, she rolls down the window and yells out \"Hey, what took you so long ,you sad excuse of a man\"(she regrets these words to this day) and all she gets in response is a grunt. Proud of herself, she looks back to mock her husband once more, when she freezes. That figure wasn't her husband, and is heading straight towards the car. She quickly rolls up her window and locks the doors, hoping it is enough to keep her safe. As the figure approaches, she notices something is very *off* about the figures appearance. Soon the figure passes close enough to the car for her to see his face, and  what she saw was a disfigured, red eyed face that staring directly at her. It then walks to the passenger side window to where my friends wife sat, where it just stood. Those 30 seconds seem like hours, until he began to try to open the door, snarling like a wild animal as he does it. It kept pulling and pulling with the strength of a bear, until the door started to give. After a few pulls the door was completely off, and she was face to face with the beast. With her heart pounding, and body shaking she manages to choke out the words \"What do you want from me?\". The creature leans in slowly, licking its lips as he does it, and says \"I need about tree-fiddy\". It was about this time, she realized this was no hillbilly-monster, but a 500ft tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. She then yelled \"Dammit loch ness monster, i aint giving you no tree-fiddy\" The monster then ran off into the night, never to be seen around our town again. But she knows its still out there, and she knows that it is watching, waiting for its time to strike again.\n\nTL;DR: My married friend and wife have a run in with a creature in the middle of the night", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373464968", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was almost midnight. My fiance was coming back from work any time now, and I dreaded it. He has been cheating on me. With **my aunt**. The wedding was in five months, and I called in sick from work just to spend the whole day canceling wedding plans. How would I tell my family? They absolutely loved Dave. They always talked about us spending eternity together, having babies, and they spent every minute planning the wedding with me. And now that wedding won't happen.\n\nIt was two weeks earlier, and I just came home from work. I walked into the bedroom, and noticed a bra on the floor. Upon closer inspection, I noticed it wasn't mine. My boobs aren't so pointy. I ran to the computer, and logged on to Dave's facebook account to read his messages. His latest message was to my aunt. *Thats weird,* i thought. They talked about meeting up together every Friday night at the nearest hotel. The \"business trip\" Dave took last month was them going to Vegas. He told her he loved her. I couldn't believe this. I felt so betrayed.\n\nFast forward to the present day. I was sitting on the couch, watching the clock tick. After what felt like forever, my fiance walked through the door. \"Hey, honey!\" He said, \"You're up late tonight!\" \" I have to talk to you\" his face dropped. \"A...about what?\" He said, trying to maintain a smile. \"You're cheating on me! *with my 52 year old aunt!*\" \"Honey, I'm so sorry, please, the wedding is in five months, we sent out invitations!\" His voice cracked. I had to stay strong. \"No. I'm leaving. I left my ring on the counter and my stuff is packed up and in the car. I'm taking the hamster.\" He started to cry. *Dont feel bad, stay strong*. \"Goodbye, Dave,\" I said as i walked out the door. \"Wait,\" he said, his voice shaking, \"can I ask to borrow something?\" \"What do you need to borrow??\" He looked at me. \"About tree fiddy.\" I gasped.

{"body": "It was two weeks since the accident. Or was it two months? Julie's memory was never quite the same. She wasn't quite sure what happened, just bits and pieces. The sun was out that Friday and it was some kind of holiday. It was just her and Bob, the violently lime 1964 Porsche 911 so named after Bob Washington, the dealership finance manager on the business card buried in the glove-box.\n\nShe was pretty sure they were coming home from *something* though that something was still unclear. A party? Work? It was still a blur. All she could remember was her speed: 50 mph. It was a sunny day as the rolling tarmac ribbons rose and fell carelessly. Fresh tires and service meant that Bob turned as well as he did when he rolled off the boat all those years ago. The car was in third (fourth?). Julie was 90% sure she was a few miles from home when it all came to a crashing halt. It was a corner she had taken many times prior with Bob and every other car. It was a gentle left, a mild bend. Neither blind nor hidden she knew she could keep the car in third and cruise through it. \n\nBut not today. It could have been the large gravel truck lumbering through earlier or the minivan that pulled out after a tire change but the skittish 911 lost its footing mid-corner. The car spun violently and the earth began swirling like a spoon in a coffee cup. Julie wrenched the fat twin-spoke steering wheel as the car began rotating at a violent angle like a psychotic top, praying that a wheel didn't buckle, collapse under the car, and trigger a violent roll before crashing and burning like Leif Garrett's career. Together they whirled for what felt like an eternity when the car suddenly regained grip and swung a hard right before coming to a complete stop.\n\nAnd then the impact. The lap belt and her left leg bracing her to the floor kept her fixed to the seat but the lack of upper-body restraint sent her head into the window with a sickening bang. \n\nWhen she came to, she found herself groggy, in scrubs lying in a violently-lit room. Around her were her friends and family. As they exchanged the usual sympathetic glances and, in hushed voices, told her how lucky she was to have survived, Julie quickly surmised that after the impact, the local handyman found her unconscious, dialed for an ambulance, and that it was only a few hours after, but she really wanted to know what happened to Bob. \n\nHer mother hesitated and threw a quick glance to her father, who muttered something about knowing after forty years of marriage that he'd have to tackle the hard stuff. He inhaled, closed and rubbed his eyes. \n\n\"Bob's fine\",  he said flatly. \n\n\"Good. Thank God.\" Julie replied with an equally flat affect. She wanted to cry but couldn't. Mechanics at that shop never cried. It was an unspoken rule at the garage she carried over to her own life. \n\nShe didn't touch the car for the next three weeks. A mixture of fear and anger kept her at an arm's length from Bob. He didn't seem to mind, his goofy bug-eyes and wide grin always welcoming to the stray cats lounging on his front lid and fenders. \"How could he have done this?\" She fumed.\n\nThey had been through so much together. He was her first; she having seen him abandoned with a crude FOR SALE sign and a price too dear, swore she would drive that Porsche. Her father, old enough to remember the nasty heartbreak, begged her not to. But she was not to be dissuaded, taking on another job at the local mechanic's shop as an apprentice. As her technical experience grew she finally had enough to save Ellen (the prior owner apparently never found the Bob card) and give her (him) the makeover s/he deserved. As Bob turned from a backyard curiosity into a real car her father became real worried. When she took Bob out for the inaugural run he worried himself sick fully expecting to see a pancaked Bob trucked back but that day never came. Bob and Julie came home every day: you see,  she had the special touch, she would tell people. \n\nBut there comes a time when push comes to shove and we need money to fuel our hedonistic lifestyles. Julie promised her boss on the Wednesday of the third week that she would be back Monday, ready and willing, of course leaving out the part about the Porsche. She found herself gulping as she thought of the prospect of driving Bob again. Her little lime Bob morphed before her eyes into the Loch Ness Monster. This was the last straw. Grabbing the dinky and rusty key, she marched off to the garage. \n\nShe was glad to see Bob was still Bob. He had not become the evil monster; his goofy bug eyes and wide grins welcoming her back as she walked around him like the feral cats on his hood. Her eyes traced the smooth sloping lime curves over the rear wheel. She remembered her first time talking to Ben in the paint shop across the road from the garage, how he, in his awkwardness taught her the importance of proper surface prep, how she should choose the original pine-green for maximum resale value. She hated pine green. She wanted the violent acid lime that so screamed the '70s and she got her way. The gravel-splattered chrome bumpers still shone brightly, their over-riders still bearing the age and scars befitting a 40-year-old car owned by a new driver in a rural place. Ben always got on her case about doing the bumpers, how such a gorgeous car ought to have equally nice bumpers, but she never wanted to. There are many perfect Porsche 911s that live pampered lives in showrooms as Viagra for the egos of aging baby boomers; Bob was not.\n\nAmazingly the little spin had little damage to the car other than the missing hubcap on the right rear wheel, the fender pockmarked from gravel harder than usual. Julie winced as she remembered the accident. She looked up to the windows and saw the giant crack in the driver's side window where her head bounced off like (what she imagined to be) a ping-pong ball and felt the healed knot on her skull as though it were fresh. \n\nSteadying her right hand, she popped open the driver's side door. Her body fell into the thinly padded bucket seat as if she were a baseball in a glove. Bob smelled as good as she remembered, old leather mixed with rust, a dram of danger, and a mote of motor oil - it was what she imagined Indiana Jones would smell like as a car. \n\nThe steering wheel and mirrors were unchanged. Both hands at 10 and 2 on the wheel. Shifter in neutral. The fear was quickly washing out of her system and familiarity bleeding in. Inhale. Exhale. Through the windshield she could see the driveway that Bob came home in, the one he left, and the one he loved so very much.\n\nWith a warbling whisper she broke the silence. \"You should have killed me when you had the chance.\"\n\nBob was silent. \n\nShe gripped the finger-thin wheel with all her 126-lb might her right hand could deliver. Key firmly in left, she dipped the key in the hole. There was no turning back. Foot on clutch, she deftly flicked her wrist as the air-cooled flat-six burbled to life. The two-liter engine whose carburetors she so lovingly hand-adjusted through internet forum posts reverberated ropily as if bored. Blip the throttle. The smell of 1964 engulfed everything in a 500 ft. radius. The gauges sprung to life. The old Blaupunkt radio jumped to the last station as the sound of a vapid flavor-of-the-month pop song joined the distinctive burble that such an engine can make. \n\nThe fear was gone. She slotted the tall bulbous shifter into first while ever-so-delicately balancing on the throttle and off the clutch. Bob eased forward for the first time in an eternity. A touch more throttle sent the two along the way down the dusty dirt driveway toward the main road.\n\nIt was all coming back. The sound of the engine. The smell of the exhaust. The weathered leather. She wanted to cry but didn't; mechanics never cried. It was an unspoken rule at the garage. \n\n\"I've missed you, Julie\", Bob's whining 2-3 shift said. \"I'm sorry\" he motioned with a tug of the wheel. She said nothing as he wailed loudly down the road. They reached the junction to the main road and stopped for traffic. Julie leaned forward, ear-to-dash, to check for traffic.  \"Have you forgiven me yet?\" Bob's dashboard vibrated as she eased the car onto the road. Still nothing. \n\nShe accelerated and snick-snick'd her way through the gears, Bob wailing in anticipation as he slashed his way through the asphalt ribbon. Quickly, the feeling of fear was drowning in a pool of righteous and realization that the Acura Integra in front was getting uncomfortably close. She gripped the wheel, flicked it to the left, center, and proceeded to downshift. Bob surged forward as he edged past the white sedan. The other driver didn't seem care as she passed him effortlessly. As she flicked the car back into the lane, she impulsively glanced at the rear-view mirror at the car behind. Julie swore she saw a brief green mist flash and then dissipate through behind her. \n\nFor the first time since the accident Julie felt right. She tapped the thin veneer dashboard as if to say \"Yes, I've missed you.\" \"Good\", Bob nodded with bouncing revs as she shifted the gears. \"Good.\" A tear streamed down her cheek but she no longer cared, not what the mechanics said, not what her father said, not what the internet said, not what she feared. All that mattered was that the two lovers could dance their way through the endless stretch of tarmac ahead. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373537166", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; The financial cost is the least of the problem. The societal costs of people just hanging on isolatedly and not being active are much bigger.\n\nAs opposed to being isolated in the streets, being seen as lower than scum; living in trash of the gutter, ... ?\n\n&gt; Obviously in that case, but there's a group of people who don't seem to get out of it.\n\nYeah it's the part you can still see when society is running high. But the fact that the number of homeless people tenfold during an economic crisis tends to make me think a lot of people does NOT intend to stay there; but when you can't pay the rent for the lack of tree fiddy, they try tossing you in the street anyway.\n\n&gt; I wouldn't start working fulltime to make €100 more than unemployment benefits, for example.\n\nNow you're being a little dishonest. 600€/Mo is a part time (half time) job. In France; the minimal legal wage for a full time is about 1100€ after taxes. It's like 2 to 3 times welfare money. It does tend to motivate.\n\n&gt;  but what benefit does being a productive worker have when people don't reply to you soliciting a job? \n\nBecause sooner or later employers will have to face the fact that most of their criters in their offers (\"unpaid internship\"; \"thousands of year of experience, wage of an illegal immigrant\", and other bullshit plagging 90% of the current offers) just does not work and will have to pay real wages and recruit really or face bankruptcy because there's nobody anymore.\n\nIt's the rebound we're waiting, and planning for. And we'll need workers at that moment. *Lots* of them.\n\n&gt; The homeless are notoriously difficult to get into fixed housing anyway, even when offered free. They're just allergic, for lack of a better word, to routine. It's very rare for them to remain homeless because of a lack of money alone. Most of them get off the street when they are ready for it.\n\nNow this is just feudal lord condescending ridiculous bullshit. \"oh oh oh those bloody peasant, don't give them any money they'll just waste it on alcool and drugs. Keep them farming for nuthing while i pay for my castl\".\n\nIn my town we had a number of illegal roms immigrant (from romania, *very* poor, living in the streets and in broken trailers in junkyards). They were like a hobo on two or three.\n \nWe gave a home to a number of them; and RSA (low level welfare). You know what happened ?\n\n*Half of them stopped begging in like 3 months*. Pick pocketing diminished radically (by like 70%); burglary around camps by around as much; and they started integrating a lot more; and learning french. We have like a fifth of Paris' homelessness issue per same number of habitants or surface. If that's not success then i dunno what it is.\n\n&gt; And stuffing one of those with homeless fresh off the streets would turn those back into savage dump locations in no time. These people typically have other issues than not having a house.\n\nYeah some of the buildings are a little gettoish or maybe trashy by our western standards. Recycle bins ain't used properly, there's tags on the wall and the elevator is dead most of the time. Etc\n\nBut compared to the calcutta-style waste dump they came from ? it's fucking clean. There's wayyyy less people in the street, and the cops doesn't show up more than like once a month (compared to every two/three days in some neighborhoods before).\n\nSo yeah, i'd say it works, and is an measurable improvement.\n\nMost people treat poor people like cattle then act surprised when they have no dignity and act like beast. \n\nIf you want people to act better you need to 1°) treat them like (sane) humans 2°) offer them a hand first and help, if not in monetary value stop acting like they were indesirable invaders 3°) like i just said not act like they were your ennemy 4°) oncee you've shown you're not just there to arrest them like the cops, push them on more adequate solutions for everyone. \n\nAnd even if they never started working in the most bad case (which i'll never believe is the case but will follow for the sake of the argument), I'd rather know the region \"waste\" some money on welfare if only for the sake of not seeing as much hobos in the streets. At least it's cleaner, and you don't need to crack down on anyone china style to do it and keep most streets clean on working non economical crisis society level.

It's like abortion: it may be the best choice is some circumstances, but it does mean that all forms of family planning failed.\n\n&gt;Yeah it's the part you can still see when society is running high. But the fact that the number of homeless people tenfold during an economic crisis tends to make me think a lot of people does NOT intend to stay there; but when you can't pay the rent for the lack of tree fiddy, they try tossing you in the street anyway.\n\nIf you have any decent unemployment benefits that doesn't happen. I'm talking about the baseload of homeless.\n\n&gt;Now you're being a little dishonest. 600€/Mo is a part time (half time) job. In France; the minimal legal wage for a full time is about 1100€ after taxes. It's like 2 to 3 times welfare money. It does tend to motivate.\n\nThis varies wildly from country to country, but in any case you have to deduct working expenses, including clothes, transport, childcare, etc. and then also take into account the fact that typically working people are less eligible for benefits like cheap housing and other forms of assistance. A lot of people would rather stay at home taking care of their own children and doing their own laundry than going out and take care of someone else's children and laundry for a minimal financial difference. The solution to that is to provide meaningful jobs and higher wages, of course.\n\n&gt;Because sooner or later employers will have to face the fact\n\nEmployers don't face the facts; they make other people face the facts the way they want them to face them.\n\n&gt;It's the rebound we're waiting, and planning for. And we'll need workers at that moment. Lots of them.\n\nThere is no indication whatsoever that we're going to need a lot of workers for anything anytime soon. Labor efficiency rises, we're going to need less and less workers.\n\n&gt;Now this is just feudal lord condescending ridiculous bullshit. \"oh oh oh those bloody peasant, don't give them any money they'll just waste it on alcool and drugs. Keep them farming for nuthing while i pay for my castl\".\n\nSome people are just that mangled that they have trouble remembering where they slept last night, and they lash out at people trying to help them.\n\n&gt; If that's not success then i dunno what it is.\n\nIf you start from a total crap situation it's not very hard to improve.

{"body": "Guess I'll join in, but my story probably isn't as interesting as these others.\n\nSo about three years ago I was a lawyer for an amusement park. This particular one was the biggest amusement park in a long stretch any direction and gathered about 20-30k people a day. \n\nNow amusements parks have so many restaurants in them that you typically have hundreds of food service employees clocking in daily. Because of such a huge amount of people they have lots of security checks, till checks, and a high quality loss prevention team to make sure a bunch of kids aren't stealing from the register.\n\nWell one day I got called in and was told that someone had turned their till in a few hundred dollars below what it was supposed to be. No problem it had happened before, kids who think that we don't monitor the money and try to make some extra cash. This was different though.\n\nWe generally talk to the people before we take them to court. Sort of a, \"Give us it back and nothing will happen\" sort of deal. When I met the guy and asked him to return it he said, \"I can't I was mugged carrying it back.\"\n\nSo according to his story as he was walking back to return it he was jumped and the person who did it quickly grabbed the money and ran. Sadly there were no cameras in this particular area so we couldn't verify it, and there were no witnesses because it was later after the park closed.\n\nSo I said to him, \"Since we have no evidence you have to pay it or we'll have to take it from you, and it's also in our policy that stealing is against the code of conduct so you'll be let go.\"\n\nHe about cried at that moment and I could feel that he was innocent. He blurted out everything he would do to keep his job, that he was behind on rent, and that the money he was being forced to pay back would put him so far back he'd be evicted.\n\nThen he looked at me with tears in his eyes, and he said to me.. \"And with all that I'm still gunna need about tree fiddy..\" And that's when I noticed he was a three story creature from the paleotheric era and I said I ain't giving you no tree fiddy you damned loch ness monster.\n\nSo yeah... probably the shittiest I will ever feel as a human being\n\ntl:dr: I spent time writing this, read it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373603981", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

You either have evidence on which you can make a claim, or you don't.  You wouldn't say, \"I can't prove that the Loch Ness monster *doesn't* exist, so I refuse to make a prediction.\"  And then if someone were to say, \"We swept the lake and found nothing,\" you probably wouldn't respond, \"that doesn't mean anything because it could have been (insert practically any alibi that can't be proven to be untrue)\"  So why would you do the same thing with God?  we tell someone there are no discernible signs of his existence, and yet they turn around and (insert practically any alibi that can't be proven to be untrue).  That's not how shit works!\n\n\nOne of your statements is that the universe requires God to fill in gaps, but it doesn't.  Quick tidbit: matter is energy at a low vibration, hence E=mc^2. Now:  \n\nThe 1st Law of Thermodynamics completely removes the *need* for God: Energy cannot be created, nor destroyed. Think about what that means...it means that according to a LAW, not a theory, but a LAW, matter ***does not need*** a \"creator\".  The known LAWS of physics permit for matter to exist without ever having been created.  Absolutely no theory in physics will break down because matter wasn't \"created.\"  In fact, it's quite the opposite: Not some, but, **Every** Law, Theory, and prediction in Physics is based on the 1st Law of Thermodynamics. So breaking that Law would actually cause Physics to completely deteriorate. Gravity, Electromagnetism, the **entirety** of Quantum Physics, the Big Bang Theory, Weather Models, Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics, Rigid Body Dynamics, Dynamics of Deformable Bodies, **every single equation** we have come up in the last 300 years falls apart if the 1st Law is broken. \n\n\nHow did they come up with the Big Bang Theory?  They same way every other equation was derived: they started with the 1st Law.  Many of our predictions were wrong upon observation of particle behavior under conditions similar to those at the time of the universe that the predictions were made to encompass.  After reviewing our observations, the new equations we came up with still conformed to the 1st Law.  Even when Gravity, E-Mag, and the Strong/Weak forces start to break down, even as Special Relativity is broken (from 10^-33 seconds and earlier), there is one Law that is never broken: the 1st Law. \n\nSo, the 1st Law removes God from the equation because matter never needed to be created and the validity of this statement is proven by 300 years of successful equations derived from the 1st Law.

Even rides like Skull Mountain have a pop of good airtime.\n\n**B&amp;M** - Usually decent but mostly not top 10 worthy. A lot of samey rides. They never quite built another invert as intense as Batman, which is an insane whirlwind of a ride.\n\n**Vekoma** - Can make good rides, new boomerang and slc trains really improv the experience, all the Disney Vekomas are really good.\n\n**Custom Coasters International** - Really unique, intense, often rough rides but with a lot of character. They made Boulder Dash which is easily my favorite coaster.\n\n**Great Coasters International** - A lot of potential but their rides tend to \"meh\" me. Thunderhead was an exception, one of the most out of control woodies I've been on for sure. I'm eager to give them more chances, rides like Prowler look fantastic.\n\n**Premier** - Crap from what I've ridden. Flight of Fear was boring and a leg banger and Backlot Stunt Coaster was dull.

{"body": "Ugh this memory haunts me.\n\nSo I was on a plane trip from Newark to Pheonix on business. I take a lot of these long-distance flights, so it's nothing new, but I always seem to get seated with \"characters\". This particular occasion, I was seated next to this fairly large woman. I would have to guess 300+ lbs., and she could have used a few sticks of deoderant. I was in the isle seat and she was in the center. This poor bastard was on the window seat, and I could see he was miserable. He was trying to get as close to the window as possible to get away from blubber-gal.\n\nSo the flight gets underway and this lady decides that she wants to be best friends with me. She goes into this long conversation about her family, and how she hates her job, and how she's waiting for the right man and on and on. I'm sitting there nodding going \"Uh-huh. Okay. Could I-. I just. Want to. Read my. Book. Yea. Ok. Uh-huh.\" It was terrible.\n\nEventually I just pull out my book while she keeps on talking and she starts trying to ask me about it. \"Whatcha reading? Is it a mystery? A murder mystery? I love murder mystery books. I have this cousin who's an english major...\" and so on. Eventually I just say to her flat-out, \"listen, it's gonna be a long flight. Do you mind if I just sit and read my book in silence?\" Oh, but she didn't take that to kindly. She says \"well you didn't have to be rude, asshole. Screw you.\" Great, now I have an angree manatee next to me. This is gonna be awkward...\n\nSo after awhile I decided I couldn't keep reading. Angry-lady just kept glaring at me over my shoulder while I was reading and it made me too uncomfortable. At this time the flight attendant came by and offered us drinks. Squished guy in the isle asks for headphones so he can listen to music, and that sounded like a good idea at the time, so I thought I'd do the same. I was just about to ask but ol' roundy interupted me and asked for headphones first. The flight attendant took her $5, and gave her the headphones. I asked for some too, but the flight attendant then told me that they were all out... fuck.\n\nI figured that if Sally McFat-Fuck was gonna be listening to music, that would leave me free to read, but no. She didn't even use the headphones. She just continued to glare at me. I got fed up. I said to her \"Listen, I just want this to be a relaxing plane trip. Please stop glaring at me. Or at least let me buy those headphones from you so I can listen to music and close my eyes.\"\n\n\"No!\" She said. \"You're mean and you hurt my feelings. You can't have these!\"\n\n\"Ugh, listen. I'll even pay you a little more than what they cost if you will hand them over. Just tell me how much extra you need.\"\n\nThat got her attention. She thought for a moment and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" At this point, I realized this rotund girl was actually an 8 story tall crustation from the paleolithic area. I shouted \"God damn Loche Ness Monster!

{"body": "Man, my best friend from middle school really fucked up his life.\n\nBack then he was a pretty smart guy, getting all As and Bs in classes. He ended up having to move to another state because of family problems and I fell out of touch with the guy. At first I saw him a couple times a year but by the time we reached the end of high school the only interaction we had was liking each other's facebook statuses. I got bored of facebook eventually and had no idea what was going on in his life by the time I was in college. He didn't never even crossed my mind anymore. \n\nFast forward 5 years. I'm out of college with a great job I love, living in NYC with the girl of my dreams. Out of the blue I get a text from an unknown number. Turns out it was him. He was in NYC for a week and wanted to go out for drinks and catch up. I of course agreed to go out and we made plans to go to a bar a couple of blocks from my place. We get to talking and he reveals how shitty his life had become. During freshman year of college (I was amazed to hear he went to MIT for mechanical engineering) he knocked up the first girl that he had a one night stand with. He begged her to get an abortion or at least put it up for adoption, but she was a religious nut and refused. He was forced to drop out of MIT to get a job working at Walmart full time to raise the kid. After a few years of living this shit life and being forced to marry a girl he didn't love, he came home one day to find that his wife had killed herself. This was less than a year before the day we met up. I was shocked to hear that he was now stuck alone, broke, with a 4 year old daughter named Jennifer. I did what anyone would do and offered to help him out. He looked at me with the most gracious look I have ever seen on someone's face and said something that I will remember for the rest of my life: \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\".

{"body": "Oh it was bloody awkward.\n\nIt began with this girl \"J\" who was in my studyhall period. It was around 10 in the morning, and she was extremely shy. I usually played chess with my friends in the study hall, and she would sit in the back of the room and do her homework. I noticed her, and I remember thinking she was really cute, but I never spoke to her. I mean, we were both shy and nerdy, so going out on a limb and saying something to eachother would've been way out of our comfort zone.\n\nTowards the end of our junior year, J and I got invited to a mutual friend's graduation party. Well, it was her friend. I got an invitation because we were aquantances from marching band. There was little parental supervision, and there was alcohol there. I had never drank before, so I went with a few friends into this girl's basement where we got a bit tipsey. Don't worry, the alcohol was provided. We didn't steal any from her parents or anything. I think her older brother got it.\n\nAnyway, after a few drinks, I head upstairs and outside and start to \"feel it\", as young kids do when they first drink, and decide that I feel confident enough to talk to J. I head over, say hi, and mention that I'm in her 4th period study hall. She said she already knew that. That felt kinda nice. The fact that she knew who I was too. Well we got to talking, and the fact that we should talk more, and about how we were both really shy, and that lasted quite awhile. I suggested she come inside and have a drink. We both had some to drink, but she was smaller than me and hadn't drank before either, so it wasn't too long til we were both pretty drunk. This ended with us sprawled out on our mutual friend's basement floor alone, still talking, but slurring a lot. Eventually, I just leaned over and kissed her. I quickly realized that I was shy as fuck still and pulled away after a moment, but she pulled me back in for another kiss. It was nice.\n\nAfter that we got a litle handsy with eachother and decided to just have sex. It was pretty spontantious and I was pretty surprised at both her and me because of how forward we were being. So J and I went into our friend's basement bathroom, got undressed, had awkward drunk virgin sex. We didn't use protection, because we were stupid highschool kids. It's a fucking miracle nothing happened.\n\nAnyway, we finished up, got dressed again, and left the bathroom. Outside were about 10 other people playing a drinking game. We froze. They knew what just went down, especially since the both of us left the bathroom together. She got bright red and ran upstairs. I tried to chase after her, but was slowed down by the guys wanting high-fives.\n\nEventually I made my way upstairs to catch her running out the front door. I got outside and caught up to her and said \"hey! Wait up!\" She just said \"Leave me alone RGood. I can't believe we just did that\". I didn't know what to say. Although, I knew she couldn't get home. We were sobering up at that point, but there was no way she could drive. She just kept walking.\n\nAll I could think to say was \"Where are you going?\" \"Home\" she said. I said \"Let me call you a cab or something at least.\" She said \"I can do it myself.\" \"Oh come on,\" I said \"at least let me give you some cab money or something. Please. There's no reason this has to be so awkward.\" She stopped for a moment and said \"...fine...\" I said \"so how much will you need to get home?\" She said back \"I need about tree fiddy.\" At this point, I realized J was an 8 story tall crustacian from the paleolithic era. I shouted back \"God damn Loche Ness monster! I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"\n\n**TL;DR**: Shy girl and I hook up at a party spontaneously, we get caught, and it gets super fucking awkward.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373651287", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 43, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was my first day of college. I had unpacked all of my stuff away in my dorm room, had an awesome roommate, and was heading to class. I was majoring in physiology. I got to class, took a seat away from everyone else, being the socially awkward penguin that i am, and then I noticed him. Sitting. Being absolutely beautiful. I can honestly say that I have never seen someone else quite like him. The way he talked, his smile, the way he genuinely seemed to care about what everyone else was saying. I didn't learn a thing that first day. The next day i worked up the courage to sit by him. I introduced myself, as did he. I couldn't help but notice the way he looked at me. I was in love, although I had just met him. \n\nA few months had passed, and he asked me out. I said yes, and we went on a date to the nearest café. It was the best first date I'd ever been on. After that we watched a movie at in his dorm room. I went back to my dorm room after the date, practically spinning with joy. He was perfect. I knew we would get married. I told my roommate all about him. She agreed that we would end up married. So me and Chris dated for a few more months. I hadn't met his roommate up until this point but one day, as I went to Chris' dorm to meet up for a date to the movies, i finally met mr. Roommate. He was tall, handsome, and a little bit familiar looking. He said I looked familiar too, which made me feel less crazy. Chris was still at a class, so I waited and talked with his roommate, Bill, for a bit. Apparently me and Bill grew up together. He was in my kindergarten class, and went to elementary school and junior high with me. I couldn't help but notice that he seemed quite interested in me. When Chris came back, we went on our date, came back, had dinner, our usual routine. \n\nThe next day, Chris comes over to my dorm room. We talk for a bit like always, but I can't help but realize that he looks uncomfortable. Apparently Bill had told Chris that he loved me. He said that he has \"loved me since the first day of kindergarten, and hadn't forgotten about me even as we went to different high schools.\" I was shocked to say the least. In junior high i had a little crush on him for a while, but my friends convinced me that he was way popular than I was, so I let it go. I told Chris that i didn't love Bill, and that maybe we should just avoid him for a while. Chris agreed, looking very relieved. He seemed happier after that. So we avoided Bill for the next few months. But then the worst thing imaginable happened.\n\n\nBill turned into a stalker. Like, stage 4 cancer level stalker. He found my phone number out of Chris' phone, called me 25+ times a day. Texted ,e hundreds of times a day. Broke into my dorm room in the middle of the night and took pictures of me as I slept, and then sent me the pictures the next day. Chris reported Bill to the police, he got a new roommate, we thought it was over. We were wrong. Bill took it to a new level. Sending me letters threatening to kill himself, saying it was my fault, that he would get revenge if i didn't break up with Chris and marry him instead. I ignored it. That was so stupid. The next day, I was at the mall with Chris. Chris gets a text from his new roommate saying that there's a something wrong with the sink, and he need to get there immediately. We figure, eh, whatever, lets just go fix the sink then come back to the mall. We go to Chris dorm. There we see Chris' roommate duct taped to a desk chair, struggling. WTF, we thought, and then we saw him. *Him*. Bill was standing in the corner, with a gun, a knife and several rolls of duct tape in his hand. Long story sort, both me and Chris end up duct taped to a chair. Bill laughs like a maniac. \"Hahahaha, see? I *told* you I would get revenge.\" I was scared, but I managed to yell, \"*What do you want, you monster??\" he stops laughing, has a dead serious look on his face. He looks me in the eyes and says, \"You know what I want?\" \"Yes\" he hesitates for a minute. \"About tree fiddy.\" It was just then i noticed I noticed he was the Loch Ness monster. I gave him tree fiddy, he let us go, and then me and Chris got married in Vegas. The End", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373657346", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

We ordered another bottle of wine from room service and as we're waiting for it to come up she starts telling me about the company, which I immediately saw as a pyramid scheme, but she had no idea what she was getting herself into.

{"body": "I had a best friend all throughout my childhood; we were close until she moved to Maine in the middle of sophomore year. We kept in contact a little bit (social networking wasn't huge, but we fancied ourselves \"pen pals\"). From what I understood, she was fine. She had started using coke in the autumn before she moved, but she made no mention of it in her letters. In senior year, I started writing her about colleges, but she seemed to have no interest, not even responding with a \"congrats\" when I told her I was going to Dartmouth. She just wrote about this guy she found, how he was so amazing, how they were going to run off together and love each other til the end of time...this delusion worried me. I asked her what her plans for the future were and she just emailed me her cell number \"just in case.\" That was the last time I heard from her. Two years ago, right after I graduated, I looked her up. Using her cell, I finally found that she was living in Portland, Maine. That's all I knew, besides her apartment address.I was visiting relatives in Old Orchard Beach that summer (before job hunting-ugh) and decided, hey, why not find her. We may have grown apart over the years, but we were best friends until around sixteen. \nOne day I call her cell, and though she doesn't pick up, I let her know I was going to drop in. It was pretty out-of-the-blue, but I got a text back with a smiley and a \"cant wait!\" We set up a time, and I drive to her apartment. Portland is a nice city, but this is in one of the poorer sections of town. Dirty, pretty empty, etc. but I wasn't going to judge; God knows how expensive apartments are. I knock on the door of the apartment (luckily its more of a house turned apartment and she is on the ground floor). It's opened by this....woman. \nHere's some background; this girl was a short, curvy girl with a bubbly personality, very pretty with long curly blonde hair. Fairly athletic, and average intelligence, but just a fun person with twinkling hazel eyes.\n\nI see none of that in the thing that stands before me. It--she, I guess--is short, and thinner than a toothpick. The only curves on this are from the disgustingly distended belly from a nearly to term pregnancy. Since I work in a hospital, I am used to pregnant women and think that the growth that accompanies a new life into the world is natural and beautiful. Except in this instance. This girl can't weigh more than 75 lbs, and is about 5'2\". So the life growing inside her already frail body makes her stomach look terrifying, especially where her ribs poke through. Her skin is waxy and pale and dotted with scars and broken veins; I can only assume from heroin use. Lank, greasy hair hangs down to her waist and looks as if it hasn't been cut since the day she left. \nBut in spite of all this, her still-twinkling hazel eyes light up when they see me. She grabs my arm and hugs it-I doubt she would possess the strength to do more. She squeals about how happy to see me she is, and her voice is the same. If I couldn't see her body, I would think her unchanged. \nShe tugs me into the apartment, which is surprisingly clean. Sparsely furnished, but not a shithole. We chat for a bit, me telling her about my life, mostly. She seems reluctant to open up. Finally I gesture to her tummy and go, \"Congrats! Are you excited?\" She shakes her head. I look at her and go, \"But its a child! You'll be bringing a new life into the world!\" She shrugs and goes, \"it's not my first.\" My mouth just hangs open. She  continues on as though unaware of my surprise. \"Yeah, this'll be my fourth.\" I just gape. It may not be that astonishing to Reddit, but keep in mind that this'll be the fourth child of a 22 year old heroin addict. But she just keeps plowing on. \"Yeah, my first daughter was taken by her dad, I don't know where they went. Second kid, stillborn or died soon after birth.\" She grimaces. \"Don't have a kid in your bathtub.\" I just stare in shock. \"Anyway, third kid, he's almost four, he's around here somewhere.\" I gaped, looking like a beaches whale. \"Um. Wow. Okay. That's great.\" I say, while my mind is racing. Third kid=almost four. That means she had to have had him at 18. To have two kids before that?! She must have been pregnant while I was still writing her postcards in junior year of high school! She had to have lied about her entire life to me! And not even mentioned a guy until it was probably her third pregnancy!! I am just in shock. This is crazy. We drop the subject of kids in unspoken agreement that its too awkward. I tentatively ask her if she graduated high school or got her GED. She blushes as shakes her head. Expecting that she lied in her letters, I continue on and tell her that she can get help, care for her kids, get a steady job...and she explodes in my face. Literally. I realize that the entire time, she has been a puppet, hiding the giant green head of a primeval sea serpent under her overlarge and greasy shirt. The Loch Ness Monster rises up out of the floorboards in its full glory , before bending over close to my face and saying, it's colossal eye bigger than my face,\"I don't need your help.

I saw him come inside and he was dressed in what I thought was business attire. He came to the table, we ordered and we started talking. Five minutes into the conversation I realized he kept mentioning god, and then the food came. He pulls a fucking bible out of his coat pocket and starts to say a prayer over the food. He then looks me square in the eye and tells me, oh by the way I've become a mormon. I'm a Bishop in the Mormon faith.

{"body": "I think word-games muddle the issue--i.e. the lines between the labels \"gnostic atheist\" and \"atheist\" and \"agnostic\" are sort of arbitrary. Any reasonable position (including “atheist” positions) on God admits a margin of error. However, it is one thing to admit that there is a possibility (however slight) of a hypothetical A existing; it is quite another thing to turn this into *ambiguity* over whether A exists or not. We can admit that it is technically possible for A to exist, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we should seriously accept A as a contender for “being real” just on the basis of a mere hypothesis. \nIf a stage magician uses sleight-of-hand to \"vanish\" a ping-pong ball, what conclusions can you make from what you perceive? Clearly, you can no longer see the ball. What happened? Sure, one explanation is that the ball is now in a nether dimension, out of phase with reality. It cannot be disproven that this is the case, like you correctly point out. Another theory is that, say, he surreptitiously flicked the ball into his sleeve. It is true that we can't really know either way, but are these two explanations really on equal or comparable footing? If the guy in your neighboring seat asked you, \"so, what do you think happened?\", why will you choose to give him one of the explanations and not the other? Is the nether-dimension theory is as plausible as the ball-in-sleeve theory? If, from the seat behind you, I told you the ball was transported to another dimension, would you believe me? As far as can be humanly observed, the ball is now imperceptible. But why do you (or for that matter, anyone) refrain from believing certain things?\n\nOne of the explanations, though technically possible, would be classified as “absurd”. Sure, maybe the ball is in a nether dimension. You don’t know that it isn’t. Sure, maybe god is just a currently-imperceptible energy form. The real question is not “which way should I stake my absolute trust?”, but “which way do I want to bet?”  The stakes for this bet would be how you live your life.\n\n Which frameworks of reality should you wager on? Which ones should you wager against? Should I dedicate myself to believing that the world is just a computer simulation? I can't prove it either way, but the fact that you and I don't live our lives like Neo, ceaselessly hacking and searching about in the bowels of cyberspace (reddit doesn't count) indicates that neither of us believes in the Matrix hypothesis seriously. Put another way, Neo seriously believes that the Matrix hypothesis (we are living in a computer simulation) is a real contender for an explanation of reality--we do not.\n\nWe're making a judgment is about how plausible or implausible certain explanations are over others. Every one of us makes such judgments everyday in the framework of reality we function using in our lives.\nAtheists (at least, the thoughtful ones), do not deny the existence of God “outright”. All they say is that god (as an “imperceptible” being) is very unlikely—i.e. that it’s implausible to the extent of being absurd. There’s no way we can know, but all we have is the mere hypothesis, and this sort of vague “maybe” that we may be able to detect this currently-undetectable thing. This is not enough to seriously entertain the notion of God, these atheists say. In much the same way we can reject absurdly-implausible hypotheses (especially ones concerning the existence of \"imperceptibles\")— the Loch Ness monster, psychics, and so on, we can reject God as an imperceptible being. \"Rejection\" in this case is not outright denial, but simply wagering heavily against that particular hypothesis. Remember, the stake you're wagering with is how you live your life. \n\nThis \"wager\" business may sound like a really weird way to explain factual claims about reality, but (to me at least) it's just another way of reiterating Voltaire's famous line: “Doubt is uncomfortable, but certainty is absurd”\n\nThere is also another problem with the imperceptible-energy-god claim: Even if we go ahead and assume there is a kind of currently-imperceptible energy, how do you make the argument that this imperceptible energy is “god”? How do you argue that this imperceptible energy has the defining characteristics of what we know of as a “god”? Once again, the mere hypothetical possibility of X isn't enough to make X a serious claim about reality.\n\nedit: grammar", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373685048", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I guess after so long the Hive Mind gets to you, whether you realize it or not.  Anyways sorry for taking up some of your time.

{"body": "Here's one from the 4th. Long read since we were basically drunk from 1pm - 1 am and I was never blacked out so I remember all of it. No tree fiddy, no fresh prince, etc.\n\nI'm at my sister's (A) for summer, and her, her fiancee (C), and a friend of both of them (T) all decide to go to their friends house (O - who happened to still be drunk/hungover from the night before), and they take me along. Another guy (N) lives with O. At the party, two girls also arrive, S and K (get this outta the way - no I don't have sex with one/both, these people are all 10+ years older than me)\n\nSo we get to O's house at around 11 am, and right away we load up 4 [bubba kegs](http://www.blogsmonroe.com/childbirth/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/bubba-keg-240x300.jpg), all have different drinks, beer, vodka, rum, so on and we go to a pool. Keep in mind O and N live at an apartment complex so there are families there while a group of late 20 year olds and one 17 year old (me!) arrive with our bubba kegs full of booze. Anyway we drink and get more loud and annoying, at around 1 pm we're decently drunk at the pool. Some families leave already due to the old frat bros being loud, others leave after they start playing catch in the pool. \n\nAt one point, kids began joining them when they played catch. O *hates* kids, so he starts screwing with them. At one point, one kid, around 7-8 floating on an inner tobe around begins shooting the guys with a squirt gun, so O flips the inner tube over and the kid falls out. But he can't swim, so the mom dives into the pool to rescue the kid. After that we leave.\n\nSo it's around 3 pm and all the guys and S are pretty wasted, me and my sister are half drunk, K hasn't seemed to touch many drinks yet. Eventually the guys begin shooting S with a BB gun, and she gets pissed and goes upstairs to look for another BB gun and instead finds a REAL FUCKING GUN in N's room, but thinks its a BB Gun. She waves it around and threatens to shoot back, and people are going crazy saying its a REAL FUCKING GUN and that she needs to put it down. \n\nAt around 5 pm we go back to the pool and one of O's friends join us, a Mexican (D). And yes the fact he is Mexican does matter, he comes back later. I fall asleep at the pool for 2 hours so I know what happens here. When I wake up, D is gone.\n\nLater on some drunk girl finds the gun again and freaks the fuck out. C sees her, and says she needs to wipe the gun in case someone steals it, uses it in a crime, then finds all our prints on it and we get arrested.\n\nAfter that nothing really that funny happened until around 11 pm at night when after we lit off fireworks. Of course by now we're all wasted. O is blacked out (by like 5 pm too), not sure about the rest. My sister, C, and I weren't blacked out. Basically everyone except my sister and I go to swim, while me and her just talk about college and stuff. Eventually C, N, and S return, while O, T, and K are all in the pool. S goes upstairs and passes out in O's bed. About an hour passes and the 3 still haven't returned, and during this time we keep drinking. My sister falls asleep, and they still haven't came back so we decide that the 3 of us (me, C, and N) will go to the pool to look for them. We get to the pool and no one is there so we start freaking out. By this point, C is convinced D came back, kidnapped everyone and is doing some \"fucking Apache shit\" on them. On the way back him and N talk about \"that fucking Comachee asshole stealing our friends\". I'm in the back trying to remember if he was comachee or apache.  \n\nWhen we return to the apartment, we have more drinks in their honor since we're all convinced they're dead. N starts throwing lettuce EVERYWHERE, and when he hits me he tells me \"man, I could have thrown much worse at you... but I didn't, and you want to know why? It's cause I respect you.\" so then we told each other that we respect each other. We talk a bit about me, my goals, any girls I might find attractive. When we reach that last topic, N is like \"dude, get some 18 year old bitches down here\", and I was like \"man, I totally would but like, I don't know if they'd be willing to drive 2 states right now\". N is disappointed, and then he remembers S passed out upstairs. He starts asking me and C if he pretends to be O, then if we think he'll have a chance wit her. C says \"man, maybe\", so N gets a mask and starts making grunting noises and says \"I'm O babe\" in between them to us. Then he stops and asks if we think he'll have a shot like that. Don't fully remember the next part but we somehow got him to just sleep in his own room.\n\nAnd convinced that \"Apache fucker killed our friends\", me and C finally fall asleep.\n\nWhen we wake up at 8 am, there's T lying right next to us. We get up and T can't even stand on one foot. About 10 minutes later, O comes downstairs, and tells us what happened.\n\nThe pool is closed so they had to hope the fence, and when T did, he landed on his ankle and that's how it was busted. When it was only T, O, and K left at the pool, they started playing chicken. O somehow fell backwards and hit his head against the brick lining a pool during this too, but that isn't vital to the story. Eventually they start making so much noise the complex security comes and kicks them out, O gives them an obviously fake name, so the guard is just like \"I'll just escort you back to your apartment\". So O is like, \"You dipshit, I don't even live here!\", and meanwhile T is sending a text telling D to come pick them up. So in the time it took the guard to kick them out, try to get their information, and for T to limp out (this is how he hurt his foot), D had enough time to get there, and so they all drove away. D took them to his house where they ate, and when he found out T's foot was hurt, he tried using natural medicine on it. Like he straight up starting saying prayers and chanting to \"cure\" the foot. I'm upset I missed that part but it was pretty funny nonetheless.\n\nAnyway... I wrote a lot.

{"body": "This one from yesterday. In the old friend thread.\n\n\n\"Man, my best friend from middle school really fucked up his life.\n\nBack then he was a pretty smart guy, getting all As and Bs in classes. He ended up having to move to another state because of family problems and I fell out of touch with the guy. At first I saw him a couple times a year but by the time we reached the end of high school the only interaction we had was liking each other's facebook statuses. I got bored of facebook eventually and had no idea what was going on in his life by the time I was in college. He didn't never even crossed my mind anymore. \n\nFast forward 5 years. I'm out of college with a great job I love, living in NYC with the girl of my dreams. Out of the blue I get a text from an unknown number. Turns out it was him. He was in NYC for a week and wanted to go out for drinks and catch up. I of course agreed to go out and we made plans to go to a bar a couple of blocks from my place. We get to talking and he reveals how shitty his life had become. During freshman year of college (I was amazed to hear he went to MIT for mechanical engineering) he knocked up the first girl that he had a one night stand with. He begged her to get an abortion or at least put it up for adoption, but she was a religious nut and refused. He was forced to drop out of MIT to get a job working at Walmart full time to raise the kid. After a few years of living this shit life and being forced to marry a girl he didn't love, he came home one day to find that his wife had killed herself. This was less than a year before the day we met up. I was shocked to hear that he was now stuck alone, broke, with a 4 year old daughter named Jennifer. I did what anyone would do and offered to help him out. He looked at me with the most gracious look I have ever seen on someone's face and said something that I will remember for the rest of my life: \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\". It was at that point that I realized my former best friend was a three story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "I always got the 12 pack crayons :/\n\nI remember coloring the same picture as one of my friends, and realized his picture looked a lot better than mine. I thought on and on and on about it. After a couple of days I realized he had WAY more colors than I did.\n\nAfter that day I realized, I ran home from the bus as fast as I could to tell my mom. I asked her if I could buy some new crayons to be \"cool like the other kids\". My mom has always had a phobia of me not fitting in for some reason, but money was tight. I remember her giving me this bittersweet look with a smile she uses when she goes over budget to make my siblings and I happy. \n\nWe drove to the store in our old, beat up car, and when we got there I was so excited to buy my crayons that I ran to the store without my mother. I got lost. An old lady in the store asked if I needed some help with anything, and I quickly said that I needed some new crayons. She laughed the cutest little old lady laugh ever, and handed me a two dollar bill. I found my soon to be crayons, and my mom that was frantically looking for me in the isle. I pick up the crayons and proceed to pay with my mom, and my handy two dollar bill from the old lady, but realize I might not have enough. I ask mom for the money she originally brought for me to spend, and she hands me a dollar and twenty-five cents. \n\nI just know this is enough now!\n\nI hand the cashier lady my crayon pack (32 pack I mind you) and ask her how much the crayons are with utter excitement and the biggest smile I've ever had in my life. \n\n\"Bout tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that was the moment I realized the cashier lady was a 500 foot tall Loch Ness Monster.

{"body": "This happened some time back. I was in 6th grade, I had this friend whom we shall name Buddy. Buddy and I hung out all the time. We did everything together, we were brothers from other mothers. You get the idea. \n\nHe lived about a block away from our house and my school was about 3 blocks away. So most days I walked to his place and we walked to school together. On our way, there was this abandoned house. It had been like that as long as I could remember it. However it was the classical haunted house. Light brown dirt colored,victorian house paint peeling off, windows broken, there even was a dead tree in the front yard with a crow on it. It was perfect. Because it was perfect we wanted to go in and see if it really was haunted.\n\nOn one monday at school we decide to go in the house after school. Man I cannot wait for the school to end. I was nervous and excited and scared all at the same time. I assume Buddy was as well. We go stand in front of the stone fence of the house after school and we look at each other. the rusty metal gates of the house groans with wind. We wait scared and we chicken out.  we tell each other we shall become man on tuesday. \n\nYea right. \n\nWed comes. I insist, having chrome plated balls I persuade buddy to go in with me. we go through the metal gates of the front yard. the crow is on the tree, we slowly walk towards the house, my hands are cold with fear. There are couple of marble steps going up the house to a massive wooden door. It must have been a beautiful home in its prime but it stood dead before us. We hoped it was dead. \n\nWe are now standing in front of the main door. It has a crytal knob, I gently touch the knob and the door opens by itself. It squeaks like a thousand tortured souls. we go inside, there is absolutely nothing interesting. Beer cans, newspapers, I saw a mouse, a ton of bird shit covering the floors. we walk around a bit but greatly disappointed we decide to leave. As we were about to exit Buddy spots a stairwell going down. but after couple of step down there is this brigh green metal door blocking the entrance to the cellar. it does not have a handle but is held with a padlock. I touch the door, its freshly painted and its warm. Buddy says he has an idea. Runs outside gets a big rock and starts hitting the lock. \n\nbam \n\nbam\n\nbam\n\nBAM!! the door opens, and with it a warm putrid smelling air hits us. whatever was down there, it had been there for a long time. I might have chrome plated balls but Buddy has titanium, tungsten alloy. \n\n\"Lets go down\" he says his eyes widened with excitement. I indulge him. Its dark down there, pitch black dark, he goes down first, I am touching the slimy walls with one hand and his shoulder with the other so we wont loose each other. we reach the end of the stairs and he goes straight till we hit a wall, turns left. The idea is to make a circle around the wall and come back up. We are breathing heavily, its warm, humid and slimy. after couple of mins of exploring he discovers another door, closed but not locked. He opens it. Black, cannot see shit. we move on. Another door, and another, and another all the same. \n\nWe reach one more door, he opens that one too. Steps in. Stops. His body starts shaking. He turns around grabs my arm and whispers in my ear. \n\n\"Run\" he says. \"whatever you do just run\"\n\nWe run like the wind. \n\nWe do not talk the rest of the way home. \n\nThurs, I was a bit late for school so i dont wait for him in the morning assuming he already left. But he is not in school. I think nothing of it. \n\nHe is absent again on Friday so I decide to drop by his house to check on him. I knock on his door, his mom opens it. Looks at me with confused eyes, like she has not seen me before. \n\n\"hi mrs Buddy, I wanted to see if Buddy is doing ok he was not in school the last 2 days\"\n\nThe confused look in her eyes intensifies and then she gives me warm smile and she says\n\n\"Arent you a confused young man. See I am not married, I dont have a child named buddy you must have confused me for someone else.\"\n\nSpeechless, my legs weak I walk away. I never see him again. \n\nSometimes though, I have these dreams, we are back in that cellar, we go through each door and we reach the final one, he stops and grabs my arm. But its not a kids arm now. He is a grown man. I can feel his beard stubble as he reaches to whisper in my ear. \n\nHe says\n\"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\" ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373824299", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This was about twenty years ago. There was a kid I taught math to in 7th grade that I'm pretty sure was autistic to some degree, though he was usually just referred to among the faculty as \"off\" back then but that was pretty standard for the times. He had an *unusual* tick (to put it lightly) of making this high-pitched grunt-moan sound resembling a whale that could go on for up to a minute or so whenever he encountered a math problem he didn't know - or was working out for the first time. It wasn't often I heard it however, because he almost always knew the solutions to any problems I posted on the board instantaneously. \n\nHe was like a freaky little foot-tapping, head-bobbing human calculator. Son of a bitch drove me crazy because for every lesson I'd cover he'd be asking questions about collegiate level mathematics I couldn't always answer, without even realizing he was showing off. He honestly just thought it was a simple progression everyone else in the class would want to know about. \n\nNow, as you're probably guessing this kid wasn't the coolest kid in school. For Valentine's day he gave this girl a card with some sort of equation on it - I don't remember the details exactly but I do remember it had something to do with infinity (as in the solution to how long he'd love her). At the end of the school year, on the last day of class he stopped as he was walking out the door and looked at me and said, \"Mr. Baby, I just wanted to let you know...\" Now, I'm preparing for this little sweet kid to tell me how much he appreciated all he'd learned this year, maybe something about how I went the extra mile to challenge him. But instead he said, \"...I just wanted to let you know, you sneezed a total of 87 times in class this year,\" and walked out the door. \n\nI never really had any idea what would become of that kid. I'd hoped he'd do great things in some sort of computer science field perhaps. Well about seven years ago I walked into a McDonald's and my heart just about broke. There he was, standing behind the counter, asking what I'd like today. I made my order and reached for my wallet, but he just stood there staring at me with dead eyes without ever giving me the total so I finally said, \"what do you need?\" He said, \"about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about this time I realized this kid was a 500 foot tall monster from the paleolithic era. \n\nAfter fifteen years of teaching he was probably the most naturally gifted student I'd ever taught. I really wasn't shocked at all to see him doing so well. It's nice to stumble upon a past student and be shockingly surprised.\n\nedit: grammar", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373873507", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 185, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "OK, so this is so wide open in my area as to be most easily summed up as: all of them. That's maybe not *quite* fair, but it's pretty certain you pick up anything fictional on Jacobites (or hell, all of Scottish history), it'll be romanticized and inaccurate.\n\n*Rob Roy* comes to mind, primarily as Sir Walter Scott had a very heavy hand in establishing that Scottish Romanticism that infests basically everything afterward. Now I have to say that I enjoyed *Rob Roy* both times I read it--there's some great observations and one of my favourite (and possibly only) grammatically based insults--but it definitely simplifies the conflict into a Catholic-Protestant one. The highlanders are basically \"noble savages,\" having their own moral code outside the norms expected by English narrator Francis Osbaldistone and generally seen by him as somewhat less, often showing characteristics of the *teuchter* stereotype (think Scottish-style country bumpkin).\n\nSo I don't wind up wandering into novel critique rather than history, I'll also add that Scott's creation of a Scottish culture here sort of filled a void left after the second Jacobite Rising (1745), when various laws functionally outlawed many aspects of Gaelic culture and the later Highland Clearances damaged it further. In other words, there's good mixed in with the bad. Also, before anyone asks, I have see the movie *Rob Roy*, but it was so long ago I couldn't add any useful commentary about it.\n\nDiana Gabaldon's *Outlander* series also deserves mention. To its credit, though, it's NOT intended as historical fiction in spite of what many will tell you--it's more of a historical romance with light sci-fi elements and that's enough to make me forgive a lot of its historical problems. After all, when your main character is a time-travelling WWII nurse who meets the Loch Ness monster, historical accuracy is maybe not high on the list.\n\nOn the other hand, it bugs me to no end that so many people feel that this is a good and accurate description of the culture, language and time period. Highland society is depicted as entirely feudal, when the actual clan system had been fading for nearly a century before the book('s historical section) takes place (some time in the 1740s--You can read more in L. Murray Pittock's *The Myth of the Jacobite Clans*). Jamie, the main highland character, is supposed to be a Gaelic speaker also fluent in English. However, his \"accent\" is Doric. That's maybe more of a linguistic complaint than a historical one, but Doric sounds nothing like a Gaelic accent in English--there are arguments it's a separate language (leaving aside debates of language v. dialect). When he does speak Gaelic, it's clearly been translated with a dictionary and not by a native speaker. I'm sure it's fine if it looks like \"flavouring,\" but it's pretty funny when you understand.\n\nAs for the historic portrayal, she draws straight from Scottish Romanticism, giving her characters clan tartans (not really a thing) and providing very anachronistic medical treatment which is accepted as normal. Early 20th century drugs can be perfectly synthesized from herbal compounds--again, forgivable given the genre of the novel.\n\nThere's also a lot of really interesting stuff about the portrayal of Jacobitism in music, but I'll just post a [PDF](http://ecti.pennpress.org/PennPress/journals/ecti/sampleArticle2.pdf) that gives an excellent run-down of two writers, Robert Burns and Baroness Nairne, since this post is already getting long.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention my annoyance with the title \"Outlander\": supposedly, it's the translation of the Gaelic word *Sassenach*. Unfortunately, a *sassenach* is one from *Sassain*, the Gaelic name of England. So rather than meaning \"foreigner\" or the poetic \"outlander\", it just means \"Englishman.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373905108", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;But you left out a word here: \"believe.\"\n\nMiswording on my part: it should have been \"I believe unicorns do not exist.\" Still has the same meaning.\n\n&gt;In that case, you \"believe that unicorns don't exist\" and you \"don't believe that unicorns exist\" are the same thing.\n\nNo. Saying \"I do not believe X exists\" is not the same as \"I believe X does not exist.\" One is the rejection of the claim that X exists, one is the assertion that X does not exist. They are completely different.\n\n&gt;But the converse does not hold up. You can be unreasonable while still being rational. The difference is that an irrational person unreasonably believes something that is wrong. An unreasonable person believes something that may seem unlikely to be the case, but is not necessarily proven to be incorrect.\n\nThat's just not true. I mean literally almost every sentence in this section is wrong. The two words have the same meaning in the context of the argument: acting or being without reason. If someone has an unreasonable *belief* then their belief is without reason, and is irrational. If they have an irrational belief, then their belief is without reason, and is unreasonable. The converse IS true. Your definition of irrational and unreasonable are not correct at all. Please do not redefine words to suit your needs as it will do nothing but harm your argument.\n\n&gt;It would not be irrational for me to believe a Focus gets better gas mileage unless I would have heard it proven the other way and still stuck in my ways.\n\nAgain: you are wrong. You are believing that the Focus gets better gas mileage for no reason. You have no reason to believe the Focus gets better gas mileage and yet you still believe that it does. This is the most clear-cut example of irrationality that I could ever come up with and yet you deny it is irrational. That being said it is also irrational to believe even if you are given evidence of the contrary. You either do not know what irrationality means or you are trolling. And no that is not an ad hominem.\n\n&gt;but the actual belief of an atheistic person is that no gods exist.\n\nYou're either straw manning or are confusing atheism with its subset \"hard atheism\" (or gnostic atheism). Atheism does not require you to believe that no gods exist, it only requires that you do not have the belief that gods exist. Again the difference may seem subtle, but they are very significant. One is a claim of knowledge, the other is the rejection of a claim of knowledge. Atheism is not a belief system anymore than not playing golf is a sport (yes: humor. But it demonstrates a point).\n\n&gt;I find it unreasonable to reject something because I can't prove it.\n\nThen you find it unreasonable to be a rational human being. You are opening yourself to hold all sorts of unreasonable beliefs. You're opening yourself up to believe in flying reindeer, magical snowmen, boogie monsters, yettis, the Loch Ness monster, ET abductions with subsequent anal probings, all because we can't prove that they do not exist. With that mindset you can believe anything your mind can possibly imagine and consider yourself rational simply because we cannot disprove you. That is irrational. The rational action is disbelief of a claim until proof. If you do not agree with this then I don't what else to say than: you are wrong.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373919418", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh good, I needed a place to get this off my chest. Some shit that went down this past weekend. Not sure how it's going to play out yet. This is going to be long, so apologies in advance.\n\nSo I ran out of weed about a week ago. No biggie. I hit up my guy and let him know I'm looking to reload. He responds with a \"lol finaly pussy\". Not exactly the response I was looking for, but then again this guy is a huge prick that I only put up with because he's the only guy I know that sells weed. I asked if I could stop by that night and he said sure, so after work I drove about 45 minutes out of my way to his place...and it was dark. Rang the doorbell, no one home. Called him up and he answers and says he's at the store and will be home in a second, so I hang around. 5 minutes go by. 10. 15. Finally I call him up again to see if he's almost home, and when he picks up he starts cracking up and calling me a \"dumb bitch\" for believing him and said he won't be back till late. I was pissed but again, I like my weed and he's the only guy I knew with it, so after telling him he's a douchebag I asked if he's still interested in selling to me or not. He unconvincingly apologized and told me to come by the next day. I drove home with the radio off (like you do when you're pissed off and don't want to hear god damn Nicky Minaj belching in your ear).\n\nThe next day I texted to confirm he would be home which he said he would, but once again, after driving 45 minutes out of my way to his place it was dark. I called him up again and this time didn't hold back. I told him he's a god damn asshole and he's going to regret fucking with me. I had no idea how I was going to follow up on that threat...it just sort of came out. I told him to fuck off, hung up, and left.\n\nNow, normally I'm able to let things go pretty easily, but this guy just *pissed me off* and something had to be done. I considered calling the cops on him, but I still wanted weed...and an idea occurred to me: why not steal his shit? I know, I know, it's wrong to do, but what was he going to do - call the cops?\n\nI called up a mutual friend and talked about a bunch of other shit before casually asking if he was going to be seeing the dealer anytime soon, and he said they were going out this weekend. I made up an excuse as to why I couldn't come and changed the topic. I didn't want to dwell on that topic lest he become suspicious.\n\nSaturday night rolls around and I drive out to the guy's house. After driving by to confirm the house was dark, I parked on the next street over and casually walked over. I rang the doorbell, and as expected, no one answered. I walked around back, let myself in through his unlocked patio gate and got my lockpicking tools out. Before you ask - it's just a hobby I picked up for fun. I find locks fascinating. We put so much faith into a 3\" cylinder of metal and it takes almost no skill to learn basic lockpicking. But I digress.\n\nIt took me like 15 goddamn minutes to open the lock because my hands were shaking, but I got it open. This guy doesn't have a security system, if you can believe it, so I knew I'd be fine...but I hid behind some bushes for about 10 minutes just in case he installed one without my knowledge (I was paranoid as fuck). No cops showed, so I went in.\n\nEvery time I've been there to pick up weed, he'd always disappear into his basement and then return with whatever I was buying, so I knew which floor he kept the weed on. I quietly went downstairs, feeling my way down (didn't want to turn on any lights and a flashlight seemed just as bad). Once in the basement - which has no windows - I flipped on a light and began searching. Looked under the couch. Checked some drawers. Opened the closet...and there it was: four 1-pound bags of sweet, sweet marijuana just sitting on the floor on top of some shoes. I hadn't expected this much and only brought a small backpack which could hold one of the packages, but I wanted this guy to lose god damn *everything*. I jammed one of them into my backpack and carried the others upstairs, setting them down right next to the patio door behind a couch. I slipped outside and power-walked to my car (I was in a hurry but thought it'd be suspicious if I just took off running down the street). Dumped the weed in my car under some towels and went back to the house. As I was getting the second one I briefly contemplated just carrying the other packs out in the open but decided to be smart about it and do them one at a time. After coming back for the third one I remembered I had left the light on downstairs, so I went down to turn it off. I don't know why, considering he would figure out he'd been robbed eventually, but it seemed stupid to leave it on. As I was creeping back upstairs, both hands pressed to the walls so I could feel my way, I saw the headlights. A car pulling into the driveway. Fuck.\n\nBy the time I made it to the living room with the weed (and patio door), they were already inside. My dealer, our mutual friend and a few people whose voices I didn't recognize were coming down the hall to the room I was in. I crouched down behind the couch, sweat running down my forehead, two pounds of weed right next to me and freedom an arm's length away. They were laughing and just chatting, no idea that anything was amiss. The couch creaked as two of them sat down and I heard one rummaging around in the kitchen. I heard the dealer ask if anyone wanted a beer. I could have used one right then. Someone asked if he had any green instead and he goes \"fuck yeah I do! One sec\" and walks out of the room. The others are still sitting around chatting not two feet from me. After a moment I hear a muffled \"WHAT THE *FUCK*\" from downstairs. I hear him sprint back upstairs and he busts into the room. \"Someone jacked my shit! I had four god damn *pounds*! What the fuck!\" I briefly considered just bolting - surely he'd search the house now, right? - but thought better of it. One of the girls goes \"so you have no weed at all?\". I assumed the dealer would bitch her out but he just sighed and said he had a little left he could sell her. \"How much? I brought fifty bucks\" she asks. \"I don't have much but...I need about tree fiddy\" he replies. It was at this point I peeked my head around the couch and saw that my dealer was actually an 8-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! Freaked out, I grabbed one last brick of weed and bolted out the door in plain sight of this mighty beast. As I ran down the street, the wind in my face, I felt a deep rumble in the ground as this weed-selling-beast chased me, bellowing out in an inhuman roar, \"Gimme my tree fiddy!'\n\nNaturally I didn't waste any time throwing my car in drive and peeling out of there.\n\nI've been hiding out at a buddy's place smoking this delicious weed trying to figure out what to do now. He doesn't know where I live, thankfully, but who knows what resources a creature like that has at his disposal? \n\n**TLDR: stole a bunch of weed, but I'm not sure I got away with it yet.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373926652", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

He didn't think it was broken either. \n\nNext day, morning comes and I wake up with my wrist still sore. I complain once more telling her how I need to go to the doctor.

{"body": "About 3 years ago, I was assigned a book for school and I decided to go to the library to rent it. It was a couple of blocks away, about a 25 minute walk, so I figured I might also enjoy the day out, maybe get an ice cream on the way back. I got to the library and found the book and just as I was getting ready to check it out, this lady cuts in line in front of me. I wasn't in a hurry so I just let it slip. She hurried out the door with a couple of books when she was finished. I didn't even think of it at the time. When I left the library, I noticed the same woman inside a white minivan. She was looking down at her lap with a worried expression. I shrugged it off and continued my way to a Cold Stone a few minutes away. After crossing the street I noticed out of the corner of my eye, a car inching behind me very slowly. I realized it was the same car from the library. I quickened my pace and the car matched my speed. Now, to get to the ice cream shop, you have to go through a long boulevard, but there's a shorter way through a not very safe neighborhood. It was a stupid desicion to make at the time, but I decided to go that way. As soon as I made a turn, the car sped up and went through the boulevard. I decided there was nothing to worry about and continued on my way. The streets were completely empty. Around five minutes later, I saw the same car speeding up towards me. This is when I got really scared. I froze for a second as to process what this woman was doing, then it clicked. She was going to run me over. I only had a few moments to make a move, so I turned around, ran a little and dove out of the way. The car missed me by a few feet. I got up and just ran without looking back. I got through the neighborhood very quickly and went into a more busy street. I looked behind me and saw the car leave the neighborhood and approach me. I stopped and froze, I just didn't understand anything. The woman pulled up next to the sidewalk I was standing in. I tried to be defiant and strong, but I was very nervous. I attempted to shout \"What do you fucking want?!\". I only managed to whimper, \"What... the fuck.. you want..?\" The woman looked me in the eye and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\nWell, it was about this time I noticed that this woman was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I became enraged and shouted \"God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\"\nIt was a close call, but I'm glad I am alive.\n\n*TL;DR: Woman tries to run me over*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373956844", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

He starts telling me how bad he messed up and how he can’t believe what he’s done and all his stuff, mumbling half of the time.\n\nAfter I got him to calm down his story basically ended up like this.\nHe owns a 2006 mustang, blue, really nice, convertible and everything. He says he was driving it on this particularly long usually empty stretch of road right by our houses. A lot of drag racing goes on down there. He starts explaining how he was “testing how well the traction control worked” going about 60 when a guy just pulls out in front of him. I started to freak out because I thought he was about to tell me he killed someone or something. He says he just clipped the guy like their bumpers just barely touched. But the guy in the other car was PISSED. He was driving a big black Escalade and was telling my friend he was going to have to pay for the damage and swearing at him etc…\n\nNow this was where he needed my help, my friend’s dad is crazy, but he also owns my friends car, so the insurance was in his name. Well my friend knew if his dad found out that would be the end of the mustang so he asks the guy if there was any way he could pay him now so his dad wouldn’t have to find out. The guy actually said yes.\n\nSo I ask my friend “how much do you need?”\n\nAnd he looks me dead in the eye and says \n\n“I need about tree fiddy”\n\nIt was about this time I realized my friend was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era.\n\nGoddamn Loch Ness Monster…\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373957506", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[It Starts with Food] (http://whole9life.com/itstartswithfood/) is a great tool for understanding *how* and *why* food manufactures tweak foods.  \n\nEvolutionarily, we gravitate toward sweet rather than bitter, because very bitter foods can be poisonous.  We like high fat foods because in the Paleolithic era, a human body wasn't on a regular feeding schedule, so the body would save and store fat for future use.  We like salty foods because the minerals help our bodies function and stay hydrated.  \n\nFood manufactures *know this.*  They take sweet foods, and make them **unnaturally** sweet, so it fools our bodies into thinking, \"Holy shit! This is so sweet!  It **must** be good for me!\"  Over time, we get used to the super sweetened foods, and when we eat something *naturally* sweet, it comes no where close to measuring up to the processed sweet foods.  \n\nSame goes for salty foods. \n\nAND, they change it up every few years.  Ever had a candy bar that you enjoyed as a child, and tried it as an adult to find how drastically it has changed (salted nut rolls for me... man they've gone downhill).  It's because new chemical ingredients become available and in order to reduce production cost or enhance artificial flavors, the processor needs to incorporate new ingredients by replacing old ones.  \n\nFriend of mine worked for Pepsi/Kraft for 20+ years, the things she's told me about manufacture of products is spine tingling.

Now, I'm not one to turn down a bet, so in my head I'm trying to figure out the best way to ask her. Then it hits me. I tell my friend \"Alright, wait until she walks by us after she clocks out.\" (By chance, we overheard her ask to go home. Perfect opportunity right?)\n\nSo she gets out of work and starts walking towards the door. I stop her and say, \"hey, can you help me? I think you forgot something when I ordered.\" She says, \"Sure, what can I help you with?\"\n\nThis is when I pull out the pickup line to end all pickup lines. \"Well, the food I ordered looks right, but I was looking at the receipt, and it looks like you forgot to write down your number.\"\n\nShe immediately starts laughing.

{"body": "I'm bored: Mastodon. (only albums, not EPs or compilations)\n\n1. **Leviathan** Leviathan is one of those albums that will go down in metal history. This is one of those albums that is relentless from start to finish, offering outstanding musicianship, songwriting, and just great metal altogether. While Remission had a unique sound to it, Leviathan was the album where Mastodon truly mastered its own sound. Songs like Blood and Thunder, Iron Tusk, and Megalodon offer killer riffs that cannot be forgotten, and Hearts Alive is my favorite Mastodon track to date. Even Joseph Merrick, the instrumental at the end, is unforgettable. This album IS Mastodon.\n\n2. **Blood Mountain** How did Mastodon follow up their masterpiece Leviathan? With their masterpiece Blood Mountain. Blood Mountain offers every stylistic approach that Mastodon has ever taken while remaining awesome from start to finish. Every dynamic is included, from the roaring intensity of The Wolf Is Loose to the psychedelic feel of Sleeping Giant and Pendulous Skin to the inexplicable tracks Siberian Divide and Colony of Birchmen. This album also features Brann's insane drumming, notably on Capillarian Crest. The only reason that this album isn't number 1 is because the dynamic changes are a little more sudden and less graceful than those of Leviathan.\n\n3. **Crack the Skye** I love this album for many reasons. The only thing I don't love about it is the lack of diversity. CtS is a psychadelic, unique, beautiful experience that haunts the listener with a sound never heard before. However, it does not feature many of the Mastodon dynamics that I love so much. Crack the Skye is an absolute masterpiece, but it feels like one long song with the same sound throughout rather than an album full of twists and turns. I love Mastodon's softer songs, but I need some heavy material to remind me that Mastodon is a metal band at heart. Crack the Skye is a beautiful and genius album, but its sound travels in the same direction throughout.\n\n4. **The Hunter** The Hunter has the best production quality and most commercially viable material of any Mastodon album. Many metal listeners hate it because of this. Unlike those \"fans\", I really enjoyed this album. The high points are the beautiful passages found throughout, most notably in The Sparrow. The album also brought an intensity that was missed on Crack the Skye. The low points are the passages that seem to lack ambition. The song I hated most (by far) is Curl of the Burl; it's not a bad song but it is NOT Mastodon. Other songs were perfectly fine but just seemed unimportant and rather forgettable. One of the things that I love most about Mastodon is how their albums flow from start to finish effortlessly, and The Hunter seemed more like a collection of different songs, some of them being a little unforgettable. I really liked the album, but I would never put it on the same level as my top 3.\n\n5. **Remission** Here is Mastodon's rawest and most aggressive album. Remission is also a great album. It is, however, very immature compared with Mastodon's other four albums. The vocals are almost all harsh and are quite amateur compared to those on their next album Leviathan, causing many of the songs to sound the same and become a little redundant. The riffs, however, are just as impressive as those on any other album; March of the Fire Ants actually has my favorite Mastodon riff to date. Mastodon also shows a softer side with songs like Elephant Man, Ol'e Nessie, and Trainwreck that would come to play a critical role in later releases, notably Crack the Skye. Remission is a dark and intense album that is a great listen but sounds quite amateur compared to other Mastodon releases.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374035519", "subreddit": "Metal101", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

On top of all the I was struggling with a heroin addiction problem and required a daily dosage. Anyways, I was friends with my dealer so she was charging me 20-25$ a pop. I worked two day jobs and the grave yard shift at a gas station just to keep up with my bills and drug addiction. I lived on the edge of my life for nearly 3 years, often skipping meals for 2-3 days just to get a fix. At my very bottom of my life, I was begging my dealer to give me just enough so I don't get the usual symptoms of withdraw so I could actually work and pay my bills. Being a nice dealer, she kept giving me what I needed but she said she'd expect me to pay her back. This goes on for 4-5 months and one day she decided to ask me for a favor. She said her father just passed away and needed extra money for a funeral so she wanted me to pay her back.\n\nAt this point I had no money, living out of my truck, and eating less than a meal every two days. I told her I had absolutely no money and I couldn't pay her back a cent of what I owed her.\n\nThat's when she came with the offer. She said I didn't have to, and all she needed was a favor. One of her wealthier clients was looking to get laid and willing to pay big, I'm talking about 10-15 big ones, just for a night. She even said I could get a cut being how much this client was willing to pay, so I accepted. \n\nMy dealer tells me to meet her at a bar to meet this girl before we get things hot and bothered. At this point, I was excited being that I was being paid to fuck a girl. \n\nI was fucking wrong.\n\nI was outside of the bar waiting for my dealer to show up and eventually she did. We waited outside when her client decided to show up. Holy shit. This was one of the largest girls I ever seen with my own eyes. I could see sweat stains on her tank top and her stomach had enough rolls to feed a small African village. \n\nAt this point, I quietly pulled my dealer aside to yell at her for not giving me a warning that I was fucking a whale. She begged me to do it because none of her other clients were willing to. Being me and needing money, I asked her how much my cut of the 10 grand, the whale was paying, would I be getting. She said tree-fiddy and that's when I realized my dealer had turned into a 500 year old loch ness monster from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374049443", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

One never thinks that they'll come home and sit back on their couch, only to be surprised by a sadistic monster with a knife.

Scared as hell or not, he would have to try.  \n\n\nHe bit his fist as he rolled onto his stomach, feeling the warm stickiness of his blood as he rolled in the large puddle of it.  He bit his fist, trying to keep himself from screaming as his wounds were pressed against the floor.  \n\n\nThis was going to hurt.  \n\n\nHe whimpered quietly as he got to his knees and began to crawl to the back door, leaving two smears of blood on the carpet as his knees dragged.

In modern society you don't need good eyesight to hunt for hot pockets at the supermarket, and regardless we now have eye glasses, contact lenses, laser vision correction, and cornea transplants. Thus, calling a mutation that leads to poor eyesight deleterious today is WRONG.\n\nA mutation is only deleterious if it negatively impacts the affected organisms chance to reproduce. Poor eyesight USED TO BE deleterious, it is not any longer.\n\nThis is the problem with your argument, you don't know how to properly determine if a mutation is benign or if it is harmful. In the evolutionary sense, the only one that matters to this discussion, a mutation is not harmful just because we don't like it or it negatively impacts our quality of life... the process of evolution does not care about our quality of life, it only cares about our likelihood to reproduce.\n\nThis has all been said, and I don't know why you insist on duplicating our previous conversation here when YOU linked to it earlier in this thread.\n\n&gt;specific code with random noise\n\nToday's \"specific code\" was yesterdays \"random noise\"... Despite being able to adequetely discuss these concepts you still seem to have some serious misconceptions about various aspects of evolution.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374066457", "subreddit": "ChristianCreationists", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

If you did that, it would only require about a third the accumulator coil diameter compared to stainless steel or aluminum, and it won't react violently (in terms of gallium/mercury corrosion of stainless steel) with the printed accumulator cage (or aluminum, as I suggested earlier) like it would with a simple steel plate.

But she always essentially froze when it came time to start taking off our clothes. \n\nI would ask her if she was OK, by this time I could see tears starting to form in her eyes...she'd always whisper \"yeah\", then head off to the bathroom for a few minutes.

One night, after we had gone out for a nice dinner, we headed back to her place and things started to progress like they had countless times before.\n\nBut this time, I wasn't going to go down the same path again.

{"body": "My wife once told me about a pap smear she had.\n\nThis was a few months ago. She had to go get a pap for some reason. Anyways, she's having a tough time finding a doctor who has an opening when she's free. After calling about 10 different doctors, she finally finds one with an available appointment slot. She, of course, takes it. \n\nAppointment time rolls around and she's getting a little nervous. This is her first time with this doctor and she's insanely shy,so she starts to get a little freaked out. The nurse comes into the waiting room and calls her name. She's then escorted down the hallway to her exam room. I guess the nurse can tell that she's nervous so she's doing her best to calm her. The nurse tells her that this is a great doctor, he's been doing these for years, etc., etc.\n\nOnce they get to the exam room, the nurse gives my wife some privacy so she can put on the gown. After about 5 minutes, the doctor comes in and starts making small talk with her, trying to ease her nerves. It's not doing much for her, but she appreciates the effort.\n\nSo, he's there, making small talk with my wife and gradually she's starting to loosen up. So the doctor proceeds with the exam. All is going pretty well...as well as it can anyways. \n\nAfter all is said and done, the doctor stands up and starts joking with my wife...I guess to try to ease the tension. He then tells my wife that he needs a favor from her. This is kind of surprising for her, why would he ask her for a favor??? Nervously, she says \"OK??\". The the doctor said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" Well according to my wife, it was at that time that she noticed that this was not, in fact, a doctor, but a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era. So, my wife quickly got dressed and beat a hasty retreat from that office.\n\nShe has since filed charges.  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374174781", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Lic---what? Everything is so stuffy, you can barely make out what he's saying, but he keeps gesturing at the scanner and looking at you like you're some hooligan.

Again, he insists \"License, PLEASE!\" okay, okay, your brain is fumbling as are your hands to retrieve the forsaken plastic card for this increasingly angry cashier who doesn't seem to understand how desperate you are to collapse... maybe choke down some chicken broth, that is, if you're able. Your brain is nowhere near fully cognitively functioning as you rummage through your pockets like your hands are afflicted by tardive dyskinesia. you find something there, and thrust it awkwardly towards him, your arm dropping before it reaches the counter. \"That's your library card, sir\". Too many words for your poor sickened body and brain to process. you stare blankly at the cashier, obviously something is wrong, so you must once more into the pockets, trying to find your wallet or this card. finally, in your sickened stupor you realize, you didn't bring it-- you just grabbed the cash that was in the valet on your way out. No medicine for you. You fall to the floor of the pharmacy, defeated. Crying, you try to explain to the mean man that you just want to feel better. He takes pity on you and decides you aren't a junkie, so he won't call the authorities, but \"sorry son, can't sell it to you without your card\". Hope of recovery, even just an alleviation of your symptoms, just out of grasp, slipping away, forbidden, Soup-Nazi'd. You turn to the door, back into the streets. The people behind try to remind you to retrieve your cash, but you can't be bothered with such trivial things right now. All your strength and effort is focused on making it back to your bed. There's no energy to return to the store a second time, you'll simply have to wait until you have accumulated enough strength to try again. this time, with the damn card. \n\nyou of course then realize that the money you gave to the cashier for the syrup was exactly *tree fiddy*. just kidding. but still. druggies make life hard for the rest of us.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374288414", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Those that tried to give hints to you were slowly removed from existence, but they knew what they had signed up for. Wave after wave of extras in your life have tried to warn you about the impending doom that you are about to face, however, the people with true input in your life were not the ones to reveal anything. These people (Very talented actors with their families lives being threatened) refused to tell you about this. I have slowly wormed my way up the ranks, becoming someone that you may finally listen to, in order to tell you this.\n\nHe first approached me after I had a run in with the police. We were cellmates, I was in for laundering. He wouldn't tell me why he was there. He explained his plan to me. A specific person (you) had wound up on the wrong side of him, and he needed my help in order to get his revenge. He claimed that I had lied through my teeth to the guards about the cocaine I had been stashing, but it was convincing, and he thought that I had talent in making people believe me. \n\nHe took me to a warehouse. I have no idea how I got there, or out of prison for that matter, but he had a lot of tricks up his sleeve. He showed me his machine, similar to the augmented reality games on the sims, but with hundreds of wires sprouting out of it, connecting to various pieces of equipment. A person, (sitting on a chair, badly beaten) was hooked up to the machine. He explained to me how the machine worked. The person hooked up to it was in a trance like state, unable to leave, not knowing he was even in there. We, on the other hand, were able to come and go as we pleased. He had worked out a previous life for this person, but had also planned out the rest of their life.\n\nHe was a very manipulating man, hence I finally agreed to help him with his plan. Now, I know you have no recollection of the events I am talking about, so you have to ask yourself one question. Do you want to leave? You have a family In here. You have friends that adore you and this is how you have lived your life. But this is all fake.

I managed to find out how to get out of it, knowledge which I will now share with you, but fist let me explain how I came across this knowledge.\n\nI approached the man, the look he shone me was enough to let me know that I had to do this, for your sake. \"Hey, Zaintly\" He shouted toward me, \"We have a big plan for Panda tomorrow, and I'm gonna need some help.\"\n\n\"LOOK!\" I shouted, \"This is the last thing, after this I quit, this is inhumane and I don't want to help you anymore you sick freak!\"\n\nHe nodded towards my station, the place where my AR helmet was placed. I stared at the picture of my family before finally giving in.\n\n\"Fine,\" I muttered \"What do you need?\"\n\n\"About tree fiddy,\" he laughed.\n\nIt was at this point that I realized that the man was was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

Very odd, no doubt, especially as on the days she was off, she was raiding hardcore.\n\nA bunch of crap ensued, and one day she was off, so I came home early with tasty treats for her, only to see another car in our driveway, and the sounds of sex going on upstairs.\n\nWe lived in a three-story townhouse where the bedrooms where on the top floor, and the living room was on the second, so I poured a glass of whiskey (Glenlivet 18) and sat there, with one of our two cats curled up on the headrest behind my head and one on my lap.\n\nAfter about thirty minutes of petting the pussy, he came downstairs, fully dressed, and saw me sitting there, in the chair, bladed weapons nearby on her desk, and very calmly walked out the front door quietly, started his car, and drove off.\n\nShe came down shortly thereafter, yelling about how he didn't bring her a snack like she'd asked, and blanched bone white when she saw me. I told her to go upstairs, get dressed, and get out.\n\nA few minutes later, she came down fully dressed.\n\n\"I've called you a cab.

Oh god what if I'm in England, where the hell is my car?\" To explain I had just watched monsters inc and thought I walked through one of those doors.

{"body": "A couple years ago, I had a girlfriend who was very interesting. She was really into fish life, and would always go on trips to different lakes, she didn't like oceans, too much salt she said. She also would randomly ask me for this very precise amount of money, which I would always answer the same way. It was one of those things that I liked about her, that I knew she would do it, but not when. Anyways, we weren't too close, she didn't invite me on her trips, said she needed to be alone for them. I didn't think too much about it, I was dealing with multiple jobs at the time and didn't have time to go anyways. I never paid for her trips, she saved money from her job at the aquarium to pay for it, so when she did go, it didn't bother me. We would skype and text each other when she went, so we could at least talk, but I always felt something was off. I planned a surprise for her, but the first step was to discover what she did on her trips. This was relatively easy as we had a mutual friend who would tell me anything, and she would tell her anything. Once I had learned she was heading out to Scotland for her next trip, I purchased a ticket and headed out a day after her. To help me track her down, I installed a tracker in her phone, with help from a friend, and was able to find out she was staying at some house in the Scottish Highlands. My plan was to surprise her in the house she was staying at with the car I had been saving for, a old 66' Mustang, her favorite car. I arrived at the house, with a bouquet of flowers and a bottle of nice wine, and noticed the door was open. Now I didn't understand if that was a Scottish thing or her just being lazy, but I continued in. The first thing that I noticed was the fishy smell, something wasn't right, and I was correct. Turning the corner, what I saw I almost could't comprehend. She was laying in bed, completely naked, on top of some random guy. I was surprised to say the least, I didn't get mad, I didn't beat the living shit out of the guy, all I did was stand in the doorway, in disbelief. When she finally noticed me, she didn't make any move to cover herself, she just looked at me, tilted her head back and let out the loudest screech I've ever heard. And it was around this point, that I realized my fish loving girlfriend, was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.\n\n**GOD DAMMIT LOCH NESS MONSTER, I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374384148", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So I'd been talking to this one girl for a while, we started dating shortly after prom (we didn't go to prom together though, she went with her then-boyfriend) we were also both 16 at the time. About 2 weeks into our relationship she started giving me mixed signals. For one moment she seemed horny as hell and wanted to have sex with me. Then the next moment she would be all timid and just want to talk about things. I don't know. Anyway, about a month and a half into our relationship one day she said lets just skip the talking. I knew her mom took her sister to some night dance class, so she wouldn't be there, and her dad was working. I had a hunch I would be 'getting it'. So we kissed for about 3 minutes, it was getting pretty hot, sort of awkward though because I didn't really know what to do after all the kissing. Then she slowly took off my shirt and I took of her shirt and she started smiling at me. She left her bra on though. We started laying back on the bed staring in each others eyes. But before we did anything else I politely asked her, \"is there anything you need before we start, babe?\". \"I'll need about tree fiddy.\" It was then I realized she wasn't my girlfriend at all! She was actually a 7 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"you aint bout get no tree fiddy\", and I just grabbed my shirt and stormed off, I was pretty pissed.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374453068", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 362, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I discovered a horrific family secret. More specifically, about my dad\n\nIt was about 4 years ago, I came over to visit, and he was acting very strange...wouldn't really look at me, avoiding me, etc. Since we were always really close, it worried me a bit. I asked my mom but she said that she couldn't tell that anything was wrong. I also noticed that, even though he enjoyed fishing his entire life, his poles were in the garage, unused for probably a year or two. \n\nAnyway, because my mom made a really good dinner and I ate too much, I was really tired so I decided to take a nap afterwards. I woke up, and the house was completely dark. I did my rounds, made sure that all the windows were closed, doors were locked, etc. Everything was fine, so I went in to check on my parents. My mom was sound asleep, but my dad's side of the bed was empty. I figured he had gone to the bathroom, but I checked there too and he still wasn't there. This made me worry even more, coupled with his strange behavior, this wasn't like him at all.\n\nAt this point, I'm too upset to sleep, so I keep looking for him. The house was pretty big, so it took a while. The garage, nothing. The den, nothing. He wasn't in the attic (but a doll was, scared the hell out of me) so I decided to check the basement.\n\nAs I walked towards the basement door (it was at the end of a long, scary-at-nighttime hallway) I could have sworn that it was getting colder. I figured it was the poor circulation from the AC, it was always giving them problems when they used it more than a few hours a day. I cracked open the door, and didn't hear anything, but I saw a small light. It wasn't a steady light from a bulb, it was from a candle, which confused me even more because dad hated candles...he said they were too messy. Anyway, I start walking down the stairs, and he's still not freaking there! There's just a single candle burning on a table in the middle of the room in the basement. I walked up to it, and immediately started freaking out.\n\nThere were all kinds of crazy and archaic symbols etched into the table, and there were puddles of wax everywhere. I have no idea what to do, so I turn around to run upstairs and my dad is RIGHT freaking behind me. He grabs me by the arm and shoves me to the ground. I'm shocked because he was never very strong, but then I look up. He's wearing a hooded robe, and half of his face is horribly burned. He starts making this croaking noise at me, then points to me his old, boney hand.\n\n\"You've seen too much!\" he screams at me. I'm almost in tears at this point. I can barely breathe, but I manage to respond. \n\n\"You're not my dad! WHO ARE YOU?!\" I yell at him. He doesn't acknowledge that I said anything...just walks towards me with his finger ready to jab me in the face. He starts making a hissing noise\n\n\"I NEED...\" he bellows at me. \"I NEED...\"\n\nAt this point, I lose my composure and start to cry\n\n\"WHAT DO YOU NEED?!\" I scream at him\n\n\"I NEED...about tree fiddy\"\n\nThat's when I saw that my dad wasn't my dad, but a 8-story tall dinosaur from the paleolithic era.

Very few of them report their attackers because they feel ashamed,  because they think that people won't believe them, and because others (redditors included) judge them *really fucking harshly,* especially if the press is involved. This lets the small portion of people who are rapists continue raping people. This is the current state of things, full stop.\n\nHell, of the ten or so girls in my college friend group, two of them have *admitted* to being sexually assaulted while in college, and the number could be higher. An ex-girlfriend of mine was sexually assaulted shortly before we started dating, and she never told a soul. Sexual assault is a problem that the fucking reddit circlejerk doesn't want to believe exists. I'm not talking about some sort of theoretical, philosophical bullshit situation; the truth is that someone you know has probably been sexually assaulted, and probably hasn't told you about it because they feel pressured into keeping it a secret.\n\nThis article doesn't have the best reporting in the world by a long stretch. Yes, the article really blows, and yes, they chose a really strange case to examine. But I've had it up to here, reddit. Knock it off with your constant doubt of victims. Victims aren't claiming to have seen the Loch Ness Monster, they claimed to have been raped. One of these two things happens all the time.\n\nI've had a great few months on reddit, but this shit has gotten old, guys. So fuck it, I think I'll just stick to /r/aww or something from now on.\n\nEdit: murphymc rightly called me out on having no sources for my \"very high number.\" I'm on my phone, otherwise I'd link, but look for his comment below to see a few citations. \n\nEdit 2: some really interesting and well-cited discussion has come up about men being raped.

If our question is (and this is important to keep in mind) what does the audience respond to most, in a violin concerto and in a Madonna song, let's be real, it's a violin and Madonna. Not that the rest of the music isn't important. It's all apiece, but there's an emphasis on one particular instrument that you can't really deny. \n\n&gt;More arrogance. Strictly vocal music has been popular for 100 years or less. Instrumental music is a timeless tradition that's been popular worldwide for over 1,000 years. You hang out in a circle that values vocal pop music and that's cool but it's hardly 'broadly more popular.' More people on earth would recognize the names of classical composers than would recognize any given pop artist. It's just not popular in the ways you'd think.\n\nYou're really quite wrong here.

You're talking about only a version of western classical music on the one hand and recording technology on the other. \n\nAlso, there is just no way that right now western classical music is more popular worldwide than western pop.

{"body": "&gt; I don't mean to generalize but basically what athiesm comes down to is saying that there is no way there is any sort of being(s) that have any effect on us as humans.\n\n\nActually, atheism simply means : *Atheism, from the Greek ἄθεος (atheos), is defined as \"The theory or belief that God does not exist.\"* No more, no less. In regards to your comment, it means there are no God-like beings to HAVE an effect on us.\n\n\n&gt; I think it is silly because there is no such thing as absolute truth\n\n\nOf course not, which is why agnosticism should be the default world view, right? Heck, how do I even KNOW the sky is blue? I could be agnostic about that too. But not exactly. Because people believe things that are generally apparent to them as facts. And things that you and I observe to be true, are as true as they get. We cant for certain KNOW we arent brains in a vat, but for all intensive purposes we assume to our greatest confidence that we arent. So that means we should probably go ahead and pick something to believe that we find as close to truth as possible, right? So what exactly is silly about claiming atheism as true, yet claiming any other religion as true is not as silly? Wouldn't all claims be silly because nothing is concrete? \n\n\n&gt; I feel as though a lot of athiests (myself in the past included) like to use the \"look at the universe and tell me there is a god watching you maturbate\" thing.\n\n\nI don't really know what you mean here. You're saying you used to say 'because we can't observe it, it musn't be true' before? Or what?\n\n\n&gt; This example is looking the god issue far too narrowly because in my opinion god (or spirits or life stream ect) doesn't care about us but we, just like all living matter , play an integral part in the shaping our universe through energy and all that jazz but nevertheless I feel as though the fact we have conscious thought and the ability to reason is something so rare there is something going on behind the scenes. \n\n\nThis is what is called the god gap. Where science doesn't explain things, we fill the unknown with the supernatural. This is similar to how ancient humans explained the weather and sickness by saying the weather gods caused rain and sickness was caused by demons because they had no other explaination. Same with many other things religion has claimed to play a part in, such as creationism, and then science stepped in and explained it. If you think that consciousness is inexplainable, do you believe that science will never be able to explain it? They're learning more and more about the brain every day, why would consciousness escape that? I read up about consciousness because I'm interested in the philosophy of mind and there is a suprising amount of information available on the subject because research is being done on this exciting and complex topic.\n\n\n&gt; And as for faith things like say your mother has lung cancer no amount of logic and reasoning will help settle your mind\n\n\nSettle your mind about what... Her being okay? Why do you need to 'believe' she'll be okay if you have reason to believe that cancer is a very fatal illness and modern medicine hasn't caught up with it yet? You're using reasoning to assess the likeliness of the situation, not faith. That's like saying \"I'll have faith I'll get over this cold\" when we know that most colds aren't fatal. Same with cancer. We know our mind won't be settled, because cancer is serious.\n\n\nAlso, I think you're confusing faith with hope. You can *hope* something will be released lol. But I think that's a side topic, I really haven't looked up the definition but we can :P\n\n\n&gt; And I didn't mean athiests are boring but if everyone has the same athiest mind set, conversations such as this would be few and far; and I like arguing with people way too much to live in a world like that haha\n\n\nBut why do we have to waste our time with these conversations? Imagine if you had to sit there and try to explain to the whole world that santa clause isn't real. Then do the same thing with the tooth fairy, then nessie, then Dracula. Yeah, it's a diverse view to debate, but it isn't productive. You can just go debate with children about why monsters don't exist; kids will always believe in things that aren't there and there isn't really a way to disprove them so you'll be arguing forever.  \n\n\nBut sure! Less atheism, more wiccan! more voodoo! More people who believe in Zues, Satan, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and in the boogeyman! Would you really like to have more conversations with people like that? Just add more to the mix! If you really do like 'arguing' with people, I question why you do it. I do it because I feel like what I say is true. But you seem to want to argue for the sake of arguing. Why doesn't it bother you that your truth won't be heard and there will be perpetual disagreement on an apparent truth for you? I mean, let's go back to animal cruelty. It's a diverse opinion. I'd hope you think it's an abomination. Would you really want to spend all day arguing to the diverse reasons why it's okay, instead of having a community that can move on with their lives and spend their time doing more important and productive things without disagreeing on apparent truths?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374684746", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

That's the exact same kind of evidence there is for the Loch Ness Monster.  We should have something by now. It's one thing to keep discovering new species of insects and critters -- they're smaller, look pretty similar to other species we've already found, and we're *not actively looking for them.* The closest we've come to discovering a sasquatch-type animal in American woods is a black bear. I'd love for bigfoot to be real, but at this point, I gotta go with my reasoning and say it just ain't so.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374741501", "subreddit": "JoeRogan", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I went to get a blanket to 'eat popcorn on' and my gf's mom was pretty suspicious, but she didn't make a fuss. So anyway things start getting intense, some clothes came off, couple of noises, all good fun until we hear steps coming down the hall. In 3 seconds I manage to get my pants back on, pull my gf's shirt back down, and buckle my belt. All without making a noise. All this only a few minutes after the initial suspicion her mom showed. \nShe poked her head around the corner and asked if we were ok and if we wanted anything from McDonald's, no course not, we have popcorn, blah blah blah. My gf was so mad at her mom, \"what do you want?\" In the meanest tone I've ever heard her use. Her mom says \"nothing\" and promptly goes back to the front room. Seconds later gf's mom pops back into the room and says \"actually I need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time I notice my gf's mom was actually a 500ft tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era.\n\n**TL;DR:** read the damn story", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374746534", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

For much of the rest of the morning, I watched my friends get on rides while I was incapacitated. My friends commented that I should have eaten more for breakfast, so I have a nice lunch with another group to calm my queasiness.\n\nBeing sick kind of psyched me out though. After lunch, I continued to watch my friends ride roller coasters from the sidelines. We did go see a show or two before we came to a ride called Loch Ness Monster.\n\nEveryone, including me, went in this time. I was a little nervous but felt better after the Celtic show we saw. The group (there was six of us) realized we needed to hang back in line so we can all ride at the same time. Me and another guy misjudged our position badly and ended up in front of everyone else.\n\nThe coaster eased its way in. A single dude got on and there was an open spot next to him. Me and my friend were next but there was only one seat. Everyone else in the group were waiting for the next go round. I gauged the situation and got on.\n\nI sat in the only open spot, knowing I would ride without my friends. But I felt I needed to conquer this false fear. So the coaster rolled away and I'm sitting next to this stranger who is in his early thirties. I enjoyed myself on the ride and as we were getting off, I mention to the guy, \"That was fun.\" He agreed and we went our separate ways.\n\nSpent the rest of the day actually having fun again.

{"body": "My best story has to be when I almost killed myself. (Not intentionally) I was 15 and snowboarding in Aspen Colorado. I had been snowboarding for awhile and was carving down the mountain faster than I ever had before. Anyone who has ever snowboarded before can associate the dread that comes with catching the front edge of the board in the snow. Well, I caught my front edge and impacted the ground with the left part of my ribcage. It didn't hurt all that bad right away. I pretty much felt like I simply knocked tbe wind out of myself. So after a couple minutes I stood up and boarded maybr 30 yards until I was too dizzy to stand up much less board. About that time a man who was an ex EMT had stopped by since he saw me crash going up the  ski lift. After that I vomited worse than ever before, blood and cheeseburger are what came out. By now my abdominal area is starting to hurt pretty badly and ski patrol had arrived. They put me in a sled and took me to a waiting ambulance and off to the hospital I went. After a short time i heard a doctor call my mom and I was off to the MRI/CAT scan machine. Doctor calls my mother again and by that time as the doctor explained blood was leeking into my diaphram. FUCK CHILDBIRTH! Blood in your diaphram is the worst pain I have ever felt. It feels like there are ninjas slicing your lungs out every time you breath! A bit after that passed out. I awoke to my parents sitting by my bed. I looked at them and leaned in close as I whispered \"you got tree fiddy?\"\n\nSeriously though I fucked up most of my abdomen in that crash. My entire left side was bruised along with my ribs. My left lung had been completely collapsed. I had torn  my pancreas and bruised my liver. To top it off my spleen was completely ruptured and had to be removed. I have a scar from my belly button up to my sternum. The surgeon straight up told me thst if I had not been in super awesome shape( because freestyle wrestling rocks) like I was, I would not have made it through the surgery. I couldn't eat for 3days, no school for a month, and no contact sports for a year.\n\nTL;DR I am The Spleenless Wonder!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374819572", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Now, this was not the first time I had ever been spoken to about my car, but it isn't a regular everyday occurance, and I love talking to people about my car. The man walks slowly around the car, asking an occasional question and offering up kind compliments. After the guy was done Investigating/admiring my car, he finally decides that it is time for him to be on his way. But, just as he opens his car door, he spots the manufacturers stickers (VIN, SLP parts codes, etc) on my door and quickly bolts back to the drivers side door of the car. \"Are...are these ORIGINAL?\", he asks me, his eyes full of wonderment and awe. \"Yes sir, they are\", I respond, slightly bewildered. Then, he reaches out his hand to touch these stickers. The touch quickly turned into more of a pet (think what you do to a dog), and soft moans soon accompanied. These moans rose in intensity and volume until he let out a deep breath and... just walked back to his car and drove off, never to be seen again.\n\n**TL;DR** My Camaro got felt up, the loch ness monster doesn't come at the end of this story", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374822756", "subreddit": "cars", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I'm 20 at the time and back home on leave right after my deployment.  I go to the local bar and grab a couple drinks (family friend owns the bar, so I'm cool with the bartenders) and start walking home....\n\nStory: I seemed to have gone out the bar and taken the wrong way and went over the bridge to a completely different part of town from which I live.  (remember, I had beer for the first time in 8 months at this point, so I'm pretty fucked...).  I keep walking because I don't know any better.  There's these two girls walking towards me and I try to play it cool.  As I get nearer and nearer, I think to myself \"I'm just gonna steal one of them...it'll be smooth as fuck.\"\n\nI get right next to them, grab one of their hands, and continue walking.  She doesn't struggle, scream, fight, or anything.  She just turns around and walks with me.  I have this huge smile on my face at this point.  About 10 steps behind us in the opposite direction, the other girl yells \"Hey _______, I'll just pick you up tomorrow!  Have a good night!\"  The girl I'm walking with says \"OK!\"\n\nWe keep walking, and she tells me her name is...let's say Harley.  I introduce myself as Josh.  She asks what I do and I tell her I work as a contractor for the Government.  I then ask what she does, and she says, of all thing, she's a drifter.  I shrug it off as \"Eh, that's cool.  Where you headin?\"  \"I'm actually heading to Colorado!\"  she says.  \"But, I'm strapped for cash\"\n\nI kinda wanted sex...(8 months without it) so I gave her a proposal.  I offered her money for the sexy times. (verbatim, might I add).  So, we haul off behind a Haverty's Furniture store and go at it for what seemed like 2 hours.  When I finished, all she said was \"That'll be tree fiddy.\"  I said...\"GOD DAMMIT LOCHNESS MONSTA!

{"body": "I was about 20 when this happened, I wasn't attending college or any type of school at the time and was still living with my parents. So I needed to get out a little and find a job, to give my parents some money for letting me stay at their place for a little bit longer. The local gas station hired me and I was stoked because I didn't think I could find a job. But I guess they hire anybody.\n\nAbout 3 weeks in there was a new girl working there as a cashier. I was a cashier too, so I figured we would get to know each other eventually. We chatted up everyday at work for the next couple weeks, I honestly didn't think about having a relationship with her, she never talked about her boyfriend though. Which I figured she would have one because she was fairly attractive. Anyway, one day before closing time she asked if I wanted to go outside and smoke with her. I don't smoke but I took the offer anyway, just to chat with her I guess. As we were talking she told me about how her ex-boyfriend mistreated her, and how her parents never gave her any money to go to college (she was around my age). She started crying on me, I didn't mind, I like to help people out and give support. I asked her if she wanted me to do anything, or if there was anything I could do to make her feel better because she was crying an awful lot. I went in and bought her another pack of smokes, she stopped crying but was still tearing up. Then I asked her if she needed anything else. \"I'll need about tree fiddy.\" It was then I realized she wasn't my co-worker at all! She was actually a 7 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"You aint bout get no tree fiddy.\" I went back in and closed up shop.

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro.\n\nCTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed.\nWait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. *whoosh*.\nSince rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now, so I'll be in my bunk with dat ass. Oh, you! ...now KISS!!!

{"body": "It was a cold, wet Wednesday in the winding suburban sprawl of the greater Los Angeles area. I woke up as I did on any other given day of the week: hung over and pissed off. I slammed the snooze button on the blaring, yellow-green Harpy on my night stand in order to reflect upon the events of the previous night. I remembered a big party. All my friends showed up. There was a group of girls there from my class. We talked to them. Past that, it was a dense haze that I chose to keep out of my mind, for my own benefit. \n\nI drudged out of my dusty bed and headed for the warm aroma of eggs and bacon flooding in from beyond the door, but was interrupted by a shrill ringing in my back pocket. I flipped open my ancient cell phone, and was met with the name of my best friend who was at the party with me last night. I reluctantly pressed \"accept\", and was immediately met with the excited voice of my friend, \"Dude! Wasn't last night THE shit?! Jeez, best night of my life right there! So glad none of the pics landed on Instagram, my dad would've flipped his shit. But dude, really, we gotta do that again soon.\" He was always unreasonably happy, no matter what the circumstances. Maybe the party wasn't so bad, I could've had a decent conversation with those girls; I possibly could have been a decent human being, not a obnoxious, knuckle dragging ass fucker like the last time. I could only hope.\n\nIt only took an hour to be made fully aware of what truly happened the previous night. As I feared, yet expected, I got shit-faced and made an ass of myself to everyone there. My friend was never the most accurate story teller. The best I could do was own up to it and apologize to those girls. In English, one of them sat directly next to me.  I shuffled in past the colossal wall of literature, plopped down my text books, and sat my ass right down. I turned to my right, looked the girl directly in the eyes and breathed out, \"Hey, I'm really sorry about last night. I should've known my limits... Hope there's no hard feelings.\" \n\nShe replied, \"Well maybe I could forgive you if you gave me back my fucking purse...\"\n\nFuck. I didn't know I fucked up that bad. I stole this poor girl's purse. I knew I was a shithead, but I didn't expect myself to be a thief. As I was contemplating some half-assed response to somehow remedy the situation, she interrupted, \"Hey, ya know, there wasn't much in it. It's mainly a fashion thing, ya know? Hell, it was a shitty purse anyway. I only had a few bucks in there that I'll need back.\"\n\n\"Um, sure,\" I uttered, \"How much do you need?\"\n\n\"I had... I dunno... three dollars? Maybe another fifty cents on top, just in case.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I muttered as I reached down for my wallet. When I looked back up, I had a terrible realization. This girl wasn't actually a girl, hell it wasn't even human. It was a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era! I leaped out of my chair as fast as my fat ass could, just as it slammed its giant flipper down at my desk, splintering oak all around the room. Panic soon enveloped the class, and everyone quickly evacuated to evade the monster. As I was crossing the threshold, though, I looked back across my shoulder to see one of my female classmates curled up in the corner screaming for dear life as the gargantuan beast neared her. I sprinted over the wreckage and grabbed her just before the crusty flipper slammed down on her body. I carried her across the campus to get as much distance from the monster as I could, and set her down on the grassy, dew-sprinkled lawn of our establishment. She embraced me, thanking me immensely for saving my life, and from that day forth, we've been going out.\n\nActually, as I was writing this, she texted me and broke up with me. So fuck her. I guess I can't answer OP's question anymore.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374890415", "subreddit": "teenagers", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

So she brought me to the site and nothing too eventful happened. Just some dudes jacking it. So later that night I decided I would do some searching of my own for a cool cam site.

There was this one picture of a girl with her stomach torn open, with all the insides being pulled out. I don't know why I didn't leave then, but I thought it was fake and moved on. I got on to the cam part of the site and saw that there was only a few members online. One struck me, his name was \"Ret Snom Ssenhc Ol\" or something of that nature, something weird. I started a Video chat with him. He was in his mid-fortys, a bit tubby, and a big beard. He noticed that I was young and a small smile grew on his face.  He showed me his collection, Dead cats and dogs piled the room, guts torn and flung about, I about vomited, but I carried on. He showed me dead cat after cat. All getting worse as we went. Finally he mumbled something under his breath, something about how we wanted to have a human to play with. He then left his room, telling me to wait right there. I was trembling at this point, I don't want to know whay he was getting. I moved my mouse to the x button to close it when he popped back on the screen. He asked me \"Hey kid, wanna see something?\"\nI was too afraid to answer.

{"body": "Note: I've bolded all the numbers that I'm working with. Almost none of this information is actually confirmed.\n\nI actually think it depends on how much the game will cost. Based on what I know, newly released Nintendo games tend to cost anywhere from $45 to $60. I'll be optimistic and assume that **SSB4 is going to be $45** at launch. I'm also going to work with the assumptions that **stages cost 50% more than characters**, **songs are worth 5 cents** each, and things like menus and stuff are just recolors of the menus from Brawl or something, making them a gigantic 0% of the game's cost. So far, **13 characters** have been confirmed, which means that there will probably be 13 stages plus two or three extras that are unrelated to any of the characters. For now, though, let's just assume that there are only **13 character stages** so as not to complicate things.\n\nNow, we'll have to add those together to get **26**. \n\nNow we have to go back to songs, which I made the assumption of being 15 cents each. Brawl had 258 songs in it, so let's keep that number SSB4. **5 cents ($0.05) times 258 equals $12.90.**\n\n**45-12.9=32.1**\n\n**32.1/26=1.23461538**\n\n\nGoing back to the assumption that stages are 50% more than characters, we'll have to **take 13 of those and subtract 50% and add 50% to the other 13**. Because this is a business we're talking about, I'm also going to **round up to the next quarter**.\n\n1.23461538-50%=0.61730769 which rounds to **$0.75 per character**.\n\n1.23461538+50%=1.85192307 which rounds to **$2.00 per stage**.\n\nBecause we're Nintendo, that means we're also a company and *that* means that no matter how much we care about our customers (and Nintento *really* cares), our main goal is to make a profit. So, let's **add an extra 25 cents per character ($1), 50 cents per stage ($2.50)** and bundle each DLC character with its respective stage so that **a single DLC pack includes one character and one stage and costs $3.50**. Something something Loch Ness Monster.\n\nNext, let's assume that each DLC pack comes both individually and in bigger bundles with other characters. A pack of two characters (and their stages) should cost $7, but since we're already making A 75 cent profit (more because of our profit based rounding) per character ($1.50 for two), let's lower that to $6 for a profit of 50 cents. It seems like we'll make less, but players will be more willing to by **one two-character pack for $6** than than two one-character packs for $7. The one-character packs will be there for players who buy all the DLC as it comes out or only want specific characters that aren't in the same bundles together.\n\n**TL;DR: $3.50 for one character and stage, $6.00 for two characters and stages bundled together. Based on all this data, does that seem fair?**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374937958", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So this happened in middle school. I was a fairly healthy, active kid, and play injuries requiring minimal amounts of stitches were normal, but I had yet to experience a truly scary health problem until this story transpired. \n\nMiddle-school aged me went to bed with a slight throat ache, but I was exhausted from a day of exploring in the woods. It was mere minutes before I was out-cold and in dreamland. I often had lucid dreams around this time. While in this particular post-hike slumber I had an unforgettably vidid nightmare where I was laying paralyzed in a bathtub. There was warm fog in the bathroom, and the water was slowly filling up around me. As the water began to creep up my body, i began to panic. The water inched up my face until it began to cover my mouth and nose, and as I became submerged the plastic bath tarp dropped from the moorings, covering the surface of the water. I felt myself fading out in my dream, and even though I couldn't move I was in a frenzy fighting as hard as I could to overcome the paralyzing gravity and lift myself out of the bathtub.\n\nI awoke in buckets of hot sweat, clawing for air. I was back in the real world, but it wasn't over. Still in a panic, I was unable to take deep breathes, and still felt as though I was drowning. My neck was swollen and stiff, and I had uncomfortable chest pressure like someone was sitting on my chest. Shaking, I dragged myself out of bed and stumbled to my parents room and within moments we were PJ's bound  to the local hospital. I was really scared.\n\nThe hospital was close, and within 10 minutes of first waking up I'm already in the ER. My blood-oxygen levels are really low, and they immediately put me on an oxygen feed as they run tests. Even though I still felt feeble and couldn't breathe, simply being at the hospital made me feel safer. It was a quick diagnosis. I collapsed a lung in my sleep, and they poked a small hole in my chest cavity to alleviate pressure to try and allow my lung to reflate. It was successful, which spared me from having to have a balloon type device fed down into my lungs. Thank god. The throat and chest pains were pressurized air pockets that formed when air from my lung entered my chest cavity. Surprisingly the effects of the procedure were nearly immediate, and within an hours time having 2 functioning lungs as well as an oxygen feed had me feeling quite normal. I was discharged later that day!\n\nTLDR: Tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374964804", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

It was near the end of the school year.  We were having a field day and the teachers were acting really upset over little things for some reason.  Kids kept getting in trouble left and right.  Well, for one competition, it involved kicking a ball down the hall into a net.  This one poor, little, shy, smart girl kicked the ball and instead of kick it strait.  Kicked it into a teachers face and broke her glasses.  I laughed hard.  Well we both got in serious trouble, she reacted like it was all intentional, and we were bared from the rest of the field day and were ordered to sit in the classroom and write 150 lines.  Mine where something like 'I'm sorry I laughed when Mrs. (not saying) was hit in the face.\"\n\nWell, I had a boner spring, and you know back then, the tend, although starting to fade out, most kids still wore short shorts.  So my 9 year old penis, managed to slip out, and was showing hard as a rock.  I don't know why I got the boner, probably just a narb.  The girl noticed next to me and said 'your penis is showing.'  I was so embarrassed, I tried to tuck it away, but it kept slipping out, I would cram it back into my briefs, it would hurt and strain, and pop back out.  I was almost in tears.  \n\nShe felt bad I think for my situation, she put a hand on my shoulder and  grabbed my other hand and she said, 'Stop, it's ok, I have an older brother, and it does that all the time to him too.'  Then she said, 'He goes to his room and rubs it till it gets small again.  You can, I won't tell.'  \n\nSo, I went to grab my dick and I turned to her and I said 'A sex show will cost you about Tree Fiddy'", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374971159", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I feel almost completely the opposite about it (i.e atheism is the most intelligent position...). My reasoning is that there is no evidence showing gods existence and much evidence indicating flaws/in-discrepancies within many religious texts. Science may not be able to disprove the existence of a deity as it's really not testable/falsifiable but there are many more reasonable/simple explanations for the complexities of life. The possibility of a deity being responsible for the universe seems very far fetched. Belief in religion and the supernatural has been around for a very long time, for example, many primitive cultures believed that lightening was the anger of gods. Obviously we know and understand weather a lot better at this stage but the universe is a big place and there are many things we are yet to understand. What we do know is that attributing things we don't understand to a supernatural force is common; it appears to be a side effect of the way the mind operates and superstition has been observed in many other species. It is much more likely that belief in a deity is produced by the mechanisms by which the brain operates than the knowledge passed down from an actual deity. Atheism is not a belief in anything, it is the **lack** of belief in a deity. Given what we know, I think it is reasonable to lack the belief in a deity, just as it is reasonable to lack belief in the loch ness monster or the abominable snow man. We know that footprints elongate in the snow over time, and that this is what likely resulted in the belief of the abominable snow man. Knowing that footprints could and have been made (and subsequently elongated) by other animals doesn't disprove the abominable snow man. We may not be able to disprove the abominable snow man, by why would one exist? Is is more likely that there is an actual abominable snow man out there, or is it more likely that belief in one is a product of the mechanisms by which the brain operates? It is far more likely that there is no abominable snow man, and wouldn't it be quite the coincidence if there were.

{"body": "To start the season, point guard Derrick Rose still doesn't feel 100% and misses the season opener as the Bulls get blown out by the Miami Heat by 40+ points\n\nFollowing this game, the team's morale greatly goes down, we lose 4 more straight after that and start 0-5. Rose finally comes back but is a shadow of his old self and puts up 9 points and 3 assists as we put the weight on Luol Deng's shoulders to get the team going. \n\nThe extra minutes for Luol lead to his reinjuring of his already notorious wrist ligament and he's out for the next 4 months after surgery.\n\nThrough this 10 game streth, the Bulls only won 2 games and are off to a franchise worst start of 2-13, last place in the Eastern conference. \n\nAt this point Derrick Rose's numbers have gone up a little but his 15-5 averages are not nearly enough to get wins for the team and Carlos Boozer is the lone sliver of offense (Breaking character for a brief moment to express how painful it was to write that). New pick up Mike Dunleavy Jr. is now in the starting line up with the injury of Luol Deng and after Rose's horrendous play and bad shot selection, Thibodeau decides to put in Kirk Hinrich as the starting point guard for his defense. 20 games more with this Hinrich-Butler-Dunleavy-Boozer-Noah line up and the Bulls drop 16 of them, leaving their record at 6-29, still at the bottom of the Eastern conference.\n\nBut wait, just when all hope is lost, Derrick Rose drops 55 points against the Miami Heat as well as putting up a triple double and beat Lebron in double OT. Rose goes on to have a stretch of 11 games with 30+ points and 10+ assists and the Bulls win 10 of those 11, bringing the Bulls to a record of 17-30. Bulls move up to the 12th spot in the East and Luol Deng is on the brink of recovering early. Joakim Noah is playing out of his head and leading all players in the NBA in the month of January with 14.7 rebounds per game. Bulls great play keeps up and their record bolts up to 30-34, on the brink of playoff contention, just below 8th place division rival Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nDerrick Rose leads his team to win 9 more games straight giving the Bulls a 6th seed worthy record of 39-34. Fast forward to April, the Bulls end the season as one of the hottest teams in the NBA and end as the 5 seed with a 43-39 record, squaring up in the first round against division rivals, Indiana Pacers, whom they sweep in 4 games.\n\nDerrick Rose is averaging 35 ppg in the playoffs, the Bulls then beat the Nets in the semi finals in 6 games and face the 2 time defending champs Miami Heat in the conference finals. The games go back and forth but in a thriller game 7 triple OT game, Bulls win on a fluke 3 pointer from Joakim Noah.\n\nBulls now face the surprise Western Conference winners, Golden State Warriors to take on league MVP, Stephen Curry. Derrick Rose is having one of the greatest runs in NBA playoffs history and it was at the tip off of game one that everyone else on the Bulls realized Derrick Rose was actually a 7 story crustacean from the paleolithic era. \n\nBulls went on to get swept in the finals, and Spanish league MVP prospect Nikola Mirotic decides to not play in the NBA.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375023856", "subreddit": "nba", "score": 48, "controversiality": 0}

She was a huge hockey/soccer fan and I was as well and the conversation flowed so well that we lost track of time and she looked at her phone and noticed it was 1:30 am. I drove her home and we spent around 25-30 minutes making out in my car before she opened the car door to leave and get out as she steps out of the car she asks if I want to come inside. At this point I'm ecstatic and I tell her I would love to come inside. She said before I was allowed to come inside that she needed something from me first. I relecutantly replied \"Okay what do you need?\" She says \"She needs about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that my date was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had tricked me again! \"Goddamnit monstah, I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away. The next morning was weird, I was browsing the internet on the Craigslist casual encounters section and I couldn't help but think about my date and how perfect it was, I kept thinking about where I would take her on our next date. I was thinking about taking her to see a hockey game but I wasn't sure if it would be too pricey for a first date or not.\n\n\n**TL;DR: I met the girl of my dreams, the first date went well and we headed back to her place where things got interesting.**", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1375052035", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 259, "controversiality": 0}

I sent out a few messages to all sorts of women ranging from long term relationships to casual encounters. \n\nI eventually got a response back from a girl on casual encounters (wasn't really what I was looking for but a guy needs to get laid), after a few messages she gives me her Skype name and we start to video chat. I was amazed at how seemingly normal she looked,  it defiantly seemed a bit like an interview with all the questions: do you take the initiative sexually, or are you passive. What sexual positions you are comfortable with (and even asked about a few I had to lie my way through and look them up on urban dictionary), and my approximate length and girth (average).\n\nAfter the sexual interview she gives me her address and says to stop by around 9, and to bring some wine. The address she gives me is a trailer park in a shady neighborhood, but fuck it I've seen her and chatted with her already maybe she's stuck in a crappy job and this is what he can afford. Once I get there I'm a little concerned about a bunch of kids toys strewn across the lawn (again I shrug it off, I like kids I this gets serious down the line) and I get enough balls to get out of my car to knock on the front door.\n\nShe opens the door just wearing a open robe revealing her wearing just a bra and panties, I hold up the wine and half mumble \"hey I made it\". I get pulled inside and get told we new to be quiet she just got her kids to sleep, so we crack the wine I brought and after a brief conversation start making out on the couch. We're getting pretty hot and heavy when she suggests we head to the bedroom, she gets a little aggressive and pushes me down onto the bed and drops her robe.

The first week was great but then I met Judy. Judy was an 16yo korean girl with the most beautiful eyes. She was a sweet girl my own age and we hit it off sounds great right? Well lets just say not all was as it seems but I'll get to that later\n\nSo pay day rolls around and all of the counselors are gathered around waiting for their paychecks. I look around and notice Judy is not there, which was strange because she talked all week about how she was going to finally buy a pair of sun glasses. So I get concerned and I text her. Not 30 seconds go by before my phones beeps with her reply. \"I couldn't make it today, we should totally hang out after work though!\". So by now my teenage brain is on cloud nine, a cute girl asking me to hang out 1 on 1 what is this? \n\nSo i get out of camp and drive over to her house, but on the way i get a brilliant idea! Why not show her how much you like her by buying those glasses she wanted? So i take a detour to the local sun glass hut and choose out the pair of aviators she had been talking about all week.  Satisfied i was well on my way to getting laid I drove over to her house anticipating a loving embrace. I get there and knock on her door only to be greeted by her crying. And i don't mean like oh I just stopped crying a little while ago but you can still tell, I'm talking full blown tears streaming down her face blubbering mess. She invites me in apologizing between sobs. I go upstairs to her living room and we sit on her couch. So shes still very upset so i start asking \"are you ok\" \"whats wrong\" etc.   \n\nAfter maybe ten minutes she catches her breath and tells me about how her mom had just been in a car accident and she needed her paycheck to pay for a cab fare to the hospital to see her. Now keep in mind at this point I had just spent the bulk of my money on those damned glasses. Helplessly I show her the glasses and explain why Im broke. To my surprise though she chucks them on the ground! I look at her stunned, I know shes upset but acting like that? \n\nShe jumps up off the couch and goes off \"Why would you do that? I don't need sun glasses I only need one thing!\" \"What\" I ask her bewildered by the sudden change in demeanor. \n\"YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED ASSHOLE\" She screams back\nat this point I am really deeply confused, and am searching for words when she drops it on me \"Im going to need about three fiddy\" \nSo its about that time i realize this lovely korean girl is actually the DAMN LOCH NESS MONSTER \n(Im so sorry) ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375057932", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm going to be honest here. I came here to post a Loch Ness Monsta story, but then i thought better of myself. Anyway, here's the story of a CL hookup that involved my GF and me last year. Things were going great between the two of us, but we had been dating for several years and everything in the bedroom was beginning to feel like watching that movie you love from your childhood. The one where if anyone brings it up, you get excited and nervous inside. You always feel like watching it this time would bring back some of the novelty and you don't remember some parts and hope that will make it more exciting. But then you start watching it and you still love it, but you always know exactly what is going to happen next and it feels like it is losing that charm.\n\nAnyway, one night my GF and I were drinking a little when she suggested that we bring someone else into the bedroom to see if that would help liven things up a bit. We couldn't agree on whether to bring another man or a woman, so we decided to find a couple on CL so that we could try swinging for a night. We contacted several couples and after some image trading, we emailed one of them and set a date. We told them we would meet them at this rather upscale restaurant  in one of the seedier parts of the city.\n\nWhen we met them at the bar, they seemed nice enough and she looked amazing. Let's just say the rack of lamb she ordered complimented her nicely. He was pretty average-looking, but my GF seemed interested. The night was going smoothly until we got the check and the other guy realized that he forgot to bring his wallet with him. His first reaction was to politely ask my GF for some money, but the other woman quickly stopped him and covered for him.\n\nThe night then proceeded into a bar where all of us ordered drinks. It was obvious that the other guy was into my GF more than his, so he kept close to her and I stayed with his GF. Now, he still didn't have any money for drinks so he kept asking my GF to cover for him. She was nice and gave him a dollar before his GF came over and stopped him. The rest of the night went fine until my GF told me before we were leaving that she really didn't feel comfortable with the other guy. She wanted to call it off. I was upset, but I understood and didn't want her to feel left out or uncomfortable so we told the couple that we didn't want to swing with them and we went home. We arrived home and proceeded to have an amazing drunken time on our own.\n\nThe next morning was the usual hangover morning, so the two of us decided to go out for coffee and breakfast burritos at this place down the street. I asked the cashier how much and he said \"that will be tree fiddy\". It was at this point that i realized that the cashier was the other guy from last night. My GF jumped up and said \"What on earth is that creature!!\"  I turned to my GF and said \"Well of course he's not going to go away! You gave him a dolla and he's going to assume you've got more!\".

{"body": "About 2 years ago I thought why not try this online hooking up I was 18, a virgin and ready to be ridden with this virginity, put up an add in the CE section of craigslist and got a couple replies, mostly from larger women.  Finally I can a across this one girl who I was moderately interested in and didn't look that bad so I thought why not.  We exchanges some pictures and emailed for a little while and I decided to give it a go.  She was as I'd put it a 6/7 out of ten not bad 19 years old with a little bit of curves, you know what I mean.  We chat for a while and says that she is unable to have me over because of her uncle who lives with them and is always there, this put me off a bit because I didn't want some dude showing up to my house but my penis made the final decision on that one so I invited her over to my dorm room later in the night so my suite-mates living next door wouldn't give me crap about it.  I spent most of that day freaking out it was gonna be a dude or some larger girl but kept trying to stay positive finally it had come time and she was waiting outside and let alone it was actually the chick from the pictures. I invited her in and we talked for a bit then decided to get things started.  I went down on her first and it wasn't the best experience but I got the job done, next thing I know she is on top of my humping my brains out and moaning and I was like WOW wasn't expecting this.  Hooked up a couple times that night and was some of the best action Ive ever gotten. The next morning she woke me up because she had to head out to work and I was fine with that I had gotten my fill.  She said she road a cab in and asked if I had any fare. Being the gentleman I am I said sure.  She says alright it will be about tree fiddy and next thing I know this is no girl its a giant crustacean straight out of the Paleozoic era, damn Loch Ness Monster tryin to get my tree fiddy again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375079660", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

God's on the case.  But if you get your arm blown off by some nutjob, or if you get horribly burned, you're apparently on your own, because that would be \"obvious\".\n\nLook, let's just look at the two scenarios.  Option 1 -- god is running around healing people from the brink of death.  Apparently, most people would find this *boring*, so the major media companies are just ignoring it, in favor of reporting more urgent issues than the cure for cancer, such as Justin Bieber's funny pants or how too much salmon can kill you.\n\nOption 2 -- this shit *just doesn't happen*.  People who are already zealots interpret unlikely events as \"miracles\".  Science and the major media, being possessed of *some* degree of rational thought, ignore these events because of the complete lack of evidence.  You can only find these reports in fringe publications (web sites run by more zealots) because no rational person would touch these ranting whackadoos with a ten-foot pole.\n\nWhich of these options sounds more like the world we *actually* live in?

I asked her if she could go to the store to pick up some hamburger helper or something since there wasn't any food in the apartment, she said yes but asked me to pay for it even though I bought all the groceries every time. That's how I found out that she had the opinion that the man should buy all the food, regardless of occasion.\n\nSo we continue dating for a while and about three months later I ask if she'll cook dinner.

{"body": "I worked as a contractor in Texas for a while, and you see quite a few non-English speaking laborers in that part of the country. For whatever reason, the turn over rate at one of the companies I contracted for was very low, and I got to know all of their workers quite well.\n\nOne day, a new guy shows up. I go over and introduce myself in broken Spanish, and he tells me, in broken English, his friends call him \"Crab.\" I asked myself how one gets that nickname, but didn't think about it much more. That day we were doing a foundation pour on a house, and there was more than enough work to go around. We needed someone to operate the chute on the cement truck, and Crab offered to do it. I was hesitant because it's a job that requires some skill, but he insisted he had prior experience so I agreed and turned to other pressing matters.\n\nAbout five minutes later, I heard a shout from the direction of the truck. I rushed over to find cement spilling freely into a pile and Crab sitting on the curb on his phone. I said something like, \"The fuck, Crab?! I thought you knew what you were doing!!\" He apologized profusely and said it wouldn't happen again, and that he had just heard that his son was diagnosed with cancer. I immediately felt terrible, expressed my sympathies, and asked if he wanted to go home. Despite my protests, he insisted on working as he needed the money, so I put him on rake duty (smoothing the cement as it was poured) and went about my business.\n\nSkip forward five minutes and I hear the guy I had operating the chute yelling obscenities. Again, I rushed over to find Crab's tools sitting in freshly poured concrete and Crab in tears over on the side of the road. I'm a nice guy, but we had work to do and I had already given him the chance to go home, so I said, \"Crab, I can't have you on this job site. I don't want to fire you, but I will if you won't leave.\" He had trouble understanding what I was saying, so I brought another worker over to translate for me. \n\nOnce he got the message, he was in tears as he told me through the interpreter that his son's cancer was inoperable and he needed the money to buy his son the game system he always wanted to make his final days at home happy ones. \n\nI'm not very sentimental, but this had me in tears. I said, \"Listen, if you will go home right now I will give you in cash the money you need for this game system. How much do you need?\" After he heard my offer through our interpreter, he got sort of a grin and said something in Spanish. The interpreter got a puzzled look and turned to me and said in a Hispanic accent, \"Crab says, 'About tree fiddy.'\" It was about this time that I realized that Crab was a 500 foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I said, \"God Damnit, Loch Ness monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\" He started to walk back toward the construction site, so I fired him on the spot and called security to escort him off the property.\n\nI later heard from his boss that he had a history with drugs and violence in his background check, but that it wasn't serious enough to turn down his application. I felt sorry for the guy, but I think it ended the way it had to.\n\nTL;DR\nGuy goes through emotional crisis on first day and I end up having to fire him.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375127719", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, this is gonna be kind of long but this is the absolute worst date I've ever been on, and also the only bad date I've ever been on. I didn't honestly think such a thing could happen until it did, and it left me pretty disheartened about dating.\n\nSo I had known this girl for about six months, she'd been in more than one class with me but we had never really talked before. She sat across the lab room from me and we barely interacted, which was fine because I had my set people to talk to and she had hers. An entire term would go by without either of us saying a word to each other and if it hadn't been for a group project then we probably never would have talked to each other at all. However, we hit it off and she gave me her number, I texted her for a while as is customary and then we agreed to go out on a date. \n\nSo on the afternoon of the date, we made plans for me to pick her up at around 6, since I would be getting off from my classes at 5. She mistook me getting off classes at 5 for \"I'll be there at 5\" and when I informed her that I'd be at her house in about half an hour (at 5:30), she sent back \"Oh. ok.\" I asked if anything was wrong and she told me that she thought we would be meeting at 5:00. I cleared up the misunderstanding and she texted back \"ok.\" At this point I was getting nervous because a possibly passive-aggressive start is never good for a date, but I brushed it off and told her I'd be there soon and I couldn't wait. I bought the tickets to a movie before hand and then headed to her house.\n\nFast forward a bit and I get to her house in good time, not too early to catch her off guard and not late. I open the door to my car for her and close it after her and then get in to drive. I purposely chose a movie theater a good 15 minutes from her house so that I could get to know her better on the drive there, and strike up conversation about any grand order of things. The first thing I did was set the music, some band I had been into for a while. I made a joke about how I hope she liked them and she replied back instantly how they annoyed her. I wasn't going to hold it against her, I asked her what she wanted to listen to instead and suggested some jazz, and she shot down a few ideas but ended up telling me to play whatever I thought she'd like. I put on some quiet music and drove on as I became more uneasy about the date. The conversation went about as well as the music choice, forced and awkward and I learned very few things about her as she gave me short answers to common questions and seemed disinterested.\n\nWe get to the movie theater and I'm feeling uneasy about the ordeal already, but I tough through it without showing any signs of displeasure because we're only half an hour or so in and it can easily turn around. We take our seats and before the previews even start (AKA the pre-previews where they show shitty TNT-channel filler content), she complains about someone on their phone in the movie theater. I try and reason that the movie hasn't started, hell the previews haven't even started. She is adamant about how rude it is and there's no point in arguing the point so I just drop it. A preview comes on for Windows 8 and she immediately laughs and calls Windows Phone stupid (despite the commercial not being for the phone). I tell her I have a Windows Phone and she apologizes but says it was a stupid choice to buy it. Not wanting to create any waves, I let that go too and the movie thankfully starts. There are couples on either side of us but I was really into the movie (The Great Gatsby) so I didn't notice anything unusual and got wrapped up in the scenery. There were no more awkward or unpleasant moments during the movie so I begin to think this date is salvageable and can't wait to talk to her afterwards about the movie.\n\nThe movie finishes and I walk her back out to my car with the idea of going to dinner afterwards to discuss the movie and continue small talk. I had done what some guys do during dates which is to starve yourself ahead of time so that you'll be able to eat a lot and your date won't feel weird eating more than you, so needless to say I was starving. Ahead of us, I hear a group of middle-aged women talking about how unsuitable this book is for children to be reading and how it should be banned, and I turn to her and ask what she thinks, to which she replies that she doesn't really have an opinion and she didn't watch much of the movie because she was distracted by the couples kissing next to us. \n\nAt this point I've basically put this date in defcon 1, it seems to be beyond saving so I make the decision to just drive her straight home and drink away the rest of my Friday night as one big learning experience about taking someone out on a date before getting to know them better. I don't let on on where I'm taking her as we leave the parking lot, and I get about a quarter of a mile down the road before she asks if I'm hungry and would like to go out for dinner. Panicking, I say that I've already eaten for the night and am not hungry, but we can get a raincheck on it for some other time. Keep in mind that at this point I am starving. She gets curious and asks when I ate, and I tell her that I had lunch with a friend at a cafe near school. Her reply?\n\n\"It's 9:30...\" (at night).\n\n\"Yeah.. I, uh, don't eat very much.\" \n\nI give small talk one last chance as driving her home in silence for 15 minutes is a lackluster option. I ask her about her drug usage as that's usually a good subject between teenagers. She informs me that she doesn't drink (damn it), and she has only smoked weed once in her lifetime, during which she violently threw up everywhere. Thinking I might finally have a good springboard towards discussion, I ask her to tell me the story. Turns out weed does something to her stomach so she got sick after taking one hit and threw up all over her friend's carpet. Not wanting to go into any more detail, I asked her if there were any other fun stories she had of growing up and she proceeded to tell me that she almost didn't graduate from high school because she had so many F's on her report card and graduated with less than 13 of the required 26 credits. How she pulled that miracle out of her ass, I still have no idea but I wasn't really one for questioning her at this point. Around the time that small talk had once again died down, my stomach let out a loud grumble. A *loud* grumble. I prayed to whatever gods may or may not have been listening at this exact moment that she did not hear what had just happened, and someone must have been looking out for me because I was able to make it to her house without her saying anything about my starving condition. I drop her off, there is an awkward moment at the door where she sort of leaned towards me for a kiss and I tell her I'll \"see you tomorrow!\" and head out. On the way home I get two texts telling me that she had fun tonight and couldn't wait to do it again. I proceeded to ignore her for the short rest of the term after telling her that I wouldn't be free.\n\n**TL;DR: No loch ness monster, just a terrible date.**\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375175230", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*From Chuck Klosterman's Book - 'Eating The Dinosaur'*\n\nLet us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn any more; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence.\n\n**Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?**\n\nLet us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots.\n\n**Would you attempt to do this?**\n\nLet us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical.\n\n**Which option do you select?**\n\nGenetic engineers at Johns Hopkins University announce that they have developed a so-called \"super gorilla.\" Though the animal cannot speak, it has a sign language lexicon of over twelve thousand words, an I.Q. of almost 85, and--most notably--a vague sense of self-awareness. Oddly, the creature (who weighs seven hundred pounds) becomes fascinated by football. The gorilla aspires to play the game at its highest level and quickly develops the rudimentary skills of a defensive end. ESPN analyst Tom Jackson speculates that this gorilla would be \"borderline unblockable\" and would likely average six sacks a game (although Jackson concedes the beast might be susceptible to counters and misdirection plays). Meanwhile, the gorilla has made it clear he would never intentionally injure any opponent.\n\n**You are commissioner of the NFL: Would you allow this gorilla to sign with the Oakland Raiders?**\n\nYou meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Creedence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it's being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it's being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a capella (but it will only sound this way to you).\n\n**Would you swallow the pill?**\n\nAt long last, someone invents \"the dream VCR.\" This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR.\n\n**Would you still do this?**\n\nDefying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week.\n\n**You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?**\n\nYou meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson's gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film's \"deeper philosophy.\"\n\n**Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?**\n\nA novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commerical success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man).\n\n**Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likliehood of you reading this book?**\n\nThis is the opening line of Jay McInerney's Bright Lights, Big City: \"You are not the kind of guy who would be in a place like this at this time of the morning.\" Think about that line in the context of the novel (assuming you've read it). Now go to your CD collection and find Heart's Little Queen album (assuming you own it). Listen to the opening riff to \"Barracuda.\"\n\n**Which of these two introductions is a higher form of art?**\n\nYou are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that--somewhere--your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill.\n\n**Would you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie?**\n\nConsider this possibility:\n\na. Think about deceased TV star John Ritter.\n\nb. Now, pretend Ritter had never become famous.

{"body": "I have a recurring dream that is extremely relaxing and peaceful to me. \n\nIt is night, a full moon hangs in the sky above the emerald green rolling hills.

{"body": "&gt;eating meat everyday is very bad for you\n\nThere are reasons why she might believe this. Meat is high in both calories and fat. Evolutionary biologists trace meat-eating back to brain development in humans, because at that time we really, really needed the extra sustenance for fuel. \n\nToday, we just don't need that fat or calorie content as much. Of course we still need protein. But today we don't eat meat in the same way - today a lot of meat is fried, or drizzled put in high-calorie, high-sugar sauces. We also eat a lot more red meat. Red meats are notoriously bad, and have been linked to many cancers, and are also indirectly involved with strokes, high cholesterol, cardiovascular diseases of all types.., you name it. That doesn't mean we should avoid it entirely, but I don't think in the paleolithic era humans ate beef morning, noon, and night - the abundance of red meat just wasn't existent. When humans were still hunting, big game was sparce and realistically their daily diet consisted of smaller game, and berries, nuts, and fruit. Even after the domestication of cattle humans still had to live off of other things that they grew.\n\n**Saying meat in general is bad is an oversimplification of the issue.** If you sift through the information you'll find **a lot more of the problem is how the meat we eat is produced and processed.** It's not like these animals today are hunted from where they've lived in the wild - no, they've been purposely fattened up their entire lives, confined in a factory, genetically engineered to balloon to much larger sizes than animals in the \"natural world\" ever would reach with their natural diet. The cattle for beef and pigs for ham end up with more body mass than normal, higher body fat percentages than normal (what, you think they get exercise?), all because that's capitalism.\n\nJust be knowledgeable about the issue. A balanced diet is based on getting the right amount of macro nutrients: protein, carbs, and fat, along with your micro-nutrients (vitamins and minerals). Obesity is caused by getting too many calories than your body needs, and, naturally, high-calorie foods, like meat, are easiest to do it with - it's not like people get fat from too much broccoli and asparagus. Undernourishment can happen if you're not getting enough of a vital nutrient, regardless of your calorie intake.\n\nRealistically, \"eating too much meat\" is actually a common problem in malnourished Americans, regardless of obesity, because while their getting plenty of protein, they're missing out on getting enough fiber, enough calcium and folic acid and vitamin A and K from dark, leafy greens, or any other vitamin from all the other fruits and vegetables that they're not eating. They're also likely eating hot-dogs, deep-fried chicken... food that's been highly modified, and that hamburger is likely paired with a white-bread bun. Telling them to stop eating meat so gosh-darn much is just the easiest way to get them to eat their vegetables. It's like how gluten-free and atkins diets are working - bread's not the enemy, it's the way people eat it - simple sugar white bread makes their sugar crash and is nutritionally empty, their processed white flower and all the store-pakaged things with it are also not giving them anything nutritious. Telling people to just cut out eating something as much or to quite eating it at all is a whole lot simpler and faster than teaching them the difference of the content between grilled chicken and turkey and salmon from a Wendy's cheeseburger.\n\nIf you're eating meat in proper portion sizes, and your diet balances out your fat, carbohydrate, and protein, along with getting you enough of the vitamins and minerals that your body needs to function - all without going over your calorie limit - then you're fine! Your sister shouldn't freak out, but she is right to worry a little bit. If you actually write it all out and try to design a meal plan for a balanced diet with a reasonable calorie limit, it's incredibly hard to get enough of everything with a lot of meat in the mix because meat tends to take up a lot of the calories.\n\nIn short, just explain (in shorter form than I just did) how too much meat is only a problem if you're eating too much fat or calories because of it. Explain how you get enough or the other macronutrients, and how you get all your vitamins from all the other things you eat with your meat. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375207556", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "How do we protect our children?\nI've wondered the same thing being a father at such a young age (since I was 21). I can't be there 100% of the time, and even if I were something could happen I had no control over. \nI am going to preach to myself here too, so bear with me. \n\nThe best way to protect our children is be there with them. Spend time with them. Parents sit with your young children let them crawl on you jump on you. Do the things they want to with them. With our busy lives we are no longer a society of family unity but rather a society of family disunity. dad works 10hr/days to come hom and work on the yard for 2 hours, moms spends all day cleaning messes and chasing chores. Instead of chasing children, building forts, and teaching them to be kids. We fathers spend our time in instruction mode and discipline mode. We go from being bosses at work to marching troops at home. We try to force a sense of logistic soundness into a world where logistics matters little in comparison to the time we spend with our family. We husbands and wives show little affection in front of our children in hopes of protecting them from the Miley cyrus's of the world who hyper sexualizes everything. We husbands and wives don't pray together, we Husbands and wives don't cry together, we husbands and wives don't spend time alone on dates.\n\nThat is a lot of don'ts and badness in that short amount of space...sadly that is only what most of us do in a single day. 13-14-15 years down the road we are now in damage control mode wondering WHY is this happening. and WHY the family is in disunity and on the cusps of dissentigration. \n\nI need to sit with my daughters and be dressed up like a princess and have tea parties, and wrestle with them on the floor. Swing them in our home made rope swings, show them how to change oil on a car they have no interest in, and I need to hug and kiss them. It's not \"sissy\" or \"being un-manly\" it's a need they have and long after. It will make you more manly when you do that. despite what society tells us, when your daughters/sons run to you and say \"save me\" in play they are only doing so because THEY TRUST AND LOVE YOU! My 4 year old told me last month \"daddy, when i get married I have to have a boy that is just like you!\" BOOOM! If that doesn't set off your pride as a MAN nothing will. I need to make time for my children individually and together. when my girls are together they love playing \"princess sophia\" but seperate my youngest loves dinosaurs, cars, swinging, and coloring fish, and my oldest wants me to show her animals and color, and walking together. \n\nSomething even more important comes next. \nBefore Kids, there was another creature who becomes seemingly elusive and hard to catch a glimpse of as the loch ness monster. It our spouses. Guys this part is only for you as i am lacking lady parts and insight i won't do much for you ladies (sorry).\nGuys assuming you married a proverbs 31 wife, you have been blessed with riches beyond what anyman could ever hope for or gain alone. When you were dating you woo'ed her with flowers, soft kisses, listening to her passions and desires for hours while staring in her eyes. You sent her love cards, flowers at work/home/ class, and you might have even saranaded her in public! (Had I tried this one i would've only gotten hand grenaded) The best thing about this was...YOU LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF DOING IT TOO! This was your future wife, your treasure trove of rubies, gold, and diamonds, and nothing was more pleasing to you. She even said YES despite your shortcomings. Then something Changed you both said \"I do\", but life hit after the honeymoon and soon after it became \"I don't\". I don't want to take the trash out, clean the kitchen, do the dishes, massage your feet, rub your back, and etc. \nGuys we stopped filling her emotional fuel tank. She didn't make it known often, but surely as time went on sex becomes infrequent, back rubs disappear, she doesn't bring you supper anymore, hugs when you get home don't happen. The kids happen. wow!! that 1-on-1 you desire is even more rare. \n\nGuys what happened? It's a simple answer...we stopped dating our wives! So go back sing to her no matter how corny it is, send her flowers, cook for her while he watches something wholesome you know like formula 1 or Le Mans (not to be confused with the breathing exercises). bring her supper, even feed it to her a little. Women are NOT that different from Us Guys despite what people say. They want your love and affirmation just as much as you want theirs.\n\nYou probably forgot about the kids reading that huh! Well guess what they just watched you fix supper for the whole family (providing), they watched you allow their mother to relax ( relieving stress), They watched you feed her and laugh and giggle like a little girl (playful, loving, kindess)...Your children just watch you be a selfless servant and it made a lasting impact. \n\nTo your wife you just let her kick back from the chores and let her play with her children eventhough you are EXHAUSTED from your 10 hour day and playing with the kids outside. You let her read up on reddits /Christianity and maybe do a devotional she missed this morning. You showed her you still love her through your actions JUST like you did before, You dated your wife and never left home!! \nSHE NOTICED I PROMISE!\nI am willing to bet doing things like this will also allow you to become one flesh again too (ya know what i mean guys!)\n**Disclaimer***\nKids don't need to see that lock the door, otherwise you have to explain things like ehh nvm...\n\nNow comes the MOST importantest thing ever to protecting our kids. before kids, was man and wife (insert princes bride priest here), but before that was God. Thats right your life was God centered, but slowly faded due to \"life and wife\"... I propose that Us me raise up and become \"men after God's own heart\" just as david was. Take charge grab your wife and pray with her. Pray prayers of praise, prayers of intercession, prayers of request. Do it with your wife in front of your children, and include your Children. Center you families unity around the one who holds everything in it's place! center your family around God. Pray together, talk about Jesus, God, and the Bible and questions you have. Bring everything before OUR provider together. rely on him to create the unity that we ourselves can't acheive. We create chaos and disunity becasue we are imperfect creatures, but he being the center can create the unity and protection we desire for our families.\n\nI'm not so good with words, so hopefully it made sense. There were places that i had issues typing while fighting back emotional leakages from my optical regions. A lot of that hits home HARD for me just because im putting it in a place where i can read it.
