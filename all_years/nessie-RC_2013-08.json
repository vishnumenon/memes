{"body": "September 1st, 2007. It was my first day of secondary school, and I was a chubby, sweaty and nervous kid with a comically deep voice for a little fellow of 12.\n\nIn English class, the teacher made everyone introduce themselves and say what their hobbies are. I was near the end, and before me was a beautiful girl named Rachel. Her voice could have charmed grown men to their deaths. I was relishing how she had said \"I'm Rachel\" when my turn came about.\n\nAfter an awkward silence I arose from my chair and bellowed \"I'm Rachel\", my voice suddenly as deep and gravelly as the guy in the van who offers you candy. Immediately I registered the titters and the look of confusion on Rachel's glorious face, hastily correcting myself in a diminutive squeak, my face burning with the intensity of a nuclear bomb.\n\nBut it gets worse. Once I attempted to sit down and cry silently, my leg spasmed, causing the chair below my considerable bulk to fall backward. I landed on the floor and slammed my head on the desk behind me. Being of the sensitive sort, I instantly burst into tears and ran out of the classroom, ensnaring my feet in the straps of someone's backpack, causing me to stumble into a shelf.\n\nAfter an hour of crying I returned to classes, where some comforted me and others mocked me. Since, people seem to have forgotten, with the exception if Rachel, who cornered me sometime in my last year. I watched, in horrified awe, as her neck elongated and her skin hardened to scales. Her mouth opened and she proclaimed...\n\n\"I'mma need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375328385", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

OP will not be paying anywhere near that much. That's not to say there's not a huge problem here, but let's get that out of the way right now. OP will not be paying that.\n\nThere are two things that could potentially happen. The first is the most likely.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n\nThe hospital bills the maximum possible for every single part of the procedure. This means the doctor's time, the staff's time, the cleaning staff who will clean the room afterwards, the equipment, hell even the cotton swab that was used when the IV was inserted.\n\nThe hospital sends this enormous bill to the insurance company *knowing* the insurance company won't pay it all. But like any good haggler knows, you always start with a highball amount. The insurance company comes back and says, \"You guys are out of your fucking minds. You and I both know it didn't cost this much. We will pay you about $3.50.\" \n\n*Let me take a brief moment to say that in this scenario neither the insurance company nor the hospital is, in fact, the god damn Loch Ness monster.*\n\nThe hospital laughs its merry hospital laugh and counters with, \"Oh you rascal. That's definitely not happening. You're not going to pay us $135,007.58, but you're sure as shit not going to stiff us with a lousy tree fiddy. Ok, ok, look... we started out on the wrong foot here. How about we just call it an easy $100,000? Eh? A solid hundo k? Eh?\"\n\nInsurance company realizes they're getting nowhere and so quite deviously comes up with a compromise....\n\n\"Hey hospital, why don't we meet in the middle on this? We'll say the final bill is $50,000... your patient, our customer has a policy that requires him to pay 20% as a copay. So we'll give you $40,000 (no biggie, we've got a million other customers shelling out $200+ a month anyway) and you can get the other $10,000 out of the patient. They'll be mad about it, but they'll be so relieved they're not paying the full $50,000 they won't make too much of a fuss. Hell, they'll even say things like 'Whew! Glad I have insurance or that would be rough!' and you and I, hospital ole chum, will get motha fuckin paid, son!\"\n\nAt this point the insurance company high fives the hospital and proceed as discussed.\n\n/Scene\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\nPatient has no insurance. Hospital may actually try to charge patient full amount of $135,007.58. Patient will become enraged and talk to hospital accountant or administrator who will agree that, \"My, my, yes that is rather grandiose!\" and wave almost the entire fee (if not the whole thing) and put patient on payment plan according to their means. \n\n/Scene\n\nSo you see, while this shit is fuuuuuuuucked up, it's not as bad as $135,007.35 out of pocket. Yes Canada's plan seems preferable. But as the current popular article about McDonald's wages goes to show, U.S. businesses are far from paying their employees a decent enough wage for the government to increase taxes to the level required to kickstart a Canada-style plan.\n\nThe end.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375330616", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I was part of a research team that was mapping out cetaceans migratory patterns on the cape and this was my chance to get in on the action.  We were out on the shore for hours at a time with powerful binoculars and even giant telescopes for farther specimens.  On the first day, I saw a giant pod of southern right dolphins herding a school of sardines along the coast with 3 brides whales in among them breaching and eating their fill.  it was a spectacular sight.  On the final day, we had the opportunity to go out on a small boat and view them from closer.  It was a pretty calm day and we could see for miles in every direction.  The other researchers and I were bored after about an hour of seeing nothing and decided to chat about stuff.  Julie, the girl sitting across from me starts going on about how this is going to further her career and such and how she needs this to get ahead in the workplace because of being a woman is such a handicap to her in the male dominated science field or something.

{"body": "&gt;I think you misunderstood me. Only one word view could be factually 100% true. Everything else must be somewhat off. I agree that nobody is probably all the way there. Maybe nobody is even very close.\n\nAh, my bad, I apologize. I can certainly agree with that thought!\n\n&gt;I prefer the traditional meaning of the word atheism (again, as understood by the average guy on the street), which is more akin to what people here call strong atheism. I.e. atheism is the claim that there are no Gods, or at the very least, no Gods that look like the ones claimed by other major world views. That word has some meat to it, and is generally what people assume when you say you are an atheist. That position has a very difficult time proving itself correct.\n\nThe problem with that take, is that many an average Joe thinks atheism means hatred of God, ie I believe in Him, know he is real, but hate him anyways and turn away from Him because I want to sin. Popular beliefs are popular, but can also be extremely wrong.\n\nIf you ask practically any atheist and push them on the question of \"there are no gods\" there's actually only a teeny minority who will cling to that position, because it's logically, philosophically, factually, and reasonably impossible to prove. Saying \"there are no gods\" is an impossible claim to verify, because you cannot prove that something is not there. Note I'm not saying that of God either, as it's impossible to prove there is no Loch Ness monster of ghosts either.\n\nEven Richard Dawkins, when pressed on it, said that on a scale from 1 to 7, 7 stating that \"there are no gods\" he was a 6.9. He knows to go beyond, to claim absolute certainty one way or another, is illogical.\n\n&gt;That position has a very difficult time proving itself correct.\n\nAs I said, it doesn't have a difficult time, it's impossible ;)\n\n&gt; I know I am generalizing here, but often atheists use the former definition when on the defensive, and the later when on the offensive.\n\nVery true, but I don't think you need to take the \"extreme\" version of atheism to be on the offensive though. It's much easier and much simpler an argument to make, but it's also much less sound. It's just a soundbite, the likes of which there are hundreds for every given worldview, who we know is in actuality nonsense or close to it, but still has some meaning.\n\n&gt;I think that science can tell us why certain moral behaviors work. Evolution for example can show us that looking out for the group is good for our genes in the long run. However, it doesn't tell me I shouldn't be racist (indeed, strictly speaking, it probably infers that we should be racist, so we look after our own people first), or that equality between people groups or the sexes should be something to strive for at all. \n\nI disagree. Everything in evolution pertains to the context and environment in which whatever it is that is evolving, evolves. If you're in an environment where being racist favours your survival, then you ought to be racist. Sort of like most of the First Nations countries 50 to 100 years ago. Nowadays though, if you were to publicly and unashamedly declare your racism, you'd be demolished and relegated to the outskirts of society pretty quickly.\n\nEvolution favours whatever works. Simple as that.\n\n&gt;why atheists don't find some lucrative immoral behavior, which doesn't commonly incur negative consequences (like credit card scamming).\n\nThat depends on what kind of credit card scamming we're talking about. Are we talking about the \"click here to get 1000000$ instantly!\" kind of scam, the \"the prince of nigeria wants to deposit money in your bank account, pass us your credit card # for confirmation\" kind of scam, or the \"I bought something off someone online (like an Xbox) and got a box of rocks in the mail\" kind of scam? The reasons for why each one is dishonest is kinda different, so I can't answer specifically if I don't know what kind of scamming you're talking about.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375389351", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So it's late (I want to say about four in the morning or so), and my friends and I are leaving a bar in NYC. Usually we'd just take the subway since it was a pretty direct line from the station by bar to my friend's apartment, but we were with this one kid who liked to buy people shit when he was drunk, so we let him buy a cab for us. We figured it would've been easier... boy, were we wrong. A cab pulls over, and everything seems normal enough. I forget what he said his name was, but he was really chatty at first and seemed pleasant enough. We told him the fastest way to get home would probably be down Broadway, and he was just like, \"No, shortcut, shortcut!\" So he's going up some street I didn't recognize and he's continually trying to make small talk even though we're starting to doubt his \"shortcut\" was even a real thing. Eventually, my one friend who lives in the city just yells at him and says, \"Sir, this isn't the way back to my apartment building. You're going in the wrong direction.\" The guy apologizes and makes a turn down a sketchier street. We're all starting to get really uncomfortable. This is where shit hit the fan. He makes another turn and there's a cop car parked along the side of the street. Immediately upon seeing the cop car, he BOLTS. He accelerates and goes straight through a stop sign and gets the fuck outta there. The cop car immediately puts on his lights and follows us. We're freaking out in the back, screaming at this dude to stop. He's having a pseudo-panic attack and yelling at us, saying \"It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok!\" But it's clearly not... he's zooming up and down back alleyways, going up the wrong way of a couple one-way streets, and just driving like an all-around maniac. The cop is continuing to chase us, but we are gradually getting away. Obviously, we're freaking out in the back of the cab. Why the fuck did this taxi driver just go insane? All I knew was that he just panicked when he saw the cop car, so something was very, very wrong. For all I knew, we were going to be taken hostage or some shit. Basically everyone was in the back pissing their pants. So he drives extremely crazy for another fifteen minutes, and luckily there's not much going on in the street since it's 4:30am. After not much longer, we can no longer see the cop car, and surprisingly, no other cops came (I was expecting a full-out chase with multiple cops). We are all speechlessly freaked out at this point. He turns down this HELLA SKETCHY alley and my friends whispers we are in Spanish Harlem. The taxi driver turned off all his lights and goes \"keep it down and don't move.\" I actually tried to go for the door to get out and he goes, \"DON'T YOU DARE!\" So I folded my hands and shut the fuck up, not sure if he had a gun or some other kind of weapon. There we are, three drunk guys and an insane cab driver sitting in a dark alley of Spanish Harlem. About a minute later, we watch as the cop car literally speeds past the road we just got off of - as if it is right out of a car chase in a movie or some shit. We're all sweating bullets and freaking out still. After a few more moments of us sitting there in silence, the cab driver turns around and says, \"Ok, you guys can get out now. Sorry, you're going to have to find another way home.\" We just mutter something like \"Ok\" because we want to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. I go to open the door to leave and before I can get out, the driver yells, \"WAIT!\" I nervously turned to him, half expecting him to pull out a gun on me or something. He looks me straight in the eye and says, \"Your fare'll be about tree fiddy.\" It was at that exact moment that I realized our cab driver was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I was like \"God damnit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!!\" I was so pissed - and we had to walk all the way home from Spanish Harlem too!

{"body": "&gt;To be perfectly honest with you. Some of the best logic, reasoning and mental aptitude I've ever seen in my life has been on r/conspiracy.\n\nSure. That's what makes paranoid conspiracy thinking funny- the people who employ it clearly aren't idiots.

If you look around /r/conspiratard, there's a clear point at which posts get hit with \"hey this person is actually sick and this just makes me sad.\" What's contemptable and often mocked here is when people NEED to believe something so bad that they talk their way into a crazy belief. \n\n&gt;Does it make you feel superior to point out flawed logic?

Most of the people on /r/conspiratard (I assume) are people who identify as \"skeptics.\" The skepticism movement is pretty much the Scully (from X-files) of western society. With the rise of science fiction came the rise of people who found pleasure in entertaining the possibility that UFOs were aliens visiting earth, bigfoot was real, and the Loch Ness Monster existed. Before that, there were always people who believed in ghosts, witches, etc. OTHER PEOPLE- People like Harry Houdini, Mark Twain, and Johnny Carson, found great pleasure in figuring out why these things weren't true. The modern skeptical movement comes from that.\n\n/r/conspiratard is a subreddit mostly consisting of people who identify as skeptics who have a specific disdain for the modern belief in conspiracy theories- which are just as illogical as thinking bigfoot is real or that ghosts appear in photographs, etc. \n\n/r/conspiratard didn't spring up because of or in opposition to /r/conspiracy.

{"body": "This is a repost, but I love telling this story:\n\nI was on an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Salt Lake City. One of those mid sized ones where everyone is cramped, and there are maybe 4 rows of first class seats up front. I was not sitting in first class. I can't afford it. I was however sitting on one of the exit seats. I try to grab these because I am 6'5\" and they provide a little extra leg room.\n\nAnyway, I brought my iPad along, and was watching the latest season of Dexter to pass the time on the flight. I had my tray table down, and the iPad was sitting vertically facing me. I have one of those smart covers so I can stand it up for hands free viewing. We are about 30-45 minutes into the flight, and the flight attendants are passing out the beverages and snacks from their cart.\n\nApparently they start their way from the front and work backwards. They are pushing the cart up to the front of the plane, and being the large individual that I am, my arm is hanging out over the arm rest. I guess the attendant wasn't paying attention because she just drags that cart right on by and smacks it right into my elbow. We are talking a full speed right in the funny bone type of hit. I immediately jump, and accidentally hit the tray table with my knees which sends my iPad tumbling to the floor between me and the passenger next to me.\n\nIn my confusion from the elbow hit, my jumpiness, and seeing my iPad tumble, I go for a reactionary grab to catch the iPad. This is when I ram my head right into the corner of the laptop of the person sitting next to me. If I recall correctly I believe it was one of the original aluminum unibody macbooks. So way too sturdy to be ramming your head into it.\n\nI must have been moving quickly, and hit just the right spot, because the contact with the corner caught just above my eye, on my brown, and cut a nice deep gash in my eyebrow.\n\nSo now my arm is tingling, my knee is annoyed, my iPad is on the ground, I am missing whatever is going on in Dexter, and my eyebrow is bleeding quite well.\n\nI have had my fair share of scrapes from soccer and basketball. I have had similar cuts, and seen cuts like this every now and then when players bump heads. I also know cuts like this bleed a lot, but aren't really life threatening so I see the blood, but I am not freaking out. I just grab a handkerchief from my back pocket and try to staunch the flow of blood.\n\nI am really embarrassed. I apologize profusely to the passenger, who now has some drops of blood on their laptop. I let them know I will clean it up for them once I check out the cut. I try to get up and go to the bathroom so I can check out the damage.\n\nThe attendant is trying to get me to sit down so they can check out my eye. I tell her I am fine, and would like to go check it out in the bathroom mirror. After some back and forth, she relents, but notes that she will need to break out the first aid kit to bandage me up once I get back from inspecting the wound.\nI head back to the bathroom.\n\nI take one quick look at it in the mirror, and I am fairly sure it will need stitches. It is a fairly deep cut, but nothing too crazy, I don't see exposed skull or anything. I am concerned it might leave a nasty scar in my eyebrow.\n\nSo as I am leaving the bathroom I stop, look around, and say, \"I know this is kind of cliche, but is there a doctor on the plane? I may need stitches, and would like to know what to do to bandage it up correctly so I don't have a giant scar.\"\n\nA tiny blond woman sitting about three rows up from me raises her hand and says, \"My husband here is a doctor.\"\n\nSo I walk over to her and her husband. The blood flow seems to have started to clot at this point so I pull the handkerchief down, and ask the doctor, \"What do you think it will take to make sure I don't have a scar?\"\n\nThe doctor takes a quick look, thinks about it for a second, and replies, \"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was only then that I realized the doctor was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.\n\n**TL:DR - Cut my eyebrow, and got some archaic advice on how to fix it.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375500403", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I was super excited and couldn't believe it. I was too naive to even think that this could be a prank. So, I excitedly told my mom about it. My mom was happy but I realize now she was skeptical from the beginning. We went to pick out a bathing suit, a birthday gift, etc. The big day of the party came and I was beyond excited. I walked up into the gate of the pool where the party was held. \n\nit was all a prank. I was met with all the kids that I went to school with who made me a laughing stock. told me I was ugly, that nobody would ever invite me to ANY parties, etc. \n\nMy mom, the wonderful woman that she is, knew something was wrong. When she dropped me off at the parking lot, she stuck around knowing that something wasn't right. I saw her heart drop when I came trudging back to the car, shoulders slumped George Michael from Arrested Development style. She and I both cried the entire ride home.

Hope so.\n\nQuickest possible version because, as you may imagine, I've told this story a LOT over the years. \n\n\n- Her parents leave for the movies.\n- She asks if I want to \"do it on their waterbed.\" I'm 16 and a virgin. I do want to do it on WHATEVERLETSJUSTDOITALREADY!\n\n\n(here's where the story gets confusing... her parents were very ghetto, and they kept 1) piles of clothes all over their room at all times. Clean, oddly, but still piles of it. 2) foil over the windows of their bedroom so no light ever got into the room... ever... 3) their stereo on 24/7. It was always playing something just loudly enough to be distracting if you were trying to talk.. and 4) their bed right in the middle of the room..\n\n..it was one of those older-style (I'm assuming, I've never owned one or been around them enough to see the \"evolution of waterbed\" over the years...) waterbeds, because it had a ledge that was about a foot and a half wide on each edge of the bed. It was like you were meant to line the outside of the bed with cases of beer or something..)\n\n\n- We get... started... and after a couple of minutes, we hear the front door of the house open and pretty loud voices. \n\n\n- Me: \"Your brother?\"\n- She: \"My parents!\"\n\n\n- We did the only thing we could do, given that her bedroom was the wrong direction up the hall... we rolled over to the side of the bed closest to the wall, we rolled up under the ledge, and we piled a bunch of clothes on top of us as we lay there, spooning.\n- Her parents come in, flinging off their clothes. She responds with an \"Ew.\" I do not respond as I am pissed about being interrupted. \n- Her parents start sloshing the bed around... bein' dirty.\n- Well, around this time, I realize that, with how we're lying, we don't have to stop either. I start... ahem... knockin' on the gates.\n\n\n- She: Now?\n- Me: (shrugs)\n- She: (shrugs)\n\n\n- We continue. I finish inside protection. I don't know HOW her dad finished, but I know that WHEN he finished, the two of them got up, went into their adjacent (private) bathroom, got into the shower, and started it up. \n- My g/f and I booked it for her room, only being \"caught\" by her step-sister who just did the \"tsk, tsk\" finger thing, but never said anything to anybody who could have been trouble. \n\n\nWhether or not we got away with it aside... about a month later or so, I'm outside one night and her dad calls me over to him. I ditch my friends, go over there, and he says, \"the_ouskull, I like you, but you gotta understand, I don't wanna be grandpa,\" and he reaches from behind his back and he pulls out about tree fiddy. \n\n\nJust kidding. He gives me a box of condoms. I was 16-17, his daughter was 15-16. \n\nOverall, they were a weird, weird family, so, to answer those questions, no the events of that particular evening did not screw her up.

{"body": "You can thank my high school, yes mine, for sweeping the nation with anti hazing laws.  They never existed legally until a few bad things happened.\n\nI didn't see the first incident but, I heard about it.  Some girl got tied to a toilet full of crap and beaten by a bunch of other girls.  They left her the locker room crying and bruised until a custodian found her hours later.\n\nShe went to the hospital and switched schools.  Her mom sued the school because she wanted them to pay for her tuition elsewhere.  She lost since she wasn't expelled but, leaving on her own free will.  The police got involved and the news was called.\n\nNow the one that  I actually did see during homecoming week was a kid get humiliated at the park.  The underclassmen who don't participate in hazing get stamped faggots and lose huge rep amongst the school for not taking their licks.\n\nThe kid I saw got picked up from home and reluctantly came with the pack.  He got a little drunk and he was taken to the park.  When I arrived he was duct taped to a tree and everyone was spitting on him.  Apparently this wasn't bad enough so another guy doused him in lighter fluid and said he was gonna die.\n\nHe lit a cigarette and started blowing smoke into victims face.  Dude was trembling but, no one did anything.  Not sure why but, as the kid started screaming and crying more the crowd go into it.\n\nA big guy taped his mouth shut and verbally abused him more and told him you came here on your free will.  Guess you wanted to go to the hospital.\n\nHe threw a lit cigarette a him but, he didn't catch fire.  I didn't know the kid and was getting ready to pour a pitcher of beer on him or something for when he did catch fire.\n\nBig guy was mad and took more lighter fluid and sprayed him again with more.  Before he could light another cigarette my friend and I started to douse him with beer as he was squeeling and in grave fear of death.  \n\nBig guy left to go to an after party.  Some senior girls helped us pull the tape off and free him from the tree.  He was drenched with beer, lighter fluid, and tears.  He was sobbing uncontrollably and I was afraid to bring him home because I didn't even really know him.\n\nThe girls and my buddy were like fuck that  we are not letting him in our car he'll ruin it.  Plus he pissed his pants.  \n\nWe tried calling his brother because he has a big truck.  Perfect, well throw him in the back.  Oh fuck, brother is asleep and won't answer the phone.  We can't call his parents because he has been drinking and wreaks like a brewery.  Finally I call him a cab.  When it arrives I ask how much i will to be to get all the way home.  I only had like twenty bucks.  Dude said he could walk if we got him half way there.  Cab guy said if you give me about tree fiddy and I'll make sure an eight foot creature from the Paleozoic era  doesn't eat him and I'll bring him all the fucking way.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is exactly what happened until I joined this site and added a couple extra lines to the ending of the story.  Since then, new anti hazing laws have launched and spread all across America.  You're welcome that now it's crime as opposed to detention to do these type of things at freshmen.\n\nTl;Dr - kid cries, almost dies, and a surprise \n\nEdit: spelling etc.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375586663", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh boy, story time! So I got married to my (now) ex wife when I was 28. I'm 35 now, and the marriage didn't last long. Ok, so I waited until marriage, and I thought my wife had waited too. We were both pretty serious Christians, and we told each other that we were virgins while we were dating. I didn't have many girlfriends before her, so I didn't have the most experience with relationships. Maybe that's why I missed some warning signs...\n\nOkay, so I had met this girl through work, and she was absolutely gorgeous. I fell for her thoroughly, and I didn't know why she wanted to be with a guy like me. However, I wasn't complaining! After dating for only 6 months, she started talking about marriage. I thought it was a bit soon, but again, I was head over heels for this gal. I soon proposed and she said \"Yes.\" \n\nThe wedding was held soon. My parents loved her, and her folks seemed like really nice people. On the day of the wedding, however, something started to seem a bit off. I couldn't put my finger on anything specific, but she was doing things like averting her gaze when I looked at her, or whispering with her maid of honor (her best friend) while everyone else was dancing. I was getting a bit nervous for the wedding night, and her behavior was also a but worrisome. \n\nLate that night, once the wedding festivities were all done, we got to our hotel room. This is when things started to get really weird. As soon as we got in to the room, she went right into the bathroom and locked the door. I stood there awkwardly for a minute before going to sit on the bed. I finally went up to the door and asked if she was ok. I heard some muffled noises from inside the bathroom, and I initially thought that she was sobbing. I could tell that something was really wrong. I felt like someone had punched me in the gut. \n\nShe opened the door, I stumbled back, and then I saw that she was laughing, not crying. I was real confused. As soon as she composed herself, she told me that tonight was going to cost me. I asked her what she was talking about. She said it would cost me about tree fiddy. It was then that I realized, for the first time, that my wife was a 500 foot long sea creature: the loch ness monster. She swam off before I could respond, andwe were divorced shortly afterwards.\n\nTLDR: Was a virgin until marriage.

{"body": "So, it's hard to write this, but it happened to me.  \n\nSo, my ex-fiance and I initially met at work.  She was an incredibly gorgeous woman, full lips, fantastic body, silky brown hair, every guy's dream.  Now, I thought I didn't have a shot at her, but on a bar wager, I asked her out on a date.  Surprisingly she said yes, one thin led to another and we became a couple.  After about two years of dating her, I got on a knee and proposed.  She said yes, but unfortunately, things got worse from there.\n\nShe became more and more distant...  As the months to the wedding day passed, it felt like she wasn't the same person.  She began disappearing at night, saying she had to pull extra shifts, but the secretary at our office said otherwise.  I had out faith in her that she wasn't being unfaithful, and was blowing off steam, that perhaps she was nervous and was looking for an outlet.\n\nOur big day rolls around, Dec 2, 2009, and though she was there initially, she never came to the altar.  I waited, then my groomsmen searched, her bridesmaids called, but no one could find her.  I drove home crying.  I half expected her to be at the apartment, but when I arrived, all of her stuff was gone.  On my bed was a yellow envelope with my name on it.  I opened it up and in it was a DVD and a letter.  The letter read, \"XFraggerX, I don't know how to put this in writing, but...  The video could explain it better than I ever could.\"\n\nSo I put in the disk, push play, and I was disgusted.  In an orgy, right on screen, was my fiance, begging for cock like a slut.  \"Give it to me!\"  She screamed, \"Give me tree fiddy!!!\"  It was then that I realized my fiance was a 500 foot sea monster from the dinosaur era, and I yelled at my TV, \"Dammit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375598500", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Me and my business partner were in Las Vegas for a vision convention to support one of our clients (a major lens manufacturer) at their booth. My partner had spent most of our week pointing out what he said were hookers, but from what I could tell that meant any pretty woman wearing nice but short clothes. Nope, that one is a hooker too. You can tell. \n\nThere was a very tense morning where we couldn't get our very expensive online presentation software working, but then swapped out their crappy wifi router for a better one and by noon everyone was happy so we marched the floor looking for booze. It was a convention; we were not disappointed. Despite a 6am flight the next morning, we started drinking at 3pm.\n\nWe found an old friend of my partner's who was repping frames who gave us each a pair along with several beers at their booth bar. Then we went to an early cocktail hour sponsored by our client so we got a stack of 50 free drink tickets and accidentally drank through dinner. We ran to meet our clients for after-dinner drinks, which they paid for as thanks for the awesome presentation, and gave them my free frames so they could put free lenses in them.\n\nStuff happened. It must have, because I woke up in my room, still in my suit. It was 8am, and I'd missed my flight. I looked at myself in the mirror, and I was wearing sunglasses. Also a very nice but completely unfamiliar fedora. I looked like a damn Blues Brother. I found my partner in the lobby and we went out to breakfast. \n\nHe asked me where I went last night, because we finally got into the velvet-roped VIP area where those hot chicks were dancing and making eyes at us. I have no recollection of this. At this point I was pretty sure my glasses were crushed and scattered on some dance floor, because he told me I'd put on my sunglasses to make it less obvious that I was staring at their cleavage. While I had proof that this had happened, even hung over I knew that would make it more obvious, not less. All I remember was wandering into the kitchen of some club, and then being outside, then waking up.\n\nHe tells me that after I disappeared at 4am he decided that he was too drunk to stand, and told his new friends that as our flight was leaving in two hours he'd better go. The two very nice women offered to him back to his room, and then somehow to his surprise, announced it would be $200 per half-hour each. After a week of pointing out 'hookers' to me he'd managed to invite not one but two of them back to his room.\n\nHe explained that he was happily married, and was very sorry they'd wasted their time on him. Then, being very midwestern, started asking them about hooking: if it was only fifteen minutes would that be $100? How about three minutes? No? Does that business model really work? They parted on pretty good terms, and by the time they reached the elevators they had already found another guy. My partner started packing, and then woke up at 8am in his suitcase. We got on a later flight, and after a few days of wearing sunglasses my new glasses arrived from our client, which came with a drawing of the Loch Ness Monster and a note saying I'd just saved about tree fiddy.\n\n**tl;dr: karma glasses arrive after missing out on the misidentification of hookers.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375631226", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

She said that she felt the same way and we were both really happy. Well, after 10 minutes, she started to take off her top and bra, after which I finally understood that it's the night I'm finally going to lose my virginity. We both get completely naked and she leaves the room for a second to steal a condom from her step-father's drawer. When she returned, I looked at her amazing body and she looked back at me, smiling ever so beautifully. She neared me, put the condom on my erect penis and guided me through the whole time I fucked her. It lasted for about 10 minutes and I had never felt so happy before, it seemed like things were finally going my way.

{"body": "Alright, fine, if you insist.\n\nWe were in senior year. She was *such* a bitch. I mean, unbelievably so. Tormenting other girls (including my best friend-- she was a lesbian, and we were just really tight). It was taxing. She was just a cancer on our entire grade.\n\nAnyway, one day I had to get to Gov class a little early to set up for a presentation, and the room is completely empty except... for her. She's just sitting at her desk, not packed up, as if class was still going on. She was staring straight ahead and she didn't even acknowledge my presence in the room. She had never directly bullied me, and we never really got to know each other, but it was still a little uncomfortable. I quietly said \"hey\" to her as I dropped my backpack on the floor. She took a deep breath and started packing her bags. She had been crying.\n\nI asked her what was wrong, and she shook her head. \"You can't tell anyone,\" she said. I was a little stricken-- was she about to confide in me? In any case, she said that her dad had died of cancer. Apparently he had been sick for a very long time. It wasn't an excuse by any means, but it certainly explained in part why she was so insecure.\n\nAfter that day, she loosened up a bit. We also got to know each other better, and before I knew it we were in a relationship. We both applied to Bucknell and we both got in! Anyway, we obviously loved each other and wanted to spend our lives with each other. We had sort of joked about getting married, but it was never serious of course. Then one day, she awkwardly paused and told me she needed to ask me something important. I said \"what is it?\" She then told me she wanted to borrow some money. I said, \"how much?\" And she replied, \"tree fiddy.\" That's when I realized I was in a relationship with a 50 foot long crustacean from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375663532", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Please elaborate on how US government education has improved since integration.\n\nGlad to.\n\nLet's set the premise of what I'm about to say, so that we can keep clear of the weeds.\n\nLike anything else in this world, nothing is uniform. Some schools are better than others and in some states, where educations is almost shunned, things suck.\n\nI'm speaking from a very blue state which takes education very seriously - so,as they say, \"Your Mileage May Vary\" and believe me, there is no \"may\" about it, it will.\n\nSince I attended public school, class of '73, dontchaknow, a lot has improved. When my oldest son was in high school, helping him with his graphing calculator meant that I had to go teach myself a lot that I never saw until well after high school. In my shop class we built a lamp using directions that were simpler than a beginner's Lego set. In his, they built a chair out of cardboard that was required to support his own weight - with no directions at all. He was charged with the entire design process and had been provided with all the tools to do so during that class.\n\nYes, I know, that's anecdotal - but it is a real world comparison of then and now.\n\nBut let's move onto another tangent, what you perceive as \"US government education\" - which in reality doesn't exist. \n\nThe Department of Education makes recommendations, it does not set the itinerary for schooling. Yes, it can threaten to reduce or remove budgeting from a state's program, if the state is found to be lacking and the No Blithering Idiot Left Behind program did have the net effect of forcing educators to teach to the test (something us liberals objected to - but what do we know).\n\nBut to talk specifically, the US government education misnomer is really not where the problem lies, it's with the states. In Louisiana, kids who attend private Christian schools *using state sponsored school vouchers* are [being taught that evolution has been disproved because of the Loch Ness monster](http://www.businessinsider.com/louisiana-school-teach-loch-ness-monster-is-real-2012-6). (And yes, I wish I had made that up - but I'm nowhere near that creative.) Were there a real US government education oversight, we wouldn't be seeing this absurdity.\n\nI don't know where you're from so your perspective is probably filtered through your own personal experiences. The reality is that a child in even the worst public schools in Massachusetts will receive a better education than one attending some of the best schools in rural Mississippi or other parts of this nation.\n\ntl:dr - Have schools improved since the 1960s and 1970s?

{"body": "TL;DR: **Got Chased by a dog, Injured Myself, Beat Usain Bolt's World Record, Couldn't play Metroid Prime 3 because Pain**\n\nA couple years ago I had a job delivering papers.  I was 2 houses away from being finished and I remembered that the house ahead of me had a dog so I started getting sad and imagining a dog in front of the house waiting on the drive way.\n\nExcept I wasn't imagining it.\n\nThe dog started growling at me and SOO many things rushed through my head.  All the news stories of people getting bit by dogs to the point that they're paralyzed, how they can smell your fear, how I'm going to end up in a wheel-chair for the rest of my life.  It was terrifying!  \n\nSo I dropped the last paper, turned and ran as fast as I could.  I was in the middle of the street and got to a street light and glanced back to check if it was actually chasing my ass.  I didn't think it'd actually start chasing me.  It had to be on a leash.  No owner would be crazy enough to just leave it out there without a leash!  But it was there alright, and it didn't look like it was slowing down anytime soon.  I ran about 100 meters in record time, Usain Bolt had nothing on me.  I was GONE!  \n\nI swung around the corner of the street and half way before I reached the other corner, my leg did something funny.  I sprained/dislocated/\"injured\" my hip and had to start limping to keep going on and I felt like [Terry Fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Fox). I got around the corner and just thought, \"I'm about to get bit, aren't I?\".  I looked behind me and didn't see the dog.  I'm safe!  \n\nMy mother came around the corner from where I was running and saw me limping along and picked me up.  At that time, the dog was coming around the corner and I'll never forget how it was sniffing around for my scent so it could taste my delicious human flesh.  I asked my mom if we could go to blockbusters to pick up Metroid Prime 3 for the Wii cause I was looking forward to playing that after a hard day's work of delivering papers!  She said, \"Sure, but that'll be about tree fiddy.\"  Then I realized my mom was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era!  \"Goddammit!

{"body": "Well, technically it'll always exist depending on how you define existence.\n\nHe meant if you think that the megalodon is currently an extant species rather than extinct.  It's probably not still swimming around, since it didn't swim at depths that would make it really difficult to run in to (eg coelacanth, giant squid, etc).  Whether or not it went extinct 1.5 mya or 10,000 ya is potentially debatable given that a tooth was carbon dated so recently, but it's hard to imagine with the amount of whaling that has been done that nobody would have hard evidence that a megalodon is still swimming around.\n\nIf we knew more about the reproductive patterns and populations of whale species which could serve as prey for a predator that big, then we might be able to predict whether or not a decently sized population could be supported.\n\nI just realized this was /r/drunk and not /r/science, my bad.\n\nedit:\n\nOther interesting thoughts as to why megalodon probably didn't live past 1.5 mya without significant adjustment to behavior patterns.  They've found hundreds of teeth, and they all date around the same era.  Even the one tooth dated to 10,000 years ago can't give any credit to people who say it swims around.  It's far more likely to be an error for statistical reasons alone.   Not to mention all the biological reasons.  That mistake generated a ton of media (and therefore money) though, by being the kernel of \"truth\" for a lot of that content.  That teaches us a great lesson about \"evidence\" in pop \"science\" media though.  If the show is based on a \"fact\" or test that is kind of fuzzy, then the chances of it being real are pretty low (especially if it's something like the shroud of turin, or another controversial thing).  People are way more likely to watch/throw money at a show based on faked science than they are on a paper or article that established something true.  Given the chance to lie, make a bunch of money off the lie, and not really suffer any consequences I expect most people would lie.  Scientists have falsified data for less in the past (unfortunately, although it's not a common occurrence due to peer review so don't pull out the tin foil hats yet).\n\nLies generate money, and if it's some trivial and obviously a lie then the scientific community won't really give a fuck enough to double check it because that costs them time and money.  Or the company/publisher will make enough money to make it not worth reviewing the published paper.  \n\nSources:  See every loch ness monster exploration video ever.  They _rarely_ admit that it's not there, they just come up with bullshit evidence.

{"body": "I had a roommate in college, let's call him Rick, and Rick was an asshole. He was fat, loud, obnoxious, mean, and masturbated all the damn time when me and my other roommate weren't around (A sight we constantly walked in on, regardless of how many times we knocked). So, on Thursdays, Rick and I had one class together, it was a Public Relations class, basically teaching us how to be outspoken and good talking to crowds. Now, this class was a walk in the park for me, but really hard for Rick because he was fine telling off one person, but can't handle the 1 vs 100 mentality. So, he comes to me for help, and I decide that I got a couple of months with this guy, so why the hell not. \n\nI tutor Rick for about a month, and he makes progress to the point where he can actually talk to girls well enough to get one. He landed this surprisingly cute girl from Public Relations named Hope; petite thing, dunno what she found all that appealing about a fatass like Rick. So, she starts visiting our dorm more often, she's nice enough, but Rick is way overprotective of his \"territory\" and never let us talk to her for too long.\n\nSo, Hope comes over more and more often and I start helping her out with the classwork along with Rick, partially because I'm a nice guy and partially because she's actually paying me $5 a session to help, which is something she insisted on. One day, my other roommate was visiting his dad, and it was just me and Rick in the room. He invites Hope over, and starts talking to me all nervous about sex. He made it clear the he *knew* he was about to lose his virginity tonight, and he wanted tips on the best positions. I just told him to relax and just react to how her body responds and he should do fine.\n\nSo Hope comes in, Rick steps out. Wanders back in with open Diet Cokes. I was about to grab one, but he pulled the tray away and gave me a very specific can. He selected Hope's in a similar fashion, and put his down next to her. I'm thinking that he's up to something, so right after he's placed his, he goes to the bathroom, and I tell Hope to be quiet as I switch her and Rick's cans. He comes back out and we start watching a movie, Rick drinking \"his\" soda, Hope drinking the one that shoulda been Ricks, and I don't touch mine at all. Half hour into the film, Rick is out like a light, and wouldn't wake up. Checked his pocket out of curiosity, bastard had five condoms and a small vial of powder. The motherfucker tried to roofie his girlfriend and me so he could fuck her (I'm not sure of he wanted to fuck me too). \n\nI show this to Hope, and she starts freaking out; shaking, saying \"no\" and \"Oh God\" over and over, and crying after a few moments as well. I tell her not to worry, that we're gonna report this right now, but she refuses to leave until she regains composure. So I do the \"come on now...\" hug, which is the bullshit hug you give someone to calm them down, and that girl hugged me tight. She then looks at me through her tears and leans in and kisses me, and gets really into it. I'm thinking, \"What the hell, why not?\", and we start taking off our clothes and fucking right next to Rick. And holy cow, this girl was a freak! She was doing things that even I wasn't sure about that made me go nuts.\n\nWe finish after what was probably two-three hours, and she grabs her shit and leaves. When Rick wakes up, I tell him that he and I must have crashed, and Hope left early.  He left calling himself an idiot. But behind Rick's back, Hope and I start this secret relationship where during the tutoring sessions, as she's leaving, she dips into one of the supply closets, I meet her there, and we fuck like rabbits. We did this for months without anyone knowing.\n\nLike all good things though, it came to an end. During one fuck session, Rick had apparently been following her, and saw me go in the closet after her to wreck what he never touched. He confronts me in the dorm room, holding his wooden katana (Yes, he actually had one), and says that he knows that I've been fucking his girlfriend. I tried denying it, but he knew too much for me to weasel out of it. He starts to threaten me, saying he'll fuck my mom and sister, and kill the rest of my family. So I say, \"Look, dude, you may be mad, but when she figured out you tried *raping* her, she kinda got turned off.\"\n\nHis demeanor totally changes at this point. He turns white as a ghost and starts stuttering. He demands I tell him what I'm talking about, and I tell him I saved the vial and would get the powder tested. He says, \"Please, give me the vial back. You don't want that.\" And I say, \"I'll give it back on three conditions.\" He's sobbing at this point and choked out, \"What?\"\n\n\"One, you let me and Hope continue our relationship, meaning that you get to dump her. Two, you dump this shit and never buy it again...\"\n\nThen he sobs, \"Yeah? And what's the third thing?\"\n\nDominant and feeling like a king, I say, \"Tree fiddy.\"\n\nThat's when Rick found out my real secret; that I wasn't a man, I was actually a 500 foot long lake monster from the Paleozoic era. He went from white to bete red and angrily shouted at me, \"God damn it, Lock Ness Monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nMy cover blown, I hightailed it out of there, never to return.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375717904", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "And then I saw her one night after she moved out. I was buying some groceries in my sweats and was generally sick and tired of the world. I didn't want to be out, but I needed milk and something to try and soothe my throat. \n\nShe was with another one of her random partners from a club. Her makeup was smeared and her stockings were torn. She had her heels in her hand and she was very obviously drunk. He had this big grin on his face because he knew that he was going to be able to do the terrible things to her that I had always dreamed of doing. \n\nI tried to hide my face, but of course she came over. She gave me one of those drunk girl hugs where you feel her sticky palms slapping on your back and her warm breasts rubbing up and down on your chest. As we talked it was pretty obvious she was ready to go with her new friend. \n\nI kept trying to find a way out of the conversation, but she kept talking to me about random inconsequential shit. She wanted to know about our old neighbor's cat and about how I was doing in school. I tried to be polite but curt. She kept mirroring and tapping my arm and generally being really friendly. I thought she might have been flirting, but it made no sense with her friend that she just picked up there and my previous experience being friendzoned. \n\nThe d-bag from the club very quickly was looking like a deflated balloon with a pound of gel and a designer shirt on. Like he was watching his chances to bang this girl slip ever farther away every word that came from her mouth. It was like smelling desperation mixed with dollar store cologne and red bull oozing from every one of his pores. He knew he was stuck and that if he complained she would just tell him to leave her alone. If he stayed here, she would lose interest or pass out on him before he could get her naked. \n\nEventually I tried to say goodbye and she pulls me in for another hug and I get a smell of her hair. It's even more amazing than I remembered it being. My wig had long since lost her aroma. As she held on for just a little too long, she reached her mouth up with a nimbleness that you wouldn't think possible from a drunk girl and she bit my ear lobe with delicate pressure.\n\nWith a husky voice, she says to me: \"Hey rapidung... I know. I know you want to fuck me. I know about you listening at my door when I showered. I know about the hair. I used to think it's creepy, but now I know it means you really love me and want me. I just need one thing from you....

{"body": "I had an extremely weird experience at a bus stop today. It was not only weird but very creepy and has shaken me up for the past hours. Well to start off my car has been in the shop for the past week, so I've been forced to take the bus everywhere. Let me also say that I'm an atheist, however with that said I haven't ever had any real take on the supernatural.\n\nNow, I live in a pretty small town. It's so small that almost everyone here knows each other, so when I'm in town and see an unfamiliar face it's kind of weird. Earlier today I went to the library looking for a couple books for a report I'm doing in school. Finally after being there for a solid hour I walked down the street to the bus stop. There was an older woman already sitting on the bench around 70-75 years old. I sat next to her and we made small talk.\n\nAfter sitting there for a couple of minutes I looked to the left of me to see if the bus was coming, but instead saw a woman walking towards the waiting bench. She sat down next to me. I stared at her, but not the sort of obvious staring, the sort of only looking at someone by moving your eyes and not actually turning towards them.\n\nI definitely didn't recognize her. She was dressed normally, and carried a small clutch with her, she was very, very pretty which is why I kept staring. As soon as she sat down though the older woman (on the right of me) started mumbling to herself. I glanced over at her and she was holding a bible with a small bracelet that had a cross charm wrapped around it. I was a little confused by that, she seemed terrified out of nowhere.\n\nThen, I shit you not, she stands up and points her bible at the woman sitting to my left. She starts scolding the woman. \"You're not welcome here.\" She just kept yelling it at her. I started looking around to see if anyone else was watching this and it literally looked as if the world around me had been put on pause. No cars, no people, no breeze, nothing. I started freaking out on the inside but I tried not to show it. The older woman put her bible and bracelet on the bench, crossed her hands, and looked up towards the sky. She started praying.\n\nI was freaking out not so much of thinking the woman sitting next to me could be evil but that this poor old lady was going crazy. I got up and tried to calm her down but it didn't seem to help, like she was tuning me out or something. As I was doing this I looked down towards the woman still sitting down on that bench ever so calmly as if nothing was happening. She was looking back directly into my eyes, and then she says something that I will never forget. Her exact words being, \"Praying won't do, even your god knows not to come here.\"\n\nI nearly pissed my pants. I have never in my 19 years of living been this scared, ever. I started scrambling around the waiting bench, this was just too weird. Still it seemed like nothing was happening around us and then with the snap of a finger, someone pressed a play button.

But these recommendations tend to derive from modern reconstructions (of debatable accuracy) of what European hunter-gatherers (\"cavemen\") would have eaten.  Modern day hunter-gatherers, by contrast, range from eating some grains and many vegetables and very little animal product to getting almost all of their calories from one animal, and there's little reason to think that diets were any more homogenous in the Paleolithic Era.  So what we wind up with is a diet movement that largely ignores the diversity in food consumption today and instead says, however unintentionally, \"eat how we imagine white people used to eat.\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375793148", "subreddit": "doublespeaklockstep", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

After walking around, Korra encountered three ruffians picking on an elderly shop.  With her innate sense of justice, she quickly dispatched the three using a flurry of fire, earth and water.  \n\n\nThe elder shop keeper looked at Korra with amazement, but before he could express his gratitude, the police department had made their way to the scene of the crime, giving Korra chase.\n\n\nOne by one, Korra rid herself of the pursing police force, and with each one, Korra smirked to herself and knowing her training was topnotch.  But Korra could not anticipate the tenacity of her final pursuer.  \n\n\nHer pursuer was dressed in normal police attire, the only visible difference Korra could see was the masked helmet, and through the slit, a set of cold eyes.  Korra could feel vehement sense of coldness just by looking at those eyes.  Using every bit of knowledge to her disposal, Korra desperately tried to dodge each of the purser's devastating, yet refined attacks.  All were meant to capture her, but none of them did any damage to the surroundings. \n\n\nFinally, Korra made her way to the edge of the city, with nowhere else to run.  Korra mustered what was left of her strength, and turned slowly to face her pursuer.  The pursuer was standing across the rooftop, as if she anticipated the final battle.  Korra unleashed a barrage of fire that could even given the most experience firebenders a run for their money, but failed to land any her purser.  With every attack, her purser would take the most minimal of steps to avoid being singed.\n\n\nKnowing she had no other choice, Korra took a gambit and unleashed a devastating combo of fire, earth, and water against her opponent.  An explosion ensued from the mere tour de force of the attack.  When the dust settled, nothing was left.  The rooftop was burnt black, and in ruins.  Korra stood smugly, screaming at the top of her lungs, \"I'M THE AVATAR.  YOU GOTTA DEAL WITH IT\"!\n\n\n\"Is that so?\"  Whispered a cold voice from behind Korra.  Korra turned her head slowly to see the pursuer's eyes.  Before Korra could react, the pursuer pushed Korra off the roof top, into a cart of cabbages.  \"MY CABBAGES!\" screamed the lowly merchant, who's cart had been just been destroyed by Korra's impact.  As Korra got up, her pursuer was walking slowly towards her, and unleashed two metal wires that wrapped around Korra's body.  The wires got tighter and tighter as the pursuer walked closer and closer.  \n\n\nFinally, Korra's pursuer, stood next to her, and slowly unwinded one of the wires slowly across Korra's body.  Korra's body was rendered catatonic, but her right leg quivered as the wire undid itself.  It was a sensation that Korra had never felt before.  The pursuer lift Korra up and stared at her with the dead cold eyes.  The binding felt even tighter with gravity working against her.  The pursuer took off the helmet to reveal an aged woman.  With a stern look on her face, the pursuer leaned in against Korra's ear and whispered, \"The Avatar means diddly squat to me.  It's time for your punishment....\"\n\n\nKorra whimpered.  She could not get out of the bind.  There was nothing she could say or do.  She was tired from the chase and battled.  However she managed enough strength to utter \"What...  What do you want from me....?\"  The pursuer looked Korra in the eyes and cracked a smile.  She whispered again in Korra's ear \"What do I want?  What do I want you ask?\"  The pursuer slowly made her way towards Korra's other ear and seductively whispered \"Look at the damage you have caused....  The amount of injuries you have caused the members of my force....\"  \"What do I want?\" she reiterated slowly.  \"I want tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375818228", "subreddit": "TheLastAirbender", "score": 27, "controversiality": 0}

I was staying with my parents and aunt and uncle and cousins so there was no chance of sneaking some sexy-time in our beach house, and she told me she was just staying with her grandma, so I proposed we use her place. She agreed and I became extremely excited and hardly cared when she asked that I wait until night and sneak over because she didn't want to risk getting caught.\n\nSo once everyone is asleep I head out on my way after quietly creeping past my entire family. I get to the hotel she told me she was staying at and it was a complete shit-hole. I wasn't sure if I was at the right place but I walked up to the room number she gave me and peaked through the window and quietly knocked.\n\nShe opened up the door and pulled me inside the dark room quickly and closed the door behind us. I was horrified, it was a small, dank room that smelled like sea-salt and must and there was only one queen sized bed with a snoring lump in the middle of it which I guessed was her grandma...\n\nShe quietly pulls me over to the bed and slides back into bed next to her grandma, I lean over and quietly slide in next to her. My heart was pumping and I couldn't believe what I was about to do but my feelings where quickly interrupted by the person in the bed next to us.\n\n\"Son, you're not going to get anything from that girl unless I get what I want first\" said a strange raspy voice in my ear.\n\nI gulped and asked what it is the voice wanted. \"Ima need about tree fiddy\" it whispered in my ear and just afterward I turned on the bedside lamp to reveal I was laying in bed next to a 500 ft tall giant monster from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375820326", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 37, "controversiality": 0}

I was filled with joy and all I could remember thinking is I have to watch inspector gadget with her, watching inspector gadget always cheers her up. I call her up and ask her if she want's me to come over and comfort her, she agrees so I head over to her place. I get to her house and her mom opens the door and tells me that Crystal is in her room crying. \n\n\n\nI head to her room and open the door to find her looking at old photos of her and her now ex Michael. I smack the photos out of her hand and tell her I'm here to watch inspector gadget with her. She smiles slightly and agrees. I put the inspector gadget video into the VCR. Yes she still had a VCR, anyways as were watching she puts her head on my shoulder. I'm really excited by this because this is the most interaction I've ever had with a girl so I start to get a boner. What I forgot was I was wearing sweat pants so I got this raging boner and it was noticeable through the blanket. She must have noticed it because she took her head off my shoulder and asked me \"Do you have a boner right now?\" At this point I'm sweating and nervous and not sure what to say so I decide to man up to it. \"Yes, I have a boner, I can't control it I get them sometimes and I know you just broke up with your boyfriend but I've been in love with you for years.\" She laughs and says \"PROSTITUTE_STRANGLER, you're sweet but I only see you as a friend.\" I'm absolutely devastated by hearing these words.

{"body": "&gt; How can you say one position is more rational than another when there's no evidence that it's either way...?\n\nYou're basically saying that since there is no evidence either way, it's neither more rational not more irrational to believe in leprechauns.\n\n&gt;That means you have no evidence that there isn't some sort of continuation of experience after your physical death.\n\nExcept that all the evidence we *do* have points to the brain as both the seat and the source of all consciousness and feeling. When the brain is damaged, the ability to feel, the ability to reason, and consciousness itself, are all altered, most permanently. To claim that \"there is no evidence for it, so it's not irrational\" is a fallacy, because we do have evidence against it. And since there is no evidence *for* the phenomenon either, why on earth would you believe it? Do you believe in other beliefs which have no evidence, but that you've never heard of before?\n\n&gt;It's a faith based position just as it's a faith based position to say you know for sure there's an afterlife.\n\nOnly if I say that it is 100% certain that there is no afterlife. I'm not claiming absolute certainty, because obviously, you can never have evidence of something that isn't there. What I do claim is 90% certainty due to all the evidence we do have, and the 10% left is waiting for any kind of evidence in support of that belief to come along and change my mind. Until then, disbelief it is.\n\n&gt;The only evidence we will ever have, aside from personal revelation or experiences, is that we see others' bodies die and deteriorate. We have no idea what happens after death, no idea.\n\nNot true, you said yourself, we see the body die and deteriorate, the brain alongside with it. So we do have an idea of what happens after death. Per personal revelation or experiences, personal revelation is extremely inefficient a way to arrive at the truth, and is about on par with pure luck for determining the truth of statements, and experiences have concluded again and again that brain functions stop when there is not enough oxygen going to the brain. We have extensively and repeatedly studied what happens with brain chemistry and neurology when someone passes out, and we don't see any evidence whatsoever of anything other than the brain acting up.\n\n&gt;And, if you googled around, you could easily find pieces of potential evidence of something after death.\n\nWhen they'll be published in peer-reviewed journals and the author received his Nobel prize, I'll take them seriously. Until then, it's like asking me to go out and find potential evidence of alien abductions. The *potential* evidence is there all right. That's not the problem. The problem is passing from \"potential\" to \"definitive\".

One man looks at me and says, \"what do you want.\" I said, \"I don't even know where I am.\"\n\nThe guy says, \"then scram.\" The woman says, \"wait!\" I understood this time. She tells me, \"I need to ask you something.\" I say, \"what?\" She says, \"Can I borrow some money?\" Now I'm really confused. I say, \"how much?\" She responds, \"tree fiddy.\" That's when I realize I'm negotiating with a 50 foot long crustacean from the Paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375882016", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "One late night, /u/3SP was bored and lonely. /u/3SP turned on the TV to an advertisement for State Farm, so he called the number on the screen. Lo and behold, it is an actual person behind the line, so /u/3SP struck up a conversation with this guy named Jake. \n\nHe always had a secret attraction to men, which felt odd to him because he loved his wife dearly. However, it seemed as though she was not fully satisfying him. The thought of trying something crazy, like talking dirty to an insurance agent with a sexy, deep voice intrigued him.\n\n\"How can i help you, /u/3SP?\" asked the deep, smooth voice that gave him chills.\n\n\"Uh, uh... What kind of *services* do you provide?\"\n\n\"Well, we can insure your car for less than you pay now, I'm sure!\" Jake ejaculated, albeit a little confused at the seemingly-sexual undertone.\n\n\"Oh yeah, insure my car, over and over.\" \n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I mean, uhm, how do I, sign up?\" /u/3SP hesitated. \n\n\"Oh, well I'll need the type of insurance you want, your zip code, your address, name, and birthday.\"\n\n\"I want, uhm, auto insurance. My zipcode? 69696; my address, 123 Jake's Sexy Voice Lane, Intercourse, PA; my name, 3SP,\" /u/3SP tried to get out before getting cut off.\n\n\"Sir, I'm going to have to go now; this is an insurance company, not a phone sex service.\"\n\n\"So? The commercial said you'd talk to me like I'd talk to me and I'm a dirty boy.\"\n\n\"Sir, I have a wife and two children. You're going to have to go.\"\n\n\"So do I, big —\" then the line went dead. \"The nerve!\" /u/3SP exclaimed after realizing he'd been hung up on. \n\nWhen it was midnight, about half an hour after the failed phone call, the phone began to ring again, except the caller ID indicated a different number from the number /u/3SP used to call State Farm. Reluctantly, /u/3SP picked up the phone, where Jake's luscious voice greeted him on the other side. \n\n\"Hey, sorry. I only had to say that because I was on the clock, and talking dirty is sorta against the rules. I'm calling you from my cell phone, and I'd love to talk to you. You sound, so, captivating.\"\n\n/u/3SP perked and said, \"Wanna meet up?\"\n\n\"Sure! Where do you live?\" Jake inquired. After realizing that they only lived about half an hour away, they met up at a cheap motel. After checking into their room, they got right to business: their clothes flew off, and /u/3SP thrusted himself into Jake with might and power. The sounds were a mix of manly groans and the claps of /u/3SP's sweaty chest on Jake's behind. After finishing, they laid on the bed, side by side, cuddling and kissing. Jake grabbed for a cigarette, and said, \"That'll be tree fiddy.\"\n\n\"What?!\"\n\n\"Gotcha! You were amazing!\" \n\nEver since that night, Jake and /u/3SP have been in a secret relationship, hoping that their respective families will never find out.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375898801", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 222, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Its a good starting point for any conversation with a believer, perhaps better answered by theists rather than atheist.\n\nThat said, every reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), god is reality or the greatest of all possible things therefore he must exist(defining god into existence), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many gods can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375906982", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had a paper route when I was 8 through 11 years of age.  This happened when I was 11, and what made me quit the route.  It was a two street route, about 52 papers; however, on collection nights that was also 52 houses I had to go to, so I would park my bike those nights at the end of the street since I had to stay on foot longer.  \n\nThis route was in a lower middle class neighborhood.  A guy had some pretty mean rotts that would always bark and growl, often jump, at a fence I would have to pass to deliver a paper to the house next door to his.  I would always do that house last, run as quickly as I could to the mail slot, slam the paper in, and run away to my bike; because, they would scare the shit out of me.  \n\nIt was near the end of a summer, the August heat coming down hard, a few days from 6th grade starting.  Normally, a bunch of the neighborhood kids would be out playing, but it was too hot for them too, choosing to stay inside.  When I got to that house, I was so hot, I wasn't even thinking about the dogs.  Thinking back, I think the heat was getting to them too.  Instead of running by, I walked by and all 4 of them jumped as usual, barking as usual.  I walked up to the mail slot, pushed the paper through, started walking back.  This is when one of the dogs messed up, it jumped at the same time another one did and they both crashed right onto the fence, the fence bent forward, enough that the others were able to jump forward and smash the rest down. \n\nI remember distinctly not registering what would likely happen next, pausing at the mess of fur tangled and flopping trying to figure out how to get footing between the links.  I, actually, stopped, when I should have ran, instead of saying 'Oh Shit!!!', I said 'Oh Shit, Look at that.'  Suddenly, the danger snapped me back to reality as one of the dogs managed to get out of the mess and came charging; angrier than a scalded baboon.\n\nI ran, but my bike was too far away.  I looked around and found a pogo stick laying against a tree, I snatched it and flung it back, I heard it clang...  so much for that idea. I dared not look back though, kept running, hoping I wasn't going to die.  I quickly had a plan though, there was a tree I could climb, near by.  I saw it, I cut right hard, I saw one of the dogs chasing me out of my left eye over extend it's turn.  I saw the tree, jumped, caught the branch, and started climbing up the tree.\n\nI looked down and saw all 4 dogs catch up, jumping, barking.  I rested up in the tree, I had only hoped someone would come take care of the dogs.  Eventually though they got board, tired, or hot and started wandered off back toward their home.  \n\nOnce they were far, off climbed back down, when suddenly the owner of the dogs came out and yelled at me...  he said \"Hey Son, how much is the paper?\"  I said \"Tree Fiddy!\"\n\nTL;DR:  It was an example, I never had to fight off 4 dogs before...  now 5 raccoons, that's a different story.

Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), god is reality or the greatest of all possible things therefore he must exist(defining god into existence), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many gods can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n\nAlso, I can't name a single positive, tangible benefit that religion provides that can't be attained through secular means.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376095073", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was 20, I started dating a girl who there was instant chemistry with. We had similar interests, a similar outlook on life, and she was low-maintenance. I swore after the first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance.\n\nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. I won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. Besides the fact that I was studying for a medical-related track (kinesiology) and therefore had to take classes in that type of thing, I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable.\n\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime.\n\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives.\n\nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\"\n\nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\"\n\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed.\n\nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that.

Unfortunately I don't see us as a match. Your last picture of you with a large cross necklace kind of shows me that. I don't mean this in any way disrespectful, but what I am looking for in a potential partner is someone who doesn't believe in a god like myself. Just as many people say faith in god plays a major role in their life, seeing through the perils of religion plays just as important role in my life. I realize people often don't see it this way- they have no problem telling me I have no moral compass and will one day be burning in hell for not accepting jesus as my savior, but think I'm being militant just for saying politely that I am looking to date an atheist. \n\nSo, just being honest. Thanks for your message and good luck in your search.\n\n*him: it takes more faith to believe their is not God than He lives.*\n\n*If you really believe their is no God, how do you account for history of the Bible and it being irrefutable?*\n\nme: I don't even know how to answer that. Considering every part of the bible has been refuted or completely lacks any evidence of truth, it would be like trying to convince you 2+2 equals 4 and not 5. \n\nAnd trust me, it doesn't take faith to believe something with complete lack of proof of existence doesn't exist. It simply requires using your brain rationally. It does take quite a bit of mind bending, ignoring details, and lacking any sense of rationality to believe it does. You sent me an answer that is vague, nonsensical, and basically the party line for trying to validate your own belief. It really doesn't pay to keep sending me messages. As Douglas Adams says, \"I really do not believe that there is a god; in fact, I am convinced that there is not a god (a subtle difference). I see not a shred of evidence to suggest that there is one … etc., etc. It’s easier to say that I am a radical atheist, just to signal that I really mean it, have thought about it a great deal, and that it’s an opinion I hold seriously.”\n\n*him: What kind of proof are you looking for to believe that God exists?*\n\nme: Do you need proof Bigfoot exists or do you just believe because someone else told you it does? Do you need proof of the existence of invisible fairies, the loch ness monster, the abominable snowman, ghosts, the tooth fairy, or your toys coming to life when you leave the room? Or do you just believe all these things exist based on faith? And if you don't, what kind of proof would you need to believe any of these exist? The concept of a god makes zero sense whatsoever to anyone with a rational mind. You believe simply because you've never thought about it beyond what you've been told. You do mind tricks to help you prove what you want to believe, and ignore what could possibly cause you to question that belief. Really, this conversation is going to go nowhere. I don't need to look for proof that a god exists. I am not looking to find a god, just as I am not looking for a yeti. It's not there, I don't care that it's not there because my life is just fine without it, and seriously- if there was a god, he is certainly doing a pretty crappy job given the amount of suffering in the world, and the suffering seems to mainly affect those who seem to most believe in a god's existence. Non-believers as a whole are doing just fine.\n\n*him: My relationship with God has nothing to do with what anyone has told me, it has to do with what is in my heart, mind and soul...*\n\n*God lets the sun shine on the just and the unjust, there is a lot of good in the world.:-)* \n\n***So you believe in the devil?***\n\nme: How can you possibly think after all I said that I would then believe in just as fictional of a non-existent character as a devil? \n\nNo, I do not believe in the devil, or Santa, or a fish that swallowed Jonah, or the boogeyman.\n\n*him: Ha, I don't believe in the boogieman either, lol :-)*\n\nedit: added line about spelling errors", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376151862", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So when I was about ten years old my family and I moved out to a sleepy little town in upstate New York. The people around town seemed nice and friendly. They were very personable. Everybody knew each other by name and were friends. After about a month, my mother got comfortable enough to send me out to the store one night. Alone. I obliged with the thought of buying myself a treat with the change from the regular groceries. The store was a couple of blocks from our house. On the way there was a dimly lit street I had to pass with woods on on either side with tall, thick grass and evergreen trees. Hearing the rustling of the tall grass caused by the occasional breeze was soothing, almost comforting. I felt at ease. When I was half way up the street, I heard something moving in the tall grass. I turned around quickly to see what it was. Nothing. I dismissed this thinking that it was an animal of some sort. Maybe a squirrel or something. I ended up making it to the grocery store in one piece and bought everything on my mother's list and a moon pie for myself. I decided to take an alternate route on the way home. Even though I was sure that what I had heard on the way there was an animal, I didn't want to take any chances. I exited the store the opposite direction of where I came and headed home. As turned a corner, the street lights started to flicker. I started to pick up my pace. They kept on flickering and I kept on moving faster. Before long I was in a full out sprint. Keep in mind that I had two handfuls of groceries in each arm. I was pretty much all over the place. I was running as fast as I could when I tripped over a banana peel spilling the groceries everywhere. Yeah, I know. Doesn't sound real, right? Shit like this only happens in the movies. This is exactly what I was thinking as I was face down on the pavement. When I sat up I noticed that the street lights were completely off. The street was completely dark. Couldn't see the groceries next to me on the ground it was so fucking dark. A couple of seconds later, I heard something move towards me. I began to freak the fuck out. It sounded like it was moving fast. The only thing I could think of doing was to put myself into a fetal position hoping that it wouldn't see me. If I couldn't see groceries that were right in front of my face, how could this thing see me from a distance? After I went into fetal position I still heard the thing move towards me. Tearing up with my face on the cold, smooth pavement, I thought my plan had failed. I could now hear heavy, distinct foot steps. I imagined that a 300 pound killer was coming for me. I could almost here his heavy breathing when, all of the sudden, the footsteps stopped. I waited about five minutes until I opened my eyes. The street lights were back on. Still sobbing, I sat up and started to pick up the groceries. When I stood up, I turned to the end of the street where I heard the foot steps and saw some one. It was a little girl. She had long dark hair and was wearing what looked like a night gown. I could not see her face because she was looking down at the ground. More confused then scared, I called out to her, \"What do you want?\" She looked up at me with black demonic looking eyes and opened her mouth inhumanly wide. Just then I heard a farting noise as this bitch turned inside out, becoming a three hundred fifty foot crustacean and asked, \" Ima need about tree fiddy.\" Pissed off at seeing this annoying piece of shit for about the twelve hundredth and seventy sixth time I responded, \"GOD DAMNIT MONSTER I AIN'T GIVIN YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" In a fit of rage, I threw a milk cartoon at the asshole turning him into a pussy ass little grasshopper. I stepped on the little shit head and began to walk back home with all my groceries.

{"body": "As he lay in hid bed, his last words, barely escaping his lips, were a simple sentence. Nothing  prophetic, nothing foreboding. Just a simple sentence. \"Assemble the fragments.\" Then death. \n\nAfter some time, and grief, his wife went down to the basement, she simply sat amongst the papers, hundreds of them, stacked in carefully categorized shelves, slowly collecting dust now that they weren't tended daily.\n\nAs she sat, she recollected his last words, and as she looked over the enormous amount of papers that lay before her, arranged in a method she could not understand, she began to cry softly.\n\nHer son slowly crept down the stairs after hearing crying in the basement, but after seeing that it was his mother crying, he walked over to her and sat, trying to console her. He too, was astounded by the sheer amount of papers, and he realized that carrying out his father's request would be a daunting task.\n\n**ONE MONTH LATER.**\n\nThe basement had sat, untouched since the day of his death. His wife kept the door locked so his grandchildren would not find their way down into his creation. His son, who was visiting at the time, unlocks the door and turns on the light upon reaching the bottom of the stairs. He sits for some time down there, pondering his father's request, trying to think of a way to complete it.\n\nAs he is sitting, his mother comes down after seeing the  door open. She sits next to him.\n\n\"How?\" He asks.\n\n\"How what?\"\n\n\"How can we do this? This is years, decades even, of work, how can we complete it if we don't even understand it fully?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But we have to try, it was his last wish.\"\n\nYears pass, and years turn into a decade. His wife dies, peacefully, in her sleep. His son inherits the house. He goes down into the basement. He almost cries when he sees the stacks of paper that occupied most of his childhood. He sits down, and collects his thoughts.\n\nAfter a short time, he gets up, and opens one of the many note books that adorn the tables in the room. He reads for many hours, witnessing the world that his father created for the first time. When he finishes the first notebook, he opens another, and another, and soon it is time for him to get back, but he vows to come back tomorrow and read more.\n\nHe continues to read the notebooks, and he soon gains an understanding of the vivid world his father has created. He gains a vested interest in putting the pages together, and completing his father's life work.\n\nHe recruits his close friends and family, and tells his story to the local high school. They take an interest and loan him their indoor basket ball court, with enough room to assemble the map. After a long night trying to decipher the way the pages are organised, they set to work.\n\nMany days of work go by, more and more of the map is completed, until, one saturday, it is done.\n\nThere it was. The entire life work of a man, all layed out in 2000 square feet. It was amazing, but the son didn't get the feeling he was hoping for. He felt sad, and useless. His father's last wish was carried out, but it was just paper, laying on the floor.\n\nHe son went back to the house, deeply depressed, looking for something to complete the map, as if there was one last piece, that would magically make the map have meaning.\n\nAs he looked, he noticed a small hatch in the floor, apon opening it, he found something. A page, but not like the others. This one had writing on it, and was not painted.\n\n\"*My dearest son, if you are reading this, I fear I am dead. I am sorry if my last wishes seemed coarse, but the map was my life's work, and I wished to have it completed. There are so many things I want to tell you in this letter, but I fear I have little space. There is one more thing you must do for me, after I am gone. You see, I need about tree fiddy.*\"\n\nThe son, flush with raged screamed \n\n\"**GOD DAM LOCH-NESS MONSTER.

I can remember it like it was last night. I was frolicking through a field of roses and kittens, when  I heard a voice...\n\n\"Big V! Big V! Big V come quickly!\"\n\nI turned around to see the most wonderful thing in the world. Imagine the Temple from the Zombies map - Shangri-La, where the Pack-A-Punch machine is, only bigger and standing at the top was the most beautiful man I'd ever seen. \n\nHe stood there, completely naked - with only a Sausage and two pinecones covering his private parts. He beckoned me to come to him, and so I did. \n\nI ran up the stairs, skipping 7 at a time (They were reasonably large steps too) until I reached the top. He said to me\n\n\"Please, Big V, come this way\" and gestured into the temple. So I followed him, into the large temple. The further we got in, the more beautiful the place got. With portraits and statues of this man in various poses lining the walls and floor.\n\n\"We've been waiting for you, Big V,\" said the man, seductively \"You are the chosen one, and you are needed to bring a new light age to this dark, dark world.\" \n\n\"You know, I find it kind of funny - I find it kind of sad. The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had... I find it hard to tell *you*, and I find it hard to take... When people run in circles it's a very, very... Mad World,\" he told me, with a grimace on his face. You are the only one who can stop this.\" And, with that, I followed him further and further into the temple.\n\nAt last, we got to a large room. It was hexagonal in shape, with a Large throne up against the back wall. It was solid gold, with a lovely Arse cushion on the seat. it was fit for a king. it was not that, that surprised me, though. Above the throne... Was a picture of me.\n\n\"How do you know who I am?\" I asked him, surprised. I looked around the room while doing so. Around the room were statues of me - and pictures of me, taking at different points in my life. I noticed my old class photo, a photo of me holding my cat when he was a baby, and the picture of me, throttling the Queen.\n\n\"You are the chosen one, my lord,\" he said, bowing down to me. \"I am Thomas, your trusted servant and disciple, but my Angels and Gold Diggers call me Adlington. Please, sit on your throne\"\n\nAnd so, I did. I sat down and looked around the room, not making eyesight with him. \"So, what do I need to do for you?\"\n\n\"Give us the thing we desire most\" He said, with a smile on his face.\n\n\"And that is?\" I asked, confused - still looking around\"\n\n\"I need about Tree-Fiddy\"\n\nIt was then I looked up and realised what had happened.

She sat next to her gargantuan part-gorilla, questionably-female friend who I'll call Hulga, because that name suits her more than her actual name.\n\nAnyway, he overhears her one day talking about going to some party that, by chance, he also got invited to and turned down the invitation due to a \"bad ratio\" which I still have no idea what that means, I'm assuming something about there being way too many males? It's never been a problem for me, as I don't think with my dick. ANYWAY, he calls back his friend, gets us reinvited to said party, and that Friday we were at some SHADY FUCKING HOUSE in the bad part of Pomona, praying we didn't get stabbed.\n\nGirls show up like two hours late, by which point I'm drunk because I met some cool people and they had some good fucking tequila, so I drank, and drank. Friend stayed stone cold sober, and was nervous about her not showing up, continually bitching while I'm trying to enjoy myself. I had been having a great time, and frankly could have called it a night, but my friend had to find a way to get at this girl.\n\nSo, being the extremely-shwasted friend, I distract Hulga for about an hour while my friend tries desperately to seal the deal. Turns out that girl can play beer pong and drink shots like nobody's business, and while she was horrendous beyond belief and had a mustache more formidable than mine, I actually rather enjoyed her company at the party.\n\nAt the end of said hour, friend reappears and tells me that some other dude is being a problem, and that he can't work his \"magic.\" I shit you not, he said magic. I was so profoundly drunk that I actually walked up to the guy and told him that he was next for beer pong, and had to come outside or we were going to perform drunken shenanigans on his car. He got mad, came outside with his friend and was shortly thereafter soundly defeated at beer pong by Hulga and myself. We said no hard feelings, drank some shots together, and were merry.\n\nSometime later, as I had lost track of time and was extremely drunk, my friend comes to get me to tell me he failed, and that the girl was actually more interested in me anyway. He, with an extremely defeated demeanor, told me to go for it and directed me inside.\n\nI was sad for my friend, but figured this would be a favor that I could owe him, and help him out next time. So I find where he directed me, sit down with the girl, and we made out for a while before finding someplace more private.\n\nWe went into a bedroom that she assured me was an alright place for us to be (as I was too drunk to confirm/deny anything at this point) and I followed her lead. More making out, and we ended up on the bed. Around this time I started to notice that she had some strange scale-like growths on her body, and became a bit confused. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me that everything would be fine provided I gave her \"about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nI had the sudden realization that this was a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era known as the loch ness monster. I said, \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monstah!

{"body": "I didn't have time before to give your comment a proper response, so I will go ahead and do it now.\n\n&gt;From my perspective though, I would never watch a RomCom and expect my SO to then be turned on or to take advice from it whatsoever. I would not under any circumstances think that it would be a tool used to better our sexual life\n\nThat is not what OP did. At all. You just made up that up and then started to argue against it. OP just watched a movie with his wife, he didn't trick her into watching it, he didn't tell her anything about how the video is what she should be doing, and he didn't tell his wife to take advice from it. Do you do this a lot, just make things up and then get upset at people about the fiction you just created? \n\n&gt; However, people often use porn as just that; either to instruct or to try to get into the mood\n\nHow is that a bad thing? Before you go on a tirade about how people use porn, you should first explain what exactly is wrong with it. \n\n&gt;  imo if my sex life was seriously lacking I would be offended if my SO tried to get me to watch porn in order to improve it\n\nWhy? Are you so insecure and immature that you can't handle constructive criticism and attempts to improve relations with your SO? Or are you so egotistical that you think that everything you do is the best thing ever with no room for improvement? Don't project your flaws onto other people. I would immediately break up with my SO if she ever was that insecure and immature. \n\n&gt;  You seem to be making the argument that what a woman perceives doesn't matter\n\nNope. Not at all. There is no way, without delusion, that you could have come to that conclusion. I just didn't say that all that is important is what a woman perceives. That is what thekateruth seemed to be saying, a woman's perception of a situation is all that matters. The man's perception, or a objective perception of a situation is irrelevant. I rejected that as nonsense, as should any rational adult. \n\n&gt; I find that to be wholly offensive to me\n\nI am sorry if you find reasonable views to be offensive. I am sorry that you are offended that a person objects to ridiculous, immature statements made by a woman. \n\n&gt; I know not everyone would feel that same but it would say to me that you are invalidating my feelings and I find that to be seriously wrong\n\nDisagreeing with someone is not invalidating their feelings. Not giving in to controlling, immature behavior is not invalidating their feelings. So, under that mindset, then I can give my SO a list of things that she can not do under any circumstance. If she does them anyway, then I can claim that she is invalidating my feelings. That sounds like a great plan to control your SO's every move. You just might be an evil genius. \n\n&gt; Everyone is completely different in what they want and think and like\n\nCorrect. But not every opinion is equal and valid. Some behaviors are unacceptable. Controlling what movies your SO watches is controlling and therefore unacceptable. \n\n&gt; some disagree\n\nSome people believe in the Loch Ness Monster. What is your point? \n\n&gt;You shouldn't be condescending and rude to other people for having different opinions\n\nI haven't been. All I did was strongly disagree and reject ridiculous notions about controlling behavior.  \n\n&gt; It's a matter of preference, not who is right or wrong\n\nYou are partially correct. Some things are preference, some are not. Or do you think that I should force my SO to barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen? How about I carefully go through my SO's life and tell her who she can and cannot talk to? My SO loves the TV show Charmed, how about I tell her that she can't watch it? Now, I can predict your response and you would say that those things are completely unacceptable. Your opinion, and thekateruth's opinion is also completely unacceptable. It is acceptable to personally disapprove of porn, but forbidding your SO to watch it goes over the line. \n\n&gt; All I can hope is that you learn to respect other people's opinions with more class in the future\n\nHahaha, really?

It wasn't that heavy, as I recall, but that's not really important. I knocked on the door, and then waited for about 30 seconds. I repeated this twice, as per the \"3 knock\" policy, and then waited for a minute after the last time. Still no answer. So I pull out the \"we are keeping your package in our storage center for you to come pick up\" form, and place it on the door.\n\nThen, as I'm walking away, I hear the door swing open and some lady say \"YOU MOTHER FUCKER!\" I turn around, and there was this woman in her 30's in nothing but a towel standing in the doorway. She started walking towards me out the door while shouting more obscenities at me, about how I was trying to knock then leave quickly just to annoy her, about how I was a terrible person and how she would never be using UPS again.\n\nI let her finish her little rant at me, told her sternly that I had knocked the appropriate amount of times, and quite sufficiently. I don't need her bullshit just because she's having a bad day or something. Anyway, I walked back to the door, removed the pick-up form, placed the package down, and asked her to sign for the package. As she reached to do so, the towel slipped off, revealing *everything*. And she wasn't particularly attractive either.\n\nI cringed, and she *screamed*. Then shouted \"LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO, YOU SICK PERVERT.\" Dropped the clipboard, grabbed her towel, ran back inside and slammed the door behind her. I just sighed to myself, put the pick-up form back on her door, picked up the shit she dropped and went to leave. I got all the way out to my truck when she came running back out after me, shouting more obscenities. This time I cut her off. I said, \"Lady, look. I tried to deliver this package nicely. You're clearly in a bad mood and I don't need to deal with it. If you want your delivery, you can come pick it up from the location listed on the form. Good day.\" That shut her up. As I open the door to get into my truck she just says to me \"Wait...\" and I'm thinking \"Ugh, here we go.\" So I sigh and say to her \"What else do you need?\" She paused for a moment, then said \"I need about tree fidy.\" At this point I realized this lady was a crustacian from the paleolithic era. So I shouted at her \"God damn Loche Ness Monster! I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"\n\n**TL;DR**: Rude lady can come pick up her package, because I'm not gonna deal with her bullshit outside of her appartment.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376333152", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

My parents agreed it was a really awesome colored fish and they could tell I really wanted it. \n\nMom and Dad agreed that I could spend my allowance on it, but that I would have to keep the tank clean every week and make sure to feed it and I would have to buy the food with my own money.

I asked how much the food would be and he said \"i'll need about tree fiddy.\" This is when I realized he was 7 stories tall and was actually a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamn Nessie!

{"body": "Here's the thing, there's lots of reasons why people cheat. I cheated on 2 of my girlfriends in the past. \n\n  The first was kind of a complicated thing. I had been in a relationship with the same girl for 18 months after my only 2 previous relationships lasting 1 date and 2 months. She was very manipulative of me in general. She would keep me on the phone helping her study for 3 hours for an entire night. Then when she got a C on the test she would say it was my fault for keeping her tied up on the phone. Shortly after the first time I (we) had sex, I realized it was every bit as good as everything I thought it could be. I would go for it 3 times a day, and still have to take care of myself. She neither wanted nor was up for near that much. I worked hard on not pressuring her (and we were still going on dates and doing our normal stuff aside from that). In the mean time, I had met another girl (who rode my bus when I didn't have my car for whatever reason) who flirted with me quite a bit. This girl also worked at a local cafe. Sometimes I would drive her home from work or visit her there to hang out on nights when it was slow. I was playing with fire and goddamn it was irresistible. How far can I take it without cheating? Is it bad if I indirectly get her to blow me and then play innocent? She was completely in on it, too. She clearly wanted me. I became obsessed. One weekend, I called up my gf and she told me she was going to a party at a local college with one of her friends and there was going to be drinking. She couldn't drink but a sip of a martini and be off her ass making eyes at people, and we both knew it. She told me she'd be out of touch for about 3 or so days while at the party (which was at a group of guys house). I knew no one there except her. So, left to my own devices, I continued hanging out at the cafe. The very first night when I was driving the girl home, I made a pass at her and we made out for a rushed few moments before she needed me to take her home. Later that night I rode my bike out to her house because I didn't want my car to wake up my parents. We fucked like rabbits. At some point, I told her I loved her (a huge regret now, because I think I always knew I just had a primal lust for her). This continued for a few weeks. In fact, I would often pick up my gf, fuck her twice, go do stuff, come home, nap, go back out and meet this other girl and fuck her once or twice, come home, sleep, do it all again. Since I was living with my parents (and they were, too) I would take them to the same spots to fuck. Ultimately, after a pregger scare, I realized what I was doing was fundamentally wrong. My GF needed to know what was going on. The problem that was underlying to the whole thing is that the relationship had progressed as far as it was going to. I had realized that we were kids going through the motions of thinking we'd be together forever, and I'm pretty sure neither of us meant it. I should have ended the relationship, and I should have moved on. However, she was devastated and I was concerned that my friends were all going to dip out on me. So I caved and stayed with her.\n\nThe second was a much simpler thing. She was a great girl. However, she didn't want to have sex for the first 2 years of the relationship. I mean, what kind of girl loses her virginity to a guy she's been with for less than 2 years. I was also her first serious boyfriend. I lasted about a year before I just couldn't take it. This was exacerbated by the fact that her mom was on to me and wouldn't let her hang out with me at my place after I moved out from my parent's place. So I couldn't hang out at her place very often, and she couldn't hang out at mine at all. Add driving distance, me being in college and her in HS, and I discovered that I'm a weak person when it comes to attractive girls wanting to suck my dick.\n\nIn the end, both were my fault for not getting out of the exclusive relationships first. Those girls would have still wanted me. One of them probably would have been OK with it not being exclusive. However, they were both also complicated situations with lots of reasons leading into why I cheated. \n\nEpilogue: That second girl I cheated with? She cheated on me. With her cousin. I realized how much that shit hurts when you're invested. I stopped playing with fire because that's how I kept getting burned. Spent a year single getting my shit straight. Met my wife, and have been faithful to her for the past 12 years.\n\nTLDR: My life story, no tree fiddy, though.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376350552", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

The home page for this site is located at http://www.defense.gov/.\n\n##The Secretary of Defense is the principal defense policy advisor to the President. Under the direction of the President, the Secretary exercises authority, direction, and control over the Department of Defense. The Deputy Secretary, the second-highest ranking official in the DoD, is delegated full power and authority to act for the Secretary and to exercise the powers of the Secretary on any and all matters for which the Secretary is authorized to act.\n\n###The Department of Defense is America's oldest and largest government agency. With our military tracing its roots back to pre-Revolutionary times, the Department of Defense has grown and evolved with our nation.\n\n####Today, the Department, headed by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, is not only in charge of the military, but it also employs a civilian force of thousands. With over 1.4 million men and women on active duty, and 718,000 civilian personnel, we are the nation's largest employer. Another 1.1 million serve in the National Guard and Reserve forces. More than 2 million military retirees and their family members receive benefits.\n\n#####Headquarters of the Department of Defense, the Pentagon is one of the world's largest office buildings. It is twice the size of the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and has three times the floor space of the Empire State Building in New York. Built during the early years of World War II, it is still thought of as one of the most efficient office buildings in the world. Despite 17.5 miles of corridors it takes only seven minutes to walk between any two points in the building.\n\n#*The national security depends on our defense installations and facilities being in the right place, at the right time, with the right qualities and capacities to protect our national resources. Those resources have never been more important as America fights terrorists who plan and carry out attacks on our facilities and our people. Our military servicemembers and civilians operate in every time zone and in every climate. More than 450,000 employees are overseas, both afloat and ashore.*\n\n##*The Defense Department manages an inventory of installations and facilities to keep Americans safe. The Department’s physical plant is huge by any standard, consisting of more than several hundred thousand individual buildings and structures located at more than 5,000 different locations or sites. When all sites are added together, the Department of Defense utilizes over 30 million acres of land.*\n\n###***These sites range from the very small in size such as unoccupied sites supporting a single navigational aid that sit on less than one-half acre, to the Army's vast White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico with over 3.6 million acres, or the Navy’s large complex of installations at Norfolk, Virginia with more than 78,000 employees.***\n\n\" Was not disappointed.\n\n##To be fair, I did nazi that coming.

{"body": "&gt; A fairy carries a particular definition, which doesn't include any relationship to making clouds.\n\nThat's *your* definition. *My* definition includes that fairies can make clouds. I just made the claim they can. I have the burden of proof. I can't meet the burden of proof. But you also can't prove they can't make clouds.\n\n&gt; If it did, we could instead call the fairies Cloud Makers\n\nThat's a bit of a fallacious statement. You call some act \"creation\" and you call something a \"Creator\" thus you expect that it's obvious to anyone that a creation requires a creator. It's fallacious because you have no way to prove the creation to begin with. And it's fallacious because it doesn't really matter how you will call the entity - creator, mechanic, actor, football player, lawyer etc. It's absolutely the same as the example with the fairies and the clouds.\n\nYou assume creation took place therefore creator who can create stuff is necessary. Correct.\n\nI assume that clouds need fairies and fairies make clouds. Why? Because i just decided that. There's no way to prove my claim (just as there's no way to prove creation and creator) but there's also no way to disprove my claim.\n\nBasically it's a nonsensical stalemate in which you can assume anything about everything and just because it can't be proven wrong - it exists. J.K. Rowling has a great quote from \"Harry Potter\" that pretty much sums it up:\n\n*You could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody proved it doesn't exist!*\n\nIt doesn't matter if you claim that fairies make clouds, gods exist, invisible pink unicorns or dragons livе in my garage, Big Foot, Loch Ness monster, aliens, teapots etc. Not being able to prove they don't exist doesn't automatically mean they do, that's a very unreasonable evidence if you even can call it an \"evidence\". Existence must be proven by the one making the claim. Shifting the burden of proof and demanding proof of non-existence is just a nonsensical fallacy.\n\n&gt; the teapot has nothing\n\nWrong. In fact the teapot has everything. As pointed many times already - we know that teapots exist. We know how they're made, where, what they're used for. Considering our level of technology we're well aware that we even can put one around Mars (you know... \"Curiosity\" may have dropped one before landing on Mars :)).\n\nSo we have everything. Undeniable proof that teapots exist - check. Undeniable proof that a teapot can be put in outer space - check. So? How's the analogy failing? The only way to keep grasping for straws against this argument is that yea, today we can get a teapot in orbit but Russel said \"affirmed in ancient books\". It's not a problem for the analogy really, that's the whole point of it. Teapots exist for a long time, but how were they put up there in ancient times? Nobody knows but since ancient books say so and we know teapots exist - must be true.\n\nThat's the whole point of this kind of fallacious logic and i will use the Rowling quote again because it perfectly illustrates the fallacy:\n\n*You could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody proved it doesn't exist!*\n\nSo basically every claim for existence is valid because it can't be proven wrong.

I used Jicama for my rice by pulsing it three times it in my food processor.   It's a watery root vegetable which I needed to wrap the \"rice'' in a towel so it wouldn't make my nori soggy!  All in all, it was a hit!\n\nWith that said, decide what kind of sushi you want to make. When I made the Maki, I used strips of red pepper and cucumber for crunch.  Your best bets are vegetables such as avocado for a smooth, buttery taste.  Have fun experimenting!  \n\nNext, try to find untoasted Nori sheets like the Emerald Cove brand or Navitas Naturals at your grocery or health food store; raw seaweed carries fiber, as well as vitamins C and B12.  \n\nBuy imitation crab meat if you can't find the real kind, bake or grill flaky fish like salmon or tilapia (you can also make a sashimi roll if you like it raw).  Grocery stores selling their own sushi will either have raw ginger and roe separate (its free with a pack or if you just swipe some) or inside the packs.\n\nYou can pick up a [bamboo mat](http://www.amazon.com/ThinkBamboo-Sushi-Rolling-mats-paddle/dp/B005O114V4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376493395&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bamboo+mat+sushi) for fool-proof hand rolling or just use a regular cutting board and roll as tight as you can.

{"body": "Things you should know: The club just went through a rebranding when we got a new owner. We have gone through a lot of changes in the past few years. In 2009 we were the Minnesota Thunder, but when that club pretty much folded we were rebranded as the Minnesota NSC (Stars). When the owner of the Thunder skipped town (literally) it looked like we were done for. But thanks to 2 awesome play off runs (we won the championship in 2011 and came in 2nd in 2012) we got a new owner earlier this year, and were officially rebranded as Minnesota United FC (with our sexy new kits and crest. Seriously, have you seen our crest?).\n\nThe games are played in NSC Stadium in Blaine (which is North of the Twin Cities, so that means closer to you by a bit). You'll notice if you say NSC really fast it will sound like \"Nessie,\" and thus a connection to the beloved Scottish lake monster was born. When it comes to what to expect at the games it all depends on where you sit. There is the main section which this season has had over 5,000 people go to on average. That side is tame. People sit for the match. Then there is the supporters section on the far side of the field from the entrance. This is where the Dark Clouds stand during the match. There is singing, a big drum, horns, flags, flares, and people singing songs in this section. We usually have a couple hundred in those stands. That is where the magic happens.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376506403", "subreddit": "minnesotaunited", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

I stuck all my selotape strips on the wooden side of my bed and peeled them off when I needed them. Bear in mind they were long and dangled down of the wooden frame. Well, I wrapped the present, hid it away, and got ready for bed. I used to sleep butt naked, so I climbed up into bed, only to find the selotape had caught around my flaccid penis and wouldnt come off. I had no idea what to do. I tried using scissors, nope. I tried jsut pulling it off, nope. In the end I did what every kid would do and ran to mummy crying. She told me I would have to pay her if she were to take it off for me! I asked how much, choking back tears with me entangled dick flopped out.

This argument is especially prevalent with Yeti's, there is just no food around for them to eat in the high mountains especially above the tree line.  Even the Loch Ness Monster could not live in a fresh water lake like Loch Ness.  The environment just does not have enough food sources to sustain a large predator ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376607262", "subreddit": "conspiratard", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

As in the fools who are wasting their time but succeeding in getting attention, which could be a reason for exploiting Christianity for attention.\n\nThe bible places very unorthodox rules in our society the Old Testament. And intends to carry out through civilization. Fathers were devoted to this \"thing\" and were willing to kill their own sons just to show loyalty.\n\nWhat disgusts me the most is the story of Job, the guy who went through hell on earth all so that god can prove that man can still be loyal to him even when things deliberately go wrong. \n\nThey talk about love and compassion, and all I see is a character told in storybooks in similar fashion to Santa Claus, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster.

That is, until we hit the restaurant.  \n\nOnce we got there, she just couldn't keep her mouth shut. Suddenly, she wanted to talk but I just wanted to enjoy my food, it got pretty annoying if you ask me because a nice dinner suddenly became a game of 20 questions on top of the fact that you have to watch her eat with her mouth open with all the grinded food in her mouth because breaking eye contact would be impolite.  \n\nShe had no table manners and was a sloppy eater. She was eating spaghetti half the time with her fork and the other half with her bare-hands. It was a mess! She made the most obnoxious slurping sounds with soup and it she was undeniable the most messiest eater I ever knew. Strangely, I was attracted to that, I don't know why. It was unique, I mean, I didn't expect her to be so sloppy and un-mannered because her friends were the type of girls who'd act all \"Upper-class\". So after a rather odd, but great tasting dinner. We decide to get back to my place and as I was heading there, I was having trouble deciding what she would like as entertainment, I thought to myself the whole way home \"Oh my god, this is the first time I have a female over and I have no idea what I'm doing\". We finally get there and I'm really nervous that she'll get bored and leave, until she points out my sega genesis.  \n\nSo we Co-Op'ed Sonic the hedgehog 2. It was at that moment where I realized I loved this lady. We played until that stage with the Zip-lines (Hill Top Zone? I can't remember) until it was getting late. So I walked her back home onto her porch. We sat on the bench that was on it and talked for another 10 minutes.  \n\nShe finally decides to go back in, but I felt it was appropriate to kiss her. So I lean in for the first kiss and as she leans in to kiss me, she first whispers into my ear \"I'mma need about tree-fiddy\". It was about that time that I noticed this cute girl I was dating was about 8 stories tall and from the paleolithic era.\n\"God Dammit Loch Ness Monster\" I said \"I ain’t gonna give you no tree fiddy!\"\nShe then proceeded to turn around and swim away.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376887130", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

The difference I think between things such as the loch ness monster, Bigfoot etc is that while they may be plausible and may have similar quantities of 'evidence' they lack the reasoned argument that there is for the existence of aliens. Statistics tells us that the existence of other life in our chaotic universe is a near certainty. For this reason the evidence we have for aliens combined with the high probability they exist and possess technology well beyond our own capabilities makes them a logical explanation for many unknown phenomena.

So I needed to get out a little and find a job, to give my parents some money for letting me stay at their place for a little bit longer. The local gas station hired me and I was stoked because I didn't think I could find a job. But I guess they hire anybody.\nAbout 3 weeks in there was a new girl working there as a cashier. I was a cashier too, so I figured we would get to know each other eventually. We chatted up everyday at work for the next couple weeks, I honestly didn't think about having a relationship with her, she never talked about her boyfriend though. Which I figured she would have one because she was fairly attractive. Anyway, one day before closing time she asked if I wanted to go outside and smoke with her. I don't smoke but I took the offer anyway, just to chat with her I guess. As we where talking she told me about how her ex-boyfriend mistreated her, and how her parents never gave her any money to go to college (she was around my age). She started crying on me, I didn't mind, I like to help people out and give support. I asked her if she wanted me to do anything, or if there was anything I could do to make her feel better because she was crying an awful lot. I went in and bought her another pack of smokes, she stopped crying but was still tearing up. Then I asked her if she needed anything else. \"I'll need about tree fiddy.\" It was then I realized she wasn't my coworker at all! She was actually a 7 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"You aint bout get no tree fiddy.\" I went back in and closed up shop.

{"body": "Got a draft going. On a plane though. I'll deliver when I can. \n\nHere's what you get for now. \n\nAlright, fuck, just FYI. No one know this, so hopefully only 6 or 7 of you will read it. \n\nThis story is like a piece of my soul now. \n\nSo, life onboard a carrier gets pretty monotonous on the backs end of deployment. And when you work nights, there's nothing to do but stand watch, think, and work out. \n\nI honestly don't know why the fuck I was so sad. But Jesus, I would sleep from 7 to 7 (12 on 12 off) sleep in the shop, just generally unable to move and continue on with my life. \n\nI had gotten it into my brain that the best solution would be to just off myself. No one would really miss me (wife ha sent me an email detailing how stupid I was and that she was divorcing me) and it wouldn't matter all that much because all my gear was working and maintenance was good. \n\nWell, now was the question of how to do it. If you've ever been in the middle of the ocean you know that it's the most beautiful thing there is, and due to my job I had to go aloft (up the mast) to work on antennas where it was even more gorgeous. I realized that the only way to go would be to launch myself from the 211' and aim for the water. If I timed it right with the sway of the ship, I could miss the flight deck entirely and nail the water. In the off chance that I would survive the 300-400 foot fall, hypothermia would take over and I'd be done in a few minutes. \n\nSo we had the how, now we need the when. Going aloft was a tricky process because of the radars, them suckers would cook me before I got where I wanted to be and that just couldn't happen. I had to wait for a drill we call a DIW (dead in the water) where we turn off all electronic equipment and float like a dead stick, no lights, no nothing. These lasted usually a couple of hours so it would be perfect. Being in combat systems with mission critical equipment, I knew the schedule of these drills, and I had a shop up on the O10 (top level of the island, right outside the airboss's tower) so it was perfect. \n\nWe were all set. Next Wednesday would be the last day of my life. Over the week I got my affairs in order, made a will, mailed some letters, and drafted my note. \n\nThe day had finally come and the whole department was gearing up for the DIW. I requested to be up in my shop during that time for some bullshit reason or another, chief was cool with it and I spent the rest of the day chilling, indulging in simple stuff like fresh brewed coffee and chocolate. \n\nETA 20 minutes. I was nervous. Really nervous, my brain started reeling about what would happen after I jumped. Would I get that euphoric skydiving feeling for a few seconds or would I spend it in worry. I pushed these thoughts from my head and grabbed my foul weather jacket and waited at the hatch for the lights to go out. \n\nWith a crash they were out and so was everything else. I opened the hatch and hopped out onto the sponson to start my ascent. \n\nAbout halfway up I noticed something. The mast was moving. It always swayed a little but it was vibrating in a way I hadn't felt before. I pressed on. It could have just been something that happens with the radars when they're turned off. \n\nI reached my destination, walked out on the platform and looked out at the beautiful ocean under the brightest moon I had ever seen. Maybe it was because of what I was about to do, or maybe I was high from the rush of climbing without a harness, but it just looked so much more...everything.\n\nI sat on the edge and hung my feet over the side. I looked down. There it was. My sweet blue release. The time was approaching. Then I felt it again. Freaking vibration. Up here, there's no Way it could be the radar. I figured I had about twenty minutes or so til it was time to go. And I wasn't about to let tho little mystery go unsolved. \n\nStaying low I went to investigate. \n\nI came to what I though was the source of it. The dome where my antenna was. *so wait, my gear is vibrating* \"what the fuck.\"\n\nI open the hatch and I can hear it vibrating but because of how dark it is My visibility is ZERO. \n\n******Ok. This is where it gets goddamn weird, like weird as fuck. I still can't even fucking beGIN to explain it. If you don't believe it, you can go fuck yourself. \n\nI fumbled around on the dome floor until I got to the antenna base (you know, the part responsible for azimuth). It was vibrating constantly, few seconds on few seconds off, it didn't feel very strong but it was Mounted to the hollowed out steel that is the mast, so this had to be it and the vibration was just traveling through. \n\nThe base had a little hatch with thumb screws so I undid them and reached inside. I still don't believe what I pulled out. \n\nIt was the Loch Ness monster! \n\nNah just fucking with you, it was an iridium. An iridium is a satphone that works anywhere in the world, and the only thing that works in the middle of the ocean. I didn't know these stupid things had vibrate. \n\nIt was ringing, someone had been calling it constantly for at least the past 40 minutes. So in proper navy speak I answered. \n\n\"Hi this is ET3 Romney onboard USS CARRIER CVN\" \n\n\"Mitt is that you?\" Some woman was speaking on the other line. A voice I did not recognize and knew my ducking name. \n\n\"Who the fuck is this?\"\n\n\"You're late so I don't have much time. You know me, but not as I am now, I'm still little. Please don't do what you're about to do. Put the phone back and get down to the shop before the DIW ends\" *click* \n\nWHAT IN THE FUCK. I was reeling, what the hell just happened, who the hell was that. There's no way it could be... No. No way. That's not possible. The one thing, the only thing that made sense I pushed from my head cause of the absurdity of it. \n\nI had one friend on the boat but hadn't  told him of my plans. Somehow he must have known. So now, pissed off, I had to get to the bottom of this. I didn't put the phone back because fuck that. I buttoned up the antenna and climbed down as fast as I could. As I got back to the shop the lights came on and the iridium was burning in my pocket. I picked up the note I had written and decided I better go find my buddy, we'll call him hutch. I radioed into central comm and told them all the gear came back on and asked if they had seen hutch. \n\n\"He's in main comm.\" \n\nI hurried down all 7 decks down and 100 or so frames and came to the maincomm door. I punched in the code I wasn't supposed to have and burst in. \n\n\"Hey is hutch in here\"\n\n\"Yeah man, check by the patch panels.\" \n\nI pulled the iridium out. Walked over to hutch and handed it to him. \n\n\"What the fuck man! How did you know anything and what the fuck, who the fuck was that?\"\n\nHe just stared at me like a crazy person and picked up his radio. \"Hey IT1, you guys missing a satphone?\"\n\n\"Yeah it's been gone all day, did you find one?\"\n\n\"No, Romney did. Said he found it in a p-way, can you check the numbers that called it?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we have to since its been missing more than 8 hours\" \n\nHutch looked at me, saw I was freaking out. He spoke finally. \"I don't know what just happened, or what you think I did. But let's go find out.\"\n\nWe walked into IT1's office and were greeted by CS1s divo(division officer) , he was a very loud. Very obnoxious. Very large black man. \n\n\"Where'd you find this Romney? Huh? You out there makin calls on our dime? You know it's emergency only right? Maybe I should call you divo. Somebody going to mast over this.\"\n\n\"P-WAY CWO. you know I won't be going to mast. CSIO (combat systems informations officer) loves me.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that true. She'll probably trump any charges. I'll getcha one of these days\" he punched my arm. Did I mention he was obnoxious? \n\n\"Yeah, looks like a number out of Boulder, CO. Romney where you from?\" IT1 said from his desk. \n\n\"Illinois. I know absolutely no one west of Missouri\" which was 100% true.\n\n\"Hutch? Where you from?\"\n\n\"Seattle. I don't even know where Colorado is.\" Which was also true. Hutch was crazy smart but didn't know anything outside of math and science. Cause he didn't care to. \n\n\"Well, we'll figure it out, thanks for returning it.\" IT1 said and we left main comm. \n\nMe and hutch talked about it for a little while and I told him what happened. He really didn't know what I was taking about. \n\nHe punched me as hard as he could in the face. I felt like Walt. We were in the shop on the O10 so no one could see or hear what was going on. He yelled at me \"you selfish motherfucker, what about your kid, you're such a cunt. Why the fuck would you do that. \n\n\"Dude I'd be lost at sea shed be taken care of, we have crazy insurance\"\n\n\"She needs a fucking dad\" and he opened the hatch and left. But before stepping out he said \"I don't know what the fuck or who the fuck that was. But you're an asshole, think about your kid. She needs you more than money.\" He slammed the hatch and I bawled. \n\nOne thing I haven't told you, is at the time, I had a baby that was about 1 year old at the time. She was awesome and I thought for sure she of all people would be better off with the insurance money than with me around. \n\nHutch gave me a lot to think about. And I stayed up that day just trying to sort my life out. Thinking about what to do and how to accomplish it. That night always in the back of my mind. \n\nI called the wife and told her to wait til I got back to get rid of me, that I had changed from the sack of shit I was and to just give it a couple months with the new Romney and see how things went. \n\nI really did change myself because of hutch and that night. \n\nNOW, if you've stuck with me this far stay with me a little longer. \n\nI got out of the navy shortly after that deployment and moved back to my hometown. Got a job and settled down. The wife stayed and things were going decent. That night slipped further and further into memory until it was almost forgotten. \n\nOne day, we were at my in-laws and my wife got a call. Turns out that she has a grandmother in COLORADO. (No shit. I had no idea) This grandmother wanted to give us her house when she died. My mind raced around to that night in my head. Still unable to place the pieces together. \n\nWe moved to CO and are waiting on getting the house, in BOULDER. \n\nThere is only one other person I will tell this story to, And that's my daughter, and I think you know why. \n\n\nEdit:  it's finished.

The one who everyone sighs at a little and who causes boners left and right. I was hooked. She and I talked a lot, texted, called, skyped, basically got very close fast. When our eyes met across the room, I could feel something. At the same time, I became close to her brother, who was two years older. One day, I went through the day, ate lunch, sat through math, basically went about my daily routine, just going though the motions in order to see her again in fourth. I walk in, look towards where our eyes would meet, mine shy, hers clear blue, and saw but an empty seat. I was disconsolant. I stepped out, went to the office, and went to the nurses office, where I called her home. Her mom answered and told me that her brother, who had always been nice, had died on the way home from college. Moreover, he had a wedding ring for his girlfriend in the trunk that the policemen found after they searched his burning car. I instantly left, went to my car, and drove to her house. I walked in and everyone was crying. I took her to her room and tried to confort her. She was beautiful even in sadness. I tucked her hair behind her ear and asked, \"is there anything I can do to help?\" \n\nShe paused and said, \"well there is one thing\", sniffling. \n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, breathlessly. \"I'll do anything.\" \n\n\"I...I...\" \n\n\"It's ok, I'm here for you.\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy,\" she choked out. \n\n\"What?\" I asked. \n\nThen she used her powerful, lean tail to sideswipe me in half and I lost my legs.

{"body": "It was about 3 years later that /u/gamer_chik had reemerged into society.  It seemed that she had been living in a bohemian commune of sorts.  In that time, she reevaluated her decisions, her attitude, the error of her ways.  She let go of the weight of her divorce.  She shaved her armpits once again.  And she began to date once more.\n\nYears removed from society left her with few contacts, so she turned to online dating.  She immediately found herself enamored by a handsome young man, a humorous short-fiction writer with several small pieces published online.  She found herself obsessed with him.  He was all she could think about.  She simply could not get enough of his stories, but there was one particular story that she felt was left unfinished.\n\nShe took this opportunity to finally message this dashing fellow after stalking him for so long.  The young man immediately responded in humor.  /u/gamer_chik, however, misinterpreting his remark as a slight immediately lashed out at him.  She could sense her dark, control-freak self aching to break out, but she managed to bite her tongue before she did any more damage, but the thought of him being offended by something she said offended her.\n\nSitting behind a computer, this gorgeous young man who possessed such wit and a bit of a dark sense of humor, however, interpreted her comments as her being funny, and thought nothing of it.  As most online communications happened, though, the two lost touch, or at least that's what the chiseled young chap believed. /u/gamer_chik continued to follow his presence, online and later--in person.\n\n/u/gamer_chik found out where the swoll young man lived.  She could not contain herself any longer.  She was who she had always been, the controlling witch that drove her husband away.  She hastily knocked on the suave young man's door, and when he answered, she said, \"I came here to take what is mine.\"\n\nThe statuesque young man replied, \"And what is that?\"\n\nShe responded, \"I want you to finish what you started.\"\n\nInching closer to her, his eyes locked on hers, his voice low, he said, \"Okay, well there's one thing I'm going to need from you then.\"\n\nShe nervously responded, \"I'll give you anything you want.\"\n\nHe held her close to him, and whispered softly into her ear, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377063582", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well. Okay. You pushed me. I do have a related story:\n\nWe had been dating for six years. She was beautiful and I did not deserve her. I knew it. Her friends knew it. Her parents knew it. Everyone in the world knew it except her. She loved me unconditionally and I returned the favour.\n\nI asked her to marry me. The proposal was tacky. It involved a popular Beyonce song and a cock ring. She laughed. I cried in relief. It worked.\n\nA date was set 8 months into the future. The church was booked. A reception room at the Marriott was booked. That date arrived faster than expected. We were half as prepared as we had hoped to be. The cake was not ready. The caterers' main oven conked off. They had to use other arrangements (all of which we had to supervise). \n\nThe flowers got delayed and had bloomed by the time they got here (a big non-no apparently). Her great-uncle had died a few weeks before and her family were still dealing with it and were less helpful than we'd hoped. Money poured in but money doesn't solve everything.\n\nAnd the final blow, the day before the wedding, we realized the a large batch of the program-cards had misspelled the word \"Altar\" to \"Alter\" (yes, exactly like this thread's title).\n\nThat was my job. She was furious with me. \n\nI calmed her down. \n\nPoured her a big drink. \n\nPoured myself a big drink.\n\n\"So... you know you have to fix this, right?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"We can't have Nana wandering all around the Marriott because she doesn't know where what is.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear.\"\n\n\"Old people need directions they can consult. And consult again and again.\"\n\n\"Yes. They forget stuff so easily.\"\n\n\"Well... how much will you need to fix this?\" she asked, hesitantly, not looking forward to the answer.\n\n\"I'll need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that is when I realized that I was about eight story high and from the paleolithic era.\n\nAnd, I told her. She was shocked: \n\n\"How long were you going to keep that from me?\" \n\n\"Have I been blind this entire time?\"\n\n\"The signs were right in front of me,\" she exclaimed.\n\nI poured her another large bourbon. She calmed down and went to sleep.\n\nAnd the next day, she left me hanging at the altar.\n\nThey found a note addressed to me in her dressing room.\n\nIt said: \"You goddamed monster!\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377066613", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 119, "controversiality": 0}

I'm wandering around uncertain of what to do, not really fitting into the whole cocktail/drinking and socializing crowd, and I recognize a few of the Mindcrackers off by a table. I have nothing better to do, so I say what the hell and wander by. There are a bunch of hangers-on around who seem to just be following them, but they're being professional and polite. So I walk over, sorta awkwardly act like I'm interacting, just for the sake of being there. I mean, I'm at minecon and there's OOG and the others right here, I'm almost obligated to be in their vicinity for a bit, right? \n\nI'm enjoying myself, got to be near the guys who make so much entertainment and that was cool, but I'm in the process of turning around to walk away when Guude and Bdubs just start cracking up. You can tell they've had a few drinks, but they're still pretty sober. Then *out of bloody nowhere* Guude just hops up and throws his arm around my shoulder. I look over and Bdubs is standing right behind him in formation, like a wingman out of Star Fox. My blood freezes, I mean I'm an admitted introvert and if someone who I'm close to jumps up and tosses their arm over my shoulder I act like a T-rex is looking at me, and this is the guy who runs the server that thousands of freaking people follow. But no, he and Bdub start talking like we've known each other for years and before I know it I'm talking and cracking jokes like I belong there.\n\nNow I've been there for longer than I was planning and really need to catch the bus heading back, so I excuse myself and sorta shuffle away. This is the most fun I've had in a long time and I've probably put myself into debt buying the amount of drinks I've had at this point. I'm not really drunk, though, half of them weren't even alcohol. So I start to walk away and someone taps my shoulder. I look over and Bdubs is there. He says 'you goin' now?' Yeah, I reply, I'm not that good with things like this, I've had fun but man I'm drained. He says 'that's cool, I can respect that...' I stand there waiting for the next sentence, he ended it with a tangible pause. He continues, 'before you go, could I ask a favor?'\n\nI look over his shoulder at Guude, sitting next to him, who nods his head sagely. What is it they would need from *me*, I wonder. 'Well, things have been great here, and we're planning on heading around the city tomorrow. But I could use some help getting a gathering permit because so many people are going to be with us, it's like one of those flash mobs except for *hours*. So, I need treefiddy.' It was about then that I noticed he was five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era. I dove out the front door at top speed, protecting my wallet like nothing else, got back to to my room and went to sleep. Never ran into them again after that. Still had fun.

{"body": "&gt; Firstly, there are too many eye witness accounts for bigfoot to be simply a lie. Granted, many if these eyewitnesses are wholly untrustworthy and probably lying in order to get their mug on TV. But there is hundreds if not thousands of people who have personally \"seen\" bigfoot and devoted their life or at least some of it to finding him with no sense of glory in sight.\n\nNo sense of glory? Except finding one of the most famous cryptozoology cases known to humans. And as you said, getting their mug on TV.\n\n&gt; Secondly, the numerous myths and folk lore stories relating to bigfoot are simply too many for at least a creature similar to bigfoot to not exist. Many cultures from all over the world have different names for an ape like creature walking on two legs, these include the Yeti, Abominable Snowman and and Australian Aborigines \"version\" the Yowie.\n\nThere are many myths for many different things. Are all of these myths identical down to the last detail? Probably not. But there are tons of myths about dragons, and giants, and angels (or flying humans)...I could go on and on. The great flood in the Bible? There are like a ton of myths supporting that story as well (heck it even usually includes giants). However, there's no evidence for a worldwide flood and floods leave a lot of evidence behind.\n\n&gt; Thirdly, the video evidence taken by Roger Patterson has many experts swear that the video could not have been faked, and that the way in which the creature steps is unlike anything human. This evidence has been somewhat tainted, by Roger Patterson's background as a fraudman and the cameras purchase using a phony cheque. Video can be found here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOxuRIfFs0w\n\n\"Unlike anything human\" except that creature's gait is quite human. Do you have any resources to back your claim that it doesn't move like a human? My impression of that video has always been that it's a guy shambling around. I mean it isn't like it's knees are bending the wrong way - it's clearly moving around the way a human *could* move.\n\nIf a bigfoot like creature does exist. Why aren't we able to find it? We have helicopters with infrared scanners and cell phones with darn good video capture equipment attached. And yet we cannot find one solid piece of evidence for this creature. Your best bit of evidence is a very old, grainy, shaky video.\n\nAnyway, someone could make a very similar post about the Loch Ness Monster (footprints and all!) - but cryptozoology has trouble providing anything substantial. We just discovered a new mammal last week and there are pictures galore of it. I won't deny that there are creatures out there humanity does not yet know about.

{"body": "Or you know, when Mr. Drago, the ex-soviet sniper, that brings his custom designed high powered rifle to work, nobody will bat an eye. But when Mr. Drago's wife leaves him for losing the biggest boxing match of his career to some stroke victim from philly that can barely string a sentence together, then Mr. Drago suddenly turns his high-powered rifle on that 4th grader jimmy that kicked the ball over the school's boundary fence and refused to go get it. \n\nSuddenly, the air is filled with screams as the children scatter in every direction. A group of teachers storm out of the building with weapons aimed and ready to fire, they see Mr. Drago kneeling over the fallen boy, he points to the far boundary and shouts \"The shot came from over there\", the teachers head to the opposite side of the playground, Mrs. Dudemeister rushes to Mr. Drago to tend to little him. She looks down and instantly knows the boy is dead. Mr. Drago stands and turns, looking grief stricken. As Mrs. Dudemeister leans over the boy, she notices the impact wound could only have come from a short range, she turns slightly and sees an empty casing lying a few feet away, almost right next to Mr. Drago. He turns around and notices the sudden realization on her face. They make a split second eye contact before she attempts to yell and raise her weapon, Mr. Drago's pen catching her in the throat and stiffling her scream.\n\nHe lowers her body to the ground as she rapidly loses blood, taking her pistol from her grip and stuffing it in his waistband. He turns on his knee and surveys the other teachers across the grounds looking for a gunman that isn't there. Mr. Drago lies flat on his stomach, using Jimmy's body as leverage for his weapon and as cover for himself, and he begins to fire.\n\nOne, two, three teachers fall before the rest register where the fire is coming from and scatter for cover. They return fire, some still unsure of the exact location of their attacker. A small girl climbs out from under the slide, shes making a run for the school. Mr. Drago takes aim and hits her in the leg. One of the teachers races out from behind her cover and makes for the boy. Mr. Drago grins at the woman's stupidity and easily drops her 10 feet from the injured girl. He cries echo throughout the playground as remaining two armed teachers shout instructions to each other. They are seconds from executing their plan when Drago lifts himself and heads straight for the injured girl. Caught off guard the teachers lose focus on their aim and their shots graze past Mr. Drago. He throws himself on top of the little girl, pinning her to the ground, before rolling over with her press against his chest, operating as a human shield. He stands with her and begins to back his way up to the school. The final member's of the Tactical Investigation Teachers Squad stand from behind their chosen covers, advancing on Mr. Drago. He drops his rifle and pulls a pistol from his waistband, pointing it directly at the little girls head as he drags her with him towards the school.\n\n\"Drop the girl and the we'll let you live Drago\" shouts Mr. Banks. \n\"Not until I've got what I need\" yells Drago. Mr. Banks looks confused \"What do you want? We can work this out.\" Drago grins as he says \"I need about tree-fiddy\". Suddenly, Mr. Banks realizes hes facing down a figure that's 8 Stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "17 years old at the time. My boyfriend and I had been having sex for a little over a year when I found out I was almost two months pregnant. Instantly my life was crushed. I'd been working hard in my senior year to try and pick up scholarships so I wouldn't have to go into an impossible amount of debt in college, but I knew I likely wouldn't be able to afford it with the financial burden and not enough time to concentrate on my studies.\n\nMy boyfriend was trying to be supportive, but I could tell he really wanted me to have an abortion.

{"body": "&gt; Firstly, there are too many eye witness accounts for bigfoot to be simply a lie.\n\nGhosts, Demons, chupacabra, Nessie, UFO's etc.  There are many religions that claim to be the only 'true' religion.  Only one could be right.  So what about all those people that 'feel god' or get miraculously healed or start speaking tongues.  They can't all be true, but surprisingly everyone thinks 'their' religion is...  Because that is what they WANT to believe.\n\nNone of these things have any proof of existence.  What they have is something that looks vaguely close and they filled in the gaps with what they know:  the common myth of that thing.\n\nThe human mind will always try to fill in the gaps or complete the equation with what they already know.  That is why the proof for all of these are never direct.  They are always foot prints, and never the actual feet. They are low quality shaky videos because this allows us to fill in the gaps and believe what we want to believe.  With all the GoPro's and cell phones and digital cameras around today, someone should have found bigfoot by now and have a half decent video.  Especially since for him to exist, there needs to be more than just 5 or 10 very stealthy ones.  A sustainable population needs greater numbers, especially for such a large mammal.\n\nAncient cultures believe all kinds of ridiculous things. And in the future, the same will be said about our current times.  Flat Earth, center of the universe, [Spontaneous generation](http://faculty.sdmiramar.edu/dtrubovitz/micro/history/Spontaneousgen.html) and on and on and on.\n\nAs for that video specifically...  Presumably, bigfoot tries to stay away from people (or else he'd be foraging in our garbage cans just like bears and moose, etc), otherwise we'd have irrefutable proof of him by now.  So in this video, Roger managed to find a bigfoot that is either deaf, can't smell and blind, or he had no fear of being near a human as it crashed through the woods towards him.  Both of these choices are FAR more unlikely than just a dude in a gorilla suit ignoring a man who is a known fraud.\n\nYou say experts swear the video could not be faked?  Why not?  Looks pretty easy to fake to me.  Also, who are these 'experts'?  My guess is that they have something to gain by saying these things.  Also, what defines an expert?\n\n&gt;I believe that many scientists and otherwise experts don't further investigate the bigfoot as there is a culture of disrepute for anyone that further investigates these occurrences.\n\nCan you imagine the fame that would be bestowed on the guy who proves bigfoot is/was real at one point in time?  The guy would be famous worldwide and would be able to get millions in funding his continued research on bigfoot.  No scientists study bigfoot because it's a ridiculous claim to anyone who actually understands the scientific method, evolution or already studies large mammals/apes.\n\nFinally, [The Scientific Method.](http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/overview_scientific_method2.gif)   \nNotice the order of those.  Notice how conclusion is near the last thing.\n\nBad Science (like the science the religious tries to produce) does not start with a conclusion and then look for proof of that conclusion.  That is a HUGE error. I learned that in fifth grade.  You end up with all kinds of ridiculous claims because you can almost always find proof of something you want to prove:\n\nBad:  The earth is flat:  Nobody in the entire history of civilization can see any curve of your crazy spherical earth idea. So I must be right.\n\nGood: How is the earth shaped?  Find all available data and THEN come to a conclusion.\n\nBad:  Cigarettes are not necessarily bad for you:  Look at my grandparents, they lived to 98! they both smoked everyday since they were 15.  Same with my uncle.  It must not be bad for you.  It's just that smokers also do other things that might hurt them.  Or some combination that kills them.  So it's not necessarily the smoking itself that kills.\n\nGood:  Are cigarettes bad for you?  Research all the available data.  Find a trend.  It shows a lowered life expectancy of people who smoke their whole lives.  Test this on lab rats.  Cigarettes are bad for you.\n\nSo lets apply this to bigfoot:\n\nDoes bigfoot exist?\n\nResearch:  Shaky cam videos, foot prints and eye witness accounts.  Further research shows that there is NO good videos.  No footprints of tracks that could not be reproduced in a lab.  Eye witness accounts are almost unanimously from unreliable witnesses or had an obvious motive for fabrication.  No bones, droppings, tracks, bite marks have ever been found that were not recreatable in a lab.\n\nHypothesis:  Bigfoot has no verifiable proof, he does not exist.\n\nTest:  Leave movement activated high quality cameras in known sighting locations and other likely places.  Never, EVER caught footage of anything even close to bigfoot.\n\nAnalyze:  Test data proves our hypothesis.\n\nReport Results:  Bigfoot is a myth, nothing more.\n\n(Follow up)  Our understanding of the world we live in is never complete, if/when new evidence shows up, start over.

The lack of a rise in the frequency of which images of ufos, big foot, the lochness monster... are captured matching that of the frequency with which people carry cameras with them everywhere they go is further evidence that the extant images of ufos, big foot, the lochness monster... were faked.\n\n&gt;Such would only be the case if we had all those cameras deep in the woods, oceans, lakes, and haunted places everywhere, but they're not. All those cameras are too busy taking pictures of lattes and cats to find Bigfoot or Nessie. \n \nhuh? This makes no sense. People use there phones to photo/video anything that interests them for most people 'Bigfoot or Nessie' surely fall into that category.

The Loch is overlooked by roads, footpaths and bridleways frequented by 1st world citizens many of whom have camera phones. The Loch is a popular tourist attraction visited by tourists many of whom have camera phones. Not only do tourists and locals habitually drive, walk and ride along the loch side they also canoe and boat upon the loch itself. From my direct experience alone that I know of 5 members of my family who are into Munro bagging have driven and walked along the shore of the Loch and guess what, they all have camera phones. What's more before they had camera phones they carried compact cameras and even slr's with them when out hill walking, they're anything but unusual in doing so. \n\nLots of cameras make it to Loch Ness just as they make it to everywhere that citizens of the developed world go to these days.

That's just telling them not to think or question. that's telling them they don't have a right to be free in their own minds.\n\n&gt;If you not worshipping in each faith, you're sending the message that you don't believe in them. You're the highest authority to your children, and they will emulate you. Maybe they'll have a change of heart later in life, but right now you're stacking the deck in favor of your world view.\n\nI stack no deck at all. I make no pronouncements about what they should or should not believe. My wife is a Catholic (and my kids are actually baptized), so they see that too, but atheism is not a wordview anyway, any more than not believing in the Loch Ness Monster is a worldview.  \n\n&gt;That's all I do too, no more and no less.\n\nNo, you tell your kids that they HAVE to believe something. I tell them they don't HAVE to  believe a damn thing and should never let anyone tell them otherwise.\n\n&gt;Views that comparative religion (as opposed to becoming faithful) can convey the gist of faith and that morality is an evolutionary trait are New Atheism 101.\n\nI didn't say comparative religion conveys anything about morality, but it's simply a biological fact that what we call \"morality\" is just biologically evolved, neurological responses. It's not a \"view,\" that this is the case, it is a verifiable aspect of primate biology. Morality existed before religion. Morality existed before  homo sapiens ever even speciated.\n\n&gt;The problem, then, is not that parents are passing on their views and values onto their children, but that you consider yours so superior to anyone else's that you think yours should be the default. That's a bit arrogant, don't you agree?\n\n\"Values\" are not the issue, telling them they have to believe things you have no reason to believe are true is the problem. Telling them that supernatural monsters will torture them if they believe the wrong thing (or have the wrong emotions) is the problem. I don't threaten my kids with devils and I don't tell them anything is a fact unless I can back it up.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377289537", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

My friends and I would spend our summers attempting to build rafts to try and cross, using whatever we could scrounge up out of our parent's garage. One of our neighbors was (justifiably) very concerned that we were going to get hurt, or worse drown. One day he saw us outside, launching our latest construction. He came down to us, and said \"boys, before you launch that into the water, I need to tell you about the pale child.\"\n\n\"Years before your mom and dad moved here, a young family lived in a house next to the lake. The mother and father of the family had a favorite son, who they never punished, no matter what he did. One day the boy was playing by the water, late in the evening, and the parents let him stay outside because he was the favorite child. The boy pushed a log into the pond and tried to ride it like a canoe. As he was balancing, something dark and black reached out of the water and pulled him under. His body was never found, but late at night, if you look at the far edge of pond, you can see the boy's spirit struggling to escape the water.\"\n\nI believe he told us this story to scare us from trying to cross. However, being a strong willed child, I ignored his warnings. We continued laboring on our new raft, and when it was finally ready we launched. About 20 feet from shore, our little boat came to a sudden stop, and we were nearly jolted into the water. We peered over the side, and watched in horror as a ghostly white form slowly rose toward us.

{"body": "Well, hang on a second, though. While it's true that you kind of categorically can't prove the supernatural (because it's supernatural and not... well, natural), the problem some of us have in believing in something is both empirical (no evidence despite frequent claims of physical intervention, manifestation, etc) and rational.  \n\nTo put the last one in perspective, which I suppose is where your point lies, I don't believe in something without evidence (e.g., Russell's teapot, unicorns, invisible incorporeal purple dragons, deities, the existence of a higher or \"more real\" reality outside of this one, etc). It's the essence of true agnosticism (atheist/theist or otherwise), I guess-- admitting when you can't be certain of something. To clarify, I'm not certain that any of these *don't* exist, just that I don't believe they do until there's compelling evidence, and in some cases I would outright bet against them despite a lack of certainty (e.g., physical evidence indicates Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster are hoaxes and not merely misunderstood phenomena). It's sort of like betting on a Roulette wheel; some people bet it IS going to be 00, some might actively bet on other things, effectively betting against it. I don't really see the point in betting at all without evidence.   \n\nPart of my beef with it is that it's all unfalsifiable. To illustrate and explain, my position was solidified when a friend of mine (possibly mentally unstable at the time) had come to the conclusion that reality might not be real, and we had a phone conversation about whether killing yourself meant you could go to the \"real\" reality. I was vehemently opposed because *there's no way to actually test this, making it an unfalsifiable hypothesis*. It may be an extreme example (consideration of the problem of unfalsifiability in the face of a suicide-related outcome), but to me it's illustrative of the problem with the reasoning in general, whether or not lives are on the line. If you can't *test*, much less have the opportunity to *falsify* a hypothesis, then there is no reason to have an affirmative, much less strong, stance on the issue.  \n\nNot to denigrate your views, but that's just why some people (I suppose those that share my views, anyway, not sure how the majority of /r/atheism for instance would work) don't really dig the supernatural or find it a reasonable or rational view (both are certainly debated a lot, often with relatively uninteresting results). Basically to me all claims of the supernatural boil down to that same falsifiability problem, and back to the friend on the phone.  \n\nTL;DR: Hypotheses that can't be falsified have serious issues, some with more serious implications than others.\n\nAaaand sorry for that, since that was kind of your point about religion and politics on the internet. =\\ Or anywhere, for that matter.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377443528", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Anyways, it was at my high school on a Friday; the night of the first football game of the year. I hadn't seen my group of friends for months because they were on vacation all summer, and we decided we were going to hang out all night. We didn't like football, but that's what we told our parents so we could be out all night. This was when we were 15; there was about 5 of us put together. One of our friends already had been smoking weed for a year, and he suggested that we try it that night. The week before we gave him each $10, and he picked up a decent sack. We went into the forest and used his bong. The first hit I ever took almost killed me; I coughed for about 5 minutes straight. Afterwards, I felt amazing. Everything was calm, vivid and it felt like I was in a movie. As we got out of the forest and headed towards the supermarket to get some snacks, a cop pulled up next to us. I was thinking how stupid I was and was scared out of my mind. He rolls down his window and asks, \"Are you kids up to no good?\" I answered, \"No, Officer, we're just heading to the Safeway.\" His voice instantly becomes angry and he yells, \"Lier!\" He opens his door and shoves me on the ground, and my friends quickly run away in opposite directions. The cop holds me down and yells, \"Give me what I need or you're going to the station!\" I nervously ask him what he needed and he replied, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" Well, it was about that time I realized this police officer was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic Era.

I soon found little value in winning, just expected to do so. Other peoples' accomplishments meant nothing to me - after all, couldn't I do the same or better? So, early on, a superiority complex developed.\n\nThe superiority complex gave me a rather irritating personality, as one might expect. It only became worse as other kids caught up with me, sometimes even surpassing me, and I became irate trying to defend my superiority. As for friends - I expected people to come to me as they always had, and the flow stopped as I became more and more average.\n\nSo there I was as a teenager, alone; but it was alright because I was better than anyone else, right? Years passed, and while everyone else was learning how to function socially, I brooded. \n\nI had originally avoided finding friends and getting into social situations because I felt I was \"too good\" to interact with normal people.  As each year passed I started to realize that I was now avoiding them out of fear. I was scared of the opinions people might form after they met me. After all, I was now socially inexperienced, and there was nothing interesting about me anymore. The best I could do was manufacture social protocols that came naturally to these socially experienced people.\n\nOf course, during this transition I made up all sorts of excuses to defend my ego from my reality. I told myself that I didn't need other people, that they annoyed me, that I was better than them. \n\nLuckily in university I moved in with a really cool group of guys who included me in everything they did, even though I was super awkward and had no idea how to act in most social situations. Fast forward four years, and I don't have the same problems I once had. I am able to communicate and socialize. I am able to enjoy meeting new people and dating women. \n\nI don't have a personality disorder anymore. In June, I proposed to my girlfriend of 2 years and she replied \"Okay, but I need about tree fitty.\" It was then I realized that my girlfriend was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377500338", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was a cold, harsh night at our cabin. The wind was howling, and you couldn't see 5 feet in front of your face if you were to step outside.\n\nWe were a large group of people out on vacation. (In the winter, I know). I was maybe 16?\nOne particular girl stood out to me. She was a brunette, glowing blue eyes, maybe 5'9, and had the nicest breasts. Same age as me.  It wasn't only her breasts though. She was had a great personality, laughed a lot, and just all around fun to be with. We'll call her Jenn.\n\nWe had steak for dinner that night. I had gorged myself, and went to go lay down in my room. Being the first night here, the sheets were fresh, and the pillows were nice and fluffy. I had my shower and lied down on my bed, hands behind my head, gazing at the ceiling, relaxing myself.\n\nMaybe 5 minutes later, everyone else returns to bed. It's about 11 at night, we were all exhausted from the 11 hour drive to get here. We arrived late, hence the late supper).\n\nI wake up to a gentle knock on my door. I glance at my clock, it read 3 am. I called out, and the door opens. Low and behold, Jenn is standing in the door way. \n\nI asked if something was wrong, she said she couldn't sleep. I found that a bit odd, since she had her parents to go to, but hey, I'm not complaining. \n\nWithin seconds, she walks up to my bed and removes her night gown. I'm speechless as she gets on top of me. Her huge breasts are dangling in front of my face.\n\n\"You like what you see?\" She says.\n\nAll I remember is being speechless. Was this actually happening? I'm sure I am living every guys dream. I`m sure of it. Some goddess out of my league knocked on my door at 3 am to have sex with me.\n\n\nIt was a bit awkward, as it was my first time, but she guided me through it, and it was still, to this day, the best sex Ive ever had.

{"body": "I got one-\n\n\nSo I was doing job training in Portland, OR and was new to the town, so a lot of the time I was at my hotel.  Well the TV in the room sucked, and I brought my 360 to pass some time.  I was trying to search for a cheap flat screen that I could get some decent gaming in, as well as find a cheap router I could use as a repeater.  The wireless in the room wasn't fast enough to keep up with online play, and connection speed varied throughout times in the day.  I hate lagging, so I wanted a wired connection.\n\nAnyway,  I was searching through electronics for these items on craigslist, and saw an ad for a fuzz buster, (little device to pick up police radar)  I drive fast, nothing crazy, but usually over 10 mph or so, enough to warrant a ticket.\n\n\nThe ad said that she wanted 40 bucks for some viper thing or another, and needed the money to help pay for her rent.  I know fuzz busters vary in price, and it was cheap enough that if it was shitty, no biggie, just a few hours of work and I could pay it off.\n\nShe lived in Vancover, Wa.  She wanted to meet up at the Vancouver mall, so I googled it.  I was staying in North Portland so it was only about a 20 min drive.  So I show up, wait for her in the parking lot so we can discuss what store  to meet up at.  Text her, she says she will be there in 10 min.  Wait 20 min, nothing.  Text her again, nothing.  So I was like whatever, maybe she stopped for gas or something.  I venture in and do some light shopping to pass the time.  I try calling her, straight to voicemail.  So after an hour I decide to bail and head back to the hotel.\n\n\nI'm driving back, and she says sorry, her phone died and had to go buy a vehicle charger to call me back.  I explain that I am on my way back to North Portland.  She says she could really use the money, and since of her time window she wouldn't be able to meet again for another week.  So I said okay, I can stop at Hayden Island, which is little place for shopping and lottery row between Vancouver and Portland.  I stop at a gas station and text her where I am at.  She agrees to meet, and shows up.\n\n\nI told her I drive a Toyota Camry, and she pulls up.  So this girl shows up and she is smoking hot.  She wasn't dressed up or anything, just some daisy duke jean shorts and a tank top, but she was absolutely stunning.  She gives me the fuzz buster, and I give her the cash.  We part ways, as she gets in her car and I go get Red Bull from the gas station.\n\n\nI come back out, and she is still in the parking lot.  I can tell she is angry, as she is visibly distressed talking to someone on the phone.  I do a simple wave, and go to her window.  I ask her if everything is okay, and with tears in her eyes she says, \"yeah ill be fine, thanks\"\n\nI said, \"are you sure?  You seem a little stressed.\"  She then goes on to explain how she just got kicked out of her apartment, and with her busy class schedule she couldn't work much to afford it.  Her parents abandoned her, and it was just her trying to pay her way through college.  I felt bad, so I offered to buy her lunch.  She agrees.\n\n\nWe grab a bite at Hooters, (not the best choice but it was right across the road) and we sit down and talk about her financial obligations.  She lived in a studio, so I couldn't imagine her rent being that high, so I offered to lend her some money to get by another month.  I asked her how much she needed, and she said, \"Bout Tree Fiddy\"  I then realized I wasn't talking to some hot girl, it was this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era, so I said \"no god dammit you ain't gettin now tree fiddy!\"\n\n\nI then ran out of Hooters scared to my life, jumped in my car, plugged in my fuzz buster and beat it back to North Portland.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377539624", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

You're not gonna \"sneak it\", unless you pull a long con, or people near the restroom are sleeping. In my case, we didn't really do either. I mean, we tried to sneak it for a bit, but it's not like the people in the back are just going to forget someone went in there, and then not notice as another person goes in 5 minutes later. Whatever, we were stupid teenagers at the time.\n\nAnyway, the story. There was this girl on our robotics team named Kim. I mean, she wasn't *that* hot, but we flirted occasionally. I was a pretty dorky kid in high school, so this was a big deal for me. Well anyway, we were on a plane from NJ to Atlanta, GA, because that's where the competition was (F.I.R.S.T. Robotics). Well the plane takes off, and me and her are sitting in the back, across the isle from eachother. We're chatting and flirting for awhile, and about halfway into the flight, she wispers into my ear that she wants to join the mile high club. Being stupid and naive, I said \"How are you gonna do that?\" She just kinda looked at me for a second and said \"with you, stupid. Meet me in the bathroom in 5 minutes.\" She then got up, and went to the bathroom right behind us. \n\nSo, here's my big mistake. We were both sitting with our fellow teammates, and our seats were right next to the bathroom. I wait 5 mintues, and then head back, and of course, our teammates *obviously* notice she's not back from the bathroom yet. Whatever, I wasn't thinking about it at the time, I was just a horny teenager. So I go in, and she's there waiting for me. She still had her clothes on, but as soon as I got into the bathroom, she locked the door and started kissing me pretty heavily. It was a good time. Then we make our way to undressing. We were getting pretty into it (which was 2nd base stuff, at the time), when I hear a very loud knock on the door. Kim and I freeze. We wait for what feels like forever, but it was probably only a couple of seconds. Then the loud knocking starts again, and I hear \"RGood! Kim! Get out here, *now!*\", and that's when we knew we were busted. Damn. So we scramble to put our clothes on, and I open up the door a crack. I was super embarrased, and not really sure what to say, so I just said \"Um.. what do you need?\" Our mentor had the most dissapointed look on his face ever, and then just said \"I need about tree fidy.\" It was at this point that I realized our mentor was an 8 story tall crustacian from the paleolithic era!

It became our go-to drinking spot.\n\nWell, there was one night we were up there, and after many shots of Admiral Nelson, my friend decided to go get his laser pointer and shine it onto the houses around. We were having fun pointing it through people's windows, until we saw a car drive by, and had an even better idea.\n\nYup. We were going to shine it at cars driving by.\n\nThe first few didn't go so well, as we were pretty drunk and couldn't keep the spot at one point for very long, let alone follow a moving vehicle.\n\nThat was until we saw a big pickup truck come around the corner, and he was cruising. Easily speeding. I picked up the laser pointer, took aim and hit the button.\n\nBullseye.\n\nI could see where the spot hit the windshield, and then the truck took a sharp swerve to the right. It shattered someone's front fence, before coming to rest halfway into a car in the driveway.\n\nFuck.\n\nThe driver managed to get out, and looked in our direction immediately. We had a bunch of lights on, and were being pretty loud. We turn off all the lights, hightail it downstairs, and hope to god he doesn't have a gun.\n\nWe heard him walk up the porch stairs, and he started pounding on the door. Then he slurred out \"Hey you fuckers, look what you made me do!\"\n\nHe was drunk! We might get out of this yet. All we have to do is dispose of the laser pointer, and no one will be the wiser. We went up to the door, and told him to remove his jacket and empty his pockets, so we knew he wouldn't grab anything dangerous, and that we wanted to talk to him.\n\nMy friend opened the door, and he was a mess. Bleeding from the head, bloodshot eyes, and swaying back and forth. I considered for a second calling an ambulance. He then said \"Boys, I need something from you.\" I was confused. \"What do you need?\" my friend asked. \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that the man was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam away into the distance.\n\nWhen we woke up in the morning, the truck was gone and the fence was fixed.

{"body": "When I was younger, we got a kitten named Tiger. I was maybe 8 when we got him, my brother 7, and my sister 3. My sister loved to fall asleep with him in bed and my brother would draw him. Great, patient cat.\n\nFast forward a couple of years. He was big enough to run around with me in the backyard. We'd play a game where I'd walk along the top of this rock wall we had, and he'd walk along the bottom. When one of us switched, the other would. My parents hated it because A. They were afraid I'd twist an ankle or fall off the wall, and B. They didn't want their wall destroyed. I still did it anyway, whenever I was home alone.\n\nOne day  we were walking along the wall, me on top, him on bottom. Suddenly, I felt a large rock twist under my feet and I lost my balance. In my scramble to regain it, the rock tumbled off the wall, but I got myself righted again and kept walking. But I realized he wasn't beneath me.\n\nI looked back to see him stuck under the rock, which had landed right on his upper body. It outweighed him twice over and he was struggling to get out. I stared in shock and didn't move for a minute. When I saw he couldn't get out from under, I ran over to him. I got to him right as he gave his last breath. He looked right at me with his two big yellow eyes and died in front of me.\n\nI sat in blank shock for about five minutes. I was about ten and had only recently become aware of the concept of death, but was in no way ready to comprehend it yet. I didn't know what to do. It was at that moment that I heard my dad's car pull into the driveway.\n\nIn a panic, I rolled the rock off Tiger, scooped him up, and frantically searched for a place to hide him. Finding none, I carried him around the side of the house and squatted behind a bush. I heard my dad whistling as he went in the sliding screen door of the back porch, and calling my name as he entered. \n\nThe next idea just came to me fully formed, and I didn't think for a second about the ramifications of it. As it was entering my head, I executed it. I ran around the front of the house, ducking beneath the windows, and over to the driveway. I put Tiger next to one of my dad's tires and wedged him under it as best I could. I then ran to my room (avoiding my father), dove under my covers, and refused to come out till dinner.\n\nThat dinner was tense. My mom was quietly furious, my dad was in a state of abject horror. As if he had just murdered his children's pet cat. That night, my sister refused to go to bed without Tiger, and cried and screamed for an hour before she finally passed out. A few days later, she was beside herself, refusing to even come out of her room.\n\nAbout a week later, my dad came home with Tiger in his arms! My brother and sister were beside themselves with joy, and I faked joy as best I could. But this cat was older, and heavier, and one of his eyes was a little glossed over. I knew it wasn't Tiger, but I kept my mouth shut, as the only way to call it out would be to reveal myself.\n\nThis Tiger didn't sleep with my sister as often, but she got used to it. He actually started to sleep with me, sitting down at the end of my bed, curled up between my feet. Occasionally, I'd look down to see him just staring up at me. I'd move him off the bed, but I'd often wake up later in the night to find he had joined me again.\n\nOne night, I woke up when he walked up my legs and sat on my chest. He was staring right at me with his yellow eyes, one slightly glossed over. I couldn't breath. I felt my ribs breaking under his incredible weight, and the green scales on his hide were wet and covered in a film. \n\nHe leaned in close to me and said, \"I need about tree fitty.\" It was at this moment that I noticed this cat was about 500 feet tall, weighed 8 tons, and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377719861", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

Get text from her at like 1 to 2 to 3 AM (Cut yourself some slack you're high as balls) saying shes gonna be in the city and wants to meet up. Cool, something to do when you get back home.\n\nStep 7: Meet her in the city and spend a wonderful time together. A romantic full day date in NYC during Christmas time. Ice skating at Rockefeller center, carriage ride through the park, NY pizza(ftw) and a bunch of window shopping at the bazaar by the park and Macy's.\n\nStep 8: Walk her back to the hotel she's staying at\n\nStep 9: \"Brrrrr, can i come up and warm myself in your room it's just so damn cold.\"\n\nStep 10: When she leaves room for a second pull the naked man.\n\nStep 11: Step 10 was a joke don't actually do that\n\nReal Step 10: Some small talk about the wonderful date, after a few minutes of this use some metaphors or similes to tell her how beautiful her features are(eyes, nose, smile, etc.)\n\nStep 11: Make a move. Put your hand onto hers and stare deeply into her eyes.\n\nStep 12: As you stroke the hair away from her face, you realize that even after what should have been an amazing, romantic day/night you don't really have any feelings for her. Well it's too late now, its do or die time so move in for the kiss.\n\nStep 13: After making out for about 10-15 mins she asks you if you have any rubbers.\n\nStep 14: \"FUUUUCK, i'll be right back.\" No, she says she'll go, in fact she 's quite insistent about it. Fuck it, at least offer to give her the money for them. At first she says no, but right before she closes the door to leave the room she turns to you and says \"Actually, on second thought, I don't think I have enough money could I get some from you?\" Your response \"Sure how much do you need?\" And in reply she whispers to you \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It is around this time you realize that this girl is about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster has gotten you again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" You yell as she swims away into the distance.\n\nStep 15: Sorry I've never posted anything this long before and couldn't resist the opportunity to throw in a tree fiddy joke. \n\nReal Step 14: Of course you have rubbers on you. Don't be a fool, wrap your tool. Cover your stump before you hump. Especially in December, gift wrap your member.\n\nStep 15: Well you've done the deed. It was not at all how you'd imagined it and you feel a little empty on the inside.\n\nStep 16: Leave ASAP.

I exit the bathroom and proceed to my seat but the laughter starts again, and it's louder, it's fucking louder! I can feel it vibrating through my body, exiting my fingertips. Oh why will it not stop. I close my eyes\n\n   Alas I open them again, but everything is different. Nobody is on this train anymore? I ask myself \"What the fuck is going on?\" I get up and decide to look for someone, calling out for someone, anyone! but nobody, not a goddamn person. I get to the end of the cart to the engineers room. I open the door and there is my daughter, but something is off. I get closer and ask her what she is doing here. SHe looks up and says \"I want tree fiddy\" It was the goddamn lockness monster posing as my daughter!

{"body": "Tooth decay has been around a long time but it's been wide spread only since the beginning of the 18 century when the production of sugar began on a major scale. 19th century's refined white flour made matters worse because people have started combining sugar and flour to prepare various desserts and the combination of these two sticks to the teeth for a longer period of time. \n\nWe eat more sugar than in the past that's why if we wouldn't brush our teeth for a month we would start seeing the effects of it: decalcification, swelling and pain of the gums caused by the persistence of plaque. \n\nBut ever since the beginning of times people have observed certain correlations between their diets and the state of their oral health and came up with different solutions for them. For example, the foods that people in the Paleolithic era would eat were raw and rough which led to early wearing out of their teeth, a problem which was partially solved in the Neolithic era when they started to boil their food, making it softer, but which eventually led to more dental caries. \n\nAlso, something that differentiates us from ancient people is the size and shape of our mandibles. The tendency in evolution is that the jaw becomes smaller which means less space for our teeth, causing them to become crooked. This is a factor that increases the retention of food in the interdental spaces, areas which are hard to clean, which leads to more dental caries and periodontal problems. \n\nWe have quite some information about the means which they used to clean their teeth, as well. Gold toothpicks, [miswak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miswak), toothbrushes that were made from animal hair (very, very bad for your teeth; plus the handle was made from animal bones, so kinda creepy, too), various homemade mouthwashes, prayers (yes, ancient people thought that cavities were an expression of a bad spirit that was inside you so they used prayers and such), chewing on certain leaves that were said to have astringent properties, but the thing that really helped was that chewing on them for a longer time meant producing more saliva which washed all the plaque off the teeth.  \n\nThese were not as effective as our modern toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash and the fact that we can go to see a dentist pretty much any time, still dental caries are widespread and are affecting a lot of children and young people and I have seen quite a few people in their 20s and 30s needing dentures because they didn't take proper care of their teeth.

If something exists you are more likely to find evidence of it than if it doesn't (obviously). So not finding evidence should lower your probability of something. How likely it should lower your belief depends on how much you'd expect to find the evidence.\n\nOr from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence): \"In some circumstances it can be safely assumed that if a certain event had occurred, evidence of it could be discovered by qualified investigators. In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence.\"\n\nFor example, I've read some things in physics where we don't see evidence for it (yet) but they don't think our instruments are capable of actually detecting it. So the lack of evidence isn't very strong evidence against the phenomenon.  (edited to add: Here is an example in [evolution](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/16/experimental-evolution-and-the-false-solace-of-theyre-still-bacteria/) I read today)\n\nBut in other examples, for example Nessie, the absence of actually documenting it is pretty strong evidence against it's existence as we'd expect someone to have seen it after all the searching if it were real.\n\nMaybe your Dad could offer some perspective as an archaeologist, but most people seem to think that a large complex civilization would leave some evidence if it were real~~?~~ .

As a Third Level Wumbologist, I study the glorious ratio of Mini to Wumbo and document my findings.  The Wodgett Theorum postulates that Wumbo always has existed in a limited form along this Wumborama timeline axis.  The Wumbo that we know today however was derived from a vector occlusion in which Early Wumbo fields overlapped with a solar event which caused a complex meta-crystallization of the Wumbolo Plane.\n\nWumbo is neither real nor imaginary, it lies in the vast abyss between.  It can be felt, tasted, seen, smelled and heard however only when you're not expecting it and also only when you have no way to document proof of it's existence.  In this way, Wumbo seems almost sentient and magical in the same way that Bigfoot, UFOs, and the Loch Ness Monster can unfocus cameras.\n\nNow for the record, Wumbo Is Not Magic.  It is firmly grounded in Science.  It can be measured in the background radiation of the fabric of the cosmos, it can be seen hiding in the shadows on those grains of rice they write your name on at the fair.  Wumbo can reversed quite simply by flipping it along the vertical axis, creating Mini where there was Wumbo.  When flipping along that axis, it is very important to translate your previous coordinates to compensate for Drifting Scale issues.\n\nWhile Wumbo is a wonderful concept, it is direly important to remember that abusing the relationship of Mini to Wumbo can cause you to do quite horrific things like shrinking all of your neighbors and keeping them in a pickle jar until their screams and your guilt cause you to attempt to reverse your work.  Terrible, sadistic things. \n\n**TL; DR: WUMBOLOGY! The study of Wumbo! I Wumbo, you Wumbo, he, she, me...Wumbo. Wumboing, Wumborama.

{"body": "I have, I accidentally starting kissing my friend's mum when we were pissed up at Christmas. She is like 50 odd and it was all just a huge mistake, she started grabbing my cock and pulled me into her room from the landing at the top of the stairs. She went down on me and started sucking my cock, I was thinking the whole time 'this is weird as fuck I shouldn't be doing this' but she was really good at it, like basically swallowing the whole fucking thing.\n\nAnyway, it carried on for a bit before she grabbed me by the dick and pulled me onto her bed, undressing instantly. I was like 'well fuck it, we've come this far, might as well go through with it' and so I carried on.\n\nI started licking her pussy, tasted nice, especially for an older woman... for some reason I assumed it would be nasty but it wasn't. It all felt horribly wrong but at the same time my boner was basically ripping through my boxers so I wasn't stopping for shit. I slipped a couple of fingers in and she started moaning like crazy, told me to put more fingers in. I continued until I had like 4 fingers up there, she was still moaning like fuck so I put my whole hand in there, she was going crazy, writhing around in ecstasy crying 'MORE! MORE!' so I continued fucking her with my whole hand. Still she was saying 'MORE! MORE!'.\n\nI was still licking her pussy with my whole hand up there, I didn't know what to do next so I was all like 'what more do you need?!' and she was like 'I need about tree fiddy.' I said 'what the fuck you mean you need tree fiddy?' She just said again 'I need about tree fiddy.'\nIt was about that time I realised that my friend's mum was in fact an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era! I said 'damn you Loch Ness Monster! I aint giving you no tree fiddy, you get your own damn money!' and left immediately.\n\nAfter that we never spoke of it again and I regret the whole thing entirely.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, I don't really understand what it is/does but cheers.

{"body": "This is kinda long but here it goes.\n\n  It was the summer during football camp. I would get a ride from my friend, who was also my teammate to the practices. His mom would give us the rides there. Except this one time I would never look at her the same again. She gave me a whole term to sex.\n\n   She had seen me grow so fast making the scene more erotic to her. The blonde hair she had with the cleavage of a pornstar. I asked her that day on June 16, 2009 what it's like to be a women. While her son was in the house getting dressed she whispered to me while breathing down my neck gently, that i would understand soon enough. Now me only being 14 at the time my body felt as if the wind was knocked out of me. Giving me an erection on the spot. She notices and smiles at me.\n\n     While my full on erection embarrassing, I felt comforted by her presence there in the car. After the practice she drops her son off at their house and continues to drive me back home. She pulls over to the alley behind my neighborhood and parks the car.\n \n    She unzips my pant slowly building up the ride of my life. Her hands slowly moving up and down my body. I felt the urge to return the favor and started to tease her tight freckled breasts. She gets out of her seat on to mine, she is now on my lap grinding her panties on to my penis. She starts to speed up.\n \n   Then she stops. We gaze into each others eyes and she told me to promise her something. I felt the sexual tension in every part of my body. \"What ever you need I'm there, I promise.\" \"Good\" she so willingly told me. \"Cause im going to need bout tree fiddy.\" \nI ran out of the car crying my eyes out as if they had been torn from my soul. I have not spoken to Ms. Aaron until her funereal. The funeral I gave her after I killed that slimy bitch.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Very Erotic tale of how I had sex with my friends mom, 10/10 must read.\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377992182", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -34, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "A while ago I was walking back home on Halloween (got abandoned by friends at a night club so just went home, being an introvert). The streets were dark and I was about to get on the main road. I could see the lights just up ahead but from around a corner 3 guys appear. I couldn't see them very well, but they start walking up to me, and shout \"Hey!\" Naturally, this scared me and I turned back around. Two more guys were behind me and I couldn't run. They get closer and closer and I'm just stood there panicking. As they get closer I start to make out these guys all look homeless. I have no idea what to do and I just imagine these guys mugging me.\nOne starts to get closer, and he says \"I'm not going to hurt you, I need something.\" Foolishly, I ask \"What do you want?\" and he says \"About tree fiddy.\" Didn't have the change to do my washing the next day.
