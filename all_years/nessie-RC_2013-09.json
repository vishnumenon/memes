{"body": "Story time!\n\nPicture, if you will, a beautiful summers day, and five young teens awandering through a forested area. One of them, an attractive blonde girl, spies a fairly well constructed rope swing over what should not be called a river with rocks in it so much as a long line of damp rocks. Nevertheless, our heroes decide it is too nice a day not to spend a few moments enjoying the rare weather and this gloriously places rope swing.\n\nThe lead of this tale, a bespectacled young man, dashing and yet shy, has been trying to catch the girls attention for some time, to no avail, but here he finds himself with a rare opportunity. \"if\" he thinks to himself \" I can prove myself braver than the others, surely I can increase my chances with the lovely lady?\"\n\nA plan is formed, and so the next few minutes are spent seeing who can best launch themselves over the river and land back safely with the others. It becomes obvious that their young bodies can only propel themselves so far.... Another plan emerges in our heroes mind.\n\n\"I shall attempt\" he declares manfully \"to go *backwards*\".\n\nThe next few moments go in slow motion, and then all at once. His hands feel slippery. He takes his run up. He decides it is a bad idea to attempt the backwards jump just moments after his feet leave the ground... And then darkness.\n\nMoment pass, and suddenly he hears voices. They are calling to see if he is okay, lying face down and very still in the watery rockery as he is.\n\nHis reward for this foolish errand? A summer holiday with his arm in a cast, a collection of facial scarring, and absolutely no change of affection from the gorgeous blonde.\n\nAnd yes, that boy was me. And no, no-one asked anyone for tree fiddy.\n\nTL;DR - if you're going to decide that using a rope swing is a bad idea, do it before your feet leave the ground.

{"body": "High school in Switzerland.  I was out on an \"expedition\" with 3 friends.  This is a weekend camping and hiking trip sans teachers.  It was supposed to teach independence, self-reliance, and good decision making.  Two outta three ain't bad, all things considered.\n\nWe got slightly lost, and took a trail which ended up being more of a deer trail, which faded to nothing.  Looking at the map, we saw that there was a train line down hill from us, which we could follow back to where we were supposed to be, and it would save us a long slog back up the path we had just come down.\n\nSure enough, the train track was there, and we turned onto it, with a hillside up on our right, and down on our left.  We came to a turn in the track which went around a protrusion in the mountain.  \"Around\" is not the correct word unfortunately, and \"through\" is a little more appropriate.  This was NOT a tunnel, but they HAD blasted an open topped trench ~30ft deep in the mountain at the bend.  It was also long enough that we could not see the other side.\n\nAt this point in the story, the title of the thread gives the climax away, but needless to say, as a teenage boy, I was goin' in.  Sure enough, halfway down the curve, I hear the train coming.  there was NOT enough room for me to step to the side, and aside from that, I was wearing a huge hiking pack.  I glanced back to my somewhat smarter  friends at the entrance and they all had the same, \"deer in headlights,\" look on their faces. Naturally:\n\n\"Well, I'm Fucked...\"\n\nI did however, manage to dive to the floor and lay flat against the base of the granite wall.  The train passing by ripped off several of the straps on my pack as the closer sections of the train passed, and the noise and wind were on a \"pants-ruining\" level.\n\nHaving NOT died, I can say that the driver screeched the train to a halt, and ran out screaming and looking for the corpse of the dumb-fuck kid he thought he killed.  Having confirmed Darwin did not have his way, he dashed back to the train.  (being late as a train driver in Switzerland is punishable by death)\n\nI heard no more of it, excepting the shit my friends have given me since about having used up all the luck I will ever get all at once.\n\nTL;DR  I took the time, you take the time.

{"body": "DISCLAIMER: **Very** long post, the sex part is at the end, but without the set up it kind of sucks. Tree fiddy free guaranteed.\n\n\nNot long after I had graduated my gf went full retard and decided to dump me for no apparent reason. I was confused and devastated but luckily I had just gotten a job which kept me busy.\n\nNow, I had another job. I was the 'official photographer' of the organizer of drum'n'bass parties in local club. I loved the music, and it was a pretty enjoyable way of getting paid. \n\nNow, in this club some time before I made friends with a regular, Tom. He's 5 years younger than me, but he's also into photography and asked me for some advice. He often came with a fairly large group of people, including this ridiculously hot girl: a head shorter than me, black bob cut, black eyes, piercing on her eyebrow and upper lip, solid B cup which looked like a C with a push-up, tiny waist, [tramp-stamp that temped you 24/7 to unwrap whatever was covering her round ass](http://www.busbones.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ribbon-lower-back-tattoo.jpg)^1 , always dressed in dark colours (and a tad slutty).\n\nWe had been introduced before, but I had seldom talked to her as she always acted like she was a bit too aware of how hot she was, and as I had a girlfriend I didn't even try - better stay away from temptations.\n\nAnyways, a few days into being dumped again, I go to that club even if I wasn't working and there wasn't any big party with Tom. The girl, Julie, is there with a friend, and as she and Tom were friends, we were dancing close together. For the first time we exchange a few words, cock takes over brain, hit on her, score, we make out.\n\nDidn't manage to bring her home that night as she had promised to spend the night at her cockblocker friend's place, we exchange numbers, facebook etc.\n\nNow, the following days, apart from the job I had found, I was working with Tom at a Dinosaur exhibition for kids, taking pictures of them riding a triceratops and a horse-sized t-rex. It was a good workout as it involved lifting pig-sized kids all day long. \n\n2 jobs + clubbing = I had slept 4 hours in 3 days. When we were about to get off, she text me and says she was free for the evening and if I wanted to do something. Cock takes over brain. Despite the fact that I was seeing pillows everywhere, I obviously agree. Tom warns me that she's nuts. Cock doesn't listen.\n\nSince she lives practically outside town, she offered to take a bus into the city. I picked her up there and drove her to the other side of town as, being tired and all, I wanted at least some fucking good beer, so I went to the best place for beer in the city.\n\nAnyways, that's when I got to know her, and the **hate** started flowing trough me. Here are some of her traits that I had discovered:\n\n\n-She was still in school, but 1 year behind as she was too lazy to study. Had no idea of what to do with her life apart going out with friends, wanted to go to college and *major in philosophy because it sounded cool to say that you study philosophy*.\n\n-Hated *every* kind of animal except cats.\n\n-[**Alektorophobic**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alektorophobia). *Very* alektorophobic.\n\n-[**Ranidaphobic**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_frogs). *Mildly* radinaphobic.\n\n-A tad racist\n\nNow, I don't remember too many other details as it was over 1 year ago, but in general she acted like she was some kind of celebrity, while her only asset was the fact that she was hot. \n\nAnyways, it was a hell of a turndown, she was extremely annoying (although I had enjoyed the story of how she almost got ran over by a car to run away from a pigeon that was allegedly attacking her), and I was so tired that I thought to myself 'I'm gonna offer to pay for her cab with the excuse that I haven't slept in days'. We go out for a smoke, and she jumps on me. Cock takes over brain. \n\nI insult the bartender by asking for a double espresso in a bar where they have over 50 different craft beers and countless premium whiskeys, and, hoping to land a blowjob, embark in a drive to her place. Drive that, considering how far it was and the mix of sleepyness/horniness/heartbreak/drunkness felt a little bit like ['In the Mouth of Madness'](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113409/).\n\nI finally get there, but unfortunately she doesn't seem willing to give me head. Now, I need to point out that I'm pretty tall (184cm) and that my car was **very** small, to the point that I was having some minor back problems caused by all the driving around because of my jobs. I hated fucking in my car. It was great when I was younger because sex, but after over 1 year with a nympho SO I was used to do it around the house where's there's lots of space.\n\nAnyways, I am there, so we park the car in a recluse spot (of a very recluse part of the most recluse suburb of the city, so it was pretty safe), and move to the back seat. Take pants off, I'm about to 'position her', when in a bossy way she pushes me and says *'Sit down. I'm going to do the shagging*^2 . \n\nFinally something that turns me on after all the animal and asians bashing at the bar, so I let her work her magic. \n\nNow, I was so horny that I got it up despite the fact that I was in a tiny car and despite the lack of sleep which was starting to seriously cripple my brain functions, so I let her work her magic. However, because of the aforementioned facts, I wasn't really enjoying it. Maybe it was also the fact that after the display of sluttyness I started questioning my decision of sticking an unprotected cock inside her. \n\nAnyways, I almost fall asleep. She slaps me awake, asks me what's wrong with me. I say that I am too fucking tired to fuck, *and asks me if I want to see her tits*. I agree, and I don't regret *that* decision. However, I was still too tired and my back was starting to hurt. She finishes off (*or so she said*), I drive her back to her door, then drive back to the secluded spot and pass out there.\n\nFortunately a couple weeks later my gf went out of full retard mode and we got back together.\n\n**TL,DR Got dumped by nympho gf, after 3 days without sleep got horny to the point of having sex in a very small car with a racist hipster who's terrorized by chickens and frogs.**\n\n**Fall asleep during the act, she tries to wake me up with her tits and fails.**\n\n^1 - Not an actual picture of her\n\n^2 - Since I don't live in an country where English is the primary language, those are not her actual words, but I couldn't came up with a better translation.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377999757", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ahh, I have a story about having broken arms, doesnt involve my mom though. Let us begin the revival of this dark moment in my life. \n\nI was an introvert mostly throughout High School. I didn't go to many parties, nor did I have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked.\nUnfortunately, when it came to actually getting with a girl, I had no idea what I was doing. \n\nIn 11th grade there was a party around my school's christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it. His brother was hosting the party, so that'd mean there would be older girls. Unfortunately, the week before I had broke both my arms in a snowboarding accident. One are was in a full cast, the other arm just has a hairline fracture, and only a small cast. So I could still move that one alright. Naturally, I was reluctant to go to the party due to the injury, but I eventually agreed and told him i'd go.\n\n\nI went to the party rocking one arm with a full cast, and the other with a small cast. At the party there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where from. I still remembered her name though, Vanessa. She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her. Maybe she has a soft spot for injured guys? I thought to myself.\n\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me.Make up some cool story about my injury? I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\n\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible. (Which wasnt very seductive now that I recall). She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back. I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\n\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of. Here was some awkward dude with a full arm cast, and the other with a small cast chatting up a girl by telling pedophile jokes...Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\"\n\nShe asked about the injury. I told here I got it from snowboarding down a hill. Told her it was a big run and put in a few jokes.\n\nShe laughed even more.\n\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl. How i had done so with two fucked up arms was beyond me. But then it dawned on me. I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where. A strip club. Vanessa was a stripper. Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.\n\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment (which was pretty damn uncomfortable under my casts) as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously. My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once. I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\n\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\n\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house. This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue. I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself. My arms were kinda dangling by my sides very awkardly.\n\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone. A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms. I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside. I was pretty in the moment, but still thought about how awkward i looked with my arms being broken.\n\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\nIn the next minute she had put on the condom on me and she was starting to take off her clothes. I was just sitting there struggling with my least broken arm to get my shirt off (she'd already done the pants) \nFinally, she was fully naked, as was I. She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.\nBefore i fumbled around my my least broken arm trying to put my dick in her she said, \"wait\". Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\" I couldn't believe it. This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin. I still can't believe it. I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock. She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to. I told her I was a virgin too and she said good. As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\" \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\n\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life. My arms healed well for those wondering. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378038236", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

Sometimes she did,  most of the time she didn't.\n\nI realised I had to get out of the marriage when we were having sex and she was telling me to hurry up,  or playing with her phone during or flicking channels on the tv.\n\nNeedless to say i wanted out and I asked her how much it would cost for me to get a divorce.\nShe asked why and I explained it was due to the lack of sex and intimacy in the relationship. She agreed it wasn't a healthy relationship and agreed that we needed to split. She agreed we couldn't go back, she hugged me, took an deep breath and said\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNow it was about this time I realized that the wife of mine was a 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \n\nThat goddamned Loch-Ness monster had tricked me again!!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378051132", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

At the beginning of the summer, I said something because heavily suspected she reciprocated; turns out she's liked me back for even longer.\n\nShe said she wanted to talk about it before we risked our really close friendship, then proceeded to avoid the subject like the plague for the next few days.  Three days later, I went over to her house around 11pm, and we sat on the driveway and talked it out; we were both going away for the summer (I was couch-hopping across the country, she was studying abroad in the Mediterranean), so that made things even trickier.  The biggest rainstorm of the summer hit around 11:30pm, but we stayed out there and kept talking through everything.  Eventually, we decided we'd go for it, at least for the rest of the time we were in the same area.  Me, being your standard awkward never-having-kissed-a-girl-before guy, said something to the effect of \"cool\", and got up to drive home.  She followed me to my car and said, \"wait, Shadowthunder... ~~I need about tree fiddy~~\" and kissed me in the middle of the street.  Took a couple tries for me to get it right, but eventually she said \"all right, that one wasn't so awkward\" and went inside.  I know we both walked away with a huge smile that night.\n\n**So yeah**, first kiss was with my best friend and crush of several years in the middle of a summer rainstorm at 1am. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378052425", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

But my friend Nessie, who was in the girl scouts at the time, and apparently had seen more of the world than us, showed us how to french kiss. It quickly stopped being so innocent, although I still really don't think it was anything more than innocent fun, either way.\n\nAfter a while, we stopped caring about the bottle and before we knew it we weren't just kissing, but we were rubbing up against each other, and eventually she started reaching her hand down my pajamas, and really going at it with me. At this point pretty much everyone else was off doing their own thing, but still we went at it, right in front of them. Before anything really happened though, she pulled her hand out from my pants and sat back against the bed, and asked me if I could do something for her now.\n\nAt first I was hesitant, but slowly I leaned up against her and ran my hand through her hair. I asked her what she needed me to do, and how I should start, and she looked at me with her big brown eyes, and she said \"I'mma need about treefiddy.\" and that was when I realized this girl scout was eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era, and I looked at her and I said \"Dammit monster, I ain't givin you no treefiddy.\" and she said \"Well how about just twofiddy?\" I said, \"Oh, now it's only twofiddy.

Unsurprisingly, he's never even seen south park, but he heard a friend of mine end a story with 'imma need tree fiddy' and the resulting laffs. He says that when he was a kid, they would do the same thing basically, tell a long, drawn out story that eventually ends with something to do with the queen, I think she chops off your head or something, he was a bit vague (he's old). The interesting thing was that he could trace the origin of the story back to its original source, despite it being spread through oral tradition. The story had spread among paper-boys from the local newsagent, who would sit around telling jokes and whatnot before work, waiting for the papers to be dropped off. One boy in particular was basically the 'cool kid' of the group and he had a few little buddies that would mimic everything he said, thinking they were just as funny. This was the kid that started it. As the newsagent was central to the delivery area, many of the boys went to different schools or lived in different neighbourhoods and spread the story to their peers, who then went on to spread it more and more. My grandfather, being one of the original boys, knew the origin but kept his mouth shut, just as a sort of sociological experiment that he kept to himself. One day a group of kids found out that he knew the original kid (the cool guy) and they all berated him for the rest of the day, saying that they just **had** to meet this kid. My grandfather, having better things to do, agreed reluctantly. The next day my grandfather meets this kid at the newsagent in the morning, as usual. He tells the kid that he's a local celebrity and that he's going to bring a bunch of kids from school to meet him. This kid had another job after school (yay the 40's), so he declined, but grandpa gave him a 'can of pop' and he changed his mind. 'I tell you what,' this kid says, 'seeing as I'm skipping work, I could even do a few jokes i've been working on.' Now this kid was hilarious at improv, so his practiced jokes must be incredible thought my grandpa. 'Awesome!' Grandpa says, 'want another can of pop for your troubles?' It was at about this time that my grandfather realised that this kid was a 12 story tall creature from a lake in ireland or scotland or something, the accent was hard to pick. 'Imma need about tree-fiddy.' he says. Grandpa was not one for taking guff, so he told him in no uncertain terms where to shove his jokes. The end of the day comes around and all of the kids were horribly dissapointed, but in the end it was for the best. Sometimes a jokes origins are best left unknown, lest the knowledge spoil it. I guess it can be compared to when you really love a song, then find out the artist was a racist douchebag or a wifebeater or something (looking at you, lennon).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378185151", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Our \"truth\" is whatever can be believably explained to us.  \"Fiction\" is the rest.\n\nYou seem to be rejecting the deterministic universe because you believe that you (along with the rest of humanity) are special, and that there must be separate rules for consciousness.\n\nIn essence, your previous conditioning of \"I think, therefore I am\" has led you to reject the concept of determinism.  Ironically, that rejection is determinism in action.  Your \"choice\" to reject this idea was already predictable based on your life experience.\n\nThe beauty of the universe currently, though, is that we don't know your life experience - and you probably don't realize that it's making your decisions for you.

Not 100% of the time, at least.  Which is why you or anyone else rejects determinism.  But just like the rest of the universe's particles, our concepts of logic are slowly coalescing into bigger and more complex things capable of doing more.  At such time that our system of logic is able to predict every single thing, that's when determinism will become painfully obvious.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378229843", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I don't know what it was that made her so drawn to me. She would always try to subtly figure out where I would be after work. Like, if I was going out to a bar or going to the mall or something. My answers would be vague but occassionally she would figure it out and show up. It would b so awkward. If it was at a bar for example, she would just shadow me all night.

I just didn't have the tact necessary to gently let her know that I didn't like her.\n\nEventually, a \"perfect storm\" of events conspired to push me towards getting intimate with her. I had been out one night with some friends and had met a lovely young lady. Things were going great but her ex showed up and convinced her they needed to talk or some shit. I was too much of a pussy to get her number right in front of him. Suddenly depressed, I decided to just get wrecked. My friends had left and who shows up an hour later? My stalker coworker.

Its a move I've been saving for someone special,]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dut5x/if_you_could_have_any_super_power_for_only_10/c9u2dt8 ) but I can maybe practice it on your freckly ass?\" I drunkenly offered.\n\n\"I don't have any money so wil you promise to get me pizza at some point,\" she countered.\n\n\"Done!\" I said and proceeded to ram my tongue down her throat-hole before venturing out into the night.\n\nSo, we got back to my shithole of an apartment. I sat her down on my couch and slapped her boobs around for a bit while Moulin rouge played in the background. After abou twenty minutes, she told me to take off my pants. I stood up, slipped them and my undies off in one motion and, [while my dog dog looked on in silent approval,]( http://i.imgur.com/h5GYaFq.jpg) I stuffed my semi-erect intoxicated penis into her mouth. I'm not going to lie, that night I had enough tequila to sanitize the genitals of every NBA player at this years All Star game after party. The little guy was having some issues standing up. I told her to get two popsicle sticks and some warm jello. She said she didn't need props. Sure enough, she got everything in working order and began to merrily pound away. Thanks to how inebriated I was, the sex lasted about three times as long as usual. To this day, that four minute love-making sesh remains in my top ten for longest duration.\n\nWhen I finished, I used her shirt to clean up the semen. Something about ejaculating made me sober up a bit. Where a few minutes ago I wanted nothing more than to have sex with this girl, now I just wanted her out of my apartment. I tried to be subtle about it. I asked when she had to work in the morning. I mentioned how I had to get up early. Even offered her some beef jerkey. She declined.\n\n\"There *is* one thing I need, though,\" she said.\n\n\"Uh, what's that?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this time that I realized that I had promised this girl some pizza. At some point, she had mentoned her favorite slice was bacon ranch, which cost about $3.50. I gave her $5 and she went on her way. Work was awkward for some time afterwards. Luckily, she got fired for stealing toilet paper after a couple of months.\n\n**Tl;Dr** Had a one night stand with a girl I never liked and had no intention of ever dating.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378242404", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 171, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Very long.  I remember every detail.  It felt like it lasted for years.\n\nBit in the future, but the world was recognizible.  I was working for an undercover military team in Edinburgh, Scotland.  We were working to stop the plans of an organization that wanted to escape earth, colonize a new planet, and blow up our solar system.  They believed they were genetically superior and felt it was their duty to destroy all lesser genetic material.\n\nI came in late on a mission.  The group had discovered some sort of natural weapon that would make their goal a reality.  The team I was with brought me up-to-date on it all - the weapon was a pair of orbs.  They didn't know how large, or where they were, and the mission was to find them before the bad guys did.\n\nWe went exploring in the woods.  I was given an ATV and a walkie and sent off while the rest of the team did the same.  I remember seeing one of them in the distance.  He was blond with green eyes and a very handsome face.  He flexed his arm at me, and it was covered pit to wrist in Rolex watches.  It made me feel really uncomfortable, so I drove in a direction I knew he wouldn't follow.\n\nGot to a location that the team hadn't explored yet.  I got out of my ATV and started walking through the forest, looking for something.  A bush caught my eye and something told me to rip it up and dig.  I thought to myself, how illogical is this?  But I did it.  And after half an hour of digging, I found them.  The orbs.  One was pale pink, the other pale green.  They fit in the palm of my hand and pulsed a strange, warm energy.  I pocketed them, walkie'd the team, and got back in my ATV.\n\nWhen we got back to base, they showed me a book about the orbs.  It was in a strange language that I had never seen before.  The blond man with green eyes asked me if he could have the orbs while I was looking at it.  I reached into my pocket to get them, and a switch went off in my mind.  It felt like I was in a trance.  I got small flashes of understanding from the strange symbols on the page.  I picked it up and went through it.  There were drawings of strange creatures.  I told the man, \"No,\" and walked out of the room to my quarters.\n\nHe came in a few hours later with some forms.  Asked me to sign.  I put the orbs on the counter and picked up the form.  As I read it, I didn't like what I saw - it was essentially signing over possession of the weapons to him.  I smiled and said I'd get some food in the kitchen for us.  Took the orbs with me and put them down on the counter.  He followed and started yelling at me.  I heard a loud crack behind me.  One of the orbs had broken.  It was an egg.\n\nThe creature looked like a tiny, slimy, loch ness with big bug-like black eyes.  It had a small mouth which it used to coo at me.  I stared at it, not surprised - it was the creature in the book.  The man screamed, moved towards me, about to attack, and a second later he was gone.  I looked down and saw a pile of goo where he used to be.  The creature tilted its head and cooed again.\n\nThe creature had the ability to \"pull apart\" compounds and make them isolated atoms.  When they reform (as they only remain isolated atoms for a second), goo.  The book was essentially an instruction manual on how to raise this thing.  The second orb was an energy source whose purpose it was to amplify the creature's power as it grew.  I told my team to go bury it in the deepest marine trench they could find.  I went into protective custody and raised the creature in secret for years.  Every once in a while, someone from the organization would show up and try to capture it, but it would defend me, its \"mother\" (it imprinted on me).  I lived with a woman who poses as my half-sister and her asshole Scottish husband.\n\n**TL;DR** Was a secret government operative who found an egg which hatched a tiny loch ness monster that could kill things with its brain.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378251434", "subreddit": "Dreams", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I don't have anything against gay people, but I was made pretty uncomfortable by the fact that there were 2 dudes messing around in the bed next to me. So I left the room and wandered the hall until I came across the blonde's room, there were several people in the room hanging out (bound to happen, only attractive female around with 6 men in the class) So I sort of invited myself in, as the door was open. We are all having a good time until she says: \"Hey, anybody wanna do some bars with me?\" at which the older more mature members of the class noped the fuck out, I was still sort of young and dumb, so I agreed...I had never tried them before, so it was a hell of an experience, at this point there was just me, the blonde, and one other guy. I decided it was too hot in the room, so I took off my shirt, blonde follows suit, other guy sees that sexual tension has been building for a bit and excuses himself, we sort of wrestled around, started feeling each other up, and making out. I was sort of high, and didn't have all my wits about me. As she pulled down my jeans and started working me over, she looked up at me and very seductively said: \"I need something from you\", I'm starting to get really excited at this point, and I ask what it is she needs...she slowly says...I need...I need about tree fiddy.

{"body": "I shared this story already, but I figure I can just copy it to here.\n\nBack in my tech-support days I'd get sent around to various houses. It was the absolute worst because it was usually just some stupidly simple thing that someone couldn't figure out from a phone call.\n\nSo one day I'm in the office and we get a call from this woman who sounded kinda nice, but she was really really dumb. She was having an issue with her \"router thingy\" and she couldn't be more descriptive than that. It was terrible.\n\nSo after a little while of talking on the phone with her, then arguing with my boss, he sends me out to her place to see what the problem actually is. I get there and it's some apartment in this beat-up looking condominium complex. Meh, I've seen worse. So I make my way up the stairs to her place and knock on the door.\n\nWhen she opens it, she's in nothing except for a towel... Like, what the fuck? She knew we were coming. Why would she go and take a shower just then? But she was actually pretty cute... Just saying. So I let her know that I'm here about her router problems and she tells me to come inside and shows me what's wrong. She showed me that her computer was connected to the router via Ethernet cable and that it was on, but she couldn't get any access. I told her that I would take a bit to figure out what's wrong and she went off to get dressed. I only remember that part because she went down the hall and into one of the rooms dropping the towel just as she went out of sight. I got a nice view of her ass and went back to work.\n\nAfter a little while I figured out that the Ethernet cable connecting her router to the wall was messed up. Usually happens when you roll over one of the end with a chair or something. No big deal. I had no idea where she was, so I said something to the effect of \"Miss, I know what's wrong with your router\". She shouted back from the room she went into before \"Oh you did? Come and tell me what it was!\" This sounds suspicious as hell writing it, but at the time it didn't raise any alarms for some reason.\n\nSo I get over to her open door and she still hasn't dressed. She's spread-eagle on the bed and I see everything. I did a little gasp that you do when you're surprised and could only really get out the words \"I, uh...\" She just laid there with this big smile and giggled. So again I stammer out \"I, uh... your router... I need to go\", quickly did a 180 and headed for the door. She shouted after me and said \"Wait!\" She ran after me, grabbed me from behind and said \"I have to thank you somehow.\" I just said back \"Miss, I have a girlfriend. I can't do this now. I'll get you a fixed cable, but then I'm gonna go.\" She let me go after another moment and I made my way out the door. A moment later she came through the doorway and said \"Wait, I'm sorry. I won't bother you again, just, while you're out there, could you grab me something?\" I sighed and said \"That depends... What do you need?\" She smirked and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" At this point I realized this girl was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era! I shouted back \"God dammit Nessie! I ain't given you no tree fiddy!\"\n\n**TL;DR**: Cute girl. Dumb problem.

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied.\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.\nThey were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.\ntl;dr: Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.\n\nCredit goes to /u/Thehealeroftri", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378387187", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

There was very little light polution, since the town this was located in had a population of maybe ~3,000.\n\nOne night in June, on my first week there, I woke up in the middle of the night, to go to the bathroom. I stopped in the livingroom on my way back, and just looked out the window toward the lake. Full moon, so it was pretty bright out. Something caught my eye on the docks. It looked like a small child, but it was hard to tell with the distance. I went down to the dock with a flashlight, and found nothing. Went back to bed.\n\nI completely forgot about the whole thing the next morning. I remembered like a week later, but decided not to tell anyone, since nothing had happened since, and I'd sound like a lunatic. One or two weeks later, the same thing happened, but this time upon going down to the docks, I'd forgotten a flashlight, and just darted down there. When I got there, whatever it was, was still there, and in the most eerie way possible, it SLOWLY sank into the water. No splash, no waves, just small ripples where it was standing. ON THE WATER.\n\nThis time I was freaked out so I ran back to my room and brought it up with my grandparents the next day. They said they'd seen something similar but never really thought anything of it, and never bothered to go investigate. That night, I pitched a tent down by the lake, and waited. I got woken up sometime around 3am, by the sound of water rippling. Like something moving around in it, or someone swimming.\n\nI got out of the tent and looked out at the water, and saw it. I tried to talk to it, but it turned out to be the Loch Ness Monster.

{"body": "This story always makes me laugh :\n\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\n\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\n\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.\nThey were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.\n\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\n\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\n\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\n\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378591846", "subreddit": "r4r", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "October 19th, 1964. Tokyo.\n\nIn his final hour, Dave knew his career had ended. A slip-up like this would not be forgotten for weeks, if not months. His handkerchief gripped tightly in his sweaty palm, he walked out of the press booth. He wasn't sure if he felt shocked or calmed by what he had just said. He knew Larry, his fair-haired broadcasting coworker, thought it was hilarious. It had gotten a few laughs, sure, but the mistake was glaring, glaring enough that he may as well quit while he was ahead. And that's when he saw it.\n\nA samurai display. Not just any samurai - well, Dave wasn't really sure, it could have been any samurai. The armor and sword shone brightly under the hallway lighting. He had seen pictures of samurai in the airport, plastered on t-shirts and billboards, and of course in those films with bad English dubs. This, though, was *right here*. This is *real*!\n\nHe reached out and took the sword from the display. Feeling guilty, he looked around, realizing how foolish he would have looked trying to explain himself to one of the staff. \n\nRemoving the samurai sword from it's sheath, it made a pleasing, leathery sound. He knew nothing about swords, so it surprised him that it did not make a loud *sshhhiiiinng* when he pulled it out. It turned out that real samurai life was probably not as glamorous as in the movies.\n\nDave's mild annoyance at this brought thoughts of his job bubbling back to the surface. What is he going to do now? This broadcasting gig was the best thing that had ever happened to him. NBC wasn't about to just let him stay after that unprofessional, tactless comment. He wanted to leave. He just wanted to leave everything and everyone behind and run. A tearful grimace had formed on his face. He wanted...to end it, he supposed.\n\nThe sword felt heavy in his hands. Cold. Exquisite. Propping it up with the blade facing toward himself, he hesitated. He thought about saying goodbye to his coworkers, thought about giving them a handshake or something before he committed *sepuku* or *sapokeoo* or whatever it was the Japs called it. Not worth my time, Dave thought. And with that he threw himself on the blade.\n\nDave opened his eyes. He felt a terrible pain in his gut. *Fuck*, this hurts, he thought. All he could see was the hall ceiling. Looking down, he saw Larry using his handkerchief to soak up blood. \n\n\"We've called an ambulance to take you to the hospital, Dave.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"You know, next time you try to kill yourself, make sure you're using worthwhile products.\"\n\n\"What?...\" He wasn't really sure what his coworker meant by that, but the question was soon answered as Larry held up the broken samurai sword pieces. \"How?...\"\n\n\"Read it.\"\n\nLarry showed him the piece that was just the handle and a jagged shard. Inscribed in the metal were three words: Made In China. \n\nDave smiled for the first time all day. Larry smiled, too. He smiled a little bit too widely. \"Dave...Dave, I want to sell you some graham crackers.\"\n\nThe blood loss was making Dave woozy, apparently. \"You...what?\"\n\n\"Graham crackers. Do you want some?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure. How much do you want for 'em? All I have are a couple of quarters and three ones, so--\"\n\n\"That'll do.\" he said.

{"body": "No, you are misunderstanding me, and I thought I'd made myself very clear multiple times now. I don't really care what the particular claim is. If you are invoking the supernatural, I will dismiss the claim because there is no way to verify whether it is true or not. I only care about what we can know to be true, and we cannot know anything about the supernatural, so I don't care about the supernatural.\n\n&gt;  I'm not saying that any book demonstrates the truth of a claim, I'm saying that certain books set out the actual claims - the Bible doesn't prove there is a Judeo-Christian god, but it does say what a Judeo-Christian god is - you can then dismiss the claim or independently verify it.\n\nNegative. As I said before, you **cannot** verify **anything** if the claim is that it exists in the supernatural. Also, if the Bible set **the** claim for the Judeo-Christian god, then there would be only one Christian church. However, every church interprets the Bible differently. Ergo, the Bible sets for the claim for every single Christian church based on the interpretations of the people reading the book. \n\nIf your claim involves the supernatural, I can easily dismiss it because I do not believe there is anything outside of the natural world. I don't believe in the supernatural. I don't have to know what is claimed about a particular deity, because I don't believe there is such a thing.\n\nHowever, if you can show me that a supernatural entity exists, then I will believe it exists. Unfortunately, nobody has ever been able to prove that any supernatural entities exist. \n\nIt would seem there is a fundamental difference between us. You believe in the supernatural, and I do not. But guess what, if you can show me the evidence of a worldwide flood (which is in pretty much every religion, but not a single shred of evidence supports it), then I will accept that it occurred. Since you cannot, I do not.\n\n&gt; This is very simple, really: you can't dismiss an idea or concept is you have absolutely no information about it.\n\nThe moment someone tells me about something in the supernatural, I have the information they present to me. I don't have to read their holy book. I don't have to read a book about the Loch Ness monster. You can tell me about it, and I can then say, \"Well, it is impossible for one monstrous creature to live in Loch Ness. There's not enough food, and there would have to be multiple creatures because things don't live forever. People have gone over the entire loch with sonar and no Loch Ness monster was found.\" I don't have to read a book about the Loch Ness monster, and I don't know why you keep claiming that I must before I can dismiss the claim that it exists.\n\nTo say that you must read every holy book out there before you can determine whether or not they are true is just...silly. I mean, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity are all based on the same myths. Which one of them is correct? Have you read all of the holy texts on these religions? Have you read the books of the Bible that were not canonized? If not, then you haven't read all of the texts on the subject, and so you don't know what the Judeo-Christian god actually is.

{"body": "I have this thing where I try to help people get to more stable situations and then they fuck me over in the end. Mostly, it has been my family.\nThis is a very long post, and I mostly wrote it all to vent, but I do think the first two parts give some insight into the final story. \n\n1. When I was 18, my older cousin was getting kicked out of his deceased grandmothers house by his estranged father. He had attempted suicide a couple months before, and was unemployed. \nI had just set out on my own, was renting a room and living off of a landscaping job. I let him stay on my floor, I helped him get food, I let him take some of my hours landscaping. Every day, he would expect me to entertain him for the day, spent the sparse few dollars I could give him for food on cigarettes or beer, invite himself on any social outings with my friends, and call me pussywhipped because I tried to call my girlfriend regularly while she was abroad. Eventually, I used some connections I had to get him a job with a growing restaurant, and he made enough money to get himself a place to stay. He immediately stopped showing up to work, and would tell me I should come visit him and he'd get me a coffee or lunch for all I had done for him, then when I arrived, say that he actually didn't have any money, and would ask if I could cover it. \nShortly thereafter, I found out that his mother had a brain tumor, and though he had spent years telling me that his mother was much worse than my neglectful, emotionally abusive mom, he cut ties with me because I mentioned he got what he wished for the many times he wished his mother were dead. I get this can be a delicate situation, but it wasn't a big loss for me, until I realized that his mother actually worked really hard to provide for her kids, and he was probably an entitled little shit with her as well (while mine expected me to start paying for my own food and clothes when I was 9.)\nAt this time, I figure the problem is him. \n\n2. When I was 20, I moved 200 miles away from the rural farm town I grew up in to Providence, RI. After a year there, I was tired of struggling with a pretty exorbitant rent payment, and didn't have many friends there, but a coworker had a nice apartment available for only slightly more than I was paying at the time. A friend from back home said he was in a similar situation, and would be really happy to move there with me, but at the time, he didn't have the money for a security deposit. I didn't think this was a big deal, and as long as he transferred his job, we would be fine. I arrange everything, I help him move, I pay my rent and the security deposit. He didn't get his transfer. Not entirely his fault, I had transferred too, and they dicked me around until the last possible second. But I tell him he HAS to get a job, but that should be a cinch since he actually has a lot of qualifications, and even served in the air force. Every day when I come home from work, he is playing video games or smoking cigarettes ($8 per pack or so in RI, and he had a new pack every day.) Another month goes by, and he is short on rent, so I pay that, too. Another month goes by, and I can't pay his side, but he finally had gotten a job, so he sets up an arrangement with our landlady so he can pay back what he owes directly to her without me having to worry about his half.  \nAfter four months, I find out that despite him having a job, he hasn't paid any of the rent he owes. He promises her that he will start paying.\nAfter 8 months, I find out again that he hasn't paid ANY of his rent, even though he ALWAYS has money for cigarettes or new video games. I tell him I would like for him to start getting his paychecks direct deposited into my bank account, and I will give him a small amount for food. He seems uneasy about this, but agrees. Around this time, his girlfriend from back home moves to Providence with some strangers, not really knowing anything of this situation. \nInstead of setting up direct deposit, he COMPLETELY disappears for a few weeks, leaving me to take care of his cat, which is basically feral, and despite being over a year old, is still kitten sized. I realize she is severely malnourished. I basically harass his girlfriend until a check for his portion of the rent shows up in the mail, with a letter explaining that I will be better off if he disappears. Even though I would be stuck with about 8 months of unpaid rent. I eventually talk his (very rational and kind girlfriend) into forcing him to come and talk it out with me. She comes over with him, says that things haven't been working out at the apartment she was living in, and agrees that he should just set up direct deposit, and we can then split the rent 3 ways. \nI got our landlady all of her money back, and I get all of my money back, except for the security deposit. At a certain point, my girlfriend broke up with me, my two managers at work disagreed about my job description and this was causing me a lot of stress, and I was basically just sick of the city, so I told my roommates I was moving, and then found out a week later that my roommate had lost his job. \nI had the realization that people who are in bad situations probably did one thing or another to get there, especially if they stay there. After Providence, I moved to Philadelphia with nothing but $500 to my name, not ANY friends, NO connections, NO job, and in a little over a year have gained the biggest friend group I have ever had, and have finally gotten a job that offers me some kind of future. \n\n3. When I had moved to Providence, my older brother had a wife, a great job, and had just bought a house. I always looked up to him, and if not for him, I probably would have killed myself as a teenager.\nIn the present, while I was dealing with a really stressful situation at work where a coworker had stolen money from me, I found out that my brother was about to be homeless in Nashville. After story 1 and story 2, I have reservations about helping ANYONE, so it is a very difficult decision for me, but I tell him that if he is ready to get his life back together, I do have connections and would be able to help him out here, but if he alienates these connections, it would be the worst possible thing he could do to me. \nHe finds a job almost immediately, and starts working while staying on the couch at a communal apartment I had been living at. One of my roommates works at a, well, upscale beer store, and has a LOT of beer around. After a few days, my roommate realizes that an inhumane amount of this beer has gone missing, pretty much overnight. Like, it was enough that it would keep a regular person drunk for a week. \nSo I had to kick my own brother out on to the streets of one of the most dangerous cities in the US. All the while, he adamantly denies that he took any of it, while he is clearly drunk. This is also the first time I have ever seen my brother cry, but it is also the moment that I realize the full extent of my brothers problem, and realize that while I still love him, I can't trust him anymore. \n\nI realize that I have some degree of responsibility for these situations. I knew there was some risk every time, and ultimately, I don't regret the decisions I made. I was able to offer people opportunities, and so I did what I could to make their lives better, and they made their decisions with what to do. That said, I don't think I am going to go out of my way for anyone else for a while. \n\nTL;DR: you can keep cats looking like kittens by not feeding them, but this is very cruel and they will hate you.

While that can be the default position on claims that don't matter (\"I had eggs for breakfast\" -- Ok sure, whatever),  the default position on major claims should sit between \"probably not\" and \"we don't know\", depending on how likely the claim is, when considering everything else we know surrounding the claim.\n\nConsidering Christianity is based on a book that contains stories which we now know not to be true (the flood, the ark, Adam and Eve, etcetera) and very unlikely claims(a talking snake, a unicorn, rising from the dead, etcetera), I would submit that the default position should be closer to \"probably not\" than to \"we don't know\".\n\nI don't really care about winning debates, but I do care about believing things that are true. If there is insufficient evidence to support a claim, or evidence pointing in the other direction, I can't believe what is claimed, and hope others feel the same. That doesn't just go for religion, but for homeopathy, acupuncture, the loch Ness monster, Bigfoot and the moon landing hoax alike.

{"body": "I do have to agree with you on homeopathy. Acupuncture may have more validity than we think, though I can't say definitively. While teaching English and psychology, and studying marital arts, in China I learned enough about energy flow in the body to think that they might be on to something. Additionally it does seem to be effective, beyond the reach of the placebo effect, for some conditions. Nessie is a good personal friend of mine and I can tell you she gets quite upset when people say she doesn't exist, so, maybe keep that one under your hat, just a bit. \n\nI am not a Bible apologist. For me religion is an attempt to do a few things. Firstly it is an attempt to make sense of this universe, and in that effort it pulls in a lot of intuitive understandings that exist in our collective consciousness, as well as revelations and inspirations that people have had, sometimes as a result of extreme devotion, introspection and meditation (sometimes in the form of prayer). I neither accept or reject these off-hand. I test them against my own sense of what seems right and true, based on my best efforts at understanding myself, others and the universe. Some things will resonate intuitively (though I admit they are hard to test in double blind studies). Secondly, it tries to understand and explain God. Part of this effort is a bit of personification, in an attempt to make the understanding of God accessible to the masses. However, all language based expressions of these theological issues are, at best, estimations and approximations. Our language is too linear in its structure and too limited in its lexicon and its references, to be able to accurately express, or make declarations about something as ethereal and profound as the Creator of the universe. The daoists had it right when they said \"the dao that can be spoken is not the eternal dao.\" So when atheists use the Bible to discount the existence of God I have to say they are taking things way too literally. However, to be fair, they learned that from Christians who sometimes take things much too literally as well. I do, however, think that wondering whether or not we should take things literally, is missing the point as well. Consider this: what if the physical universe is a metaphorical, or illusory, representation of reality, so that our whole existence is really an abstraction of reality? We are the metaphor, life is a metaphor. All of the things that we think are real are really not (this perspective is supported by physics as you probably know, things that we perceive as solid are not really solid, and so on). Then the way that we use the word \"real\" has to be brought into question. So when we are reading something, its literal truth, or realness, becomes less important than whether or not we can learn something from it (assuming that our *souls* are more connected to the eternal reality than are our physical beings, and that our purpose here, in this physical iteration, is to grow our souls as much as possible before we move on to the next iteration). We often learn things from poetry without worrying how literally *true* the poem is. And that is, for me, a better test of Christianity. Am I growing from what I read? Am I learning to be more loving and more forgiving? The things that Jesus taught have profound Truth in them. And, yes, we can learn better ways to think about, and treat, the poor. We can get better perspectives on prioritizing things in our lives, and what *power* really is. We can learn about the sublime and profound nature of Love and what eternal life really is. Just some *grist for the mill* for you. \n\nPeace to you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378692258", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes, I can recommend several!\n\nFirst is a show called **Mysterious Planet**, from the New Zealand comedy group Moon TV. It follows two idiots and their camera men as they try to make dramatic documentaries for the History Channel. It's particualry cathartic in a world of Da Vinci documentaries and Ancient Aliens. Also it's awesome. Each episode is 28 minutes long. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO-FPYrf6uI) my favorite clip and here's a link to all the episodes.\n\n[Episode 1 - Bigfoot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY0_SWjqAB8&amp;list_pxtube=PLF94E471369ADBABA&amp;index=21)\n\n[Episode 2 - El Dorado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBgo9OKvee8&amp;list_pxtube=PLF94E471369ADBABA&amp;index=20)\n\n[Episode 3 - Loch Ness Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o8Hv8DRm9k&amp;list_pxtube=PLF94E471369ADBABA&amp;index=19)\n\n[Episode 4 - Roswell Aliens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0ZjIbYdIKA&amp;list_pxtube=PLF94E471369ADBABA&amp;index=18)\n\n[Episode 5 - The Mummy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQE-FukLhzA&amp;list_pxtube=PLF94E471369ADBABA&amp;index=17)\n\n[Episode 6 - The Bermuda Triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tyL_bcaZOs&amp;list_pxtube=PLF94E471369ADBABA&amp;index=16)\n\nI'd also recommend [**Blackadder**](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Blackadder/70140363?locale=en-us). It follows various Edmund Blackadders throughout history. In the first season (which I advise you to skip) he's a prince in the early 13th century, in the second he's a noble in Elizabeth's court, in the third, he's George IV's butler, and in the fourth, he's an army captain in WW1. The first season is not funny at all, but it improves significantly in the second season. It really is one of the funniest shows out there. \n\nThere's also **Horrible Histories**, a British show that pokes fun at various things from history.  Here are some of my favorites.\n\n[Athenian-Spartan Wife Swap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLyW5UYPYYs)\n\n[Stupid Deaths - Edmund II](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbeozXrw4E4)\n\n[Elagabalus' Lottery](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6ESsouohLg)\n\nGetting away form our historical theme, there's also **Dredge Appraisal** from the Onion. It has similar dry humor and makes fun of Antique's Roadshow. It follows a man who appraises things dredged from a horribly polluted lake and slowly descends into madness as he navigates his Kafkaesque guild rules and deals with terrible customers. Here are some of my favorites.\n\n[Zionist Literature](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyRqstSA-ug)\n\n[Invasive Snake Eggs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjrpo62uGJc)\n\n[Suspicious Hat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n7x4HQ1DhU)\n\nAnd I just realized that I spend far too much time on youtube.

(His parents were away we were home alone for the weekend) and I was cool with it i thought as long as I didn't interfeer everything would be fine. So there they were in the kitchen about an hour later, they had not started yet and were trying to figure out the doses for each of the ingredients. I can say that it was definitely shit meth since it was freaking home made but anyways they were gonna try. Then my cousin asks me to step outside our get something to cover my face (for the fumes). So I got a glove mitten and covered my mouth and nose with it while I looked at the process. \n\nNow as for your question the process was actually pretty similar to the one used in BrBa the only thing is that it was not done at an industrial level.

{"body": "**Drippers:**\n\nI'd go with the IGO-L and the IGO W after that. They're inexpensive and heavy duty. The L is easy and the W is more extensible. You'll need either a variable voltage mod or a multimeter for testing the coil build before firing on a mech. Seriously. Even then you have to be careful not to short the coils when you stuff the wicks into your chimney. You don't want to hard short a coil on a mech. I think kidneypuncher.com is selling igo's and man they ship fast, good prices.\n\n**Batteries:**\n\nFrom what I can tell it's AW IMR batteries that you want. I've had guys tell me that they get better performance from stacking two 18350's, and I've seen reviews complaining that all in all it's a pain that isn't worth it. For me an aw imr 18650 is bees knees. But I've never stacked two tree fiddy's so I don't know. \n\n**Juice:**\n\nWhen I make a fresh batch of juice I let it sit open in the dark for 24 hours. Light *will* degrade flavor. After that I let it sit in the dark cap closed as long as I can wait ( usually a few minutes ) as long as a couple of weeks opening it up and sniffing it every once in a while. Seems to be good. I would not let a bottle sit open for days, just instinctively. VG: High vg ratios, while I do like the texture of the vapor and the way it hangs in the air, do not hold flavor near as well and do seem a little harsher in the front of the mouth somehow. I drink more water when I'm vaping the thick stuff or I get all parchey. My 88/12 is awesome thick but I think I'll go back to 70/30 or so. I think some online stores that allow customizing vg/pg also allow adding an extra flavor shot. \n\nI hope some of this helps. I know a teeny little bit. Ask back or PM me anytime.

You even look at someone wrong or say the wrong thing and you could get a snooker cue across your back and a bottle in your neck. That's where I grew up.\n\n\nBefore we were 11, me and my best mate Hodge were able to keep our noses clean mostly- maybe a bit of shoplifting or setting a bin alight but mostly we were good lads. This changed when we started helping the local dealers shift a bit of gear up and down our flats. As it was all in one block it was felt that we would know the people we were selling to, the police wouldn't see us and it would stop the dealers having to go up and down the lifts all day. Everyone's a winner. \n\n\nSo it was a simple setup. The customer would buzz down to the floor, give the dealer their order, we would get the package and have to run it up to whatever floor they was on, get the money and run it back down to the dealers. We were making good money and in a weird way I actually enjoyed the work- you could have good banter with the people in the blocks and they knew who we were working for so we never had trouble.\n\n\nThat is until I lost some money. \n\n\nTo this day I don't know what happened. Levi buzzed down to Frank (the dealer) with a big order. I collected the gear, took the lift up the 16th floor, gave it to him, got the cash- counted it and took the lift down. Within the space of the 10 minutes it took me to get outside the money was gone. No idea where it went. As soon as I was patting down my pockets in front of him Frank knew what had happened and he did not take well to thieves (genuine or otherwise).\n\n\nSo Frank grabs me by the scruff of my neck and marches me back up to the client. Levi is fucking adamant he gave me the money and I back him up. This makes Frank even madder. He marches me into the lift to look for it there. No money to be seen anywhere. At this point Frank is seeing red- he had anger management issues to say the least and he fucking hates being mugged off- especially by a kid. So he pushes me up against the side of the lift and pulls a knife to my neck.\n\n\"I'm going to cut out of you whatever you fucking owe me\" he spat.\n\n\"How much was it again?\"\n\nAt this point I got tears rolling down my cheek but I manage to choke it out.\n\n\"Tree Fiddy\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378820672", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The funny part is that the cause of the Phoenix lights is known, and pretty obvious.  Sky Harbor has a huge air traffic control system covering a vast area, so the only north-south flight corridor mostly for helicopters, available to and from the Phoenix metro area is up the Verde River.  Commercial aircraft avoid it like the plague.\n\nBut that corridor is also used for USAF experimental aircraft from Nevada, (as well as now, drones) en route to far off the San Diego coast, which is about the only place that military aircraft can go supersonic anymore.\n\nIn any event, one of these experimental aircraft was over the northeast Metro area, coming south over the Verde River, when they did the equivalent of blow out their transmission.  Importantly, they could still silently hover, and had to have their flying lights on to avoid collision, but otherwise they just drifted with the breeze.\n\nEventually they drifted into the desert south of Phoenix and landed, where they were able to be recovered without interference.\n\nBut then, the official disinformation campaign began, full throttle, and it was a work of art.  It was hilarious to watch, if you knew it was disinformation, almost like a spy comedy movie.  They pulled out all the stops, injecting bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, etc., as much as they could, taking all sides of the argument to push the truth as far away as possible.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378827633", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "OK i'll explain what is happening.\n\n\nSo we join a dwarven pirate crew because they just saved our hides from a horde of elves and angry peasants (long story), and we pretty much had no source of income as of yet because we had been adventuring in the wilderness for the past 2 levels. We each have only  two or three magic items to our names so we jump eagerly at the prospect of getting some loot. We sign a contract saying we won't betray the dwarven crew, we will act in the interest of the crew, etc.\n\n\nThe pirate captain (Odrin) explains that we will be coming up on a party boat soon, and that the prince of a nearby wealthy kingdom will be on it. We are tasked with kidnapping him while the dwarven crew manages other things. We also ask where we can keep our dragon egg (another long story) while we are on the ship, and Odrin says that the safest place would be the brig, where his crazy brother Wonk is. We go speak with him, and are concerned with what he will do with the egg and are about to leave when one of our members, Prof. Sycamore, says that we will trade the egg for a potion.\n\n\nNow, this story would not be complete without explaining Prof. Sycamore. Prof. uses a homebrewed class that functions pretty much like a pokemon trainer. He is a deranged hermit that has lived alone most of his life, and only got into adventuring because he fell into a hole and found his first \"Pokemon\".\n\n\nSo Prof. accepts the potion Wonk gives him without asking what the potion even does and we sigh and just give up on arguing with him. We are soon after called to the bridge to prepare for boarding the other ship. By the way, this is an AIRSHIP.\n\n\nWe are given grappling hooks by Odrin and the ship drops out of the sky. We land in the water and the dwarves start pulling the party boat towards our ship. When it gets close, our party jumps over and starts to look for the prince. However, the crowd of people running around gets in our way more than we expected. So our Wizard who, by the way, is a shade falls out of the sky (He had jumped off of the ship while it was falling) and materializes out of his cloak that his raven was carrying. He casts prestidigitation to make flames come out of his mouth and intimidated the shit out of everyone on the boat. Partygoers everywhere jumped ship. Through an unexpected turn of events, the prince is escaping in a submarine and the whole party is either drowning or looting the ship. Prof. Sycamore, who is in a form that makes him into a strong (+7 Str) and slow as ass lobster, chucks my character (Xavier, a modified Soulknife) like a torpedo towards the submarine then chugs the potion.\n\n\nThe potion turns out to be a potion of tongues, and Prof. asks the DM if he could speak whale. The DM says sure, the potion of tongues DOES let you speak any language, but there are no whales around a lake so he would have to call for other animals. Prof. calls for any animal to help him catch the prince, and a 20 ft crocodile appears and swims towards the submarine. The crocodile chomps the submarine in half after a few rounds, and I end up at -1 inside its mouth. Luckily, I roll a 20 on my first fort save and am able to do one action, so I take a healing potion from my belt and chug it, then stab the crocodile on my next turn, which makes it spit me out. Now we are being attacked by a 20 ft crocodile who is probably a good 5 levels above us, because it easily did 20 damage to me. Prof. calls for a loch ness monster to help us, so my DM being cool as hell gives him a 3% chance to summon one from the depths. He rolls a 99 on his d%. The 30 ft loch ness monster (it was actually some sort of dinosaur) and alligator start duking it out.\n\n\nMeanwhile, an elven ship arrived around the time that the alligator chomped the submarine in half. Our cleric of Pelor summons a hippogryph and readies his grappling hook. He plans to capsize the elven ship by pulling on the top of its mast. Every time the cleric declared an action, our DM calculated if the physics would actually work. After one failure our cleric successfully capsizes the ship. \n\n\nThe wizard was mainly looting the party boat, but he summoned a porpoise to get the prince safely back to the dwarven airship. The dwarves, with guidance from the wizard, harpoon the porpoise and drag the prince on board.\n\n\nWith 1 ship sunk, (We accidentally sank the party boat due to Prof's weight cracking several holes in the hull) 1 ship capsized single-handedly, a 20 ft crocodile defeated, and a pince captured, the party made their way back to the airship.\n\n\nThen the session ends.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378843040", "subreddit": "gametales", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Dad pulls up, driving on the grass in his hurry to get to Mom, sees me, and say, \"It's okay Spaghetti, Mommy will be just fine.\" I nod, tears in my eyes, and one of the medics comes over. He talks with Dad, telling him where the ambulance will go, how she's doing, stuff like that. Then the medic notices me, crying silently next to our tree, and asks if there is anything he could get me. I look at him, and say, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It's at this point he realizes that I'm not a human, but a prehistoric monster, and he says, \"Goddamnit Loch Ness Monster!

Believe it or not that's a real position, and that was me.\n\nI didn't really believe in any of this kinda stuff so it wasn't a big deal for me, he'd pick me up, we'd go round to some guy's house who's been hearing the floorboards squeaking at night, or who feels a presence when he's sitting watching the TV, that kinda thing, and the vast majority of the times my boss would just tell them it's their imagination, which it usually was, then I'd go home. It was easy money.\n\nBut the reason I ended up quitting this job, and I haven't actually told this story to many people because it freaks me out to to even think about it, is pretty disturbing. We went out to this house in a pretty normal neighborhood, it wasn't like the movies, it was actually fairly small and modern. Anyway, there was an elderly lady who lived there on her own, her husband had passed away a few years earlier, an avid violin collector. She kept his collection in the attic because they were just taking up space and none of her children were interested in them, but every night she heard the sound of this violin playing the same tune.\n\nMy boss told me what was going on, and obviously I thought she was just imagining it, so I went along as my usual skeptical self, ready to record thin air. It was close to midnight that we made this call, we sat and chatted with her for a little in her living room, expecting nothing to happen, and then she suddenly went all quiet, looked at the clock and said 'listen, it's ready to start'. And sure as anything, this violin started playing this creepy, creepy tune in the attic. So we grabbed our gear and headed up.\n\nIt was full of violins, I mean over 100 easily, but in the corner I saw this strange shape, and I could hear the music coming from it. There were no lights and my camera even stopped working when I pointed it in that direction, fortunately due to the time of year there was a little light coming through the window. I had gone up first with the camera to check things out, and I can't even describe how I felt when I seen this, I was drawn to it. I moved closer, I don't know why, I know you all probably think I'm crazy by this point but I felt both horrified and mesmerized. And then, and I can't explain it, I felt the need to speak, so I asked it what it was doing in this old lady's house. \n\nAnd to my absolute horror, the chilling voice replied... \"There is something....\", \"What?\" I asked. \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I noticed this shadowy spirit from another dimension was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That god damned Loch Ness Monster had got me again. \"Get outta here Loch Ness Monster, nobody around here is givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled, as I chased him out of the attic and away from the poor woman's house.\n\nSo yeah.

Our group was given translators and the translator assigned to the students gave himself the American name \"Tiger.\"\n\nTiger was brilliant.  He went to a #1 school, excelled at sports and was an encyclopedia of knowledge.  He taught us about culture and etiquette and had bartering skills that were unmatched (when we went shopping.)\n\nAnyway, gushing aside- We were with Tiger for almost 3 weeks and near the end of our time together, we got to talking about our aspirations.  He told us that, because he went to a #1 school, he would have a noble profession.  We ended up talking about how cool it would be to become the President someday, asked him what the equivalency in China would be, and Tiger told us that becoming the Prime Minister is the highest honor of all.  A short discussion ensued about what we would do if we were President and then we asked Tiger what he would do if he became Prime Minister.\n\nTiger smiled and said that, if he becomes the Prime Minister someday, he will work to create a stronger relationship between the United States and China, because our nations can mutually improve each other.  The next thing that he will do is gather the Chinese Army, which he told us is the largest on Earth, and sail to Japan and kill every Japanese man, woman, and child- until there are no Japanese anymore because the things that the Japanese did to the Chinese are unforgivable.\n\nMy best friend and I had some awareness about the Sino-Japanese War but we didn't know that such feelings were still held (this was in 2001.)\n\nAnyway, I've never heard anyone like Tiger (he was so brilliant) express such beliefs and promote genocide.  We later met more Chinese youth when we were out at a LAN gathering and they went into detail how public and violent they would make the deaths of Japanese women and children.\n\nWe didn't talk about it again with Tiger or anyone else ever again.

(without penetration) I told my friends all about what we liked to do, but stressed the fact that no penetration had ever occurred. That didnt stop stephanie.\n\nStephanie was a bitch, and much to my surprise, had spread my stories all over the school. She had even gone so far as to add what was said to these stories.

He opened the door, walked to my room, and was greeted by the site of me, ass in the air, shit allll over it. He wanted it. He wanted it so bad.

I was an east coast kid so it was a great new experience. After about 3 days of hot, dusty trails we reach this beautiful clear tiny little lake up in the mountains. It looks amazing. I look to the far side (the side that's stays in shade almost all day) and I see there's a patch of snow on the ground that appears to lead into the lake. Hmm... if I remember my freshmen chemistry correctly, that should tell me that the lake water is going to be pretty close to 0 C. Okay, let's do this right.\n\nI put down my gear and walk up to the edge. I look out and see a nice big great rock in the middle of the lake sitting in the sun. I imagine myself just laying out on the rock in the beautiful California mountains. I decide I'm going to do it. I look to my left and I see a big rock at the edge of the water that creates a natural little cliff about 3-4 feet above the water. I figure the best way to do it is to get it over with. I'm going to walk over there, jump into the water and swim out to the beautiful rock in the middle.\n\nI get ready, take a moment to look at my goal, take a deep breath and jump. Suddenly I find myself clinging on to the rock face that I had just attempted to jump off of. I didn't understand what happened, but I climbed back up and asked the part of my brain responsible for memory what happened.\n\nMe: \"Hey, Memory, what happened?\"\n\nMemory: \"Uh, let's see... it's says here we got an override notification from Survival Instinct. SI shut down all decision making abilities and took over as soon as you hit that icy water. It spun you around, somehow figured out how to grab onto a slippery shear rock face and made us climb back up out of that water. There's a note too. It says 'You're a Dumbass.'\"\n\nA year later and I was leading some freshmen on a similar backpacking trip. Encountered a similar lake. They wanted to swim in it.

Had that way of walking that just dominated the room, perfectly white teeth, that slight scruff on his face that made him look like a mix between Harrison Ford and Nathan Drake from Uncharted. The works. Anyway, he was kind of a care free guy. I'd seen him a couple times at this bar I used to go to all the time back in collage. We'd chat. He'd have awesome stories about how he loved to go cross-country swimming, which I didn't even know was a thing. He said his favorite places to swim were always the secluded lakes in the middle of nowhere. Well, I've never really been anywhere interesting, I'm kind of a shut in (Hence, reddit.) Anyway, over the course of a few weeks we'd continue to chat, and eventually he invited me on one of his road-trips out to a new lake he'd been wanting to visit. He said he'd got a lodge on the bank and had been looking to spend some time up there with someone. Obviously, I felt a bit weird, never really having questioned my sexuality before, but I figure'd he's just in it for the \"Male Bonding\" aspect of it. So we drive out there, it's like a day and a half driving, pretty boring stuff really. We get there, unpack our stuff, I take a nap due to having driven most of the way while he talked, and he went for a swim. I woke up and it was dark outside. I heard him breathing beside me, and it made my heart start to pound. He was so close!! He rolled over next to me, a goofy smile on his face, and started to unbuckle my pants. \"I've never done anything like this before.\" I said, obviously nervous. He just smiled back and said something witty I couldn't remember. Then he stood up and started to undress himself. \"Don't we need like... condoms or something?\" I asked. It almost sounded like an insult. He continued to smile back, and then said something I will never forget. It still haunts me to this day. \"Don't worry man, I got about tree fiddy.\" My mind exploded. As he pulled off the rest of his cloths I saw that he was, in actuality, the Loch Ness Monster in the flesh! It was just a total turn off... So I ran out of there as fast as I could, even stole his car. It didn't matter that I was naked, I just wanted to be out of there.

I though she was tired and I didn't make a big deal of it.\n\nLater, before go to bed, I decided to check if my son was ok. As soon as I opened the door, I saw him sitting in his bed, staring at me. I dont know why but something made me nervous. Maybe was because of his avid look. I asked in sing language what was wrong. Then, shockingly he told me with a deep and unatural voice that he needed tree fiddy. Then suddenly I noticed my son was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he jumped out the room through the window", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378929190", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I decide maybe I'm just being picky or paranoid and that I should at least meet her, she seems cool. We exchange texts for a while and I'm starting to think she's way cool, funny and hopefully looks as good in person as she does in her pics. \n\nWe decide to keep it casual for the first meeting and grab some coffee at a local coffee shop.

She's in school, has her own place, has a killer body and loves to travel. \n\nI mention that I'm doing some remodeling at my place and she gets very interested. She asks what type of remodeling- I guess she's so interested because she's been doing some of her own at her place.\n\nShe says she'd like to come over and check it out, to see what I'm working on.

If I don't, I'll lose the office and my job, and those collection agents who've been tailing me will finally catch up.  The booze keeps flowin', the rain keeps pourin', and the jazz keeps playin' as I wait, sinking deeper and deeper into that dark place of my soul.\n\nAnd then, she walks in.  It's like every guy in there sighed deeply in the same moment.  Tall, she was, in a red dress with a damp overcoat and wide hat.  Hair the color of an autumn sunset in New England, if you've ever been.  She spots me at the end of the bar, and my heart skips at least two beats, as does the drummer.  As she sits down, I can smell her perfume.  French.  Classy.  Most dames who dress like that are.  She looks me up and down, and I feel like I'm on the receiving end to two shotgun barrels.  I'm feeling nervous, and when I feel nervous I go for one of my two magnums.  I only brought the one with me this time, but it's six shots should be more than enough to calm my nerves.  She speaks:\n\n\"So you're the detective, huhn?  Somehow I figured you'd be....taller.\"\n\n\"And you're my contact.  Kinda dangerous for a broad like you to be out in a place like this.\"\n\n\"Don't let my looks deceive you, I can handle things if they get rough.\"\n\nShe crosses her legs, the slit in the side of her dress showing an ample amount of thigh, along with the garter holding a gold-plated double Derringer.\n\n\"I stand corrected.

You never know who's listening, and many walls in this part of town have ears.\"\n\nShe nods, and orders a gin and tonic from the bartender.  Straight, with no lime.  I think I like this dame.\n\nI flip through the file quickly, turning a bit so no one can see me.  It's all there, addresses, phone numbers, bank accounts, wire transfers, names, dates, the whole she-bang.  I got enough here to set this guy up for 30-to-life, along with several of his cohorts.  Payday, it's finally my payday.  This case will have my landlord off my back and my name up in lights.  Might even get the key to the city, if they can dredge the mayor out of his mistresses apartment long enough for him to give it to me.\n\nShe finishes her drink as I thumb the last of the file.  \"Thanks, doll.  You have no idea what this means for me and my clients.  You've done a public service tonight.  Is there anything I can do for you?\"\n\n\"Just one thing.  Can you loan a girl bus fare?\"\n\nI dig into my pocket.  \"Sure thing, how much is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that's when I realized my contact was an eight story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era, and not a sex kitten from a detective noir movie.  \"Get outta here, Loch Ness Monster!

{"body": "I'm going to start this off by saying that I am in fact a girl, and besides a quick fling in college, totally straight.\nThis was when I was 17 years old. At the time, I had a shitty job at a McDonalds. The manager, a female, was about 30 years older than me, and probably one of the creepiest people I have ever met. She would constantly be staring at customers, dropping things to make people look at her ass, that type of stuff. And she was married.\nThe poor guy she was married to will be referred to as 'John' (creative, I know), and the 47 year old creepy lady will be referred to as 'Whoreface'. \nJohn came into the McDonalds once, and I was cleaning tables. I noticed him and waved a hello at him. He was 30 at the time, and not bad looking at all. He proceeded to walk up to me, hand me a note, and walk out of the building. The note itself said 'Important info. 11:30 PM. My house.'.  Now, like I said, he wasn't bad looking, but I was still hesitant to go to his house. After being married for 3 years to Whoreface, he was a really slouchy and depressed guy, and I was afraid he was going to snap and kill me or something. Or, possibly, he wanted to cheat on Whoreface with me, and I was afraid I'd lose my job. But, I decided to go regardless.\nI knew where there house was because I went and TP'd it like a mature adult a couple of times. So, I drove up to it, got out of the car, and knocked on the door. And, what do you know, Whoreface opens the door. She convinces me to come in, where I see that John was sitting on the couch, legitimately crying. To this day, it's the only time I had ever see a man cry.\nWhoreface explained that her life with John was boring, and she wanted me to spice it up. If I would have sex with her, she would promote me and work on getting me a raise. And I did. After about ten minutes of thinking, I had sex with her right in front of her husband. Who cried the whole time.\nAfter the deed was done, and I was feeling extremely disgusted, I sheepishly asked her if she needed anything else before I would ask her when I would be promoted. She looked at me with the most disgusting-horny face I have ever seen, and she said \"Yes.\" I gulped down my pride, expecting the worst. She said in what I assume was a seductive voice to her: \"Can I borrow tree fiddy?\" I then realized that Whoreface was actually a three story high crustacean from the Paleolithic era! \n\"God damn you, Loch Ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I screamed as I ran away faster than I had ever ran before in my life. \n\ntl;dr I had lesbian sex with the Loch Ness monster.

Here's what actually happened.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Kay: Tame, there's something I need to ask of you...\n\n\n&gt;Me: What?\n\n\n&gt;Kay: can you stop bullshitting everyone?\n\n\n&gt;Me: Wha... wait what?\n\n\nI make a quick \"wtf\" look to W\n\n\n&gt;Kay: focus on ME (a la Joker). Seriously, everyone knows so let's just get this over with.\n\n\n&gt;Me: Knows... what?\n\n\n&gt;Kay: OMG you are soooooo cute when you act like this.\n\n\n&gt;Me: ??????\n\n\n&gt;Kay: About us. Everyone knows we're going to be official so can you just stop hiding your feelings.\n\n\n&gt;Me: What the fuck are you talking about?\n\n\nI signal W to come over\n\n\n&gt;Kay: NO W STOP WALKING OVER HERE\n\n\nHe still comes anyway\n\n\n&gt;Me: W what the actual fuck? Why is she saying we're meant to be together and that everyone knows it?\n\n\n&gt;W: Beats me, first time I'm hearing this.\n\n\n&gt;Kay: Come on, you broke up with IV for me! Remember, I told you about how you needed a real woman, you said \"lol yeah\", and you broke up like a week later?!\n\n\nOh fuck, talk about an unfortunate series of events.\n\n\n&gt;Me: I didn't break up with IV because of you, we broke up because we knew it wasnt serious and we wanted something more serious. I assumed you were joking\n\n\n&gt;Kay: babe come on stop bullshitting me\n\n\n&gt;Me: stop calling me babe, why did you ever think I liked you?\n\n\n&gt;W: yeah he has standards you know\n\n\n&gt;Kay: The fuck W? What does that mean?\n\n\n&gt;Me: guys its okay, Kay I'll never date you, just stop this please\n\n\n&gt;Kay: Why? Is it cause I'm fat? \n\n\n&gt;Cue are you fucking kidding me face. She misses it, continues her fat logick.\n\n\n&gt;Kay: I'm not fat, I work out, I'm very healthy. I WAS IN SOFTBALL.\n\n\nWhat W is about to say is the first time I ever hear and after he says I try to stifle my laughter\n\n\n&gt;W: Kay, you were in softball and you were on the team, but you didn't do shit. Whenever I came to watch your games you'd always be on the sideline and when Mrs. S had you go up to pitch you'd bitch about having to get up off the sidelines. When I watched your practices you wouldn't even be doing the exercises, you'd just sit around. I have 0 idea how you're still even on the team.\n\n\n&gt;Kay: so? I was still on the softball team! I worked out!\n\n\n&gt;W: you have to actually play the sport to work out.\n\n\n&gt;Kay: Fuck you you skinny sack of shit, like you know shit about staying in shape (Note: this man has rock hard abs and isn't shy about showing them)\n\n\n&gt;Me: alright W time to go talk to Mrs. P.\n\n\n&gt;W: Yeah you're right\n\n\n&gt;Kay: YOU ARE NOT LEAVING HERE UNTIL WE'RE TOGETHER.\n\n\n&gt;Me: I think I'm leaving right now\n\n\nShe begins to follow us, crying, insulting W, then she drops it\n\n\n&gt;Kay: Well you know the reason you and AT never dated? Because I told her you loved me.\n\n\nFor anyone that missed it: I had a huge crush on AT earlier in the year, things were going super well until one day she just said she couldn't go on a date with me. \n\n\n&gt;Me: What did you say?\n\n\n&gt;Kay: You heard me. You and AT aren't together cause of me.\n\n\nI actually felt a little sad here\n\n\n&gt;Me: how is this supposed to benefit you at all?\n\n\n&gt;Kay: to show you how much I cared for you! Tame! \n\n\nAfter about 10-15 seconds of just standing there stunned (not in a romantic way)\n\n\n&gt;Kay: are you trying to say you won't date me because I've gained a little weight since you made that promise? (I hadn't noticed by this point)\n\n\n&gt;Me: Where are you even gettign these arguments from?\n\n\n&gt;Kay: W called me fat!\n\n\n&gt;Me: Go away\n\n\n&gt;Kay: Is there another bitch?\n\n\n&gt;Me: stop talking\n\n\n&gt;Kay: who is it? is it [some girl I've had a puppy crush on since fucking 'nam]?\n\n\n&gt;Me: I like her yes, but she's not the reason I refuse to date you. \n\n&gt;Kay: she's a slut anyway, pretty sure I've never seen her eat anything.\n\nBy this point I'm trying to walk away with W. She not only lied to one girl I had a huge crush on, but insults the girl I have a crush on now is anorexic (bullshit I've seen that girl scarf down pancakes from Sharis and those things are not tiny) . She insults my best friend, I'm done putting up with it. I'm laid back but this has crossed the line.\n\nShe starts doing that waddle run towards us, but our brisk walking pace is faster than that. We run into Mrs. P's room, give her a short run down (yes she took that long to catch up to us) of what happened when all of a sudden\n\n&gt;Kay: TAME YOU GODDAMN ASSHOLE\n\n&gt;Mrs. P: Going to assume you're Kay, if you leave now I won't bring this up with the principal\n\nLuckily, after yelling at W and me for a bit, through an ocean of tears and blubber, she was finally able to realize it would be in her best interests to leave. \n\nJesus fucking christ.\n\nTL;DR of the whole thing: Make a friend, thought she was cool, as the year progressed she became more and more obsessive towards me but I wrote them off as jokes. She got so obsessed she told a girl I wanted to date that I was in love with her (why did you believe that whyyyyyyy). Eventually confronted me earlier today with my best friend there, said she was in love with me for a year, thought I had the same feelings because of some vague texts and that I broke up with my ex to be with her, kept accusing me of not liking her back cause she had put on weight, eventually begins insulting me, my friend that was right there, and a girl I have a puppy crush on, calling them both anorexic even though I've seen them scarf down food like wolves. Me and my friend race to my English teacher's room where she follows us, throws a fit, then gets kicked out. Takes sports but doesnt do shit during practices, thinks a dinner date is going out to McDonalds, thinks that being part of a sport is enough to be considered a \"work out\" even if you sit around and don't do shit.\n\nTL;DR of the TL;DR: Holy fucking jesus I regret wanting to have one of these stories.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378970838", "subreddit": "fatpeoplestories", "score": 110, "controversiality": 0}

Kind of like a Seinfeld episode, where you can't stand it but you're staying in it just because of the situation, you don't want to hurt her and don't want the emotional rollercoaster of the wrath of a woman scorned.\n\nAnyway, unbeknownst to my girlfriend, he gets it and comes to visit. We head to a party and my girlfriend's busy, but says she's going to catch up with me later. Party's fun but one of those typical keggers at a small school. My brother and I are seniors at this point so we just kind of sit around and play cards and decide not to head to the bar. Not sure when it happened, but my brother snagged my phone and disappeared close to the end of the party. \n\nOnce I realize I don't have my phone and my brother left, I  I head back to my place. I figured he met someone, decided to go smoke, or something similar. Regarding the girlfriend, I was so over the relationship, I didn't even think of my need to get in touch--frankly forgetting that she was supposed to meet up.\n\nSo, I get back to my place and head up to my room, hearing some strange sounds that sound like somebody's watching porn. Obviously, getting a bit concerned, I barge in.  I see my brother on top of my girlfriend absolutely going to town. I yell, \"what the FUCK?!?!\" My girlfriend doesn't even stop and without missing a beat and without even turning around, my brother says, \"Thank God you're here, man, I really need something from you...\" Obviously confused, I yell, \"what the HELL could you possibly need? You're screwing my girlfriend!\" Turning around he said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that my brother was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Oh man..  I found my thread.  This is how I lost my virginity...\n\nSo... I was in 9th grade and my sister was in 11th.  I don't want to sound rude talking about her... but she was kind of a slut.  By the age of 17 she had already slept with at least 7 guys (that I knew of) and had to have an abortion when she was 15.  I don't know what age she lost her virginity but I'd imagine it was around 12-13.\n\nMe on the otherhand was a virgin who had kissed a girl a few times but had never made out with someone before.   I always thought my sister was attractive but never voiced it because that's very socially frowned upon and I never thought anything would come of it.  \n\nMy sister and I had a pretty good relationship together.  We weren't very close but we talked often and joked around a lot.  Sometimes she's rant to me about how her current boyfriend was being a jerk or whatever and I'd listen and be nice.  (In hindsight maybe it was because I found her attractive.)  \n\nOne day in 9th grade me and my sister ended up having a conversation in which I admitted I was a virgin and for some reason my sister was shocked.  She kept saying, \"No, seriously.  I tell you stuff all the time you can't lie like that. You have to tell me.\" and I kept insisting that I was a virgin. (Because I was)  \n\nWhat my sister said after I had told her I was a virgin for the 40th freakin' time shocked me. She said, \"Well Thehealeroftri, I could probably fix that for you.  We just can't tell anyone.. hehe\" and she winked.\n\nAt first I thought she was joking and I said, \"Haha, very funny.  Stop mocking me\" but she kept insisting that because mom and dad weren't home she could take my virginity from me and give me a head start in high school when it came to women.\n\nI was a horny 9th grader... I think in my current state of mind I wouldn't have done it but man I was a horny 9th grader and my sister was a 9/10.  The only thing she didn't have was a nice ass but she had everything else.  I'm confused on how she turned out so great and I turned out so... average.\n\nAnyways.. so we go to her bedroom and she hands me a condom.  I couldn't believe this was happening but it was.  I'd pinch myself and she was still there.\n\nSo we started making out and it was a little weird so my sister stopped and said, \"Just taking off those fucking clothes\"  \n\nSo I did.\n\nEventually we were both butt naked and I had the biggest boner I'd ever had in my entire life.  We were lying on the bed and she helped me put the condom on then she climbed on top of me.\n\nI wish I could say I lasted longer than 30 seconds but I didn't.  I still remember her perfect tits bouncing up and down as she rode me.  Her face as she bit her lower lip while bouncing on top of me.   I came in a very short amount of time and she rolled over and said, \"So how do you like that?\"  \n\n\"It was amazing.\" I said.  I couldn't believe I just lost my virginity... to my older sister nonetheless.  \n\n\"You can't tell anyone!\" she said.  She kept saying it over and over in different ways so I would get the message.  I got up and got dressed all while promising her I'd never tell anyone and as I was about to leave she stopped me and said, \"You're not going to tell anyone, right?\"  \n\n\"Of course not,\" I said.  I turned to walk about when she said again, \"Wait.   I need something before you go....\" \n\nI was suddenly horny again because I assumed she wanted round two or something so I said, \"What do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that my sister was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Goddamnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nMy relationship with my sister didn't really change after that even though she did seem a little more... sexual with me after that incident.  \n\nMy parents never found out as far as I know nor did any of my other siblings.  I've never told anyone (Except for my best, best friend in high school and he didn't believe me) but I guess now I've told Reddit.

{"body": "Okay, so I'm not a twin, but my ex is one. So, a little back story first. My Ex and I had grown up in the same area, but never really knew eachother until highschool. We'd usually go and sneak off to have a little fun when I visited her house, which was on the edge of a nice lake. Pretty swanky if you ask me. Anyway, the first time we have had any nakie time, I noticed she had this pretty big scar on the left side of her body. I didn't want to ask her about it, because she seemed a little self consious about it. So I let it go for several more months, trying to ignore it, not even touch it really, but finally I asked her. It turns out that She and her sister had an accident when they were younger and had matching scars on opposite sides of there body. It became this tradition for me to give it a little kiss before or after every sexy time.\n\nAlright, so fastforward a year. It's night time. I'm feeling horny, so I sneak-walk the couple miles to her house (I had to sneak due to curfew.) and I climbed into her room (She always had the window unlocked for me.). She wasn't there, so I decided to wait for her. Well, I must have dozed off, because the next thing I know I was being kissed, and it was an amazing kiss. Like, the ones that make your head spin. So my Ex and I wriggle out of our cloths and all that, and I go to kiss her scar. Well, it's not there. So Obviously I figure out what had happened, and I'm all flustered and everything, trying to push her off of me (Because it's my Ex's Sister) and she just sits ontop of me. \"If you don't want me to tell my sister you cheated on her with me, you'll have to give me something.\" She said, and even in the dark I could see this lusty grin on her face. I asked what, of course. \"I'll do anything...\" and all that. Then she said something I will never, ever forget. She leaned in close to my ear, nibbled on it, which caused a shiver to go down my spine, and whispered, \"I'ma need about tree fiddy.\" As she leaned back, I realized that my SO at the time was the Loch-Ness Monster, and that this was her identical twin! I managed to push her off me finally and got the hell out of there. While I was running home though, I fell really bad, and the next thing I know I'm waking up in the hospital. My mom was next to me saying how glad she was that I was okay.

{"body": "&gt;First of all, I'm not saying that capitalistic modern societies are the be-all end-all.\n\nI didn't think so - although I do find the implications of your thought process to be quite disappointing.  So far, it sounds like social evolution is a unilinear process defined by some vague notion of human nature.  That simply isn't true.\n\n&gt;When?\n\nDuring the Paleolithic era of course.\n\n&gt; Please, give me some evidence that such a society ever existed.\n\nI usually point people to Boehm's *Hierarchy In The Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior*.  The work is a tad dated but it is very accessible to the laymen.  Boehm does a good job of synthesizing the archaeological, anthropological, and evolutionary data available to us into a clear picture of our egalitarian roots.\n\n&gt; Bribes, violence, intimidating strength, whatever.\n\nThat is a fairly oversimplified perspective.  While leaders within social groups routinely do come to prominence due to some outstanding characteristic or actions, how these qualities are understood within said group defines the nature and limitation of a leader's authority.  \"Bribes\" can be understood as generosity or a dedication to the public good, \"violence and intimidating strength\" can be seen as an ability to protect and serve.  How these things are understood and framed by the group at large ultimately determines whether or not a leader is a ruler and by extension whether or not a hierarchy exists.  Within the context of many Native American tribes, for example, powerful warriors would command their communities during times of intercommunal conflict.  This influence would immediate end once a conflict was over or if said leader was seen as overstepping their bounds.\n\nA good, modern day example of this is the Zapatista rebel territories.  The Zapatistas make up several hundred communities united in an entirely democratic federation where every decision effecting participants is put to a vote that includes every adult individual.  Despite this, they still have clear leaders - like Subcommandate Marcos - who are influential and help provide direction to the territories without actually *controlling* the populous they lead.  On a superficial level one could say the Zapatista leaders are no different than Enrique Nieto, as both have access to guns and therefore use \"intimidating strength\" to solidify their position.  But such a claim is rather baseless when the social realities of the Zapatista rebel are compared to that of the average Mexican citizen.\n\n&gt;. But the egalitarian utopia that you're describing, \n\nI did not describe a utopia.  The absence of hierarchy doesn't mean equate to the absence of social tension, economic woe, or individual contentment.\n\n&gt;especially in a form that could be applied to a world of 7 billion people, never existed. \n\nUnless of course we lived in a world where 7 billion worked within 70 million communities.\n\n&gt; It's wishful thinking and naive over idealization.\n\nHistory is replete with examples of people declaring that the circumstances we enjoy today are impossibilities.

With luck, the backside of the island tile indicates a sea monster spawns in that space and his swimming meeple immediately dies. \n\nThen she ends her turn by rolling a monster die to move a whale, shark or Nessie toward her brother's other meeples... hopefully upending his boat (sending his meeples into the water) or eating his swimmers, or eating the boat while the occupants are still in it.\n\nMy favorite double-cross was when my wife was in a boat with two other players. In one turn, she was able to move the boat to safe land, disembark her meeple, and then move a sea monster to eat her former shipmates before they could do anything.\n\nThe game lasts 45 minutes to an hour.

{"body": "You completely misunderstood that first article you linked and my argument.  The authors never said that the prevelence for lethal human violence and greed was any less than today.  Merely that instead of occuring on a large scale it was much more likely to occur in small or single events.  This proves nothing on the subject of human tendencies for violence; rather it just comments on the fact that we weren't as efficient at large-scale killing in pre-agrarian society.  \n\n* Also it's disingenuous to post one study supporting any claim you make which itself refers to another study arguing the exact opposite and then acting as if the debate is closed.\n\nRegarding your second point: I'm not really sure what you're trying to prove.  While that is a fascinating concept the study seems to expose, in the end it's pretty meaningless to our debate.  Arguably the singular defining human trait that differenciates us from animals is that we don't act on pure instinct.  We consciously choose our actions.  We posess a brain that is capable of higher executive reasoning and logical function.  Yet we still act out at the expense of others all the time.  The man who kills someone with a rock is no more or less violent than the man who kills a hundred people with a gun.  They've both consciously chosen their desire for revenge, power, money, rage, religion, a woman or any number of reasons over the life of that other person or persons.  War is simply this same phenomenom played out on a global scale.\n\nI would argue that altruism is never a completely unselfish act.  There is always a conscious or unconsious benefit we receive even if it's simply feeling good.  Every single action in our lives has some element of personal interest or self-benefit involved.  This however is a philosophical debate that is highly subjective and cannot be proven or disproven by empirical evidence.\n\nFinally your blanket statement on the non-existance/non-prevelance of greed in your highly idealized view of pre-agrarian society is hilariously lacking in evidence bordering on ludicrous.  How on earth can you even pretend to know the motives of people who lived thousands of years ago?  Most of what we know about the Paleolithic Era is based on a rather limited fossil record and the study of isolated modern day tribes.  Any statement you or I make regarding this time period is highly debatable and when you approach it with such blind dogma you shut yourself off from reason.  \n\nIn conclusion a different society does not neccesarily equal better; they both have their advantages and disadvantages.  While the Paleolithic peoples might have led very different lives from you or I, and unless you can provide some shocking evidence to the contrary, they seem to be very much like us: human.  \n\nWhile it's interesting to try to understand the people of that time, in the end it's mostly congecture.  I find the observations of human nature within recorded history much more relevant and valid to the world we ourselves live in.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379059330", "subreddit": "Futurology", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "After six months of unemployment, my girlfriend \"Angela\" took a new job at a very trendy hair salon in the city. Hot chicks and gay guys everywhere. I'd usually go there during my lunch break and bring her coffee while she worked, and soon enough I became a mainstay at the salon. All of the girls liked me and soon I became \"Coffee Brad\".\n\nThen I got to know some of the other stylists there. One of them, a very flamboyant guy I'll call \"Mark\", started to become very friendly with my girl, and she started going to the bar with him and other coworkers. No big deal, I shrugged. More football and Breaking Bad in my boxers.\n\nThen, the nights became later and started to turn into sleepovers. Now, mind you, Mark was *flamingly*gay. His wrists were flimsier than a silk sheet, and even the other guys in the place were annoyed with him; one guy even joked that he was setting gay people back 50 years.\n\nWell, one day I went to bring them coffee as usual, and she wasn't there. I asked around, and they told me she went to grab some food with Mark. I'm still completely oblivious, as you can tell. I didn't think Mark had it in him, as he was, well, gay. I texted her; nothing. I walked around all of the diners and coffee places; I don't see them. I got frustrated and headed back to the salon, where one of the girls is having a smoke in back. I asked her where Angela was, and she sort of just chuckled.\n\n\"Probably screwing Mark,\" she said. We both laughed; none of us entertained the possibility. By then it was almost one and I had to go back to the office. I excused myself and walked into the bathroom for a quick leak, and then I saw them: my girlfriend and her gay coworker, stark naked and going at each other. I slammed the door and I panted heavily. I had a mini-panic attack. There was my woman, the love of my life, cheating on me with her coworker, her GAY coworker at that. He scampered out of the bathroom while hastily throwing on his henley onto his dainty body, and I confronted her. I loved you, you betrayed me, how could you do this, that sort of thing. She started crying and begged me to stay with her. I told her she was nuts and that I'd have her stuff on the front lawn when she got home.\n\nI get home, grab all of her clothes, shoes, makeup, anything that was remotely feminine and threw it onto the front lawn. I wanted to burn the place down, but it was my place. She comes home, holding her heels in her hand like she was stumbling out of a bar at 2 AM, and the mascara is running down her cheeks. She starts crying and tells me to stay, but my heart is hardened and after everything I gave her, I wasn't giving an inch. She cried and said she had no money to go back home to Montana, and I asked her how much she needed.\n\n\"About tree fiddy,\" she said.\n\nIt was about that time I realized that my new ex-girlfriend was a seven-story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I couldn't believe my luck, and I told her to go to hell, as I wasn't giving her no damn tree fiddy. I chased her away with a broom and never saw her again. \n\nEventually I met a new girl, Jane, and things are going remarkably well. I've never been happier, and it feels good not to be lied to by a woman, or anyone, really.\n\nTL; DR: Girlfriend cheated on me with gay coworker, discovered an even darker secret.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379080941", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

A lot of people on our shoot were low carb, so used what money we could to cater to them, like cottage cheese and bacon. We also always made couple dozen hard-boiled eggs, since they're easy to transport and can be made in advance.\n\nAnyways, the day this happened, we were shooting at a house in Brentwood, and we parked our trucks on the street around the corner (a couple minutes' walk away from set). I set up the crafty table in front, put out the food, crew members are showing up, etc. Then there is this guy who comes up to the table. He looks homeless, but says he's an extra. He's telling me this tale about how he knows some famous actor who knew someone and that's how he got this gig. I'm trying to be polite, nod along, and he takes a soda. I'm like, \"you know, if he IS homeless, at least his story was worth us losing a soda.\" I hear a call for my name over the radio, walk to set, walk back a couple minutes later, and *all the eggs are gone*. People are going to be PISSED. \n\nI look around and just happen to see the homeless guy behind a house. He's crouched on the ground, just stuffing his mouth with egg after egg. He sees me, starts to run, and I give chase.\n\nI run after him (he's pretty slow) and he stops. I'm like, \"listen, I need the eggs back, and I need you to stop stealing stuff from set. I know you're probably hungry, so what can I give you for this to be over?\" And he says, \"About tree fiddy.\" Now it was about this time I realized the egg-poppin' homeless man I was chasing was a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era!

It's something that's been on my chest for quite a while and every time I think about what could have happened I just feel empty inside. I just don't think I can carry on with this so I guess I should thank you AskReddit for finally giving me a chance. Don't judge me. I did what I needed to do. So here goes. \n\nI was around 16/17 and I didn't really care about what I did. You know, I was one of those rebels who just wanted to 'stick it' to my parents. Both my parents came from poor backgrounds but I was raised in a sub-urban area with no worries or troubles. I lived very easily and never had to worry about not having enough but because of this I always wanted more. I didn't really have appreciation for money so you can bet your ass that when the PS3 was released I wanted it straight away. My parents however always told me that I would just get bored of it after a while and that I should get my own job. I screamed at them. At that age, the idea of me working was just ludicrous. I wouldn't accept it. However a couple of weeks went by and I just knew that I needed to get money. \n\nThere were some guys near my area that everybody knew were dealing drugs. Nobody ever did anything because we were all scared. Well I approached them and asked them if they could give me a job. You know easy money. They didn't trust me though so they gave me a test. I had to \"deal with\" one of their competitors. I was quite fit and I loved going to the gym so I knew that all I would have to do was beat the crap out of this guy and it would be easy. \n\nThe day came round and I was really nervous. I had to beat the shit out of a guy and then deliver some drugs. Every time a cop car went past I would just panic and I would think about turning back. However I got to this guy. I just jumped him and started beating the living crap out of him. \"Stay off our turf!\" \"This is my fucking area bitch\". Those types of things. But have you ever gotten that rush of adrenaline and never been able to stop? I didn't stop. I kept going. He kept getting hit but he stopped breathing. I ran. I was like Usain fucking Bolt. \n\nI was scared shitless. I'd just murdered a guy in cold blood for a couple hundred bucks? I had to go on though. I went back and got his body. We were in an alleyway so nobody would have seen it.He wasn't dead. The dude was fucking alive. I don't know how but he was. I delivered the drugs alright. I can't stop thinking about what I did to this day but I did deliver the drugs. I went back to the guy after I sent the drugs. He was still where I hid him barely concious. \n\nI slapped him across the face until he woke up properly. \"I'm going to call an ambulance for you. If you even mention me then I will fucking kill you for real this time. I wasn't here. The guy who got you was black and had a rose tatoo on his arm. Do you understand?\" I told him. It's the part I remember the most. I was threatening to kill him moments after nearly killing him. \"Y-yes\" was all he said really quickly. But then he continued. \"I'm just going to need one thing though\". I was shocked but I needed to  keep this under wraps. I asked him \"What do you need?\". His answer. His answer was just. I don't have words to describe what I felt. \"Imma need about tree-fiddy\"\n\nIt was at this point that I realised that this guy was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

{"body": "I used to be a huge MTG head. I played religiously and convinced other players in my middle school to make terrible trades. They generally had a poor idea of how valuable certain rares went for, such as older editions of BOP, etc... and I would list a bunch of fake market price values for terrible rares, ones you could buy for 50c - $1.00.\n\nThis went on for about a year. One afternoon I was in my local ice cream shop opening a fresh pack (I think 7th Ed.) and the owner  told me he played! It turned out he had a better sense for real market price values of rares, conditions, editions and we ended up negotiating rares for ice-cream. $5 rare = triple-scoop or a milkshake\n\nThen I started to lose interest in MTG and WoW came out. My friends tried to get me to play but I was addicted to Halo. They nagged me for months so eventually I caved.\n\nI went on some forums where you could buy/sell/trade wow accounts (markeedragon i think) and offered to trade \"2,500+ MTG rares\". After getting a bunch of offers (was surprised to get more than a couple) I negotiated the value at about $1k. I named some quality rares in the package, but most of them were just repeats of the same, pretty crappy rares. I ended up scoring a fully-decked GM warrior! I kept my top rares, still have a gross lookin' black lotus, some mox emeralds, and others.\n\nSo yea. Years and years passed in WoW, befriending people all over world, traveling across vast seas, defeating molten enemies, trolling everyone in bgs... life was good.\n\nLife was so good, school and grades became pointless. Money? I have mad gold. Girls? I have night elves. A job? I'm a professional farmer.\n\nThen college came.

No idea about the list you're talking about, but my take would be:\n\nFirst: I thought The Aztecs was great - though Planet of Giants win on hilarity factor (though I've only seen seven of the serials)\nSecond: The War Games\nThird: I love Pertwee dearly and can therefore not really be held accountable for what is actually best, but I do love me the UNIT stories. Though Invasion of the Dinosaurs is pretty grand.\nFourth: Genesis of the Daleks (with Terror of the Zygons as a second, as it has a) Scotland b) Loch Ness Monster c) Zygons d) UNIT)\nFifth: as with Pertwee, I love Davison too much to be unbiased. The Five Doctors is fun. And I remember finding Terminus pretty chilling. (Resurrection of the Daleks, though not the best Dalek story, has my absolute favourite scene of a companion leaving.)\nSixth: Maybe The Two Doctors? I know a lot of people hate Six, but although I've only seen four of his stories, I found him rather lovable, though in a grumpy way. The Mysterious Planet (first part in Trial of a Time Lord) was pretty cool.\nSeventh: Battlefield is ace.

{"body": "My girlfriend HATED fishing.\n\nI grew up in lake country, and fishing has been my life ever since I was a little boy, sitting in my dad's lap and casting my rod into the clean water, hoping for a trout. From when I was a baby 'til about 25, I fished every Sunday afternoon with my father until he passed away from pancreatic cancer. I was devastated after that, and I swore I'd never touch a fishing pole again. My mom encouraged me to move on and fish anyway, but smelling the ravine, hearing the tranquil sounds of the lake, it wasn't easy.\n\nI started dating a new girl around this time. She was cool, nothing crazy, things were going fine, but I still couldn't get over my father's death. She said, \"why not go fishing?\" Secretly I wanted to, but it didn't feel right. It was mine and my father's thing, and in a way I felt I was betraying my childhood by going fishing without him. So I asked her to join me. She laughed and said no, arguing that it was smelly and gross. Kind of hurt, but she said maybe later. So I kept asking her again, and again, until she gave in and said yes.\n\nSo, I packed my rods, tacklebox, and I went to pick her up. And I drove over to her place, while listening to some old blues records we used to play on those Sunday afternoons. Got me right in the feels, and I started to tear up. As I pulled into the driveway I realized what a mistake I made; I couldn't do it. I couldn't betray the memory of this great man who loved me so much and had taught me so much in life. Just as I pulled my truck out she came running out and asked what if I was okay. I broke down and started wailing, which, frankly was embarrassing. Here I was, a *man*, and I was crying for my daddy. I figured she'd blow me off and never want anything to do with me again.\n\nBut to my surprise, she didn't. She invited me into the house and held me in her arms, and I cried like a baby. I hadn't so much as shed a tear for him during the funeral. Her soft fingers wiped my tears and she planted gentle kisses on my neck. I had never felt so loved, yet, I felt so emasculated. I told her I'd go home, but she insisted that I stay. After I got myself together, she said she had a surprise for me. She took me into the garage showed me this super-awesome boat, perfect for fishing. My eyes lit up and we took it with us to the lake and went on it. I was so excited that this girl would do that much for me.\n\nThe fishing went surprisingly well. I caught a few trout and she even helped dress them up. Everything was great until the Loch Ness Monster appeared and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" I told him I wasn't giving him no damn tree fiddy, but my girlfriend gave him a dollar. And since then, the monster has been pestering me for money ever since, since she caved in and gave him that damn dollar. But I still love her. We got married and we even had a son who was a chef, but he passed away.\n\n**TL; DR:** Father passed away, went fishing with new girl.

{"body": "Public orgy.  Yeah, sounds crazy, but here's the story.\n\nSo, it was late and I was riding my bike back from this pet store I worked at.  It was darker than usual, and because I'm afraid of the dark, I didn't want to take my usual lamp-less bike path back, so I decided to cut through the park.  And mind you, this is like a big fucking park.  If I had to guess, I'd say it was at least 1-2 square miles.  More to the point, I was riding my bike on the path, and I see a little kid crying on a child leash stuck to a bench and no parent in sight.  There wasn't anyone in sight, really, so being the nice guy I am, I ride up to her and ask her if she's alright.\n\nShe sobs and tells me she lost her mommy.  I spend a minute calming her down, just saying it's okay, and I ask her where she lost her mommy.  She pointed to a thick brush over yonder, and I told her to wait and I'd get her mommy for her.\n\nSo, I leave my bike with the girl so she knew I'd have to come back and I walk over to the brush.  I'm fuming at this point, wondering what kind of piece of shit would leave their child chained to a bench and vanish into thin air.  But as I got closer to the brush, I heard noises that got louder.  It was moaning.\n\nI get to the brush, clear my way through, and there are tons of adult men and women just fucking in this clearing.  Just going at it, some girls had two or three guys in them at once.  It was kind of gross, but I was so shocked I just stood there watching.  One of the women, a MILFy looking blonde with huge breasts, noticed me and got off of her friend.\n\nShe walks up and asked, \"Come to join the fun?\"\n\nI stammered, \"Actually, there's a little girl over there who's crying...\"\n\nThen she tells me, \"Don't worry, she's fine.  Care to join?\"\n\nAnd this situation is not one of my prouder moments, but my clothes came off and I was in that woman in an instant.  I still feel guilty about leaving the little girl there.  Anyways, while I'm fucking this lady, I notice that there are more people than I originally thought, and I asked her how many people were actually here.\n\nShe pulled me close, licked my ear, and whispered, \"If I had to guess, I'd say...  Tree fiddy?\"\n\nThat's when I realized I was fucking the Loch Ness Monster and this was an orgy full of 500 ft tall creatures from the Paleozoic Era.\n\nScared for my life, I ran outta there.

{"body": "Alright here we go. When I was in my senior year of high school, my dad lived in an apartment building right across the street from school. This was pretty kickass since I didn't have to wake up until about 10 minutes before school, but also there was this really hot girl that lived in the apartment across the hall from me. I don't mean just your average cute teenager, I mean this girl was gorgeous. 5'10\", straight blonde hair, nice perky B-cups, and legs for days.\n\n\nAs the school year went on, I would walk home everyday, and started to notice this girl walking back about 100 feet ahead of me everyday. One day, I finally got up the courage, and yelled \"Hey, wait up!\"\nNow I'm not bad looking, probably just above average looks, but I was not used to talking to girls. My high school was pretty big, and I was used to just slipping into the cracks in the social scene, so my \"game\" was pretty much non-existent at this point in my life.\n\n\nAnyway, this gorgeous girl stops and waits for me to catch up. I walk the rest of the way home with her. She introduces herself. Amanda. I had never heard such a beautiful name in my life. We continue chatting all the way up the stairs of the apartment complex, and when we get to our apartments she invites me in. I don't know what I did that day, but it must've been right, because this stunning young lady was inviting me into her apartment.\n\nI casually stroll into her apartment, and the set up in pretty standard. Hardwood floors along with family portraits made for a cliche decor, but I wasn't complaining. She brings me into her room, saying that it's much easier to study in there because it's nice and quiet. Sounds good to me.\n\n\nAs soon as we got to her room she closed the door behind us, and starts playing quiet jazz on her ipod. \"I thought we were in here because it was nice and qu-\" I stifled out before she put her finger to my lips and shushed me.\n\n\nI'lll let you use your imagination for the details, but be assured that we fucked like animals. I mean this girl was amazing, and also the first I'd ever had so... yeah it was great. after finishing her off doggystyle, she laid down on her pillow and just stared up at the ceiling. \"I'm gonna grab some water,\" I explained as I got up, \"do you want anything?\"\n\"Actually yeah... I have to tell you something but it's kind of embarrassing. I need a favor.\" \n\nI couldn't imagine wtf I had gotten into, but my heart dropped at those words. I was scared, but I'm a polite boy and she HAD just fucked me, so I asked \"yeah sure, anything. What do you need?\"\nShe looked at me with her bright green eyes and flatly said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was about this time that I noticed Amanda was actually eight stories tall, and was a crustacean from the late-paleozoic era.\n\n\n\"God damn loch ness monster!\" I howled, \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" And Amanda swam out her apartment window, never to be seen again.\n\n\nI'll never forget what that heartless bitch of a crustacean did to me.

{"body": "It was absolutely wild. My friend isn't socially awkward, but he's not the most active guy I know. But he told me that he got invited to this amazing house party in San Francisco (we live in DC). I had the weekend off, so I just decided to go. Why not? We're in college, what's there to lose?\n\nThey sent a private jet for us. I had no idea it would be like that. Really fancy on the inside. It was all such a blur. We didn't even have to go through security! So we land on this private airstrip and hop in a hummer limousine, just the two of us. It was night time and the windows were so tinted we couldn't see outside. Either way, in a few minutes the car stops and the doors pop open, and all we can see is that we're in a courtyard surrounded by this enormous white mansion. It looks like a modern castle. And the bass. It's pumping loud. There's nobody to be seen but the two big dudes in suits standing next to each of the four doors that are in the center of each wall of the courtyard. All of the windows are dark. The limo pulls out into the tunnel and we're just standing there. We decide to just go towards the door we're facing, and when we get through it's like a wall of light and sound just hits us. There's people everywhere, and they're all naked. I didn't get it, and either did my friend.\n\nI should take this time to note that when I asked my friend where he got this invite, he said it was delivered to him by some guy in a suit saying he knew his dad from business, so he trusted it.\n\nIn any case, we started to mingle, and very quickly our clothes were torn off. Never saw them again until we were leaving, and they were in the limo. It was really fuckin' weird at first, but then we realized that we were at this crazy party and so we just went with it. In any case, we walked around and began to mingle.\n\nI grabbed a drink from a woman walking around and started to talk with a bunch of ladies. They were amazing looking, 10/10. One of them pulled me away and we walked for a good ten minutes down onto some dock. It was actually pretty quiet this far away from the stuff. And so she looks me in the eye, and tells me she needs to ask me a question. I said, \"what do you want to know?\" And she responds, looking me straight in the eye, \"I need to borrow some cash.\" I reply, \"how much?\" It's not like I was going to ask her why. I was just a little startled, and that was my instinctive reply. She says, \"tree fiddy.\" That's when I realized I was taken away by a 50 foot long crustacean from the paleolithic era.

It's hard to explain, things just felt tense. Anyway i went through about 2 weeks of this before the real shit started happening. I remember one instance where all the knives and forks in my drawer could be heard rattling from upstairs. When i went down to check it i found the basement door ajar which was unusual because i don't leave doors open and hardly ever went down there.\n\nThings finally culminated though one day when i was watching TV and out of nowhere my mirror which my grandmother gave me falls off the wall and smashes.

{"body": "&gt;12    Do you believe in astrology or otherwise believe that celestial bodies that are light years away can somehow affect us? How and why?\n\nNo.\n\nDivination on the other hand, I do believe in to a point. Astrology is one type of Divination, but the ones in the newspaper are silly and more for entertainment/positive suggestion at best.\n\nI'll use the example here of something my Grandfather used to do on new year's eve. He'd set up the BBQ, and melt down a few lead smelting ingots (or solder) in an old pot. Then he'd pour the molten metal in small spurts into a waiting bucket of cold water.\n\nThe idea was, that the essentially random formations of metal as they exploded and cooled in the water, would form shapes and images. But much like looking for shapes in the clouds, it was an act of imagination.\n\nIt was said that the things we saw in the metal would fortell our coming year.\n\nTarot is like that. When you do a Tarot reading, you get a very basic set of information back. This is random.. purely and solely random in by any reasonable measurement. That which has value is the reading. When you pull the Death card, with the mental space you're in while seeking.. do you see death, or do you see the rose? Each card has it's official meanings, but there are subtle other meanings and images that you as the reader will bend to suit your situation.\n\nWhat you are doing in the process, is giving your intuitive mind a chance to speak. We spend a lot of time reasoning and being logical, examining things.. we project our wants, and our fears onto things, and we often don't listen to that 'channel' of ourselves that has a good guess for how things will work out.\n\nTarot, and pretty much every form of divination, are just 'flash cards for the intuitive mind'. \n\n&gt;13    Do you practice magic? Can you prove it?\n\nThat's a tough question.. with all the above, I've pretty much said as far as I'm concerned, there is no such thing AS magic, and yet, many of these things still have a 'power' from a certain point of view.\n\nWhen most people 'work magic'.. what they are doing is focussed visualization. They're creating physical, verbal, or visual representations of what they want to happen. And in the process, they're giving themselves permission to cause whatever it is, to happen. As time goes on, the memories of that working, that imagery and desire given a 'form'.. will play in the corners of the mind. When we then see opportunities 'in life' to make those things happen, we'll pursue them.\n\nAdd in a dash of confirmation bias, and it quickly becomes the 'spell' or the 'ritual' that caused the desired effect. \n\n&gt;14    Do you believe in other nonsense, like homeopathy or conspiracy theories?\n\nHomeopathy? no. Do I believe that there are other remedies that work, that may not work 'as well' as pharmaceutical compounds sold by big pharma? yes. But again, there's always confirmation bias to consider, but when I get a cold of the flu, I get lots of OJ, and eat lots of warm soup. I also take some Tylenol Cold and Flu, because I find that works for me.\n\nAs for Conspiracy Theories.. well there is such a thing as a conspiracy. That's just a fact of life whenever you have people and secrets and politics. I suppose you're probably more likely asking things like \"Do I believe Aliens exist, do I believe that we've been visited by aliens, do I believe that Area 51 is a secret holding place for the Alien craft recovered in the 1940's?\n\nI believe Alien life MUST exist as a statistical certainty. I also 'feel' that the likelihood of intelligent life 'somewhere out there' is also a pretty likely scenario. Some of them surely have to be more advanced than us.. but space is really really big. I think the chances that a sufficiently advanced civilization has already found us, and come here, to be extremely remote, tho a lovely, entertaining idea to fantasize about.\n\nDo I believe in Bigfoot, Chupacabras, the Loch Ness Monster, or that the world is secretly controlled by a group of subterranean, reptilian creatures who disguise themselves as human and fluoridate the water supply in order to subjugate us as a species in order to use us as breeding stock and control our Gold supply?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt;15    What do you think of science?\n\nI hated it in school. Worst subject after Social Studies and PE.\n\nSeriously, Science is. Science is the study of the nature of life, matter, existence, energy, death, disease.. everything. Science studies the very nature of nature itself.\n\n&gt;16    How many dollars a year do you spend on buying things related to Wicca?\n\nI dunno.. probably about 30-50? A book here or there, maybe some nice candles that smell good. Maybe some nice music, or something.. I dunno.\n\nHow much do you spend on Jewish stuff per year? Do you go through a lot of Yarmulkes? What's your annual latke budget?\n\n&gt;17    What's with the pentacle?\n\nThe star in the circle is called a Pentagram when drawn or printed, and a pentacle when turned into a three dimensional form, or into a necklace. It's a symbol, historically associated by the Christian world, with evil, or 'magic', and forbidden spiritual practices.\n\nIt has been claimed by the wiccan community as the primary symbol (among many) of the broad 'Wiccan\" faith. It's generally used as the centerpiece of an altar, and is generally used in many ritual practices, much the same as the cross is used in Christianity.. as a focus point for prayer, as a physical gesture when beginning or ending a prayer, etc. \n\n&gt;18    Do you believe in sacred geometry and numerology? Are some shapes, angles, or numbers more \"powerful\" or \"good\" or \"bad\" than others? How so? How do you know? Can you prove it?\n\nI'll lean back on what I said before. They have only the power we give them. Much of that 'power' (like for the 'unlucky #13') is ingrained in us by the social experience. Throughout a child's life, we inundate them with messages that something has power, or doesn't.. that it's good or bad, and when that child grows up, they'll believe that on some level. Then that person will give that power to that thing, in their life.\n\nThe number 13 isn't unlucky, but if you believe it is, you'll be extra watchful for bad things happening when 13s are involved.\n\nThe remaining stuff of numerology relates to the whole 'divination/intuitive mind' thing. If I tell you that the number 3 is lucky, or if you beleive that.. numerology gives you a convenient way to reduce everything down to single digit numbers. You can name your children with names that reduce to 3 if you like.\n\nBut it comes back to the idea of 'putting work into giving your desires form'.. and then ingraining those desires in your mind, so you can better find the opportunities for them to occur. It works with negativity too, as is evidenced by good ol' #13.\n\n&gt;19    Isn't Wicca just a modern invention that bears little to no relationship to the pagan religions of Europe? Would the Druids of pre-christian europe recognize the Wiccan Rede? Would some other group of pagans recognize it? Didn't Druids practice human sacrifice?\n\nYup, totally invented, borrowed, cribbed, and decoupaged together. I've no idea what the Druids did in times past, though I know there's a group of people doing their best to resurrect the Druid faith, faithfully to the original. I'm sure there are others as well, trying to reconstruct the dead religions of Egypt or Rome too.\n\nAnd yes, Wicca (or Paganism in general) would be unrecognizable to the original followers of Artemis and Odin.\n\n&gt;20    If you are polytheist, do you include Judeo-Islamo-Christian conceptions of God in your pantheon? Why or why not?\n\nI'm more of a pantheist than a polytheist. All the gods are one and many at the same time, depending on who's looking, and what they're looking for. At the same time, all the gods could be said to not exist to one person, and to be very real to another. For me, the Divine transcends man's attempts to define it, and the Divine neither needs, nor wants a definition better than resonates with the individual.\n\n&gt;21 Edit: What's the deal with Aleister Crowley?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379300098", "subreddit": "Wicca", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Since the evidence for one god existing is the exact same amount for multiple gods (as in a pantheon) existing it cannot be considered more likely. Or equally unlikely, whichever you prefer. You cannot ask for an exact number since of it being likely that multiple gods exist since you cannot give an exact number for the likelihood of just one god existing. It is all a guess. But since the evidence for each is the same, odds are it is not more likely for one than many. How is the \"number\" for the possibility for Nessie, Bigfoot, leprechauns, aliens etc any different. Anything for which there is no evidence has no such \"number\". Just over a hundred years ago there was no knowledge of galaxies outside of our own, they thought the MW was the whole universe. Could you give a \"number\" to that? Once we know something we can measure it outside of guesses.\n\n&gt;So there could be some culture that decides that killing a person's whole family is an appropriate punishment for murder? If not, why?\n\nThere COULD be a culture that decides anything, then people try to improve on it with new knowledge and understanding that comes with time. How about some culture that believes it is ok to kill a man for gathering firewood on a Saturday? There was one of those...in the bible. Or a culture that would kill a women not a virgin? That has existed. Or a culture that would go around, conquer towns and put everyone..man, women, child, livestock to death after winning? That has existed..all in the bible. But we do not do that any more because we have learned better. Laws, morality, science, etc..pretty much everything..we get better at over times.

I guess I can tell the story of how I was picked up by a 'cougar.\n\nSo I was couch surfing following a fall-out with my parents (long story, not worth going into). Anyway, this went on for a while and I ended up staying at one friend's for about a month or so. My friend lived with his single mum (dad had gone out to get milk, never returned type thing). His mum was young-ish considering my friend's and my ages at the time (18), in pretty good shape, lovely smile, always very friendly with me, and I was obviously very grateful to have somewhere to stay at this point. My friend worked in a mobile windscreen repair service and I was between jobs. His mum worked part time so we were often in the house together. Was kind of awkward at first (obviously) but we got chatting. She would make comments about how mature I was and how she couldn't understand how I didn't have a girlfriend etc., I would sort of giggle and brush it aside, but the more it happened the more I thought maybe I had a chance here. A chance for something great...\n\nWhich leads me to a piece of advice: if you think something is on, ask for it. Same with meeting any girls. You can whinge about not getting dates, but are you actually asking? The girl that smiled at you on the train, at the bar, buying coffee, did you just ask them? They are people after all! I digress, of sorts. So, with this spirit of adventure, one time when we were alone, I though I would give it a shot. She was sat on the sofa one morning, I decided to join her. Normal small talk, sly comments, 'why don't you have a girlfriend'... My heart is pounding, but I say something cliche along the lines of 'only being interested in you'. She cottons on, leans into me and says 'what can a young boy offer someone like me'. Excitedly, I ask 'well what do you need?' She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was about that time that I noticed this smoking hot milf was about 500 feet tall and from the paleothic era\".

Somehow a rumor got started that I had done some things at a few parties my summer going into senior year. Since most of my close friends were a year older than me, a lot of people who were in my grade never got to actually witness me just getting belligerently drunk at parties and talking about how amazing Amy was. \n\nWell when the rumor reached her she was completely offended that I wouldn't tell her about it since she considered us so close. She messages me the weekend before senior year and tells me she wants to talk. (She was leaving work which was conveniently in walking distance to my house.) I told her I'll meet her on the corner of my street.\n\nWhen I see her its flutters in my stomach and so much expectation. I felt my heartbeat in every inch of my body and she walked up to me hugged me. She just held me, buried her face into my neck and  whispered \"*I missed you.*\" I just held on for as long as she wanted me to. Her hands crossing my back made me feel secure for the first time since I had fallen for her. I knew that no matter what happened next in this moment she and I were alone. There was no drama, none of the history loomed over us, just the pleasure of each others touch.\n\nThe walk back to my place was calm, quiet, and used as a moment to collect the hundreds of thoughts that were scattered earlier. My parents lived on the second floor and I on the first so we walked in and had some privacy. I sat on the couch and she then confessed that she had felt the same way I did for so long, that it was difficult to walk out of a relationship to walk into another. I couldn't comprehend it... in my mind if two people loved each other they could easily be together. Blissful ignorance is something I was a serious victim of in my teenage years. She and I just talked. Words were thrown and tempers flared, voices raised and hearts ached. In the end I told her it was too late for her to walk home and that she could sleep in my room and I would take the couch. She nodded.\n\nIt was that night that i learned that why people said hate and love lie on a very fine line. I was so angry with her about not telling me the things I had wanted to hear for years. I felt every word she said like a blow from a boxer but I couldn't help but watch her like I was in a trance as she nodded and got up to go to sleep. \n\nShe walks into my room and I let my body rest and lay back. That's when I thought I heard her sing. Some wouldn't consider it that but she always had this ability with me that everytime she would say my name it would be better than any sonata. \"*King_Treatment... you know I hate sleeping alone... would you stay with me until I fall asleep?*\"\n\nShe retraced her steps and grabbed my hands and brought me into my room. The place I considered sanctified but with her it was paradise. Lit only by the dim bedside lamp, Amy and I laid in bed for what would be the last night I was a virgin of both lips and hips. When I laid down I held her hand and she came close as two people could. I felt the hairs on my legs being brushed by the foreign smooth skin of freshly shaved legs. \n\nHere's the strangest thing about your first kiss, you don't truly realize its started until you are half way through and your heart beat is whats guiding your tongue. I swear I can hear music when she tells me to take off my shirt. It slides off and by the time I readjust to the situation there she is in all her glory. I didn't know people could get naked so fast and clothes could be thrown so carelessly. She knew what she was doing and thought I did as well but I just stumbled and fumbled through it while she glides and danced around me. It was a dance that is guided by emotion and only follows the rhythm that two hearts in love can create. It was perfect for me. I don't think it was perfect for her. \n\nI didn't finish... I was too nervous, too enthralled in the moment.\n\nIt's strange I started writing this so nonchalantly but memories even as bittersweet as this one really get my heart going and my mind racing.\n\nWe drifted apart after my senior year and I can't stand the thought of her anymore because she hurt me so much after that. But like the saying goes \"**We'll always have Paris**\"\n\nTL;DR: Got kissed and had sex with my three year crush... I was the other man though. =/\n\nPS: sorry for grammer or whatever... didn't actually plan on writing anything in depth\n\n**Edit #1: O.O Thank you so much for the gold!!!! &lt;3 I'm glad you guys are enjoyed the story!**\n\n**Edit#2: My god reddit has removed all of your faith in a real story... about 1/2 of you were convinced it was a tree fiddy story.

{"body": "Well I met this girl at a party, and we really hit it off. She was really pretty, and had a great ass. So we're talking, sitting on this old, deep, sofa, the kind that has no support whatsoever so that even a 98 pound anorexic would sink into it. Eventually, we lean in, kiss, and start making out. We keep, going and I start to feel her ass (God it was glorious, I'm a little hard just thinking about it). And I knew I had to get her somewhere private. Problem was, this wasn't my house, hell, I didn't even know the guy throwing the party too well (he was my roommate's friend). But, luckily, my hall and this shared a parking lot, and I had a car!\n\nSo I told her that we should continue this in my car, and she gives this naughty little smirk (which is almost as hot as her ass), and we head over to my car. As soon as we close the back door, and start touching, WHAM! Everything was over. Someone had yelled \"P-SAFE\"--campus security had come to shut down the party. We stopped everything, and laid as still as possible as a these Security trucks roll in, while everyone else runs the other way. One of these guys, flashlight in hand, walks right passed the car. \n\nNow, we were 18 and 19, so it wasn't illegal, but this wasn't the cops, it was campus security, and a little Catholic college were sex is technically not allowed. Some of these P-Safe guys were totally chill--hell, some of these guys were said to even buy weed from dealers on campus! But for every stoned security officer, the was a hard-ass who made Argus Filch look kind of nice. Besides, we had both had a little something to drink earlier, and didn't want to get in trouble for that either.\n\nSo we sit quiet for maybe 20, no more than 30 minutes. As this goes on, though, we aren't doing nothing. Silently, I have been running my hands all up and down her body, and have begun sliding some fingers into her pants. Once it looks like p-safe is down with this area, her pants came off. I had spent too long longer to feel her ass in my hands and plant my face between her thighs. But as I start to pull her pants down, I notice something odd. \n\nThe skin didn't quite feel right, and I suddenly noticed this odd smell. She seems to sense my hesitation, and says \"Don't mind that, it's this crappy lotion I use. I  could buy some better stuff if I had about tree fiddy. *Well*, it was high time I noticed this girl was covered in scales and from the paleolithic era! I shoulda noticed I had just spent almost an hour feelin up this great scaly beast! And she says again to me, \"Yeah, I think I'd need about tree fiddy more.\" Well I wasn't gonna fuck with no Loch Ness Monster! And so I opened that door, and I got right outta there.  \n\nNever did get the smell out of my car.\n\n**TL;DR:** About to get with a gorgeous girl, and campus security makes us hide.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379364048", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay. First up, I'm no expert, but here's my take:\n\n**MY SELF-SUMMARY**\n\nOverall, I found this section to be rather lacking and not doing much in terms of selling yourself.\n \n&gt;&gt;My family and friends describe me as outgoing guy with a good sense of humor. I like a good balance of serious and silly. Silly usually wins though. :)\n\nGood. Now the thing you hear on this subreddit all the time is \"don't tell us, show us!\" so now's your opportunity to demonstrate your silly, outgoing, funny personality... Lets see how you do.\n\n&gt;&gt;Athletic yet slightly out of shape(college + beer ruined me).\n\nOkay, I get it, it's some light hearted self-deprecating humour. But really, I wouldn't make jokes about your body image, especially not in the second line. You look a bit soft around the edges, but nothing that unusual for a 35yo male. I think self-deprecating humour can be funny, but in this instance it's counter-productive, especially in a superficial environment like online dating where people can very easily just skim the profile and go \"next\". It doesn't sell yourself. I would just maybe mention that you love XYZ sports and play ABC socially in order to demonstrate your athleticism. Leave it up to the audience to determine whether you're flabby or not by looking at your pictures.\n\n&gt;&gt;Love the usual stuff...restaurants, movies, music, tv. I'm always up for spontaneous fun though.\n\nThat's a shopping list of things that's on every guys profile. You're going to have to try a little bit harder than that.\n\n&gt;&gt;Love sports. I enjoy playing just about any sport there is when I have time. I mostly played soccer, football, basketball and baseball through high school.\n\nI don't like the \"played\" aspect. You're talking about high school which was 17 years ago. I don't know if this is a unique American thing but who gives a shit what you played in high school? What sports/hobbies/past-times/pursuits do you play/enjoy now?\n\n&gt;&gt;My mom used to always beat into me, \"Patience is a virtue.\" I guess it worked because that's definitely one of my biggest strengths.\n\nI like this, but would like it if you elaborated.\n\n&gt;&gt;I'm book smart but a bit of an airhead.\n\nNeeds context, otherwise it sounds too self-deprecating. I'm certain there's a funny anecdote here. You should include it. Remember, you can't just tell us, you've gotta SHOW US! Show us your good sense of humour and book smart/airheadedness. \"My friends always joke that I can remember OPQ about XYZ, but can't RST my DEF half the time!\" &lt;- I'm sure you can think of something better than that though.\n\n&gt;&gt;I love my job.\n\nWhat do you do? What do you love about it?\n\n&gt;&gt;I'm looking to get to know a fun, witty, laid back girl. A girl who likes good communication in a relationship. Someone who can be comfortable in silence. Somebody who can be in a relationship and be independent at the same time. Someone who speaks their mind and will stand up for their own beliefs. A girl who is compassionate and understanding without even knowing it sometimes. Someone who agrees that unhealthy jealousy(which is most jealousy) is a BIG no-no. A girl who wants a guy that will stand up for her, for anyone that needs someone to have their back. Someone who's looking for a southern gentlemen that advocates to keep chivalry alive by setting a good example. I think most importantly, a girl who likes to laugh...at herself, at me and with me.\n\nPersonally, I would not include this at all. Your profile is about YOU, not your idealised image of the perfect girl. In terms of \"what you're looking for\" - if you don't like them, don't message them. By giving a big shopping list of personal attributes and behaviours you want in your next partner you're probably disqualifying half the girls who you've messaged because they don't 100% fit the bill. It might also come off at being a bit demanding too. In my honest opinion, DELETE IT! But hey, it's up to you.\n\n**WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE\n\n&gt;&gt;I work with young adults(18-25) in their wellness and recovery from severe mental health and substance addiction challenges. There is nothing else in the world I would rather do right now.\n\n&gt;&gt;Next fall I'm starting graduate school to receive my Masters in Social Work.\n\n&gt;&gt;Because of the nature of my job, I'm big on self-care. I love playing golf, hanging out with friends and family, road trips, singing along with music, and occasionally winding down on the weekends with a beer or two.\n\nOverall, I would say that this section is excellent, I would not change a thing. You actually talk about your job, demonstrate that you're passionate about it. Show that you have compassion, as well as some self-compassion valuing good times with friends and family. You also talk about future study which I think shows a lot of ambition and drive. Don't change a thing here.\n\nTo be honest, I wonder if rather than overhauling the \"self-summary\" section, you deleted the self-summary altogether (or maybe just made it very short and sweet) and just had this. That's a possibility.\n\n**I'm really good at**\n\n&gt;&gt;witty banter, listening, any athletic endeavor, making people feel comfortable, being honest...and hugs. I give fantastic hugs.\n\nExcellent. Keep all that.\n\n&gt;&gt;Oh yea, I can also vibrate my hand faster than anyone I've ever met. I always figured it was only useful for video games. Try to beat me...\n\nSounds a bit weird an obscure. I get that you're showing us a useless skill in order to demonstrate some offbeat humour, but I don't know if it quite works. People barely skim most people's profiles unless they're REALLY interested, so I can't see too many people clicking those links (redditors reviewing your profile excluded). Try find some other offbeat skills or talents to demonstrate your funny nature.\n\n**The first things people usually notice about me**\n\n&gt;&gt;is how easy I am to talk to. If I'm wearing shorts, definitely my calves.\n\nCool. Can't fault this.\n\n**Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food**\n\nI'm not going to go into this one. It's really just an exercise in showing what you like (as opposed to what you're like) to see if you and the audience have anything in common.\n\n**The six things I could never do without**\n\n1. family &amp; friends\n2. career\n3. music\n4. TV\n5. my car\n6. my iPhone\n7. boring you with my generic six things\n\nThese are all boring and generic. I guarantee you that there are a million people on okcupid with the exact same things listed. Keep the \"family and friends\" and change the rest to something mildly amusing. Maybe mention your dogs, a hobby that's important to you, caffeine (cos you work hard), something like a small \"life's pleasure\" that will make that person reflect and either crack a smirk or think \"yea, that is pretty important\" e.g. one of the things I have listed is \"the restorative power of clean sheets and clean underwear\".\n\n**I spend a lot of time thinking about**\n\n&gt;&gt;you.\n\n&gt;&gt;Corny? Yea, corny. If I said I don't think about anything all that great, would that be such a bad thing? I rarely think about politics, though I care about our country a great deal. I think it would be bad ass if the Loch Ness monster is real. I'll always have hope for that...until they drain the lake. I think In-and-Out is overrated. I think milk chocolate is the best flavor of ice cream, not even sure there's an option outside of Blue Bell. I think pomegranate is quickly becoming the bane of my existance. I think bananas are great and strawberries are great, but strawberry-banana flavored drinks are gross. I think /r/ is my favorite site. I think brown ankle socks for my brown sneakers should be easier to find. God bless eBay and the UPS. I think the judge that scored last night's fight 114-114 is nuts. I think math is a great subject. I think it would be greater if they would euthanize geometry. I think that is all for now.\n\nMildly amusing but a bit long-winded. Cut a few bits and bobs out. You've done a good job of showing us some light hearted observations, but just seems a bit long.\n\n**On a typical Friday night I am**\n&gt;&gt; winding down with family, friends or myself. Whether that's at a bar, restaurant, movie theater, ball game, concert, home...I never know.\n\nThis is fine but a bit cliche and unexciting. I like to flip this section and follow it up with \"my ideal friday night\" and then describe something fun and exciting (but realistic) to do. Might be a good date idea too!\n\n**The most private thing I’m willing to admit**\n\n&gt;&gt; is that I have a potty mouth. This isn't always so private though. :D\n\nThis is good, kinda light-hearted and funny.\n\n**You should message me if**\n\n&gt;&gt;you have a good heart and enjoy life. \n\nNice. Short and sweet. A much better alternative to that description of your perfect mate that you had in the self-summary.\n\nI hope this has helped.

{"body": "Man...\n\nSo, in highschool I wasn't sure if I was gay or straight. I think I somehow knew I wasn't bi? I dunno'. My first ever crush was on a girl. I had memorable sexual fantasies about her, and my earliest accounts of jerking it involved fantasies of this girl. Shortly thereafter I was at a friends house, and we were sitting on the couch watching a movie, his parents had gone out somewhere, and he diddled me. Not bad diddled, I definitely liked it, but it was kind of like \"what are we doing oh god okay haha movie lol bye\", and then went back to being normal. Happened a couple more times, and my crushes changed from girls to guys, so I just stuck with that, but I didn't want to come out. I think this whole.. series of events pushed me to be more attracted to \"straight acting\" guys, because I felt confused about my own sexuality, and even a little bit put off by \"openly\" gay guys.\n\nI'm from a small town, hick people, bad stuff for gay people, so I didn't want to deal with it in high school. I screwed around with a couple of girls, from blowjobs to sex to whatever, but never REALLY enjoyed it.\n\nQueue Freshman year college. It's welcome week, lots of drinking/meeting people, and jesus tapdancing christ was there a lot of gay people. Suddenly I felt like I was weird because I *wasn't* out of the closet. I felt comfortable hitting on guys a little bit, doing whatever. I didn't tell anyone I was gay, but I definitely was more outgoing than before. I met tons of friends, and enjoyed it more than anything, so I decided to sign up later that year to be one of the leaders for the next year's welcome week.\n\nQueue Sophomore year college. It's welcome week, and me + 5 or 6 others have a group of 40-50 freshman's we show the ropes. Lead tours, do events, games, have a huge beach day, all sorts of fun stuff, then all the groups meet up after the \"contracts\" end (i.e., don't seduce the freshman, don't give them alcohol, don't teach them bad things, etc), with our freshmen, and throw the biggest party of the year. \n\nEveryone goes, and my group had an abnormal amount of particularly attractive guys. One of them was at the party, a little tipsy, and started coming onto me like CRAZY. I hadn't even considered him interesting because 1) he was out of my league, and I'm pretty cocky, and 2) he seemed perfectly straight. He asked me to follow him and do a shot with him, but instead went into a bathroom. I waited outside, but he yelled for me to go in. I walk into the bathroom and, I shit you not, he's on his knees, and says \"I really want something from you...\" My jaw dropped, and I rush to unzip as he mumbles \"I need about tree fiddy.\", and I realize that damn Loch Ness monster is still trying to get my money.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379390938", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well I met this girl at a party, and we really hit it off. She was really pretty, and had a great ass. So we're talking, sitting on this old, deep, sofa, the kind that has no support whatsoever so that even a 98 pound anorexic would sink into it. Eventually, we lean in, kiss, and start making out. We keep, going and I start to feel her ass (God it was glorious, I'm a little hard just thinking about it). And I knew I had to get her somewhere private. Problem was, this wasn't my house, hell, I didn't even know the guy throwing the party too well (he was my roommate's friend). But, luckily, my hall and this shared a parking lot, and I had a car!\n\nSo I told her that we should continue this in my car, and she gives this naughty little smirk (which is almost as hot as her ass), and we head over to my car. As soon as we close the back door, and start touching, WHAM! Everything was over. Someone had yelled \"P-SAFE\"--campus security had come to shut down the party. We stopped everything, and laid as still as possible as a these Security trucks roll in, while everyone else runs the other way. One of these guys, flashlight in hand, walks right passed the car. \n\nNow, we were 18 and 19, so it wasn't illegal, but this wasn't the cops, it was campus security, and a little Catholic college were sex is technically not allowed. Some of these P-Safe guys were totally chill--hell, some of these guys were said to even buy weed from dealers on campus! But for every stoned security officer, the was a hard-ass who made Argus Filch look kind of nice. Besides, we had both had a little something to drink earlier, and didn't want to get in trouble for that either.\n\nSo we sit quiet for maybe 20, no more than 30 minutes. As this goes on, though, we aren't doing nothing. Silently, I have been running my hands all up and down her body, and have begun sliding some fingers into her pants. Once it looks like p-safe is down with this area, her pants came off. I had spent too long longer to feel her ass in my hands and plant my face between her thighs. But as I start to pull her pants down, I notice something odd. \n\nThe skin didn't quite feel right, and I suddenly noticed this odd smell. She seems to sense my hesitation, and says \"Don't mind that, it's this crappy lotion I use. I could buy some better stuff if I had about tree fiddy. *Well*, it was high time I noticed this girl was covered in scales and from the paleolithic era! I shoulda noticed I had just spent almost an hour feelin up this great scaly beast! And she says again to me, \"Yeah, I think I'd need about tree fiddy more.\" Well I wasn't gonna fuck with no Loch Ness Monster! And so I opened that door, and I got right outta there.  \n\nNever did get the smell out of my car.\n\n**TL;DR:** I told a tree fiddy", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379403762", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I come from a small country town in alabama and have a very common last name. For the sake of the story we will say it's Smith. \n\nNow this town was very small. Everyone knew everybody, and that's still pretty much the case even though it has grown to almost a small city. Back in the prohibition days there were two Smith families. My grandfather, the smaller of the two families, and JohnRay Smith's boys. \n\nNow the JohnRay boys were the kind you didn't want to mess with. But they were also the ones you went to if you needed something. Mainly moonshine, but they were known for robbing people, vandalism, burning down churches, even murder. \n\nThe police refused to do anything about it because they got a huge kickback and they had several family members on the force. JohnRay had an uncle that was pretty high up, I can't remember what exactly. \n\nWell my grandfather was just a church going cattle farmer who minded his own business. He kept to himself and stayed out of trouble. He taught his family to do the same. My father was one of the few to make it out of our town and go to college. And then his brother, and their sister after him. None of them ever went back except to visit my grandmother for holidays and such.\n\nWhy not my grandfather you might ask? Well JohnRay and the boys didn't like the fact that he was sending his kids to college. They said he thought his Smith clan was too good for the rest of the town. This couldn't be further from the truth. My granddad was just a simple man who taught his kids to work hard in every aspect of life. They worked their asses off in the field and in school and it motivated them to pursue a higher education. \n\nThis didn't matter to JohnRay. He had his sons and cousins start using the woods on my grandfather's property to make moonshine among other activities. My grandfather didn't like this, and decided to go talk to JohnRay. Needless to say that didn't go well and my grandfather warned him if they didn't leave he would handle it himself if he saw them on his property again. he also told him he would go to police in the town over and bring him down. \n\nBy this time my dad had just finished up law school and his sister was in her first year at Auburn. He had a pretty good internship in Hunstville and even had a connection with the DA. My grandfather told him about the problem and my dad promised he would look into it, but not to do anything. \n\nThat night my grandfather's house burned down. The glass from old moonshine bottles was scattered around the outside. My grandmother somehow made it out alive but was in the hospital for a week. It didn't take my dad long to get enough people involved and put together a case. In the end, JohnRay sold out a couple of his nephews/cousins and even a son, but he walked a free man. \n\nI have one picture of me and granddad. The day I was born. My dad told me the story I just told you and how it haunts him to this day that JohnRay got away with it. And the worst part is, every time we go \"home\" to visit, any time someone looks at our credit card or finds out our name looks at us with an evil eye and says \"Smiiiiith? You kin to JohnRay?\"\n\nA few months ago I got in the truck with my .22 and my picture of granddad. I made the 4 hour drive to see JohnRay. I pulled in the long gravel driveway and walked straight up to the screen porch door and let myself in. There sat old JohnRay in his recliner watching the alabama football game. \n\nI walked up to him slowly with one hand on the gun in my pocket and the other on the photo i placed in his lap. \"Do you know who I am?\" He said nothing. \"My name is tdt0005 and you killed my grandfather.\" \n\nHe spit into his dip cup and slowly turned his head at me. \"Well, are you gonna kill me boy? Cause I heard the city Smith's ain't got the balls to kill an old man. Yeah, I killed yer pappy, so what? What do you want from me?\"\n\nI pulled the gun out of my pocket, pulled the hammer back and as I looked him in the eye I said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time I realized I was the Loch Ness Monster and they couldn't charge me for murder because I don't exist. So I swallowed the bastard whole and burned down his house. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379436671", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was 18 years old when my first anal adventure happened. My girlfriend at the time had already gotten quite used to being fingered back there, and it was prom night, so I figured it would probably be the best time to take the dirt trail.\n\nSo, I had a little care package that I left in my car. It consisted of 1. Lube, and 2. Several packs of wet wipes.\n\nI take my well dressed self over to my GF's place and am amazed at how amicably her poor father was treating me considering I was planning to deflower his daughter's asshole in no more than about 5 hours. But I digress, probably best he never know.\n\nAnywho, we went to the dance and had a great time, we'd been dating for about 18 months at this point, and that prom just really brought it all together. I don't think I'd ever wanted her more.\n\nWe do the whole dance thing until it's over, then we head back to my place. Conveniently my rents were away on vacation, and my older sister was out partying, presumably for the rest of the night, so I had the place to myself.\n\nWe head to my bedroom and start getting hot and heavy. At some point we are naked and petting and after fingering her vagage for a bit to lube up my fingers, I stick the middle one in her asshole. She let's out a little yelp, looks up at me with that look that women only make when they've just been violated a bit but like it, and I ask her, \"I want to put it in your butt, tonight?\"\n\nShe responds seductively by querying, \"Tree Fiddy?\".\n\nIt was about this time that I realized my GF was the goddam lock ness monster, and that the story before mine has zero chance of having happened.\n\nYou can't just ram it in dry, son.

My friends and I would spend our summers attempting to build rafts to try and cross, using whatever we could scrounge up out of our parent's garage. One of our neighbors was (justifiably) very concerned that we were going to get hurt, or worse drown. One day he saw us outside, launching our latest construction. He came down to us, and said \"boys, before you launch that into the water, I need to tell you about the pale child.\"\n\n\"Years before your mom and dad moved here, a young family lived in a house next to the lake. The mother and father of the family had a favorite son, who they never punished, no matter what he did. One day the boy was playing by the water, late in the evening, and the parents let him stay outside because he was the favorite child. The boy pushed a log into the pond and tried to ride it like a canoe. As he was balancing, something dark and black reached out of the water and pulled him under. His body was never found, but late at night, if you look at the far edge of pond, you can see the boy's spirit struggling to escape the water.\"\n\nI believe he told us this story to scare us from trying to cross. However, being a strong willed child, I ignored his warnings. We continued laboring on our new raft, and when it was finally ready we launched. About 20 feet from shore, our little boat came to a sudden stop, and we were nearly jolted into the water. We peered over the side, and watched in horror as a ghostly white form slowly rose toward us. The white form broke the surface, and in terror I screamed \"what do you want?!\" The monster replied, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379534205", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was a kid (like between 7 - 11) I was obsessed with bigfoot, UFOs, conspiracies, the loch ness monster, etc. I read every book in the library on these topics, then every book in the next library over, then started getting books at the bookstore... I was never 100% convinced of any of it, I think, although I was a lot more naieve and prone to take claims at face value.\n\nWhat gradually shifted me to a skeptical mindset were the books that described hoaxes and misidentifications alongside the standard bigfoot and UFO tales. I started to see how these things could be falsified, and to appreciate the patterns that indicate potential falsehood. By then the internet was around, so I started digging into every topic with a vengeance and came up empty-handed of any sort of proof of these fringe topics. My later scientific and philosophic training helped me formulate what I hope is a mode of thought that better approximates the truth.\n\nMy point is that there's probably value in arguing / debating these points. Combating sloppy thinking can actually save lives and prevent people from being victimized. More to the point, there may be a 12 year old kid on the sidelines who reads your argument and says \"hey wait a minute...\"\n\nThe true believers are a lost cause. You cannot change their minds with argument; in thinking that you can, you're projecting too much of your own approach / background / bedrock ideology onto them.

{"body": "It's not because I found any 'argument against the existence of a god' particularly convincing, rather, I am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theist unconvincing. \n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379617142", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had a threesome with my ex-wife's mother and her aunt.\n\n\nI am an asshole, no doubt.  But here's a little background.  We'd gotten married way too young and fast.  We were constantly cheating on each other and had been separated a couple times all within 1 year.  It wasn't going to work out and were basically getting ready to split up for good.  \n\nMy ex-wife had been working graveyard that night, and she called me from work saying her mom and aunt had been getting drunk at a bar in town.  She was worried they would try and drive home drunk.  So I told her I'd go and drive them home.  When I pick them up,   the drunk aunt kept telling me how handsome I was and how I should come in for a drink when we got to her place.  I told her, \"Yeah, yeah.. I bet you've been saying that to all the guys tonight\".  She's sitting in the front passenger seat, while the drunk mother-in-law is laying down in the backseat.  The aunt starts giggling and grabbing my dick while I'm driving.  I'm sort of in shock, not knowing what to do or say.  So when I pull up in the driveway, the drunk mom insists we go in for a drink.  Since I figure the mom would be there too, I didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nAt this point, I know I'm definitely gonna bang the hot aunt.  I just figured it would be some other time since the mom wasn't around.  And yeah, I know I was being a complete fucking asshole cheating on my then wife with her aunt.  I get it.  \n\n\nSo anyway, we go in and she hands me a beer.  The aunt starts saying things like, \"Doesn't he kind of remind you of (her ex-husband)?\"  And they start kinda giggling and shit.  I'm just sitting on the couch trying to finish my beer and go home and masturbate already.  The aunt comes over and sits on my lap.  She feels my huge boner and says, \"OOH, I bet he's got a big dick too, just like (her ex).\"  I turn beet red and say, okay time for me to go.\"  I'm just trying to show my mother-in-law that I'm not trying to flirt back.  The aunt gets up, says something to my mother-in-law, and then comes back.  My mother-in-law tries to play it cool and says something like, \"Hey, I'm gonna lay down on your bed for a while.\"  The second she shuts the door, the aunt starts shoving her tongue down my throat.  I'm thinking my mother-in-law must be okay with it since she left us alone.  Either way, I was so ready to bone this woman.  We have sex on her couch and she's being way loud and I figure my mother-in-law HAS to hear it and know what's going on.  She's not coming out of the bedroom so... it must be okay with her?  \n\n\nAfter we're done, the aunt gets up and goes to the bathroom.  I can hear her talking to my mother-in-law and laughing.  I put my clothes on and get ready to leave when I hear my mother-in-law behind me... \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\"  Fuck, I'm screwed.  Oh well, it was worth it.  Plus, my then wife and I were getting ready to split up anyday.  I sit down, get ready to apologize and put on a show when she says to me, \"I heard you two, and now I am so fucking horny.  We might as well fuck too, don't ya think?\"  Boom, instant erection.\n\n\nSo I'm sitting there making out with my mother-in-law when her sister comes out and starts laughing and saying, \"OMG\".  I stop, but she keeps going to town.  I'm trying to figure out what's going on at this point and my mother-in-law starts taking my shirt back off.  The aunt comes over and takes my belt off.  I'm like, \"Oh wow.  Are we.... uhh... gonna really do this?\"  \n\n\nSo we ended up having one of the craziest nights I've ever had.  I didn't get home for about 4 hours.  When I got home, I took a shower and got in my truck and drove the fuck outta there.  I knew my then wife would be home anytime, I figured it would be best to just pretend I got up early and went fishing.  I drove around for a while and then came  home.  Sure enough, my wife was home.  I sit her down, tell her it's time to talk.  We agree we should split up and that was that.  I moved out that day and into my buddy's place.  I never told her or even my buddy exactly what happened.  To this day, I've never told anyone about it.  I guess I know it makes me look like a complete fucking asshole.\n\n\n\nHOORAY FOR BEING ANONYMOUS ON THE INTERNETS!\n\n\n\nedits: I have no idea what the fuck TREE FIDDY is or what in the hell the Loch Ness monster has to do with this lol.

{"body": "I know this is a long story, but it details the abuse of one poor girl at the hands of my yearbook staff and I.\n\nOur advisor was good, and stayed involved, but as the senior editor, I could get away with anything. By association, the whole yearbook staff could too.\n\nFor instance, I sorta rigged the elections for senior superlatives, but the worst thing we did was to one girl who wanted so badly to be in as many pictures as possible. She made great grades but not top, so she hated the handful of us on the yearbook staff that were closer to valedictorian than her, and on top of that she was a huge bitch to everyone in general - just the super self-centered competitive type. She was also in a whole bunch of clubs and on a few sport teams so she had a huge list of them in the registry in the back of the yearbook.   \n\nWell, we did senior quotes, and she submitted hers just the right way. It was exactly the character limit, and some truly inspiring bullshit about living life to its fullest, all in French. I personally put her quote In the yearbook right beside her picture, and all it said was \"live your life.\" I thought that was a fitting translation. I think we had a 300 character limit...\n\nNot only that, but we took her freshman zitty-faced braces yearbook picture and photoshopped that face onto the senior pic wearing the same fake dress thing with pearls to match all the other pictures. \n\nThen we conveniently photoshopped her out of a half dozen club and event pics by putting things like the school flag or podiums and other such things in front of her. We left her in DECA club. That club was terrible anyway.\n\nAnd to top it all off we just conveniently left her name and list of accolades and clubs out of the back of the yearbook. \n\nThe only thing we didn't mess with was her parent's dedication page in the back. We made sure to take extra care to ensure it was absolutely perfect.\n\nWe never heard anything about it, but she stopped by the yearbook office every day after we ordered them to see if they were in yet. She was so excited about it, so we let her look through the rough proofs from before we totally butchered her out of the yearbook, and she was such a bitch about telling us how we had formatted everything wrong. Still was glad to see her face everywhere in it, though. Haha.\n\nThe day comes and the yearbooks are in. She was first in line. She took hers and smiled so big as she carried it away to read with a handful of other girls way back in line. We saw her open it enthusiastically, flip to the first page she expected to be on, and her browl furled a little. She slowly flipped to the next page, now with a frown. Flipped a couple more, and turned to walk towards us. \n\nNow I expected she was about to flip her shit in front of half the school.  I started getting nervous, thinking that maybe we had gone too far. She approached the table and politely asked, with an almost guttural tone but hushed piety, for her money back. I told her that if she had her receipt we could do that for her, but she would have to wait as we only had a few bucks in change at the time (most people had preordered). She looked over into the lockbox to see what change we had and saw it, and said that the amount we had on hand was fine for now and she'd get the rest later. I said that it would be easier to just pay it all out later when I realized she was getting red in the face and quite seriously angry, and through gritted teeth she said, \"Look, right now ... I need about $3.50.\"\n\nIt was about that time that I realized that she was actually about 8 stories tall and a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era, and that I had made a serious mistake. I, naturally, refused the payment, and she dropped the yearbook on the table and sauntered off, holding back tears.\n\nI still see her from time to time, and she still harasses me about that damned $3.50\n\nPreemptive edit: typed from mobile, may be errors.\n\nFollow-up edit: obligatory thanks for the gold! I'm glad that ruining one person's high school memories can now bring more joy to others. For the record, the whole story is true until the last part. I never saw her reaction, but I'm sure she was piiiiissssseeeeddd. Especially since she knew it was me, and I made sure I was in every club picture and all over the yearbook in general in places I didn't need to be, but was at since I was the senior editor. (it's what you get when you give a high school senior a DSLR camera, free reign to edit the yearbook, and 90 minutes of free time every school day).\n\nAnyway, hope ya enjoy the fun we had.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1379683615", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I lost my virginity with an stripper in a little town called Metropolis, Illinois. \n\nI was there for a summer gig, a job that had me traveling all across the country (I think I logged like 4,000 miles that summer). I ended up in a place called Paducah, Kentucky and couldn't find a hotel cheap enough. So I crossed the river and found a rather nice Motel 6. It was right next to a strip club. I as in this town for the weekend (thursday night through sunday night) and made it a point to go in. \n\nFortunately I was getting a per diem on top of a great base pay with guaranteed overtime, and since I was sleeping and eating well under budget I had a LOT of spare cash saved up on my per diem card. I pulled a hundred dollars out at an ATM, took a shower, put on my best clothes, and walked over to the club. \n\nIn all, it wasn't too bad of a place. There were maybe 12 girls working, and 20 or so patrons since it was a friday night. I sat in a corner and tried my best to chameleon into the wall. (I was very shy and wanted to get the feel of the place before I talked to anyone.) Of course, the girls working could smell the fear and were on me like sharks. \n\nIn reality, it was not that bad. A girl walked up and sat next to me. she introduced herself and we started talking a bit before she offered me a dance. I declined with a \"maybe a bit later\" before she was pulled up on stage. A few minutes later, another girl sat down and we started talking. She made the same offer and I, somehow, plucked up the balls to nod and let her pull me into the private dance area. \n\nIf anyone here hasn't ever had a lapdance, it's kinda hard to describe. It feels both good and oh so restricted. But mostly, it just feels nice. After 2 songs, she gives me a hug and  kiss on the cheek and I walk back into the main room. I spot the first girl and ask if she's busy. She is not, and I get two songs from her too. \n\nNow I'm hooked. I went gain that saturday and sunday. and both times got at least one dance from the first girl, let's call her Mary. I end up dropping like 300 bucks on this one girl, and she is just my type. Turns out, this girl, when she does a private dance, gets really into it. She'll grind away and, according to her, she came several times dancing in my lap. \n\nNeedless to say, I was desperately horny at this point. But sunday came and I left the motel 6 in preparation for moving to the next job site. Fortunately for me, my work schedule ended up delaying me in the area for another 2 days (these government employees I was contracted with are not the pinnacle of efficiency.) So I go back to the club after checking into a Super 8 few miles away. This time, I pay for a few dances with Mary and at the end she leans down and whispers in my ear \"I am sooo tempted to fuck you, right here.\" \n\nNow, I was not a confident guy. I was VERY out of shape, like morbidly obese out of shape. And she is a professional saying *she* wants to fuck *me*. I was, and am to this day, astounded. I asked if she wanted to go back to my hotel, and she agreed. But her shift ended at 2 and it was only like 11:30, and I was tapped. \n\nI gave her my number, went and bought condoms, and went to my room to catch some sleep since I had to wake up early to go to the next job. Sure enough, she calls me at 2:10 and I give her instructions on how to get to the hotel and my room. \n\nShe comes up to the room and starts kissing my neck as I start taking her clothes off. She whispers in my ear, \"Wait, I need something first.\" I paused, heart pounding, and asked what. \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"\n\nIt was then that I realized Mary was actually was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Dammit Nessie! I ain't giving you no Tree Fiddy!\" I yelled as she smashed through the wall of my hotel and took off, jumping into the Ohio river and swimming off.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379730834", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

We weren't really in a good relationship, always bickering, fighting, it just wasn't any fun. I didn't intend to marry her, until she got pregnant. We married for the sake of the kid. It was OK for a couple of years, then we realized we were in a toxic relationship and we called it quits.\n\nIt was a rough year or so, but I kept looking forward to my 10 year high school reunion. I felt this could be a chance to reconnect with my high school crush. After facebook stocking, I realized she wasn't in a relationship at that time, she was mostly just focusing in on her career.\n\nI felt this was my opportunity. The day came, and I saw her from across the room. I casually made my way over to her, and struck up a conversation. We hit it off, and I asked her if she'd want to go out some time. She thought about it and said \"Well Yeah! But I need something from you first.\" I asked \"Sure what do you need?\" She looked at me and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that my high school crush was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

{"body": "The problem with relying on standardized test to show teaching quality is it forces \"teaching to the test\" rather than practical learning by students.  \n\nTeachers, up until the 60's were not burdened with making sure every single child was successful.  It was not mandatory that all students graduate from high school. In addition, there was no strict, nation-wide curriculum jammed down their throats then their jobs jeopardized if their students didn't take a standardized test seriously. \n\nOur education system now is geared toward the lowest common denominator for students. \n\nKids are also over-tested. Everything (even the ACT/SAT) becomes just another standardized test. I remember weeks wasted on Student Aptitude Tests, State Assessment Exams, Progress Report Testing, etc. Those weeks were valuable education and classroom time wasted on filling in scantrons. \n\nThese kinds of practices also don't account for good teachers in bad schools. When I say bad schools, I mean the culture of the demographic is not conducive to learning. If your parents don't care about your grades, if the community does not vote to raise property taxes to support the school and if education is not seen as a high priority, test scores will be low no matter what.  Punishing teachers based only on test scores and slashing funding as punishment is absurdly ineffective. \n\nThe good teachers, who want to teach curriculum that is useful to students (knowing how to contextualize history and its effects rather than memorizing the date of the Battle of Antedum) are forced out because their standardized test scores may be lower - but their students are ultimately getting a better *education.* \n\nThe \"Bad Teacher\" is a bit like the Loch Ness Monster. Lots of people claim to have seen one, but once you account for all the surrounding context - there's not a whole lot of substance. \n\n[This](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/being-human/children-today-are-suffering-a-severe-deficit-of-play/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AeonMagazineEssays+%28Aeon+Magazine+Essays%29) is an interesting article on how students may be more successful if we just left them alone - rather than increasing work-load or the school day or adult-structured activities. \n\nAdministrators do very, very little for a school system, aside from suck up valuable dollars. Secretaries and curriculum coordinators are the ones who keep a school functioning. Principals are simply figureheads to complain to and \"manage\" teachers - though they are notoriously ineffective at it.

When it comes to genuine biology, if there's one critter, there are many, and that must be a population large enough to sustain the species. \n\nThose kinds of populations leave traces, and while absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, a minimum viable population is generally thought to be in the 500 to 1,000 animals range, with 4 to 5 thousand being a good median estimate - in the wild.\n\nIf there are 500 Bigfeet or Nessies around, one would think we'd know it by now.\n\nAs to paranormal critters and entities, the big question is this: we humans have been around and communicating at an advanced social level for something like 40 to 50 thousand years. Wouldn't we know by now?\n\nThere is one scenario that could explain the ephemeral and equivocal nature of the paranormal: it doesn't really matter to us. Our nature has evolved to address things that materially impact our existence and survival. It may well be that paranormal things exist, but if they don't impact our survival, we probably wouldn't have evolved mechanisms for dealing with them.\n\nIf ghosts and demons were a genuine and natural threat to us, it's not unreasonable to presume we'd have known about it without any doubt long ago, and have ways of dealing with that threat.

{"body": "I was the nerdy girl in 10th grade. Not ugly, but not popular. I had glasses, always wore a hoodie. Probably  7/10, \n\nThere was this new boy. He was tall, slim, had amazing eyes. A good 9/10. All the girls were always gawking at him. I thought he was perfect. But who was I to go after him? I was a nobody.\n\nI was walking down the hall reading, \"The fault in our stars.\" School had just gotten out. I figured the halls would be scarce, so I didn't bother watching where I was going. Oh, and behold. I bumped into someone.\n\n\"Sorry.\" I muttered as I leaned down to pick up my books. I glanced up and It was him. \"Don't worry. it happens to the best of us. \" He smirked  and my face flushed. He handed me my books and we stood up. We started walking towards the door and he began talking again, while I sit silent in my awkward body. \"What's your name?\" - \"nessabessa34\" I responded. He reached out his hand and said, \"I'm james.\" And half smiled. I melted. I sheepishly took his hand as he shook mine. \n\n\"So, nessabessa34, Would you like to go out with me tomorrow?\" \n\n\"Y..Yeah..\" I stammered and scribbled down my address on a scrap of paper. \" -\"I'll pick you up at 8.\" He half smiled and walked away. I was in love with this boy already.\n\nFast forward and we had been dating casually. About 6 dates. We were very close and i was getting very comfy with him.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting. It was about our 10th date. We had been dating about two months. I was a virgin. We had kissed. Blah blah. But then one day after a date, we snuggled up on his couch.\n\nWe began making out pretty heavily. He was running his fingers through my hair. I had goosebumps. He pulled back and looked me in the eyes, full of passion. \"Do you want to?\" He said, so smoothly.\n\"I'm a virgin..\"\n\n\"So am I. It's okay.\"\n\nI nodded and leaned back into the pillows.\nHe began kissing me all over my body.  My body was painted in goosebumps.\n\nHe looked me in the eyes and kissed me gently as he entered me.\n\nIt was the greatest pleasure I've ever felt. I felt like fireworks. I felt like life! It was amazing!\n\nAfter we finished he stood up and put on his shirt. And this is where it got awkward. I never thought someone I loved would say something like that to me. \n\nhe leaned down and looked me in the eyes as he whispered..\n\n\"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\nI then realized the sexy boy I knew Was was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. \n\nI never did see James ever again, but I thought about him from time to time.

{"body": "I am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing. \n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379807002", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I think there are a lot of reasons why I married someone I wasn't really sexually attracted to. You might see it as wrong of me to do it, to make someone that I'm not sexually attracted get married to me as \"wrong\" or \"bad\" and may think they are being tricked, but I'll give you some counter points.\n\nFirst off, I still love her. She is amazing, witty, funny, intelligent, all of those traits you look for in someone. She is like that best friend in your life that you couldn't imagine your life moving on without. The thought of never seeing them again terrifies you, and they can comfort you in any situation.\n\nI also grew up in a republican home, strict catholics back as far as our family tree can go. Church every week, private schooling to keep us emerged in our faith, and all of this back when homosexuals were still seen as mentally disabled. Imagine going to your parents and saying, \"Mom.. dad.. I think I'm retarded.\" They would gasp and wonder why you thought that, what they did wrong, did they fail as parents? Did God want you to be messed up?\n\nSecond, I still want a family. I want kids that are my own. Kids I made, that look like me and act like me, and will never wonder where they are really from, or why kids at school make fun of them for having two dads. My kids shouldn't be affected by my lifestyle. Sure it may not be a huge problem in today's society, but I saw how gays have been treated and to an affect still are treated by \"normal\" people.\n\nFinally, we were made for each other, even from the first time we met. I like to re-imagine it because it reminds me why we're married. It's just like someone else who is married remembers first meeting their spouse.\n\nLet me set the scene.\n\nIt was a beautiful autumn day when I first met Rachel. We were both studying outside of our dorms. Although we didn't know each other and weren't in the same classes she peered over as a furiously erased a problem from my notebook. As I stared down realizing I just wasted 15 minutes on a problem to have done it wrong I heard a quiet voice chirp up, \"If that's calculus, I could probably help you.. if you wanted some help.\" She quickly backtracked and said, \"I'm not, like, trying to come off as smarter than you, but I took that class in high school so I could probably help I guess.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said \"I could really use some help with this.\"\n\nWell we powered through the rest of that homework, and decided to go get some lunch after all the stressful problems we had worked through. We chatted about our crappy hometowns, how college is so much better, how much we hated being restricted by our parents, etc. Normal college kid talk.\n\nWe exchanged numbers and figured we could work together more in the future.\n\nAfter about a month we had become best friends. Always hanging out and joking around. Nothing could separate us. Then it happened. As we were eating some chinese food together and joking around she looked at me with a look I can't even describe. She leaned in and started whispering in my ear. \"Can... Can I ask you something?\" \"Sure,\" I replied. With her best attempt at a seductive voice she whispered, \"Can I just have about tree fiddy?\" And at that moment I realized the person I had become best friends with over the past month was really a three  story tall monster from the paleolithic era. I said, \"Get outta here you damn loch ness monstah!\" And she reluctantly left the room with a defeated look on her face.\n\nSo it isn't about sexual attraction, it's about love, family, and wanting to have a better life for your kid.\n\n**Tl:dr: Read it, I put a lot of heart and thought into this response.** \n\nEdit: Fixed some minor spellign erors that apparently bugged everyone.\n\nSecond edit: [For all those people who sent me hateful PM's](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Ron-Swanson-Says-Dont-Even-Care.gif)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379807277", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 782, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was in a relationship like that for 2 years. My story is actually very similar to the loch ness monster guy's story except that it's real. We met in a college class we were both taking. We spent time almost every day talking together until we realized we were in love. I'd never held hands or kissed anyone before her. I loved her completely. I knew I was gay but I also knew I cared deeply for her. She was kind, talented, beautiful, intelligent, generally amazing person. We separated for unrelated reasons, neither of us wanted to but I knew I had to (sorry for a lack of explanation here).\n\nAs to sex, we had tons of it. She was a freak and we had lots and lots of fun and sometimes rough and dirty sex. I knew it wasn't right of me to be thinking of the hot guy at work while I was working her but you can't really keep those things from flashing in your mind, you just have to push them out. The warmth of her body against me felt amazing. I fucking loved working her nips with my tongue as long as I could because I could see in her face how much she loved it. I wanted her to feel good, so lots of cuddling/kissing/foreplay. Sex was fine but I always felt there was something missing - no I don't mean just a dick, I mean the whole body and physical sensation of a man. I knew this without ever having been with one. We fucked for hours sometimes so arousal was never an issue, I just always felt something was off. The only issue I has was oral. That was really hard for me to deal with. I think straight guys love vaginal fluid and more power to them, but I just couldn't stand to do that very long so I just stayed around the clit as much as I could until things got sloppy then moved elsewhere. It's rather hard to understand why I can eat a guy's ass for just about ever but vaginal discharge was like garlic to a vampire for me.\n\nThat was almost 15 years ago. I still think about her almost every day. She's the single best thing that ever happened to me. I've never dated a man. I've never met a man that made me feel like she did nor do I think one ever will. I've had lots and lots and lots of sex with men afterwards and loved it. Things finally felt right there. I've just never met a person that I could enjoy both sex and a relationship with at the same time. I wish so badly I could have felt what I needed to for her. My life would be so much more complete and enjoyable if that were the case.

{"body": "I have found your putative Nessie.\n\nI started thinking about standardized tests in 1993. My son had come home from school and complained that he was confused about how to add mixed numbers. I showed him how to add mixed numbers a couple of ways and he responded that wasn't how his teacher showed him. He then showed me a method he claimed his teacher had taught him. The method made absolutely no sense.\n\nThinking he had missed something in the teacher's presentation, I asked to meet with the teacher to see what she had said so I could clarify to my son what he had missed when she showed the class how to add mixed numbers. Turned out he hadn't mis-understood her - she didn't know how to add mixed numbers and she had taught the entire class a bogus technique. I showed her her method worked in the case she had illustrated but didn't work in another.\n\nIt was at that point that I started wondering how an administrator would know there was a problem in a classroom. Clearly, the principal can't monitor every lesson and if a few of lessons are screwed up, how would the principal ever know? Standardized testing turns out to be the only rational answer. \n\nIt's fine to teach a child the general technique on how to add mixed numbers because you know there are likely to be some mixed number questions on a standardized test. I see absolutely nothing wrong with a teacher doing that. OTOH, a teacher who gets to peek at the upcoming standardized test or knows from prior years what's on the test and teaches the answers to the specific questions is not only teaching to the test but they should be fired for doing so.  As should the principal if he/she put the teacher up to it.\n\nMy 11th grade history teacher made a point of teaching us how Locke, Blake and Hume influenced the words that went into the Constitution. She also made it clear to us that you had to know dates because if you didn't you'd think Mario Savio started the Free Speech Movement during the Depression which would have been highly unlikely given the gestalt of the 30's.\n \nI disagree with your blanket statement that administrators do very little for a school system. I have met both kinds of principals - the kind you're thinking of and administrators who knew how to run an excellent school. An excellent school requires excellent staff and to identify and keep them you need an excellent administrator.  \n\n Margie Thompson ran an outstanding school back in the 80's and 90's in Inglewood California.  She took students who were in the bottom decile demographically and placed them in the 6th decile on the STAR tests. \n\nI happened to know Thompson because she hired my wife. Thompson was everything you wanted in a principal - she dealt with problem students and parents, hired uniformly excellent teachers and kept the custodians on their toes so the school looked good despite limited funds to do so. My wife would routinely go into school on the weekends and find the staff parking lot was full - all the other teachers were there setting up their classrooms for the coming week. It was a vibrant school in a very poor neighborhood run by a woman who knew how to run a school.\n \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379820561", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, I'll bite... story time.\n\nI went to a big party school for college. Halloween night, it was absolutely awesome. It was my freshmen year, and I was a big drinker. We had an apartment on campus with 3 other roommates one of which was a Chinese exchange student and was never actually there, and another who was a huge video game nerd and refused to ever drink, ANYTHING (which is totally fine, I feel bad being a dick to him about it at the time). Anyways, as such, the guys below us had the same layout but all 4 of them liked to party, plus my one roommate who was the only guy I had ever met who liked to party as much as I did.\n\nWe had parties 4 or 5 nights out of the week - and all 6 of us were always advertising it across campus to all the women in our classes who we thought were hot enough to come.\n\nSo Halloween night, one of the guys from below (we will call John) had a girl he regularly saw - not sure if it was a fuck buddy or relationship, but he mentioned to me he wanted it to be a relationship. We also had girls coming dressed up in the hottest shit - this particular girl we will call Amy was wearing a Toga like a Greek Goddess. Another girl, named Amber, was dressed up like the Purple Fanta Girl, and lastly a girl named Stacie was dressed up in a Zebra pattern slutty dress. We didn't get the idea, so we just called her Zebra Cakes all night long like the Little Debbies.\n\nStacie didn't like this much, so to prove herself she was making out with me. Fanta girl and her were roommates. Greek Goddess Amy was John's \"FB\" or what-have-you, and she evidently didn't appreciate me making out with Zebra Cakes. Long story short, all 3 of them are making out with me in front of about 40 other people who I could give a shit less about at this moment because I'm getting action from 3 different girls - this shit is like a porno in the making and I am exhilarated having never experienced anything like it.\n\nAmy's \"FB\" (my friend downstairs) was working that evening at a call center close to the campus, as such she leads us all into my room. We are fooling around for a good hour and the party is pretty dead outside as it's become quite quiet. These girls are hot I might add, like super fucking hot. I am hard as a diamond in an ice storm and we're all going to town. I mean I'm having girls eat each other out while they are giving me head, or riding me and sitting on my face - I'm talking the whole 9 yards. What a fucking night...\n\nBOOM. In walks John from downstairs. None of the girls had managed to lock my door as I was witnessing some of the hottest shit I'd ever seen. I'm going to town on Amy and I shit you not, as she's on top of me and the other two girls are fooling around with each other. John looks in disbelief and I don't know if he wanted to beat the shit out of me or cry or applaud me. He was completely silent.\n\nI said, \"LOOK I CAN EXPLAIN\"\n\nHe looks at me and says, \"I don't need your GOD DAMNED explanation - I'm just gonna need about tree fiddy\"\n\nThat's when I realize the truth... John, my good friend from downstairs, was really a three story tall monster from the Paleolithic Era.\n\nI said, \"Get the *HELL* outta here you damn Loch Ness Monster!\"\n\nJohn turned tail and, with a clearly depressed look on his face, left. I guess this explained why getting Amy off was so incredibly difficult.\n\nSo I guess the moral to this story is, don't ever let a monster interrupt your porn fantasy.\n\n**TL;DR - may as well read it, it's pretty hot**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379871926", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I posted a bullshit comment about my best hookup experience. Got me 400 karma and I didn't even feel bad. Here is the comment:\n \nI was an introvert mostly throughout High School. I didn't go to many parties, nor did I have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked.\nUnfortunately, I had 0 skills on picking up girls even though I was trying really hard to get a girl.\nIn 11th grade there was a party around my school's christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it. I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where. I still remembered her name though, Vanessa. She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me. I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible. She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back. I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of. Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\"\nI started saying more things.\nShe laughed even more.\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl. But then it dawned on me. I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where. A strip club. Vanessa was a stripper. Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously. My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once. I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house. This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue. I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself.\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone. A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms. I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside.\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off Vanessa's clothes. Finally, she was fully naked, as was I. She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\". Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\" I couldn't believe it. This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin. I still can't believe it. I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock. She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to. I told her I was a virgin too and she said good. As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\" \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life. Been waiting for awhile for someone to post a question like this to askreddit for a long time now. Happy I finally got the chance to tell that story.\ntl;dr: A stripper who aggressively threw herself on to me was actually a virgin.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379940931", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I work at a law firm in administration. A cute employee under me (let's call her Jane) was getting slack, turning up to work late, not getting all her paperwork on time, etc. She'd been working with us for about six months, and was fine up until one month prior. I had a couple of informal talks with Jane about her subpar performance, but for one reason or another the message wasn't getting through. So I had to call her into my office and write her up officially, and give her a warning that she was at risk of being terminated if she didn't shape up. I reckon she couldn't've given two shits about anything I was saying until I dropped the word 'termination'. Suddenly she starts crying, and I shit you not, leans OVER the desk where we're both sitting and clutches my neck, begging me not to fire her. I brush her off straight away, tell her to calm down. She explains to me that she'd recently broken up with her boyfriend, and that her mind hasn't been in the right place. So I spend a couple of minutes listening to her vent (not very professional, I know, but I was still in shock at the sudden display of emotion). \n\n\nAfter she finishes, there's just silence for a moment. Then she thanks me for listening, and then out of the blue, asked me if I had a girlfriend. Keep in mind that I generally keep my personal life to myself, especially from people that I'm in charge of. No fraternising with the plebs, to put it bluntly. I tell her that I've been single for a while, not that it's any of her concern. And suddenly she starts asking me about what qualities I like in girls, what features....I'm sitting here thinking what the fuck? I just called you in to give you a warning, and now you're trying to pry into my personal life? I interrupt her mid-sentence, and tell her that she has to leave, but the written warning still stands, and she has to get her performance back up to standard or risk termination. She fucking LOSES it. Goes absolutely ape shit. Gets on the desk and DIVES on me, tackling me in a headlock, knocking my chair to the ground. So I'm pinned underneath her (she was a bigger girl, not fat, but definitely some meat on her) while she's CLUTCHING my neck sobbing 'please don't fire me, I'll do anything'. Fuck a duck. I tell her to get off me before I manhandle her off and call security to have her escorted from the building. She calms down, and suddenly, I feel her hand groping at my crotch. She draws her face up to mine, and says 'please, let me do this for you'. \n\n\nNow, I have to admit, I had a moment of weakness. It'd been a while. I didn't say yes, but my hesitation was all the invitation she needed. She undid my belt, and within a second, her cold clammy hand was on my shaft, stroking up and down. The combination of sheer fucking shock and absolute elation completely paralysed me. Here we are, under my fucking desk, and an EMPLOYEE is pinning me down and giving me a handy-j. My mind was racing... what if someone walks in? We'd both be gone. And what the FUCK just happened...? I told her, I said \"Jane, you have to stop, get off me!\" She replied \"Come on, I really need this!\" I ask her \"What do you need?\" She stops, looks me dead in the eye and says \"I need about tree fiddy\". That's when I realised that I was being jerked off by the goddamn loch ness monster.

{"body": "The Midwest would be so tight for the next GTA game, and I say that as a native Miami Floridian.\n\nChicago based city: We have the big city, with industry and business, mansions, skyscrapers, a beautiful coastline with a great lake, and some poorer areas. This city plays like your average GTA city: you do something bad cops come after you, you can pull heists on banks and do all that fun stuff. There is lots to do in Chicago. We have changing seasons, beautiful autumns, blooming springs, sunny summers, and white winters.\n_____________\n\nGreat Lakes: here we have the same opportunity to really explore the lakes, maybe there can be a Loch Ness monster Easter egg, or something fun like that. Maybe a fun fishing minigame, scuba diving. There will be a lot of water traffic as trade ships use these lakes to import and export things to the east (probably liberty city). During the summer there can be lots of yacht parties, kayakers or canoers, people at the lake beach. During the winter the lakes freeze over, and can be walked on or driven upon. However, if you are not careful you can crack ice, and freeze. Once you hit freezing water you have 4 minutes to get our of the water and find warmth. You can do this big stealing a car, and warming yourself up inside it. Beat up an ice fisher, strip him naked, take his warm clothes, and if you are feeling extra mischievous, throw him down his fishing hole. You can ride one of those icebreaker boats and uncover the lakes again if you would like.\n__________________________________\n\nIn Between the cities: Here we have the opportunity to hunt in Midwest woods. You have to be careful for Bears and Wolves they are dangerous. Bears can bother you if you are fishing near a stream, and wolves will compete with you to hunt game. There will be many farms, and farmers, and trailer parks, methheads, etc. Almost like Blaine county but more woodsy.\n______________________\n\nCollege towns: There would be two college towns between both cites. These towns can be modeled after Madison Wisconsin, and Ann Arbor Michigan. On school will be the smarter, snotty, preppy, ivy league-like school. The students want prescription drugs to study hard, so perhaps you can have missions to help supply that demand, and rockstar has the opportunity to make fun of these institutions and students. The second school can be a party school. This school has a very active Greek scence, and many frat bros with popped shirts and backwards visors can give you missions to prank the other school, or supply them with the party drugs they need. Want to ride the school's live mascot? Go for it! Again another opportunity for rockstar to make fun of college students. The two schools can have a big football rivalry, and a game between the two teams can offer a great opportunity to cause chaos. Maybe you are a gambling man and don't like losing, so you bet on one team, and bust the opposing team's QB's knees with a baseball bat before the game. Maybe you can climb on top of the stadium, take out a sniper security guard, and snipe the football when thrown in the air (maybe with some slow mo dead eye shooting). Or just snipe the running back's knee. Go into the stadium crowd and mug someone; there are too many people around invested in the game, no one will notice. In both schools, if you start causing trouble and get a one star, fat campus security guards chase you in golfcarts, until the proper authorities are called.\n_________________________\n\nDetroit based city: on the other side of the map lies a smaller city based off Detroit. Here criminal activity is rampant, and police presence is severely lacking. As long as you stay away from downtown and the auto industry. Here you can really cause mayhem with a lot less repercussion. You can make your own car, from scratch. How you want it to look, and how it drives is completely up to you and how much money it costs. After a while maybe you can take control of one auto business, and start selling and mass producing your model. Make a giant penis shaped car, and if you market it properly you will see many people driving down the street in your new car. Gang violence is a major issue in Detroit, and there are plenty of abandoned factories you can repurpose for your criminal activity.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379956033", "subreddit": "GTA", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A great friend of mine committed suicide in front of me while I was trying to talk him out of it. It has been the absolute worst thing I have ever witnessed and I am constantly haunted by it. The worst part is I am completely responsible for his death. Nobody believe me though, and his family and friends all tell me there was nothing I could have done. \n\nIt happened almost five years ago. I received a very strange text message from my friend. It was full of gibberish and random nonsense and I could tell there was something very wrong. So I decided I should go over to his house and check up on him. As I arrived I noticed he was pacing back in forth in his room ( I could see him through his window in the front of his house) and as I got closer I noticed he had a gun in his hands and was shaking it around. I was immediately alarmed by this because he had never owned a gun before.\n\nSo I called the cops thinking he was contemplating suicide and that he and I needed help. After I get off the phone I walked up to his door and knocked. I heard him breathing heavily on the other side of the door. I yelled at him to let me in, that we need to talk and that I wanted to help him. He responded but I could not understand him, he was speaking clearly and with intention but it was a language I did not understand. This scared me because I had known him since we were young and he had never been able to speak, read, or write anything but English. So I pleaded with him some more, to let me in so we could talk.\n\nAs I was pleading he fired off several rounds. I knew he hadn't shot himself yet because each round was spaced a few seconds apart. However, I knew I didn't have much time before he would finally turn the barrel on himself or me. So I decided to try and reminisce about our childhood together. I talked about everything from football to teachers we hated to blistered palms from Mario Party.\n\nFinally he responded, still in the same tongue he used before, but this time in softer tone and less urgent. That is when he opened the door. I could sense the fear in him, I could see the pain and loneliness in his bloodshot eyes. He was on a knee, hunched against the wall, a blood soaked shirt hung tattered over his shoulders and he was bleeding from various self inflicted wounds. His face was pale and lips were a translucent purple.\n\nWe stayed in that doorway locked in a stare-down for an eternity until the silence was broken by the sound of sirens. That's when he finally spoke up to me and asked what I was doing there. So I calmly sat down next to him maintaining my eye contact. And I said \"I need about treefiddy.\" I could tell he had had enough of me, he screamed \"What do you want from me monster?\", put his gun to his temple and ended it all. As I walked back to my car I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and I noticed I was not this cute little girl scout but a 500 foot monster from the paleolithic era.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379963848", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's not as much the location of where I saw Waldo, more the circumstance. I've been waiting to tell this story for a very long time.\n\nMy wife (girlfriend back then) and I were both off work and we woke up to radiant weather. Deciding to make the most of our day, rather than the usual lie-in, we packed up the car and headed to a theme park 40 minutes outside of town. We arrived early enough to beat the usual entrance queues and bought a Fast-Track pass each. It was actually the first time I'd been there since my early teenager years, resulting in an even greater thrill from each of the rides. Combine that with the gluttonous amounts of cotton candy and popcorn, and you had one hell of a day.  \n\nWe were coming to the end of The Haunted House and I was needing a toilet break real bad. I'm not sure if it was because of the terrifying living props or the bladder full of soda, but I had to get out of there. I followed the dimly illuminated passage as quickly as I could, trying my best to ignore the actors along the way. Once I finally broke free into the sunlight, I desperately scanned for a toilet sign. I gasped with relief when I realised they were in a block across the path.\n\nAs I approached the bathroom, I saw a guy with awful body language enter it just before me. You know the type, hunched shoulders and head down. What made it even more peculiar was that this guy was wearing the Waldo bauble hat, the striped jumper and the blue trousers. It didn't really have time to register with me until I had relieved myself in the urinal. (And what a relief it was.) By this stage he was now in a stall, sobbing profusely. We were the only two in the bathroom, so after ensuring it was the Waldo trouser ends under the door I checked if he was ok.\n\n\"Y'alright, man?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ehh, not really\" he replied through a breaking voice, which had an extremely eerie tone to it.\n\nI immediately felt sorry for the guy and tried to reassure him, \"Is there anything I can do to help ya?\" \n\n\"Ehh, you couldn't lend me a few dollars?\" \n\nI had now started to get more sceptical and less remorseful. \"How much you need?\"\n\nAs I said that, the latch on the door clicked open. All of a sudden, this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era, comes out of the stall, wearing a Waldo costume. \"About tree fiddy.\" \n\nI completely lost my cool. \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!

{"body": "One of my best friends in high school played a rusty trombone. \n\nSTORY TIME:\n\nLets call him Nestor. Nestor came from a poor family that lived off about 3 or 4 bucks a day, food stamps, and whatever \"showed up\" for them to pawn.  He was the kid who wore ratty second hand (more like 5th hand) clothes, held his book bag together with duct tape, and walked to school in the rain with out a jacket cuz he didnt have one.  I knew Nes for a while, and he was one of the best people I ever knew, honest to a fault, generous with what little he had ( he often went hungry so his little sister could eat) and he would always do the right thing.  \n\nNestor had one dream, He wanted to play trombone in a big band. He didnt watch TV much, the old tube that their father had \"found\" could only play VCRs ( I swear if anyone asks what a VCR is i will not be held responsible for my actions) and the only movies they had were the Glenn Miller story and the Music man (the old one, duh). Band music, marches, Jazz, swing, that is what Nestor loved. While other kids in the neighborhood listened to Rap, R&amp;B, Pop and the other garbage that was blasted over the radio in the 90's Nestor was tuned in to Sing, Sing, Sing, Minnie the Moocher, Lassus Trombone, Birdland and many other greats from eras long passed. It was his dream. \n\nHis dream became a bit more real when he got old enough to join the School band. Only one thing stood in his way - he needed an instrument, and not just any instrument a trombone.  The school, knowing his family flat out denied him a loaner instrument under the guise of \"you cant afford a security deposit\". No music rental shop had prices low enough for them to afford it. Nestor's only hope came in the form of an old beat up brand-less instrument sitting on a dusty shelf in a pawn shop. But even that was too much. Nestor was beat, his dream evaporated, he fell in to a depression that no one could breach. Then something happened, there was an armed robbery at the pawn shop and a whole bunch of stuff was taken, some of the bags of loot were dropped on the way out but the theif got a way with some electronics, cash, a handgun, and an old beat up trombone.  Nestor showed up to band the next day saying his dad had spend a hidden reserve of cash on it. We didnt question it. \n\nNestor named his horn \"Rusty\" it was only fitting, the patina was worn, the slide dinged, and the spit valve didnt sit quite right. Nes and Rusty became inseparable, he spent every free moment practicing and by the time we hit high school he was so good that he auditioned as a freshman for the jazz band and ended up as first chair. For the rest of high school we watched in amazement as our friend became a professional musician. he recorded a couple of CDs  with local groups and had his work sold  in our home town. He held concerts, and sat in with visiting groups. It was astounding, He was living his dream. \n\nI lost touch with him for most of college. but every once and a while i heard about a big gig of his. or the fact that he had gotten married. I was invited to the two baby showers but i couldn't make it. I gradually fell out of touch and it wasn't until a few months ago i saw him again.  He called me out of the blue. Said he needed help. I met him at his apartment, picked him up, and loaded a few boxes in to the car. he told me the story. His youngest daughter had a rare lung disease that was gonna kill her, and he needed to pawn some of his stuff to pay for a hail-mary experimental  surgery  (her only hope at this point ) that his crappy insurance didint cover, as far as the insurance was concerned, the girl was dead already and would not give a cent. So we hit a few pawn shops and sold old records, books, designer brand clothing, and other memorabilia that was worth a few bucks.\n\nI was unloading the last bit while he was doing the math, seems like he was close to what he needed. But to my horror the last item he had to hawk was none other than Rusty. His treasured instrument that had made his dreams real. I asked him if he really needed to sell it. he looked at me with sad eyes and said \"yep im short by a bit and my girl is in pain man\". I was beside myself \"look Nes, were old friends ill give you the difference, just keep Rusty ok? how much are you short by?\" He looked down and when he looked up he was crying and through choked sobs and sniffs \" Thank you Wordplaya101, thank you so much. i need about tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380097901", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**tl;dr** Here's a [series of photos](http://imgur.com/a/zuuKd) my dad took Easter of 1993 that is a good representation of what it was like having 2 older brothers.\n\n**Overly-detailed version:**\n\nI have two older brothers. One is 8 years older than me, one is 4 years older. \n\nI freaking *worshipped* them growing up. I thought they were just the coolest. I always wanted to play with them. Unfortunately for me, half the time our \"games\" were just them being mean to me--tying me up in the basement and leaving me in the dark as \"monster bait\", convincing me the Loch Ness Monster lived in our house and wanted to eat me, letting me watch *Alien* when I was six, locking me out of the house when our parents were gone, etc. They never let me listen to my own music--I wanted Britney Spears and N*Sync and Backstreet Boys, but they insisted on Nirvana and Led Zeppelin and Metallica (although that is something that I thank them for in retrospect).\n\nI was never super bothered by the mean big brother stuff, though, because they also:\n\n* helped me with homework\n* taught me how to ride a bike\n* played Polly Pocket with me (I set up all my Polly Pockets into a town, they invaded with Star Wars miniatures, battle ensued)\n* played endless video games and board games with me\n* played hide and seek and had super-soaker fights at midnight during the summer\n* taught me how to swear (and when not to swear)\n* etc.\n\nThere was a phase where the brother closest in age to me absolutely despised me, and I him. We were at each other's throat most of the time. I think our parents thought we would legitimately hate each other forever. It got much better when he was an upperclassman in high school, I think mostly because he was so busy that he was never home. After he went away to college and I started high school our relationship improved. When I was 17 and he was 21 he recruited me to be his DD whenever he was visiting home on college breaks, and one summer he took a job at the place where I'd worked for several years. We worked together almost every day and got along just fine. It was like a miracle.\n\nEven though they were jerks to me a lot when I was middle-school aged (which was warranted, probably, since middle schoolers suck), I still decided I wanted to be just like them when I got to high school. I joined the sports they had been in, joined band and drama and choir, joined all the same clubs.\n\nAll of us get along really well now that we're adults (there's a third brother, but he's younger than me and just started college). Whenever we all get together--which isn't often because geographically we're spread far and wide--it's like a big party. Lots of wine and beer, lots of joking and shit-talking, lots of shenanigans (we will always have in our hearts the Great Drunken Snowball Fight during the Christmas Blizzard of 2010). We call and text each other. I just spent over two weeks visiting my oldest brother down in Texas, and I regularly hang out at my other brother's house. \n\nWhen I was down visiting the oldest one, his fiancee was asking what I wanted to do one Saturday night. She kept suggesting different nightclubs. I told her that I preferred laid-back bars or pubs where I could have a reasonably priced beer and not have to pay a cover. She turned to my brother with a shocked expression and he grinned and said, \"I told you! She's exactly like me, except a girl and eight years younger.\" Kinda felt like the best compliment ever.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380140431", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Price/paleo/primal devotee of some degree, I typically think that nutrition is a huge overlooked blind-spot when it comes to healthcare.\n\nNo scientific consensus is ever going to recommend the paleo diet, and for good reason. Also, the paleo diet probably wouldn't effect epigenomes all that much. People have been eating modern grains for 5,000 to 15,000 years and our epigenome has been fine. It's only been the last 80 years where we've seen a rise in auto-immune disease. It's likely attributable to pesticides and other contaminants in our food, so the solution is to eat as much unprocessed food as possible.\n\nOf course avoiding processed food is vastly different from the scientifically flawed paleo diet. For one, the \"paleo diet\" itself is basically a myth. It's impossible. The meat, nuts, fruits, and vegetables we eat today are all vastly different from the foods humans ate in the paleolithic era. Just like grains, all the other strains of food we eat (meat, veggies, ect) have been selected millions of times over and don't genetically or nutritionally resemble their ancestors from 10,000 years ago. Of course neither do human beings. \n\nIf we were to name the non-microscopic species that have genetically changed the most over the last 10,000 years, it would be humans and the food we eat, including nuts, meat, fruit, veggies, and all the other foods ascribed to the paleo diet.\n\nYes, nutrition seems to be able to improve your epigenome, but the only conclusive and repeatable studies so far on the subject have removed highly processed foods (white flour) and replaced them with whole foods (whole grain flour, brown rice, ect).

After a lengthy discussion, I was ready to achieve salvation and followed the reverend inside.

{"body": "Kind of a funny story actually. \n\nWe met one day in math class, because I was late and I just sat down in some random seat. I struck up a conversation with her, and it went pretty well, so well, in fact, that she added me on facebook later that evening.\n\nFrom there we just talked a lot on facebook. I asked if she wanted to go see a movie with me some time. She said yes, so I was really happy. That was nice.\n\nHere's where it starts to go downhill. After talking to her on fb for about a month, the summer break starts. She stops talking to me. For a month. I sent her a couple messages but I wasn't pushy at all or anything. She just stopped. \n\nWhere I live, the council has this thing where you can apply for a job during the summer. There were 300 spots, pretty much every teen in my area applied, including me, but I didn't get in. My best friend, lets call him Edward, did though. And guess who was working at the exact same place as him? You guessed it, she was. They didn't talk a lot, but according to him, she said that I was a little too eager (could be a bad translation, I live in Sweden).\n\n(Just remembered when we stopped talking, it was a friday afternoon and I had spilt hot chocolate on me that day, which I told her. Turns out that she had done that as well the same day which freaked her out I guess, she thought my friend and I were talking about her and doing some weird shit idk.)\n\nAnyway, after ~1month she suddenly messages me on facebook. I was pretty upset that she'd just ignored me like that, so I asked her what was up with that. She said it was all just a misunderstanding. I just said ok and went along with it. That got the ball rolling, and eventually I asked her out to see a movie, but this time. I gave her an actual date. She said yes. I was ecstatic, and told my best friend. \n\nThis is when shit got really strange. Apparently she had been messaging him, asking him if he wanted to watch a movie with her, over the past week or so. He hadn't responded. i should have bailed then and there. But no, I had to go through with it, because I was an idiot and I thought that for once I might have a chance with a girl. \n\nFast forward to the day before the date. I get a text from her. She asked if Edward was coming. \n\n... \n\nNo.\n\n... \n\nAsk him then!\n\n...\n\nI tell my friend and he says to just tell her she said no.\n\n...\n\nShe asks \"why can't he come?\"\n\n...\n\nThat right there just proves my idiocy. It was so extremely obvious that sje was into him and not into me. But i kept believing and just made up some bullshit about him not being able to. \n\n...\n\nFast forward to date day. I meet her at the cinema. She seems allright with it all, but she didn't know that I knew I guess. We enter the cinema. I buy my ticket first, she comes after. Turns out she didn't bring any money...\n\n\"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\" \n\nIt was at that point I realised that she was a 40ft reptile from the paleolithic era. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380244050", "subreddit": "teenagers", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In college, I answered an ad for a roommate. It was a 4 bedroom apartment, and I met 2 of the guys who lived there when I came to check it out. They were both soccer players, and decent guys. When I asked about the third they just kind of looked at each other before telling me that he was never around. No big deal. My room was in the back corner of the hallway, next to the invisible roommates room. \n\nIt was a decent arrangement until the night of the party. Being soccer guys, they had invited the female soccer team as well as a handful of soccer groupies. Lots of beer and dancing happened, and I hit it off with a hot brunette. Deep brown eyes, nice body. The ass was fat. We decided to head to my room for enhanced fun. \n\nSo we were making out on my bed, getting quite frisky, when there's this knock on my door. First is was a light tap, which we both ignored, but then it got louder to the point where she pretty much insisted I answered it. I got up, boner walked to the door and opened it a crack. It was a guy I didn't recognize, wearing nothing but some silk Tabasco patterned boxer shorts. Before I could ask what he wanted he said \"Hey man. I need your help. In my room\" I figured this must be the absent roommate, as I didn't see him at the party, and I was still kind of drunk. I told my soccer girl, and she said she would wait. I followed him to his room. His door was pretty much right next to mine. His room smelled funny, and I noticed what looked like crack pipes next to an ashtray lying on the floor beside his bed. They were the kind with the stem and a round part. They had lighter soot on them and pretty much looked very crack pipey. \n\nBut on his bed was a female. Totally naked, eyes closed, mouth open and sort of unnaturally pale. My first thought was 'is he looking for a third?' But she wasn't moving. I got scared. \"Is she okay?\" I asked. I mean she did not look like she was just passed out. \n\n\"You gotta help me\" he said, looking kind of panicked, but also kind of high and twitchy.  I had no idea what to do. I figured someone had to check her pulse and call 911. I told him and he got very angry, very fast and practically shouted \"No cops!\" Well fuck. Now this was the early 90's so there weren't cellphones everywhere. To call 911, I'd have to get out of his room and to the phone in the kitchen, but he had moved between me and his now closed door. I tried to tell him we needed an ambulance, but he got more agitated in his refusal. Finally he put both of his hands on my shoulders and stared hard at me.\n\"I need your help\"\n\"What the fuck can I do man? We need an ambulance\" I said, panicking a little.\nHe said, in an eerily calm voice \"I need about three fiddy\" that's when I realized that the mystery roommate was really the loch ness monster. His head was bent, scraping the ceiling as it looked down on me from atop his huge neck. I said goddamnit you dirty loch ness monster, get out of here you big faker! He then turned the girl on the bed into a unicorn and flew out the window.\n \nI got back to my room and my soccer girl was in a deep sleep in my bed. It was just a twin bed, so I wound up sleeping on the floor using some balled up jeans as a pillow and a towel for a blanket.

Then one day he would take a nip at my ankle. Than the next he would try and claw me. Over the next few months he would see where I'd enter from the woods and come closer down the trail to start his attack in ambush. Eventually it had been about a year that he started to cluck around me and attack me. He only made it halfway down the trail now and would never get any closer. I told my dad about it and he just went to his room and handed me his 16 gauge shotgun and told me it was time to learn how to shoot. So we went and got my hunting license. After that he told me to bring the shotgun on my trips with to my friends house and to take action against that fucking chicken if he ever attacked me again. Well sure enough after church I went over to my friends house like I always did. That fucked was hiding behind a tree and came out of nowhere. He attacked high this time . Claws coming out to cut me deep. All I could think was I better get this fucker before he gets me. I pulled the gun up to meet his eyes. I stopped and asked why had he attacked me all this time? What in the hell did he want?

I think anything more than that would have broken something in me.\n\nHe noticed my response and asks, “Is something wrong my sons?” At this point I notice his collar, and though I may not have ever been a good Catholic, I know a priest when I see one, and suddenly that gas station became my confessional and I poured out every once of my soul right then and there.\n\nHe was a great listener, and spoke to me like a true friend. And at the end of it all he simply said, “We all go through trying times, and must take solace knowing that where ever we are, whoever we are, we are loved by someone.” I thanked him through the tears I couldn't fight back and he gave me his card so that I could call him if I ever needed to talk to someone again. And as he did I was finally able to ring up that last item.\n\nI tell him his total, and he replies calmly. “Oh my, it appears I'm a little short.

{"body": "The paleolithic diet is based on *assumptions* about what our ancestors ate from 3 million years ago up to about 10 thousand years ago during the Paleolithic era. When this diet was popularized a few years ago several studies that were referred to were animal studies (just like the now so popular 5:2 diet, by the way).\n\nFurther more the concept behind the paleolithic diet fails to draw any conclusions (based on evidence) about the average human life span, health, medicine, environment and a whole bunch of other things. Instead, since it based on events that were so long ago that there can be no real evidence, there are claims that deceases, life span, health and so on were better during the paleolithic era if it wouldn't be for the environment.\n\nDon't get me wrong here, several things regarding the actual nutrition are correct and resembles other diets. Put claiming that a potato is worse for the human body than a carrot because the carrot would have been easier for our ancestors to find, and eat.. come on! Not to mention that the continental drift was so far gone during the paleolithic era that the diet would have to be specifically designed for each continent to match the food that different people actually ate..\n\nFurther more the paleolithic concept fails to take any of the four (five) industrial revolutions, where the society as a whole evolved faster than ever before in history, into account when making bold claims about quality of life and what not. \n\nTo continue my rant, additives to food that is common now-a-days is neither a reason for the paleolithic diet nor against any other diet. It is a completely separate issue that can be tackled with any kind of (serious) diet. To even use the phrase *real food* implies that there is some kind of fake, or unreal, food. Since the *definition* of food is a substance that provides nutrition to the body the unreal food couldn't possibly have that property, thus providing zero nutrition and zero energy to the body.\n\n**Summary** The concept behind the paleolithic diet popularized during the last ten years is based on assumptions and a will to sell books, a lot is based on animal studies, it fails to take continental drift into account and there is not a single long term study on human subjects to prove the claims. The diet itself is not *bad*, but it is a random set of hypotheses where data has been filtered to fit those hypotheses.

The next time my mom took me to the library, I checked out some sort of unexplained phenomena book because I wanted to learn more about that adorable Loch Ness Monster.  I distinctly remember looking at the book in the car on the way home from the library.  I was only sort of interested, just thumbing through the book looking for glamour shots of Nessie, and then I saw it: [the De Loys ape](http://www.theswedishbed.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ameranthropoides_hr.jpg).

After that, whenever we went to the library I would check out books on anything weird, supernatural, unsolved, macabre or otherwise creepy.  I was a rather ghoulish child... when my friends were devouring the Babysitters' Club series, I was nose-deep in books about ghosts, unexplained disappearances, and serial killers.\n\nBy the way, if you're interested in the [De Loys ape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameranthropoides_loysi), he was probably just a really ugly spider monkey.

The first silence was a result of the emptiness of a building whose tenants were all at work. This silence was joined with a second silence. This was the silence that is the result of an apartment with no power. However, the refrain was only completed once the third silence had harmonized with the first two. This silence was the deafening sound of a man waiting to die.\n\nDave felt a pinch near his elbow and looked down to find an empty syringe which was recently filled with a poison that can be a cure. The pain was beginning to spread behind his eyes and he was already growing tired of this miserable reality. He was ready for another adventure. He was ready for another dream. He was ready to be someone else, somewhere else -- anywhere else. He was ready for an escape. Dave set about his business.\n\nAs soon as Dave had finished preparing the syringe, he looked down and said a single word. Folly. He depressed the plunger and split his mind in two. As Dave reclined back into the nest he had made for himself on the floor, his eyes fell upon a comforting site. There was another syringe lying on the floor, but that is not what brought him comfort. His solace came from knowing that although there was *only* one more syringe, the pistol next to the syringe was loaded. \n\n--------\n\nAnd with that, Patrick Rothfuss makes his novels a parable about the dangers of escapism.

{"body": "\"Gerdy! Get over here!\"\n\nIn the distance, a gaunt man in a fedora and safari-esque clothing sprints over to the banks of Loch Ness to meet up with a short and stout man in a floral Hawaiian shirt. The shorter man points towards the center of the lake and grins.\n\n\"I got it on camera, Gerdy! She finally came up, and I finally got a picture of her!\"\n\nThe taller man raises one hand and rubs his temples.\n\n\"Gabe, did you really have to wake me up for that? I thought she grabbed you or something, but just photographic evidence? Maybe a skin sample or a tooth would be enough to call me, but a bloody photo?\"\n\nGabe frowned and looked out in the distance at the once-mythological beast.\n\n\"Lighten up, Gerdy. I know that we weren't the first to photograph or prove the existence of Loch Ness *monster*, but that doesn't mean you still can't take pictures of her.\"\n\n\"Gabe, you don't understand. She's already been discovered. People know that she exists. The only reason they haven't nabbed her and dissected her for research is because we don't know if she's the only one left. Hell, we don't even know if she is really a she. It could be male for all we know, or even a hermaphrodite! The only way that we can know more about this magnificent beast is if it becomes tame enough to reappear more often than every few years and to actually interact with humans. It has to be of its own accord, otherwise the scientific community would ostracize us if we just went swimming with it.\"\n\n\"That's surprisingly pro-nature of you, Gerdy. You almost sound like those college liberals that camp out here every weekend.\"\n\n\"Don't get used to it.\"\n\n\"Yeah... wait, there she goes again, Gerdy! It's like she's posing just for me!\"\n\n\"Go ahead. It might be the last time she resurfaces.\"\n\n\"Pssh, as if I needed to ask.\"\n\nGabe repositions his tripod, and changes his lens scope. He focuses the lens.\n\n*snap*\n\nAfter reviewing the photo on his digital camera, he looks up and smiles with his usual grin.\n\n\"This is perfect. See how the sunset hits Nessy at the perfect angle? And how the contrast between the water and the body just sort of blend together, oh man oh man, NatGeo is gonna love this submission.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose. Say, Gabe, why do you suppose they call her the 'Loch Ness Monster'?\"\n\n\"I dunno, Gerdy. Maybe it's the fact that she's a damn sea beast that's been living in the Loch Ness lake since forever?\"\n\nGerdy kneels down on one knee and places his fedora over his chest, revealing a balding head complete with liver spots and wrinkles.\n\n\"Be serious, Gabe. Look at her. So majestic. So magnificent. So mysterious. Can we really call her a monster without knowing anything about her?\"\n\n\"Huh, I suppose not.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380560778", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was a senior in high school and I babysat for this pair of twin boys. They were maybe 8, right in the middle of elementary school, and apparently right in the middle of perfecting how to game the system. I wasn't their parents, so I couldn't make them do anything apparently, but I did still have to worry about them. They would constantly make me panic on purpose, faking that one was hurt, or stuck in a tree (cats in a previous life, maybe?), or anything to get a rise out of me, really.\n\nSo the last time that I babysat for them was really weird, because they both were very calm. They sat and watched TV and had me play video games with them, and then they went to bed without much of a fuss. Basically, all you hope for when babysitting. It was a Friday night, and I was ready to go hang out with some friends (read: drink with friends. Drinking by myself didn't come until after college).\n\nThe problem came when the parents came home. They had been out for dinner and then out on the town, I guess. So it had been a while, and they came home a little tipsy, the father the most. So I was content with the time, and ready to get my money and get out of there.  But it was always awkward when they paid me. It was never the same amount per hour, it always depended on their mood, it seemed, whether they were having a good day or appreciated me or felt I did jack shit staying with their hyperactive twins who liked to torture me. So after asking how everything went, the dad said, \"So you only played video games and watched TV? Something they could have done on their own?\" And I said that yes... but I was there in case anything happened. The dad pulled out a five, for the five or six hours of time I was there, and said here, will this do. Me, afraid to offend, too midwestern to ask for more, just take it. I'm boiling inside.  And then all of the sudden, this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the paleolithic creature, erupts from the father like the father was a suit made of human, Men in Black-style. And the Loch Ness monster said, I need about tree fiddy. I said, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy, get your own damn money! Basically, I ran the hell out of there, and because of that, I no longer go over to their house, nor talk to their parents. \n\nI think that this was the first time that I realized people can be bat shit crazy. I mean, I always knew it, but ... damn. And the worst part is I have a feeling the kids will be crazy, too. \n\nTL;DR I have a hard time accepting that I won't be getting payment from the parents, and it gets to the point where they demand money from me. I just hope their kids don't become as crazy as the parents...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380567668", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -13, "controversiality": 0}
