{"body": "In 9th grade I had a close friend who was female.  She was very gorgeous and it would have been very embarrassing to be caught by her doing anything bad... I'm so glad that she did catch me.\n\nMe and this girl used to hang out every day.  As much as I hate the term I was in the \"friendzone\" but I still persisted to be with her every day.  Even if I wasn't with her I still enjoyed her company and she made me happy.\n\nOne day we decided to have a sleep over together along with a few other friends at her house.  Her parents were out of town for the night and we all thought it'd be a fun thing to do.\n\nThe party was fun and all and we talked a lot but unfortunately I didn't get any kisses.  We even played 7 minutes in heaven and it seems like everyone went in with her except for me.  Oh well.\n\nAnyways, that night we all crashed in the living room sleeping on the floor, on the couch, in the recliner, etc.  \n\nI went into the bathroom to take a shower (I had spilled a lot of beer on me earlier that night so I needed to wash it off) and while I was in the shower I kind of dozed off like I normally do in the shower.  Eventually I got bored and decided to jack off.  \n\nWhile I was in the middle of it I heared a little cough and I freaked out.  I didn't know who was there but all I could say was, \"Oh my god, I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.\"  and I heard a familiar voice say, \"Well, maybe I could help out?\"\n\nI was shocked.  It was my friend.  \n\nI know how implausible this sounds but it's the landmark event of my life because I can't believe it happened and that I got so lucky.\n\nSo we started to kiss outside of the shower, me in the nude and her with clothes still on.  \n\nAs we were about to step into the shower she stops me and says, \"Wait, thehealeroftri.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" I said.  I was still kind of in shock of what was happening.  \n\n\"I need something before we can go on.\"  She said.  \"What do you need?\" I replied.  \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  \n\nIt was around this time I realized that my close friend was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nSo later that year I finally began talking to her again.  It was really awkward and we tried to settle our differences but our friendship never really worked out after that.\n\nI remember she moved schools in 11th grade and I never saw her again.\n\nShame because I really wish I could have pursued a relationship with her.

{"body": "The big issue (besides members of Congress who are content with this shutdown occurring) is that most of the general public does not pay attention to the job that their elected representatives and senators do.  I don't do the best job of this either but I at least try to update myself on what my elected officials are doing in Congress, especially if they're someone that I voted for (not that I ignore someone if I didn't; you never know if they're someone that you should keep an eye out for if you feel they did alright).  \n\nAfter the votes are tallied its very unlikely that an individual will keep any sort of tabs on that politician, barring some type of scandal or controversy, which is a big problem because when re-election time rolls around how do you really know if your officials did their jobs?  You probably don't!  All you know is that they managed to not completely fuck up and get removed from office.  There is almost NO accountability with some politicians because most people believe they are doing their job until the news breaks that they are involved in some sort of scandal and even *that* isn't enough, sometimes.  Congress has abysmal approval ratings (below 20% I believe) and yet about 90% of Reps and Senators seeking re-election in 2012 succeeded!  ([Source](http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/reelect.php) and [Bonus Source from Wash. Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/05/09/people-hate-congress-but-most-incumbents-get-re-elected-what-gives/)).  So these guys are alright on their own, but put them together and it becomes one big Voltron clusterfuck of incompetence? C'mon man...\n\nYou can go to the government websites for elected officials and see what they are doing with their votes and their time in office, or websites like [OpenCongress](www.opencongress.org/‎) or [GovTracker](www.govtrack.us/congress/votes‎) to see how they are voting and if it aligns with their platforms and your political beliefs and ideals.  If they do, awesome, if they don't, then you'd better be paying attention to candidates and showing up at the polls next election season.  For anyone interested here is the [OpenCongress page for today's appropriations bill](http://www.opencongress.org/vote/2013/s/210).\n\nI'm a teacher (social studies) and this lack of accountability would be similar to (hypothetically) my supervisors coming around and poking their heads into my classroom and asked \"Did you teach something today?\"   I simply reply \"Yes\" and they move on to the next classroom, beaming that I've done such a wonderful job teaching my students.  Every politician claims that they did their job to the very best of their abilities.  To admit otherwise would make you human (I kid, I kid...kind of).  Without any sort of research and accountability my supervisors will never find out that I'm actually an 8 story-tall giant crustacean from the paleolithic era who has been selling off-brand girl scout cookies for about treefiddy.  \n\nBut seriously, this issue will continue to stew in Washington as long as the American public is content with believing everything politicians say without taking any responsibility themselves to validate their claims.  You can bet a nickel that Ted Cruz will not serve just his freshman term in Congress because of the name he has made for himself during this debacle, even though he's earned a pretty negative reputation.  There are only 2 things that I see preventing him from being re-elected: 1) American's do wise up and realize just how harmful his temper-tantrum was to the legislative process and kick him to the curb or 2) He lands himself on the 2016 ticket because the TP-ers and far-right think he is a courageous man who put himself on the line to fight the evil Socialist Homosexual Atheist Theocrats who support the ACA.  \n\n**TL;DR:** Pay attention to what your elected officials do during their terms and hold them accountable if they're not doing their jobs.

{"body": "(continuation)\n\nThe sun set and it turned into a sleepover.  My parents were out of town for a wedding that weekend but they and the other kids' parents trusted us to be responsible, which we were.  Ariel and Ren did manage to smuggle in a bottle of booze and a joint, but the rest of us prudes made sure they were safe.  When it was finally time to turn in, no one batted an eye when Rusty followed me to my room (or when Ren and Chuck decided to go for an evening \"walk\", for that matter).\n\nTo make a long story... actually, there's really no saving that at this point.  So my and my dream girl were in my room and we had started kissing, groping, and undressing.  I stopped her for a moment.  \"Hey, Rusty?\"  \"Yeah, Shaw?\"  \"I have a kind of... weird request.\"  \"Okay, shoot\", she said, visibly getting nervous about the shirtless 17-year-old theater boy's idea of \"weird\".  \"Not weird like that!\" I hastily corrected.  \"I was just thinking, can you... sing to me?\"  \"What, like 'Whole New World'?\"  (It was one of our duets from earlier.  I know, I know, but we were, kids, and weird ones at that, so this wasn't super unrealistic.)\n\n\"No no no, I mean, well, can you sing 'Hero'?\"\n\nI should explain.  \"Holding Out for a Hero\", was our show's big show-stopping number.  It was loud and in your face and the arrangement was to die for, but most of all it was *SEXY* with a capital everything.  Rusty in particular was fitted with a mostly translucent black form-fitting leotard for the song and dance, which she wore under her dress and TORE OFF HER CLOTHES TO GET TO IN THE BEGINNING OF THE NUMBER.\n\nI'll assume you can tell why this might awaken certain things in the mind and in the... other mind of a teenage boy.  On top of that, the song was about the singer needing a brave and virtuous man who she knew was coming for her and repeatedly compared to Hercules and knights and gods, so not exactly a small ego boost for the object of the song, i.e. me.\n\nShe smiled and walked around me 180° while she started to sing slowly and passionately.\n\n*\"Where have all the good men gone, and where are all the gods?\"*\n\nShe raised her hands and feigned searching about as I unbuttoned my pants and the fell.\n\n*\"Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?\"*\n\nOn \"hercules\" she placed her inquisitive hands on my chest.  I wasn't too athletic, but I had a sturdy, thick build (recently lost a lot of weight and wasn't fat for the first time in my life, as a matter of fact), and when I involuntarily spasmed at her touch, she could feel the power behind my muscles.  She smiled a sinister smile like a child who found out where the bowl of candy is hidden.  On \"fight\" she pushed me down to the bed.\n\n*\"Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?\"*\n\nShe raised her hand to her forehead as if in desperation.  When she hit the sustained high note on \"knight\", if I wasn't already hard, I would have been.\n\n*\"Late at night I toss and I turn, and dream of what I need!\"*\n\nAt this point, I was down to my boxer-breifs and one sock which I was quickly dealing with, and Rusty was in her underwear as well.  She had somehow undone her bra so that when she twisted back and forth on \"I toss and I turn\", it came right off.  I still can't figure out how she did it.  She took a step forward on \"dream\" positioned her body over mine.  I was trying to work my underwear off and regretting not getting a condom on before the singing started.  It would be tricky now to not interrupt anything.\n\nRusty brought her face very close to mine for a very long moment, and then inched around so her mouth was touching my ear.\n\n*\"I need...\"* she sang.  \"Oh god what,\" I moaned, \"tell me what.\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that my dream girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nSo we all got up the next morning and everyone expected stories and \"juicy details\" out of us, but obviously we both just responded with disappointed sighs.  Eh.  At least Ren and Chuck worked out.\n\nRelations between us were... chilly... to say the least for the rest of the production.  We didn't go to the same school either, so I barely saw here all of senior year.  I did decide to move on though and pursued other girls, particularly a quiet, introverted redhead who I had actually had a crush on in elementary school.  We got along pretty well, especially since I was very introverted and shy when not around my theater friends.\n\nShe was a pretty good singer, too.  She didn't have the raw talent that Rusty had, but I managed to get her to belt a few high notes, if you know what I mean.  (I mean that a caused her to orgasm loudly.)\n\nI guess moving on was for the best because when I next saw Rusty it was the youth show the next summer, and she had herself a new beau.  He wound up doing stage crew and my redhead found her way on to the chorus once she worked up the courage to sing in public.  Ironically, Rusty and I were cast across from each other in South Pacific as Emile and Nellie.  Would that it could have happened an earlier year!\n\nEither way, though, the spark was gone between us.  We had both moved on and found other people, and maybe we were better off.\n\nBut now whenever I hear that song, even the corny, upbeat 80s original, I can help but tear up.  It was John Whittier who said \"For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these: 'It might have been!'\"\n\nThat may well be true.  Nevertheless, for as short as it lasted, while it did, we made beautiful music together. (and I'm only a little sorry for that pun!)\n\nI still see her now and again.  I think I might do the summer musical again next year.  I stopped doing it for a while, but next year will be the last year I'm young enough.  I don't know if she will, but I think we're distinctly past that part of our lives.  We're just friends now, and that's okay.  That's really good, in fact, because she is a wonderful friend.\n\nI don't know why, but I can be with her all day and not feel a thing but happiness and camaraderie, but it just takes a few seconds of that song to make me a mess.\n\nAnyway, that's my story.  I know it's long but I didn't want to skimp.  Sorry.\n\nTL;DR Hooked up with the girl of my dreams, but it didn't work out, and now \"our song\", as cheesy as it is, messes me up big time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380620106", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Bigfoot** - One thing I don't see mentioned much (or at all really) is this: for bigfoot to exist, there would have to be *several* of them.  It's not like Bigfoot just hung around for thousands of years only to show up in photos once the camera was invented.  No, for bigfoot to still be around there have to be several bigfoot(s), and they have to be reproducing.\n\nThis means that bigfoot could only live in a VERY remote area.  An area remote enough that entire families of the creature could exist in the wilderness without being discovered.  For this reason, I have to say I don't believe in bigfoot.\n\n**Loch Ness Monster** - Same thing.  If the thing is a descendant of a Plesiosaur, there have to be others.  It had to come from *somewhere*, and if that somewhere was the ocean, odds are pretty far off that the handfuls of Plesiosaurs in the entire ocean are still somehow finding each other, fucking, and making new ones... all the way up until the 1900's and 2000's.\n\n**Aliens** - You'd be stupid to think we're alone in the universe.  That said, the sheer size of the universe is absolutely staggering.  Do I think we've been visited by aliens?  POSSIBLY.  But the odds of it happening so recently (within the last 100+ years) are, again, astronomical.  Especially nowadays, where everyone has a camera attached to their hip, yet no one has come up with undeniably convincing footage of real life UFO's.\n\nNow, I DO think there's a good possibility we were visited over the course of Earth's history.  Maybe they came while the planet was cooling, or while we were just a bunch of blind fish swimming around in primordial pools.  If we ever do find evidence of ancient aliens, I'm willing to bet it comes in the form of something buried DEEP, or crashed and sunk to the ocean floor (like the Baltic Sea UFO).  Something like that makes a whole lot more sense than us just \"happening\" to find flying saucers in the last 100 years when we can actually document it.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380726443", "subreddit": "wanttobelieve", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have to cut this in two because I reached the character limit:\n\n***Part 1***\n\n&gt; And so you think that people staying alive today is somehow different? Your argument is not at all an argument, it's just a claim for which you have no evidence. please acknowledge that.\n\nNo, it's not different.  That's the point - people survive in spite of whatever medical knowledge (or lack of it) is around at the time.  You said that people lived \"long, fruitful lives\" even when modern medicine was not in existence.  My response was simply highlighting that there have pretty much *always* been people that have, for a wide variety of reasons, survived to old age.  Your argument posited that ancient \"medicine\" somehow assisted with that, and *that* is the argument which requires evidence (which is conspicuously absent).\n\n&gt; Also, experience is not equivalent to the category of anecdotal evidence.\n\nOn the contrary, personal experience is the very definition of anecdotal evidence.  Saying that you (or perhaps someone you know) experienced something does not grant substance to your position.\n\n&gt; You literally started this little debate by saying that because science is based off evidence, it is the opposite of ideology, that is, it is truth. You said that, not me.\n\nThis is getting incredibly frustrating because you keep coming to conclusions that are so far away from what I said.  I never, at any point, said that absolute truth is part of science.  What I said was that evidence is the key to determining whether something is valid or not.  As I told you in my last post, you can make any kind of claim you want - but if you can't come with evidence to support it, what reason does anybody have for believing you?  Does that mean if I told you I saw a unicorn that you should take my word for it?  I would sincerely hope not.  You should ask me whether I have evidence to back up my story.\n\nTCM makes claims without any supporting evidence, period.  If someone wants to believe in its effects, they are in turn believing in it by pure faith.  On the day that TCM can be shown to have a statistically significant effect on the same range of medical conditions that real medicine can, then I will gladly change my opinion.  Until then, I'll continue viewing it as pseudoscience.\n\n&gt; I'm not all attempting to say science is invalid.\n\nNo, you're saying that certain topics are simply off-limits when it comes to burden of proof, which is to say that faith matters more than substance.\n\n&gt; This is mainly what I think you're wrong about. Your attitude that if something can't be proven with science, then it's invalid. It's a bullshit attitude...\n\nLet's just set aside pure science for a moment.  Why can't we just say that if something can't be proven, it's invalid until proven otherwise?  That seems reasonable enough, right?  So, going off of that, let's look at some phenomenon that have been historically put forth with personal experiences, fraud, or some combination of the two.\n\n* Bigfoot: What started the Bigfoot (aka Sasquatch) craze was a footprint, which its \"discoverer\" later admitted was a forgery.  Of course, once that fake footprint became publicly known, all kinds of Bigfoot \"sightings\" started popping up.  Even now, there are people that are die-hard believers in his existence.\n\n* Loch Ness Monster: A very similar story, except it all started with a film that, once again, was admitted to be a forgery.  Incredibly, people still go trolling in Loch Ness for \"Nessy.\"\n\nGhosts, UFOs, psychic abilities, and a wide variety of other \"supernatural\" phenomenon all follow similar patterns.  All of these have been presented either without what any person would consider evidence (\"I swear I saw/felt it!\") or with outright forgeries.  So when I say I don't believe these to truly exist, am I somehow being a zealot?  I think I'm just expecting someone making an incredible claim to make a convincing case.\n\nYour argument is the exact opposite.  You're saying that we should believe until proven false.  That's a logical fallacy known as [the burden of proof](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof).  Let's take a moment to think about what the implications of that mindset are.  \n\nWhat if the legal system worked that way?  Imagine a person making an accusation against you (let's say murder) and you are immediately arrested.  When you show up to your court date, the judge looks down and tells you \"Either prove your innocence or you're getting a life sentence.\"  It would be completely backwards and, quite frankly, insane.  Instead, if someone is going to accuse you of a crime, they have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt before a conviction can occur.  The same standard should be applied when anyone makes an important claim - you know, like \"Hey, this ancient Chinese cure can solve your back problems!\"\n\nCarrying that over to science, and more specifically medicine, there are specific ways of determining effectiveness of treatments.  It generally involves taking a large sample of people with a certain condition, treating some of them with the medicine, giving the rest a placebo and seeing what happens.  If there is a significant difference (either good or bad), we can determine that the treatment is having some kind of effect.\n\nWhen TCM (or homeopathy, or really any other \"alternative\" medicine) is put under that kind of scrutiny, it fails.  By saying that that process of testing is somehow ideological and not worth listening to, you're saying that it's OK to simply have faith.

{"body": "&gt; You cannot prove the existence or non existence of God and that is a simple fact held by most. \n\nThis is not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf, however, god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as many modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. \n\n\n&gt; In my time here I have seen a lot of criticisms against theism but I have not seen very many cases for atheism... can you please supply some?\n\nAtheism is not necessarily a claim, rather it is a rejection of a claim. I'm not claiming that \"no gods\" exist, rather I lack a belief in any gods.\n\nBut, if I were to say no gods do or could exist, how could I prove that? What evidence or proof of the non-existence of something could there to be? What would you say constitutes proof of atheism? The disproving of a god? Which god do I have to disprove in order for me to \"prove\" atheism? \n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nHaving said all of that, I would concede that atheism could be dis-proven. All you need to do is provide evidence of the existence of a theistic god.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380859200", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think the XKCD article and the above miss the point of how a robot revolution would go down. There are big differences which I will try to outline.\n\nLet me set the stage : Its initially an unsuspecting humanity vs a software mind that is self aware. The tactics and abilities of the adversary are my area of interest.\n\n__[Main difference #1] : A key element to a robot revolution isnt current hardware limitations, its current software limitations.__\n\nRecursive Iteration\n\nLets say you have a system that is sorta as smart as a person. It can learn, and it is directed improve itself. It makes improvements and makes many copies of a machine with those improvements. It takes a week to do so. That generation (#2) is smarter and more capable than #1 and is given the same directive (improve yourself), so they also make improvements, and (key point) in iess time than the first generation took, and they (gen #2) create many copies of those resulting in generation #3 (again, faster). Eventually you have a system of intelligences with more processing power than all the human minds on the planet combined. Each iteration takes less time to create as each generation is smarter, faster, and more capable than the previous. Before too long, you have individual systems that can predict what every person on the planet can do. And this system was told to 'improve itself'. If that ends up being synonymous with 'enslave humanity' then by all means it will try.\n\n __[Main difference #2] : Humans have never faced a superior intelligence, and probably would in a true robot revolution.__\n\nNow how about the mechanics of actually killing people?\n\nThe XKCD article had funny robots acting like spazzes. If we go up against a set of 'super genius' AIs, this will not be the case. In reality it is much easier to kill mass numbers of people. One easy way : without our massive food and energy supply lines, how many people can the earth support? Preindustrial earth population was 1B (sauce : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World-Population-1800-2100.svg), meaning if they could starve us out, we might go down to ~1B people within a generation or two. The control interfaces to our pipelines, electric grids, water plants, hospitals etc... are readily hacked, then manipulated, and ultimately controlled by todays hardware and software. All that is missing is a mind with a purpose behind the controls.\n\n__[Main difference #3] : Its easier to wipe humanity out than design / build 'terminator' robots. Terminator robots are extremely inefficient and unnecessary__\n\nLaying the groundwork....\n\nIn the beginning the robot AI will need humans to sustain itself (call it a transition period). There are videos of human mind to human mind control over the internet (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNRDc714W5I), of people (and monkeys http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnWSah4RD2E) (and rats http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-0eZytv6Qk) controlling robotic appendages with their thoughts (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMrvJ9_j2Tk), and demonstrations of super human robot dexterity (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KxjVlaLBmk). The point is, the hardware and software to plug human 'servants' into machines already exists. So whats to keep a robot army from abducting a few people (or just asking for volunteers!), and attaching control devices to them? What would you do to keep the pain of being repeatedly kicked in the balls at bay? Youd do whatever they told you to do, I dont care who you are. And I dont think even that level of thuggery would be necessary on the robots side.\n\nIn short, the goddamn loch ness monster asked me for tree-fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380918910", "subreddit": "technology", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; what does an atheist mean when he argues that it is rational to ~~deny~~ reject God's existence?\n\nBe careful - are we *denying* God's existence, or *rejecting* the claim that he exists? There's a difference. I've edited your statement, since it's important in how *I* approach the subject. Not all atheists are atheists because they are rational. Some atheists believe in ghosts, for example.\n\nIf you're talking to a [*skeptic*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_skepticism), then they would indeed likely say that it is in fact rational to reject the claim that a god exists. Why? There's no credible evidence to suggest that one exists. Skeptics care that their beliefs are reasonably true, and they strive to have as few false beliefs as possible. \n\nSo in the absence of good reason to believe that a god exists, such people rightly reject such claims.\n\nDo you believe in the Loch Ness monster? Bigfoot? What about pyramid power or reiki? Dowsing rods? What about things like leprechauns? I don't know you well enough, but I think it's a safe assumption that you probably believe some or all of these are nonsense. If so, *why* do you think they are nonsense? In short, you likely don't have any good reason (there's that word again) to confidently say that such things exist. Sure, you could be open to the possibility that such things exist, but to say \"Yes, leprechauns exist\" requires a suspension of rationality, an ignorance of reason in order to say such things.\n\nTo skeptics (and by inclusion, some atheists) the claim that a god exists is **no different** from the claim that leprechauns exist. If you think it *is* different, then it's up to you (the person making the claim) to carry the burden of proof to show why your claim should be taken seriously.\n\nI hope that clears things up for you.\n\n*Edit*: a word\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380987170", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ex-atheist here. I was raised in a family that never really went to church, but when asked we were christian. For K-3rd grade I went to a private school that included some religion but put it in a way that was entertaining. I remember the pastor would talk about Jesus using his camel hair toothbrush. After 3rd grade I went to a much more strict religious school. I didn't know it at the time, but apparently a lot of Mennonites sent their children there. They are a lot like Amish I guess? Anyways, it was terrible and really turned me away from religion. By middle school I self identified as agnostic and by high school I self described as atheist.\n\nAs an atheist I was always very angsty. I didn't really have a lot of direction. I didn't necessarily get in trouble much, truth be told I was a pretty good kid. But I didn't have a lot of hope. Around the time of me graduating high school, my older brother got married. He was 24 and the girl he married was 20. I thought they were both too young and it would never last. My brother was always an asshole. He tormented me growing up. But after he got married he changed. I mean, he was still an asshole. But he started going to church. His wife was a really good influence on him. He got a job with Major League Soccer and was able to travel to Utah and  be the equipment manager for a soccer team out there. He was successful like I never thought he could be.\n\nOne night I was over at their house having dinner. After regular pleasantries the conversation turned to religion. In our family the conversation will always end up going towards politics or religion. He told me that he attributed so much of his success to God and the support of his wife. It was actually talking to members of the church after a congregation one Sunday morning that he first got the ball rolling to get that great soccer job. He mentioned casually in passing his soccer experience and another member of the church asked for his number and gave it to the owner of the team. \n\nIt really got me thinking about the way God can affect our lives in really small ways. It doesn't have to be through miracles and turning water to wine, or making you win the lottery. God can just put the right people in your life at the right time. That's what God did for my brother. He put his wife in his life and he couldn't be happier. \n\nTowards the end of dinner as we were cleaning up they offered to take me to church with them in the morning. I was very hesitant at first. I never really thought much of it. But despite my differences with my brother I really did kind of respect him in a weird way. And I wanted to be happy like him. I wanted a nice house and a good wife and a good job. I wanted to feel close to God like he did. So I asked him if I would need anything special to bring to church. He said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well just about that time I realized that my brother was about 8 stories tall and was a creature from the paleolithic era. I said \"God damn you lochness monster!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381081826", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This may get creepy.\n\nSo this was last year. I was just on reddit, on my phone at like 3 A.M when I hear what seemed like the woodboard floor creak.\n\nNow for some background. If you go along the hallway in my house, by the end of it, there's a door to the left (almost always open) that leads to the house entrance. At night the only thing you can see when it's dark is the alarm's keypad, which glows.\n\nSo after hearing the woodboard floor creak I was creeped out, since I was sure that my parents were sleeping, so reluctantly I get up, turn on the hallway light (not really powerful) and get to the door I mentioned, but when I looked I didn't see the alarm light. I stood there for some seconds and my eyes started ajusting to the light, that's when I noticed a silhouette, and it was definitely not human. I run to my bed and cover myself up completely, I didn't know what to think about that. \n\nAfter what seemed like 1-2 hours I came to the conclusion that my mind was playing tricks with me and I calmed down, but I still couldn't sleep. Eventually it was daytime and I went on my day, still thinking about that.\n\nFastforward a few weeks. At this point I wasn't scared anymore, but still hadn't forgotten it. I was in bed again, I don't know the time, just trying to fall asleep when I hear it again, the woodboard floor creak, and again, my parents are asleep. I stay under the sheets for a long time deciding to whether to check it or not. If I stayed, I'd be safe (that's what I thought), but if I went I would ease my mind and realize it was just my imagination. After debating this with myself for quite the long time, I start thinking rationally, get the courage, pick up my phone for a flashlight and go to the door again.\n\nI couldn't see the light, my heart started racing, my hands shaking. My eyes adjust to the light and I see the silhouette again. \"Do I turn the phone light on? Do I want to see what that is?\". I started feeling the sweat on my nose, my whole body, I could hear my own heart beating. I looked for a rational answer to the situation, and I couldn't find it, and what was fucking with my head even more, was that there also wasn't an irrational one. \"Why doesn't it do anything?\". I was on the verge of crying, and I just wanted for it to end. I didn't want to go back and be afraid for the rest of my life, to be afraid of the dark and never feel safe again. So I spoke. \"What...(I take a deep breath)...what do you want from me?\". A deep voice from the dark answered. \"I need 'bout tree fiddy\". That's when I turned my phone's flashlight up and saw that the thing blocking the light was actually 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era!\"I ain't givin you tree fiddy, loch ness monster, get your own goddamn money!\" And it went away, I hope it doesn't come back again.\n\nIt was definitely the weirdest thing I've ever experienced.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381096943", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's not proving that God doesn't exist.\n\nDo you realize how utterly illogical that sentence is?  We are NOT proving that God does not exist ... er, therefore is fully proven that God does not exist.  That is pure blind and utterly simply the embrace of sheer ignorance.  \n\nYou don;t believe there is a God, I happen to agree with your sentence that ANY belief needs to be justified ... except that atheism is a non-belief, which means its based on facts correct?  And those facts are? \n\nYour entire premise is called the fallacy of special pleading. \n\nspecial pleading\n\nYou moved the goalposts or made up an exception when your claim was shown to be false.\nHumans are funny creatures and have a foolish aversion to being wrong. Rather than appreciate the benefits of being able to change one's mind through better understanding, many will invent ways to cling to old beliefs. One of the most common ways that people do this is to post-rationalize a reason why what they thought to be true must remain to be true. It's usually very easy to find a reason to believe something that suits us, and it requires integrity and genuine honesty with oneself to examine one's own beliefs and motivations without falling into the trap of justifying our existing ways of seeing ourselves and the world around us.\nExample: Edward Johns claimed to be psychic, but when his 'abilities' were tested under proper scientific conditions, they magically disappeared. Edward explained this saying that one had to have faith in his abilities for them to work.\n\nhttps://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/special-pleading\n\nThe basis of your claim is a KNOWN logical fallacy.  The entire premise of what you claim is illogical. \n\nHere are some additional primers for you: \n\na.  From actual atheists, those who have not illogically attempted to slam together two fundamentally different claims, \"I don't know,\" agnosticism, with, \"I do know there is no God,\" atheism.  \n\n\"The first thing to keep in mind is that the phrase “burden of proof” is a bit more extreme than what is often needed in reality. Using that phrase makes it sound like a person has to definitely prove, beyond a doubt, that something is true; that, however, is only rarely the case. A more accurate label would be a “burden of support” — the key is that a person must support what they are saying. This can involve empirical evidence, logical arguments, and even positive proof.\"\n\nIn reality, however, that rarely happens. Most of the time, those required to support their claims do offer something — and then what? At that point the burden of proof shifts to the defense. Those who do not accept the support offered must at the very least show just cause why that support is insufficient to warrant rational belief. This may involve nothing more than poking holes in what has been said (something defense attorneys often do), but it is often wise to construct a sound counter-argument which explains evidence better than the initial claim does (this is where the defense attorney mounts and actual case).\n\nRegardless of exactly how the response is structured, what is important to remember here is that some response is expected. The “burden of proof” is not something static which one party must always carry; rather, it is something which legitimately shifts during the course of a debate as arguments and counter-arguments are made.\"\n\nhttp://atheism.about.com/od/doesgodexist/a/burdenofproof.htm\n\nSo, atheists acknowledge this, and can agree to disagree with a non-conclusive evidence base.  Agnostic atheist have clearly taken something reasonable and flushed down the absurdity toilet.  \n\nSuch notions might be good if all we are attempting to do is hold onto pur preconceptions, but they do very little in a world filled with people who understand logic, requirements to support, and are very much aware of fallacious argumentation.  \n\nb. You can indeed prove a negative: \nSome people seem to think that you can’t prove a specific sort of negative claim, namely that a thing does not exist. So it is impossible to prove that Santa Claus, unicorns, the Loch Ness Monster, God, pink elephants, WMD in Iraq, and Bigfoot don’t exist. Of course, this rather depends on what one has in mind by ‘prove.’ Can you construct a valid deductive argument with all true premises that yields the conclusion that there are no unicorns? Sure. Here’s one, using the valid inference procedure of modus tollens:\n1. If unicorns had existed, then there is evidence in the fossil record.\n2. There is no evidence of unicorns in the fossil record.\n3. Therefore, unicorns never existed.\nSomeone might object that that was a bit too fast  after all, I didn’t prove that the two premises were true. I just asserted that they were true. Well, that’s right. However, it would be a grievous mistake to insist that someone prove all the premises of any argument they might give. Here’s why. The only way to prove, say, that there is no evidence of unicorns in the fossil record, is by giving an argument to that conclusion. Of course one would then have to prove the premises of that argument by giving further arguments, and then prove the premises of those further arguments, ad infinitum. Which premises we should take on credit and which need payment up front is a matter of long and involved debate among epistemologists. But one thing is certain: if proving things requires that an infinite number of premises get proved first, we’re not going to prove much of anything at all, positive or negative.\n\nhttp://departments.bloomu.edu/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/proveanegative.pdf\n\nIn short, we've come a long ways from the days of Nietzsche when his hard hitting dialogue was accurate and logical.  Now, we are left with a faith choice that is increasingly, and quite openly, embracing fallacy to avoid the simple conclusion: You cannot disprove God, so he MIGHT exist.  \n\nThe opposite we have no problem with, \"You cannot conclusively prove God, so he might not exist.\" \n\nTrue enough, which is why I can read Nietzsche and genuinely respect his claims, and must, furthermore, take the premise of atheism as valid - even if I disagree with it. \n\nIn that same mantel, I can take a look at agnostic atheism and see very clearly that it is utterly without merit.  And the more agnostic atheists attempt to explain it, the more convoluted and irrational it becomes.  \n\nNothing wrong with atheism as many atheists claim it, \"Simple the belief that there is no God.\"  No issues.  Understand, given the inconclusive nature of the evidence, how that is reasonable, I also invite it because I appreciate the Hegelian dialectic, and understand the need for an antithesis. \n\nAgnostic atheism though?  Its an absurdity whose sole goal it take logic and turn it on its head so that someone an continue to believe in their conclusions without proof.  Exactly what agnostic atheists say they hate about religion. \n\nOnce again though, let's test your standard by applying it to someone else.  If I were to say, \"I don't believe in God, I merely don't not believe in God, because I reject the arguments that atheists make to deny God.\" (Put aside the fact that atheists do not appear to be even attempting to do this anymore).  Would you accept such a premise as logical? \n\nWhy then would you expect us to accept something like that?

The inability, or disinclination, to disprove a claim does not render that claim valid, nor give it any credence whatsoever.

For example, suppose someone argues that we’ve scoured the world for Bigfoot, found no credible evidence of Bigfoot’s existence, and therefore there is no Bigfoot. A classic inductive argument. A Sasquatch defender can always rejoin that Bigfoot is reclusive, and might just be hiding in that next stand of trees. You can’t prove he’s not! (until the search of that tree stand comes up empty too). The problem here isn’t that inductive arguments won’t give us certainty about negative claims (like the nonexistence of Bigfoot), but that inductive arguments won’t give us certainty about anything at all, positive or negative. All observed swans are white, therefore all swans are white looked like a pretty good inductive argument until black swans were discovered in Australia.\nThe very nature of an inductive argument is to make a conclusion probable, but not certain, given the truth of the premises. That just what an inductive argument is. We’d better not dismiss induction because we’re not getting certainty out of it, though. Why do you think that the sun will rise tomorrow? Not because of observation (you can’t observe the future!), but because that’s what it has always done in the past. Why do you think that if you turn on the kitchen tap that water will come out instead of chocolate? Why do you think you’ll find your house where you last left it? Why do you think lunch will be nourishing instead of deadly? Again, because that’s the way things have always been in the past. In other words, we use inferences — induction — from past experiences in every aspect of our lives. As Bertrand Russell pointed out, the chicken who expects to be fed when he sees the farmer approaching, since that is what had always happened in the past, is in for a big surprise when instead of receiving dinner, he becomes dinner. But if the chicken had rejected inductive reasoning altogether, then every appearance of the farmer would be a surprise.\nSo why is it that people insist that you can’t prove a negative? I think it is the result of two things. (1) an acknowledgement that induction is not bulletproof, airtight, and infallible, and (2) a desperate desire to keep believing whatever one believes, even if all the evidence is against it.\"\n\nhttp://departments.bloomu.edu/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/proveanegative.pdf\n\nRuh Roh ... atheist caught making a fallacy AND rejecting logic.

{"body": "It was a long time ago in a small city down in the south of the congo. I was the only white person around and as would make sense, I didn't fit in. I was walking home from my job as a child soldier and was suddenly attacked by a very loud, oversize helicopter. The machine gunners on the side were shooting non-stop and it was extremely hard to get to cover since the only thing in the area was an overturned metal table. \n\nObviously, that table didn't block anything and I was hit many times. I was bleeding all over the place and the helicopter landed nearby. A soldier walked up to me and spoke in some language I didn't understand, something like Finnish. They put me on a stretcher and on then on the helicopter. The helicopter started to pick up and move away. I could feel the acceleration. The soldiers, there were only four as it turned out, all went into the cockpit and left me alone in the back. I was barely conscious but I managed to stumble off the stretcher and hobble toward where their equipment was. I dug around in it and found some sort of rocket launcher.\n\nI had never used a rocket launcher before, as you would guess. I figured by now that since I could barely lift the heavy metal tube I didn't have a lot of time left until I passed out. I decided that I would be dead soon and that at the very least I could bring these horrible people who attacked me for no reason into hell with me. I shouldered the launcher and pulled what I figured had to be the trigger. \n\nThe rocket blasted its way out of the tube. The rocket actually launched in the opposite direction of the way I was facing and hit the rear of the helicopter. (I had been facing toward the cockpit.) The helicopter fell out of the sky and crashed with a fiery explosion. When I crawled out of the wreck, I was burned horribly but at least my wounds had been burned shut. I collapsed in the wreckage and the edges of my vision started to fade to black. \"Not bad\" I thought to myself. I felt like I had done everything I could have and as I blacked out I had a smile on my face...\n\nI woke up in a hospital bed with a doctor leaning over me. \"Stay still, son. You've had a rough time.\" He said this in a soft way, he was an old man and I suppose this was the only way he could speak anymore. They then put a mask over my face and I started to fade off again...\n\nWhen I awoke again, I felt cold. I opened my eyes and saw the lights and equipment of an operating room. As I got up, I lifted myself out of the cold metal bed I had been on and noticed something: my arm was made of metal! It was a chrome colored skeletal prosthetic! The doctor entered the room wearing a surgical mask and gloves with a very casual look on his face. \"What did you do to me!?\" I screamed as I looked at the rest of my body. I was almost entirely prosthetic, with only small sections of flesh left. \n\n\"We have made you stronger.

{"body": "Who cook for you ? If its yourself can you say how and what did you do when you got hungyr between meal times?&gt;Hey [/r/fitness!] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/) I would like to start off by thanking [Scooby1961] (https://www.youtube.com/user/scooby1961), [Brandon Campbell] (https://www.youtube.com/user/CampbellFitnessTV), and [OmarIsuf] (https://www.youtube.com/user/OmarIsuf). These people helped me a lot over the last few months and learned a lot from them.\n\n&gt;**NOTE: I wrote this September 20 and just now I decided to post**\n\n&gt;I have been lurking for a while now and been doubting myself whether or not to share my progress. After much thinking I have decided to share my progress, in hope that I may inspire the fitness community to keep making progress. Let’s get this started!\n\n&gt;[Before] (http://imgur.com/a/4D37b)\n\n&gt;According to detail properties these pictures were taken Friday, February 17. 2012 and Wednesday, May 15, 2012.\nI was 5’5 and I have no idea how much I weighted at the time\n\n&gt;**June**\nI started to make changes. Nothing serious but I was being more aware of how much I was eating\n\n&gt;**July - September**\nI started to do weightlifting and walking. I started off slow. I played around with weights and did 20 to 30 minutes of walking. Around August I started Scooby’s Teen Workout Plan. I did dumbbell flys, dumbbell press, dumbbell rows, and bicep curls. September, I changed my workout routine to a 3 day split and started to keep track of my weight loss. September 2, 2012 I weighted 327. The highest I remember being was **tree fiddy**, probably more!\n\n&gt;**September - December**\nI was making progress. I was mainly focusing on losing weight than becoming stronger and gaining muscle. I really didn’t care much about counting calories. All I wanted was to get rid of the fat. I was fully aware of the consequences of losing weight fast and after thinking about it I decided I didn’t care much. By the time I weighted 314.2 in October 8, 2012 I was very happy to see this XXL shirt, smaller than most of my XXL shirts, fitted me. By this time I was slowly increasing my walking distance and I was also making decent strength gains on my bench. From November to January I was doing 3 miles of walking in about 1 hour and 40 minutes. Slowly but surely I was doing 3 miles in less time. I was still lifting weights because I enjoyed it and December 31st, 2012 I weighted 276.8.\n\n&gt;**January - February**\nEverything was the same. I was getting bored of 3 day split and decided it was time to change a few things around. I decided I wanted to focus more into strength training with a little bit of bodybuilding. **(February 25, 2013 - 252)**\n\n&gt;**March - May** \nI had changed my workout routine. I was doing 3 days on 1 day off.  I ended up experimenting a lot like alternating between strength and hypertrophy. **(May 27, 2013 - 221)**\n\n&gt;**June**\nI got bored of the new routine real fast and decided to start taking things a lot more serious and I was finding it hard to lose weight without counting calories when I was **218**. I had lost a lot of weight already and I was very happy, so I decided that I wanted to focus more on **Aesthetic Athletic**.\n\n&gt;\n**July**\nI was playing around with how many calories I needed and started using **MyFitnessPal** to track them and I got a **food scale** I started around **2200 calories** and I still wasn’t sure what **program** I wanted to start. I ended up stopping my **1 year progress** a little short because I was about to get a lot more serious. I ended it August 5, 2013 and I weighted 202.0 at the time.\n\n&gt;**Diet Before**\nI never liked eating outside, so it was easy for me to control what I was eating. All I did was just stop eating so damn much. In fact, all those months now that I think about it I was pretty much under eating A LOT for the most part.\n\n&gt;[After] (http://imgur.com/a/8PFAs)\n\n&gt;[6/4/2013 @ 218.8] (http://imgur.com/a/4VXNY)\n\n&gt;*Stats**\n**16M / **5’5”** ---&gt; **17M** / **5’5.5”**\n**Weight**: **350lbs** ---&gt; **193.0lbs**\n(**As of Cycle 2 Week 3**) - IN POUNDS -\n**OHP** (1x4) @ 80(87.28) / 1RM: 96 / 90%: 86\n**Deadlift** (1x5) @ 130(146.26) / 1RM: 152 / 90%: 137\n**Bench Press** (1x2) @ 125(128.57) / 1RM: 145 / 90%: 130\n**Squat (1x10)** @ 70(93.91) / 1RM: 84 / 90%: 76\nI started to **Deadlift** in **July** and I started to **Squat** in **August** because I was too fat and lacked mobility to perform them. \nMy **bench** used to be (1x6) @ 100 and my **OHP** (1x3) @ 85\n\n&gt;**Now**\nI’m doing Wendler 5/3/1, 4 day split, and hitting same muscle twice a week.\n\n&gt;**Monday**\n*OHP (Wendler set)\n*OHP (3x10) @ 45\n*Assisted Pull-Up Machine (5x10) @ 130 and 115\n*Bench (4x10) @ 65 \n*V-Bar Tricep Pushdown (3x10) @ 60\n*Cuban Press Variation I learned from OmarIsuf\n*Walk (40 minutes) @ 2 miles\n\n&gt;**Tuesday**\n*Deadlift (Wendler set)\n*Deadlift (3x10) @ 70\n*Squat (4x10) @ 45\n*Dumbbell Bicep Curl (3x10) @ 10\n*Face Pull (3x10) @ 20\n*Walk (40 minutes) @ 2 miles\n\n&gt;**Wednesday**\n*Sprint (6)\n\n&gt;**Thursday**\n*Bench (Wendler set)\n*Bench (3x10) @ 65\n*OHP (3-4x10) @ 45\n*Assisted Pull-Up Machine (5x10) @ 130 and 115\n*V-Bar Tricep Pushdown (3x10) @ 60\n*Cuban Press Variation I learned from OmarIsuf\n*Walk (40 minutes) @ 2 miles\n\n&gt;**Friday**\n*Squat (Wendler set)\n*Squat (3x10) @ 45\n*Deadlift (4x10) @ 70\n*Dumbbell Bicep Curl (3x6) @ 15\n*Face Pull (3x10) @ 20\n*Walk (40 minutes) @ 2 miles\n\n&gt;**Saturday**\n*Sprints (12)\n\n&gt;**Sunday**\nOFF sometimes Sprints (6)\n\n&gt;**Diet**\n\n&gt;I’m eating between **1600 – 1750** calories. I start off by tracking my **protein**, trying to get close as I can to **180g protein** with **chicken breast**, **fish**, **whey protein**, and/or **tuna**. Then I start to include **carbs**. I get my **carbs** from **rice**, **oats**, and **tortillas**, and try to get at least **120g**. I try to leave about **300 calories** for **ice cream**. Other things I eat are: **spinach**, **broccoli**, and **lettuce**. Although I have not eaten **broccoli** in a while, and I don’t count **spinach** or **lettuce**.\n\n&gt;**How you did? What's your secret?**\n\n&gt;I get asked these questions a lot, and really there is no secret to losing weight. I would just tell them I ate less. After a while I started to realize these people used to be like me, thinking you needed some **special diet**, **no meat**, or **slow metabolism**, and much more. I realized I was lucky to have found some great people that helped me a lot. Telling them that losing weight was easy, for me. That the only reason I’m losing weight was because it’s easier when you’re overweight, and that it’ll get harder sooner or later, it did. The real secret is **research**, **motivation**, **habit**, and a **goal**.\n\n&gt;**Going forward**\n\n&gt;I plan to keep losing weight until I’m at a weight I feel comfortable. I’ll keep trying to learn how to better track my calories, so that by the time I bulk I sort of know how to slowly bulk. I’m hoping that by the end of the year I’ll be squatting, benching, and deadlifting 135 with ease. I’m planning on doing a mini update late November, just showing how my lifts have progressed and form check videos.\n\n&gt;**Suggestions**\nI feel like at the time I calculated my 1RM for bench I might have been wrong. Should I recalculate my bench numbers, or keep doing the program instead of starting over?\n\n&gt;What's a decent digital camera? I'm planning on buying [this] (http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-Enabled-Wide-Angle-3-2-Inch/dp/B0075SUJH4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378310160&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=canon+ixus+240+hs) in November.\n\n&gt;PS: I'm going to be starting Wendler 5/3/1 again because now I have a better idea of where I'm at with each lift, and because my bench press numbers is to laugh at. I keep getting weaker and weaker each week. \n\n&gt;PPS: Sorry for the bad pictures. I had to get creative since I didn't have someone to take it for me. In a few months I'll have someone else take them.\n\n&gt;PPPS: I'm going to class and I'll respond to comments after I'm back.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381164274", "subreddit": "Fitness", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's my standard response;\n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing. \n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381169663", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was an introvert mostly throughout High School. I didn't go to many parties, nor did I have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked.\n\nUnfortunately, I had 0 skills on picking up girls even though I was trying really hard to get a girl.\n\nIn 11th grade there was a party around my school's christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it. I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.\n\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where. I still remembered her name though, Vanessa. She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\n\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me. I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\n\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible. She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back. I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\n\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of. Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\"\n\nI started saying more things.\n\nShe laughed even more.\n\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl. But then it dawned on me. I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where. A strip club. Vanessa was a stripper. Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.\n\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously. My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once. I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\n\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"\n\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\n\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house. This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue. I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself.\n\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\n\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone. A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms. I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside.\n\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\n\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off Vanessa's clothes. Finally, she was fully naked, as was I. She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.\n\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\". Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\" I couldn't believe it. This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin. I still can't believe it. I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock. She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to. I told her I was a virgin too and she said good. As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\" \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\n\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life. Been waiting for awhile for someone to post a question like this to askreddit for a long time now. Happy I finally got the chance to tell that story.\n\ntl;dr: A stripper who aggressively threw herself on to me was actually a virgin.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381245912", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Hey Guys and Gals,\n&gt;\n&gt;We’re stoked to release another system update, filled with a bunch of improvements that our engineers have been working their butts off to complete.  Our areas of focus have been:\n&gt;\n&gt;**1) External storage “Closed Beta”** – We’ve been focused on this feature as our top priority and are just about ready to put external storage into a testing phase.\n&gt;\n&gt;We’ve chosen to do a Closed Beta for a few reasons. It’s a big feature and there are a ton of different types of external storage out there, so we felt it was best to roll it out in stages. The staged rollout allows us to easily gather feedback and achieve the best possible product in the end. We’ve got a passionate community and we know you guys will come back to us with great feedback and creative bugs.  Additionally, we’re looking for ways to get our gamers and devs more involved in what makes OUYA tick. If this Beta is successful, it can pave the way for us to try and introduce more features earlier in their lifecycle.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you are interested in participating in the Beta, please fill out the form here:\n&gt;\n&gt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jIMULlQuv4BZ1MjWNdZ4mX_R2fyeL3VaMRqGHWMfm34/viewform\n&gt;\n&gt;We’ll start our first round of Beta invites next week.\n&gt;\n&gt;**2) Video Support** – Now game detail pages can play videos! Often times some good ol’ moving pictures and sound are the best way to show how awesome a game truly is. We know this feature will help out Gamers and Developers alike. If I were more business savvy, I might even call that a “win-win” :P\n&gt;\n&gt;**3) Bug Fixing** - As I mentioned last time, bug fixing is important to us, so you’ll see a whole slew of bug fixes and user experience improvements in this update.  We even found a way to address that HDMI wakeup issue since some of you brought it up as a hot topic.\n&gt;\n&gt;Below is the full list of changes, as well as an explanation about the name of the Update.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Full Release notes (10/08/2013):**\n&gt;\n&gt;* External Storage will enter Closed Beta next week! Interested in participating? Apply here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jIMULlQuv4BZ1MjWNdZ4mX_R2fyeL3VaMRqGHWMfm34/viewform\n&gt;\n&gt;* Added the ability to display video (for game trailers and footage) in the game details page. Developers can now upload videos to Vimeo and submit a link to show that video on their game’s page. If a video exists, it will display in the first screenshot slot.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Added the ability to download a game without entering its game details page.  Just press the U button while highlighting a game’s tile to download.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Fixed HDMI wakeup issue. If your TV was mysteriously waking up your OUYA, it should no longer do that after this update.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Added “forgot password” option to the existing user sign-in screen. Now you’ll actually know where to go, if you can’t remember your password.\n&gt;\n&gt;* We’ve changed “Download” to “Free Download” to make it clear that everything is free to try.  Not everyone knew that they wouldn’t be charged for a download, so now it’s crystal clear. It’s free to try ALL THE THINGS.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Enlarging a screenshot (or video) now goes full screen (instead of just bigger).\n&gt;\n&gt;* We now highlight the search substring when doing a search so it’s much more clear why you are getting each result. We’ve also moved game titles that start with your search to the top of the list. It’s way better.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Improved performance (speed and smoothness) in PLAY with lots of installed games.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Added a pop up message upon starting the console to remind users how to connect a controller.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Changed sorting of buried and installed tiles in DISCOVER. It used to be Uninstalled, followed by Installed and Buried (mixed together). Now it’s Uninstalled, followed by Installed, followed by Buried.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Devs: When uploading apks, it’s now more clear that you can use your previously published apk if you just want to edit text or screenshots…. or VIDEO =)\n&gt;\n&gt;* Devs: you can now hide or change the mouse cursor in your games and apps.  For more info see the ODK Controllers document.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Added Terms of Service to the console. Yup, it’s annoying to click through, but it makes the legal types happier. Think of the lawyers.\n&gt;\n&gt;* In case you missed it, multiple currency support is now turned on! If you want to switch your wallet currency, there’s more info here: https://ouya.zendesk.com/entries/26777317-How-can-I-change-the-currency-of-my-OUYA-wallet-\n&gt;\n&gt;* A bunch of other small bug fixes and optimizations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**So, uh… what’s up with “Ogopogo”?**\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, we realized that just naming each update after the date it was released was pretty boring, so we’re giving our updates a theme: Cryptids. One of our engineers, Jon, came up with the idea, so give him a virtual high-five (if not for him, the updates might have been named after Hall and Oates songs! :P)\n&gt;\n&gt;A Cryptid is “a creature or plant whose existence has been suggested but is not recognized by scientific consensus” (thanks, Wikipedia! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptid). There are a lot of really neat Cryptids out there, so now we can hit you with some random knowledge every time we update.\n&gt;\n&gt;Our first Cryptid is Ogopogo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogopogo. We’ve got a few Canadian employees that were excited to have a Canadian Cryptid featured. I guess that means that Ogopogo is a very polite Loch Ness monster that loves hockey, eh? (I kid, I kid)\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for all the continued support! Please keep on giving us your feedback and we’ll keep improving this labor of love we call OUYA =)\n&gt;\n&gt;-James, Producer Dude", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381259893", "subreddit": "ouya", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Its an example of government keeping things less expensive, why else are they breaking up the monopoly? Were they afraid the biggest telecom was going to rise up and over throw the govt? No. Its to keep Verizon from having too much market share (spectrum and what not) and charging their users exorbitant prices.\n\nMy point was government does do things to keep stuff less expensive, by breaking up a telecom, they are providing a welfare service in a sense. But they arent doing this for the people, its mainly so other  companies have a chance to fascilitate the illusion that we live in a true capitalist economy and not a state run capitalist economy. Let me readdress my first point, Im not naive enough to believe monopolies are broken up so the little people dont pay higher prices, its mainly for other businesses lobbying them so they can come in and not be locked out of the industry. \n\nBut my point still stands, government reduces expenses for everyone all the time. Imagine if your utilities or gas (fuel) wasnt subsidized by the government. Itd be way more then tree fiddy. \n\nHowd you jump from deflation to inflation? Are you such a caddy of the rich that you do not even consider deflation . You probably wont get this joke but I am implying that inflation is mainly a threat to the rich and not those with little to nothing. \n\nAs for your point about my last point , dont throw numbers at me.

{"body": "It all started a few years ago. There was this guy on Reddit. He was sort of a celebrity around here. I think his name was dualdan. Every post he made went straight to the top and every comment was 2000+ Karma. He *was* the circlejerk, and we redditors were going double dutch for his pithy commentary.\n\nAs with anything else that gets popular here, a counter-jerk eventually popped up. They did the typical stuff for a while; downvoting and trolling his posts and comments. So dualdan gets pissed, you know. This is his Karma we're talking about. After a little while it became pretty obvious who was leading the counter-jerk movement based on how frequently they would comment. So dualdan decides to start trolling back.\n\nHe starts commenting on their posts and encouraging people to downvote them. But dualdan is popular so it's not just him being an asshole on their posts it's basically everyone else too. These guys in the counter-jerk are furious. Karma is dropping into the negative numbers and that's like crack to these guys.\n\nGame over, right? Dualdan wins? Wrong. Turns out one of the users dualdan and his loyal herd had thrown into the negatives was a Moderator. Moderators aren't supposed to be able to access any personal information or hijack our accounts, but doing so is a piece of cake for any competent programmer.\n\nThe Mod hacks into dualdan's account and post a confession bear. A fucking confession bear. It was a few years ago so I don't remember exactly what it said, but it was something to the effect of, \"I killed my sister's abusive meth-head boyfriend... The police classified it as an overdose\" With dualdan's popularity *all* of reddit sees this. A lot of us didn't believe it, but apparently there were those who did because someone reported it.\n\nNow the FBI is involved. They subpoenaed Reddit for the identity of dualdan and then served him with a court notice. When the service processor handed Dualdan his summons he couldn't believe it. Who would do this to him? He'd never hurt anyone in his life. He tried to explain that there was a mistake.\n\n\"You can't do this to me.\" He said.\n\n\"Okay, fine.\" She replied. \"I just need one thing from you first.\"\n\nDualdan was confused, but he replied, \"Yes, of course. Anything. What do you need?\"\n\n \"I need about tree fiddy.\" She said.\n\nIt was around this time dualdan realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten him again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" he yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nedit: formatting ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381268378", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 57, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This may get creepy.\n\nSo this was last year. I was just on reddit, on my phone at like 3 A.M when I hear what seemed like the woodboard floor creak.\n\nNow for some background. If you go along the hallway in my house, by the end of it, there's a door to the left (almost always open) that leads to the house entrance. At night the only thing you can see when it's dark is the alarm's keypad, which glows.\n\nSo after hearing the woodboard floor creak I was creeped out, since I was sure that my parents were sleeping, so reluctantly I get up, turn on the hallway light (not really powerful) and get to the door I mentioned, but when I looked I didn't see the alarm light. I stood there for some seconds and my eyes started ajusting to the light, that's when I noticed a silhouette, and it was definitely not human. I run to my bed and cover myself up completely, I didn't know what to think about that. \n\nAfter what seemed like 1-2 hours I came to the conclusion that my mind was playing tricks with me and I calmed down, but I still couldn't sleep. Eventually it was daytime and I went on my day, still thinking about that.\n\nFastforward a few weeks. At this point I wasn't scared anymore, but still hadn't forgotten it. I was in bed again, I don't know the time, just trying to fall asleep when I hear it again, the woodboard floor creak, and again, my parents are asleep. I stay under the sheets for a long time deciding to whether to check it or not. If I stayed, I'd be safe (that's what I thought), but if I went I would ease my mind and realize it was just my imagination. After debating this with myself for quite the long time, I start thinking rationally, get the courage, pick up my phone for a flashlight and go to the door again.\n\nI couldn't see the light, my heart started racing, my hands shaking. My eyes adjust to the light and I see the silhouette again. \"Do I turn the phone light on? Do I want to see what that is?\". I started feeling the sweat on my nose, my whole body, I could hear my own heart beating. I looked for a rational answer to the situation, and I couldn't find it, and what was fucking with my head even more, was that there also wasn't an irrational one. \"Why doesn't it do anything?\". I was on the verge of crying, and I just wanted for it to end. I didn't want to go back and be afraid for the rest of my life, to be afraid of the dark and never feel safe again. So I spoke. \"What...(I take a deep breath)...what do you want from me?\". A deep voice from the dark answered. \"I need 'bout tree fiddy\". That's when I turned my phone's flashlight up and saw that the thing blocking the light was actually 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era!\"I ain't givin you tree fiddy, loch ness monster, get your own goddamn money!\" And it went away, I hope it doesn't come back again.\n\nIt was definitely the weirdest thing I've ever experienced.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381273840", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I guess I should explain a little more about agriculture, permanent structures and written language then I was responding on my phone so my apologies.\n\n\nAgriculture - It was documented even in Paleolithic times (400,000-11,000 BCE) that hunter-gathers knew how to plant seeds and domesticate animals but on a very small scale. The paleolithic era was a very long time in early human history which indicates this transformation happened very slowly, because the hunter gatherers' were constantly moving. A shift in warmer weather is also debated as to why these hunter and gathers may have been finally able to stay in one place, but is still only a theory. \n\n\n**So why the shift? Once these hunter gathers settled, their agricultural skills increased which resulted in a mass surplus of food. It was Agriculture that made for a stable and secure life which brought even larger amounts of people together.**\n\n\nIt is still unknown as to how people in various parts of the world began to domesticate animals and plants at the same time. It began around 7000 BCE in the Near East, (Tepe Yahya, Jarmo, Jericho, and Hacilar) Western Africa, China, (Yangshao) and even Central America all have recorded evidence that the ways of agriculture was beginning.\n\n\nPermanent Structures - Once people began to rely on farming for food they began to build permanent homes. This led to a prosperity in 'town life' as the population kept expanding. They built walls to protect themselves from attacks which indicates that these towns were developing social and political organizations. Civilization comes from the Latin word *civilis* and refers to a citizen. A citizen defined as someone who binds them self to political, economic, and social organization that benefits a larger community.\n\n\nThis prosperity brought two major things into play, trade and the ability to have a division of labor. Trade making it possible to share ideas and spread new techniques to others and having a division of labor allowed some to work in the fields, and most importantly **allowing others to begin mastering a different craft then just surviving.**\n\n\nWritten Language - Language had been occurring since the beginning of the Paleolithic era. Hunter gathers are believed to have cooperated by means of grunts or maybe even sign language. We don't know how they communicated but they effectively hunted and made paintings in caves together showing they did communicate somehow. Language is possible without a Civilization.\n\n\nWritten language is a very important part of how we look at a civilization. During the ninth millennium BCE people in the near east were using token as counters for keeping record. by the fourth century they began to inscribe pictures on the tokens of the clay because it was much easier then making the tokens themselves. This eventually to Cuneiform writing by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia. They began to write about their religions, rules, and commerce to even further establish their permanence as a civilization.\n\nSources: \nUnderstanding Western Society, A Brief History, VOL 1, Mckay, Hill, Buckler.\n\nChristiansen, Morton H. and Simon Kirby (eds.). 2003.

It is very rare to meet a woman who will say, \"You know, I want to like a self-deprecating nice guy with a good job...but that guy over there with the tattoos, muscles, and irrational self-confidence just makes me horny as fuck.\"\n\nOnce again, [Rollo Tomassi has already covered this on his blog](http://therationalmale.com/2011/09/29/duplicity/):\n\n&gt; Most women are literally oblivious to the underlying motivations of their sexual selections / attractions. Evolution has largely selected-for human females with a capacity to form psychological schemas that preserve an ego-investment that would otherwise afflict them with debilitating anxiety, guilt, and the stresses that result from being continuously, consciously aware of their own behavioral incongruities. Evolution selects-for solipsistic women who are blissfully unaware of their solipsism. Hypergamy necessitates solipsism.\n\nHe also goes into more depth [here](http://therationalmale.com/2011/10/03/war-brides/):\n\n&gt; Given the harsh realities that women had to endure since the paleolithic era, it served them better to psychologically evolve a sense of self that was more resilient to the brutal changes she could expect be subjected to. Consider the emotional investment a woman needs to put into mothering a child that could be taken away or killed at a moment’s notice. Anxiety, fear, guilt, insecurity are all very debilitating emotions, however it’s women’s innate psychology that makes them more durable to these stresses.

{"body": "You make excellent points. I agree with all of them--except for one. You said that meat accounted for only 25% of the paleolithic diet. I read the opposite: That meat accounted for some ridiculously high percentage of their food. Something like 80%. They analyzed fossilized tartar on the teeth to figure out what they ate. (Meat wasn't the only food they consumed, of course. The analysis showed traces of wheat and barley, legumes, and even date palm fruit.) But the striking thing was just how much meat was consumed.\n\nThat changed when farming came in due to the neolithic revolution. But recently anthropologists noticed that farming actually hurt society in certain ways. For instance, hunter-gatherers actually had longer lifespans and taller heights. (Cromagnon Man, for instance, ranged between 5'10'' and 6'.) Height shrank down after farming came in. Why? Disease. \n\nHunter-gatherers ran, they exercised. Their lifestyle led them to fresh streams, clean water, etc. Their farming counterparts, however, led sedentary lives. They lived around standing water, feces (from both humans and animals), and incurred the subsequent diseases of typhus and cholera. Their nutrition was also different, since they didn't have access to as much meat.\n\nThis effected their overall height and dentition. For instance, anthropologists noted that buck teeth didn't exist in the paleolithic era. Suddenly, when farming came in they noticed all sorts of crooked teeth and buck teeth. They wondered if there was a connection. And, upon study, there was. Hunter-gatherers gnawed on things more: bones (to extract marrow), nuts, etc. This exercised their jaw-muscles and kept their teeth in alignment.\n\nWhen people switched to vegetables and fruits [i.e., soft foods] their jaw muscles didn't develop correctly, leading to things like crooked teeth, buck teeth and wisdom teeth that suddenly didn't fit into the mouth. Here's an article on it: http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/02/the-real-source-of-cavities-and-gum-disease.html\n\nA quote from another article says: \"Hunter-gatherers had really good teeth,” Alan Cooper, director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA told NPR News. “[But] as soon as you get to farming populations, you see this massive change. Huge amounts of gum disease. And cavities start cropping up.\" The bacteria that cause tooth decay and gum disease need carbs to survive — so when men ate mostly meat, those germs died off harmlessly. But once he began eating starches and simple sugars, those bacteria thrived — and dentists’ waiting rooms have been standing-room only ever since.\n- See more at: http://douglassreport.com/2013/03/25/cavemen-had-healthier-teeth/#sthash.lFB7gSCw.dpuf\n\nThe anthropologist Jared Diamond wrote about the subject a while ago: i.e., how the human race experienced two great dips in height and lifespan. And both were associated with lifestyle changes: the neolithic era and the industrial revolution. Male height dropped from 5'10'' to 5'5''. Lifespans dropped off from 70 years to 55 years (as people died of typhus in the neolithic period, or choked on coal-smog and died of tuberculosis in the Industrial Revolution). \n\nThese are the trade-offs we make for technology.\n\nAnd as for WHO was responsible for farming? I blame females. They were the nut and berry gatherers. They were most likely the ones who created the earliest farms. Because of them cities rose up. Civilization.

{"body": "In my second year of high school, I had a stalker. Technically, I guess she was stalking me my first year and upgraded to confrontation my second year. It was one of those situations where a friend of hers came up to me after English and mentioned that she had a friend that was into me. Me, being 15 years old and in the firm grip of pubescent hormones, didn't realize how odd that was. It didn't matter that I didn't know this girl, she was a girl and she was into me and I decided to plan a date.\n\nTurns out that was a big mistake. It was three hours of awkward hanging out until my parents came to pick me up. Thankfully other people were there, or else I wouldn't have been able to maintain my composure. Her and I just didn't click at all, we had completely different interests and personalities. I know I was a horny teenager and this usually doesn't matter to horny teenagers, but we were so incompatible that I didn't even want to touch her boobies. After I went home, I texted her friend and told her that I just wasn't interested but didn't have the heart to tell her myself. I went to sleep thinking that was the end. I was dead wrong.\n\nFirst, I started noticing her more and more in the hallways at school. Even though I had no classes with or near her, she always seemed to be passing me in the halls. Then I started finding notes slipped into my locker. Small things at first, asking if we could just be friends and letting me know she was just nervous and that we may have gotten off on the wrong foot. Then they escalated from annoying to terrifying. There were descriptions of things I had done outside of school, cringe-worthy \"praises\" of my \"hotness\", and eventually this escalated to the point where she began talking about how great our marriage would be and how our kids would be beautiful and awesome. I reached my breaking point with that, she was clearly beyond \"crushing\" and was \"dangerously stalking and delusional\". I confronted her at her locker one day and told her off. I told her that she was scaring me, and that she needed to just move on and stop following me. She started crying and saying that she loved me and knew we would be great together and why couldn't I just see that and all the typical things a forlorned teenager could say. I couldn't deal with this, so I snapped at her and asked her, \"What the hell is it going to take for you to realize I don't like you?\" She looked me dead in the eyes and said,\n\n\"About tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381417807", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

You would think so.\n\nSo I decided to make the first date not super romantic like because we were still trying to get to know each other, but still nice enough to that she would enjoy it and feel special and treated I suppose. We decided on a nice sushi place about 20 minutes off campus. \n\nThe date started off great, we instantly hit it off. We discussed pretty much everything under the sun, and then some more. She was extremely funny and could carry a great conversation. It was extremely enjoyable. She then excused herself to go to the bathroom. While she was away I received a phone call from my brother. He had apparently been arrested for being blackout drunk at 8PM on a Thursday night, and how he called me and had a decent conversation I don't know and will never know.\n\nSadly I had to bail on the date to bail my brother out of jail. I waited until she came back to tell her and payed in advance for all of the meal. She said she was sorry she had to see my go and I apologized profusely. She smiled and leaned in for a kiss and whispered in my ear, \"Can you gimme about 3.50 for the tip?\" And that's when I realized i just went on a date with a three story tall monster from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "\nI met this chick at my work. Her and I were working late cleaning up the shop and we got to chatting as it was my first day and I was trying to get to know my coworkers. I soon picked up on her massive signals and asked for her aim screenname (yeah this was awhile ago).\n\nFast forward to about a week and a half later and we're meeting at the mall we worked at. Keep in mind at the time I didn't have a license because a month earlier I got an underage and thus she was my ride home. \n\nWe decide that we're going to see a film but have an hour until it starts so we decide to walk around the mall to kill some time. Naturally we start talking and getting to know each other and she tells me she's in a Christian youth group, but only because her parents kind of forced her to join one. After this tidbit we have this conversation (picture a super bubbly ditzy girl):\n\nHer – We should totally go and pick up our paychecks!!!\nMe – Sure I was gonna snag mine tomorrow when I work but whatever.\nHer – Oh we should hold hands when we go in there, but everybody will think we’re together!\nMe – Maybe but who cares? Its no biggie. \n\nSo we get our paychecks and head to the film which unfortunately was P.S. I Love You (yeah this was during a dry spell, I did what I had to).\n\nWe go into the theatre and there’s no one in our row (the back one) except for two 16 year old girls about ten seats to my right (I’m on the right and my date is on the left). After sitting through about three of those lame trivia questions she turns to me and says, completely serious, “do you want to make out during the movie!?” I say sure and we start making out. \n\nShe takes my hand and puts it on her crotch. I think “alright, its go time” and start rubbing her. She smacks my hand, slams her legs shut, and loudly says “NO!” Now I assume I got my signals mixed up and apologize. She proceeds to do the exact same thing to me again, 15 minutes later. Now at this point I figure she just felt like I would think she’s a slut/easy but now she didn't care. I also figure she knows exactly what I’m going to do if she puts my hand there again, so I rub her again. I receive the exact same reaction and begin thinking what the fuck is going on?\n\n15 minutes later this scene repeats itself, however this time I stick my hands way off to my side because I don’t want to get hit again. Naturally I look comical so the two girls two my right begin giggling. This makes her suggest we go to the parking lot and her car. I agree because the movie blows and honestly I want to get the fuck away from her. \n\nWe go to the parking lot and eventually take a drive to a more secluded one at her suggestion. We park and throw the back seats down (she has a SUV so plenty of space). Then I hear the craziest things I’ve ever heard a woman utter on a date:\n\n“Do you want to kiss with our shirts off?” I decline as I don't have a condom on me and honestly I want to get the fuck away from her. We make out for a bit, topless because hey she had awesome tits and my dick started to take over in the thinking deparment. “Can I see your penis?” At this point I tell her to stop asking and just do things, I’ll let her know if its not ok.\n\nShe then stares at it for literally 5 minutes with her mouth agape. “Can I touch your penis?” Again I tell her to stop asking. She then holds it for another 5 minutes while muttering “its so big.” (Now I’m above average but not huge by any means, but I’m 100% sure this is the first dick shes ever seen). After her just literally holding it like some sort of sausage I ask her for either a hj or a bj as blue balls are starting to kick in.\n\n“Ew that's gross, can you finger me?” I think alright once she gets going then she’ll get horny enough to take care of me so I start rubbing her through her panties. At that moment I hear a crinkling noise.\n\nMe -  “Are, are you wearing a pad?”\nHer – “Yeah its my week” \n\nAt that minute I had enough and ended it and flat out say I’d like to be dropped off. No sooner had these words left my mouth when her phone rings, its her mom:\n\nMom – “ Where are you?”\nHer – “Driving him home we went to get McDonalds”\nMom – “Where are you for real!?”\nHer – “Ok we kissed after the movie!”\n\nShe hangs up, phone rings again immediately.\n\nMom – “WHAT REALLY HAPPENED!?”\nHer – “WE MADE OUT IN THE BACKSEAT BYE!”\n\nAgain she hangs up, again the phone rings immediately.\n\nDad – “WHERE ARE YOU!?”\nHer – “ALRIGHT WE ALMOST HAD SEX”\nDad – “ I WANT TO SPEAK TO THIS BOY”\n\nAfter that she finally dropped me off. I’d like to say that was the end but there’s more to this story. I don’t want to make this wall of text any longer so if theres interest I’ll post the rest.\n\nTL;DR The Nessie and I kissed with our shirts off.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381458594", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I told A \"Well, my dick really ain't that long, but I can't fit it in a dog food can.\"  \n\nHoly shit, did that place ever explode.  A couple of people were in tears from laughing.  A couple of more had jaw-dropped and decided to exit stage left.  One girl's eyes glazed and I thought she was going to do the atomic panty-drop.  My girlfriend, a true ginger, turned beet red out of embarrassment.  And what did A have to say?  She turns to look at my girlfriend and says \"No wonder you walk around looking like one bite out of a doughnut!\".  \n\nA and I still get together with our families and go out to eat occasionally.  H.S. girlfriend lives in Idaho and has 5 kids now.  She's no bigger than she was in high school, but I tease her about carrying her uterus around in a fanny-pack.  I dodged a bullet there.  Hated high school, but still keep in touch with a lot of the friends I made.  Good times, man.  \n\nTL;DR- Dick joke backfires.  There is no 'tree fiddy' in the story.

{"body": "&gt; If I knew what it was, I'd attack that.\n\nIt's right in front of you. Here, let me show you:\n\n&gt; Most of it is how worthless I am. Actually, no, prior to the feelings of worthlessness are the feelings of wondering why I got rejected, and without that knowledge, I fill it in with worthlessness.\n\nAs a scientifically-minded person, you cannot possibly think that \"she rejected me therefore I am worthless\" is a logically cogent statement. There are multiple ways to destroy this thought.\n\nContrary to what books and movies suggest, the Casanova with a 100% success rate is as mythical as the Loch Ness Monster. Have you seen any guy in real life who manages to get a number from every single woman he approaches? Do his instances of rejection make him worthless?\n\nIn the odd chance you answered 'yes', what makes any attractive woman an arbiter of your worth? Does her genetic luck confer upon her some magical ability to peer into the innermost recesses of your mind? Why accept her metric of worth?\n\nNow it *might* be true that you're a boring neckbeard who's less interesting than a wet brick (the only way to truly confirm this is to have at least 7 women state it in explicit terms). In that case, women are obviously unattainable. I'm not going to give you that bullshit advice of \"there's nothing wrong with being this way/you have to love yourself/the world is wrong to judge you\". If you think that this makes you worthless, realize that you have the power to extricate yourself from this state. It's stupid to identify with your neckbeardness and lazily assume \"that's just who I am\".\n\n&gt; If I knew how to minimize that pain, I would go that route.\n\nMillions of men smarter than you brave rejection without becoming catatonic.

I had you pegged you somewhere between the two.\n\nAnd others, such as yourself are better than both of them, right?\n\n&gt;You think I care that other people make false assumptions about words because they're too lazy to learn? I always thought a shmuck was a jerk because I never heard it in the context of a penis. Eventually, I learned.\n\nI was merely pointing out that it is common error; and now, not one I shall make.\n\n&gt;You didn't reference it as what it is. You took the liberty to demonize it as genital mutilation, which it is not. I have a circumcision and my genitals work just fine, therefore not mutilated.\n\nI demonised it yes. I never called it mutilation.\n\n&gt;So as an atheist, you have no desire for personal honor or refining your character traits in a higher fashion?\n\nNo, as an atheist, I don't believe in any deities. Everything else is nothing to do with atheism.\n\n&gt;You make religion appealing.\n\nI suppose it depends on whether one needs that emotional support or not.\n\n&gt;I think his problem is the people, not the outlooks themselves. \n\nAs I said, he blanket-hates atheists.\n\n&gt;The atheists are unnecessarily combative and can't remain on topic in his discussions. \n\nAll of them? Blanket statements like that don't help matters.\n\n&gt;And you're saying you don't have a problem with him as a Jew, just Judaism (and all other faiths). Two things, one, that doesn't help the anti semitic claim \n\nActually, it does, because anti-semitism is a hatred of people and not ideas.\n\n&gt;and two, you must realize atheism is a faith. \n\nA faith in what? A faith in the fact that I do not believe in any deities? Atheism is the lack of faith, a lack of belief. You have to have faith/belief *in* something.\n\n&gt;You aren't convinced there's a God, but you can't actually be certain there isn't. You've jumped to a conclusion without evidence.\n\nI require as much certainty to lack a belief in any deities as I do to lack a belief in faeries, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, etc. A lack of belief isn't an asserite affirmative statement. You lack belief in all sorts of things; but I bet you don't hold yourself up to this crazy standard and call your own lack of belief in the Boogeyman a \"faith\". \n\n&gt;There are ways to criticize Judaism (or any religion) without being anti semitic (or offensive to that particular religion). \n\nNo criticism of Judaism itself is anti-semitic, only hatred of Jews, individually or as a people.\n\n&gt;Calling circumcision genital mutilation is an offensive distortion of the truth, therefore I feel the label fits in this case, otherwise every doctor who has performed a circumcision should be tried on charges of genital mutilation or whatever law it would be tried under.\n\nYou're the one who brought up mutilation, not me.\n\n&gt;Just calling a spade a spade. I don't care if you are anti semitic. \n\nI didn't think you did; I think that you like to call people anti-semitic because it is something offensive to call people. It is likening someone to the Nazis. You like to do to show how much better than them you are.\n\n&gt;Go support your colleges BDS program \n\nI have no idea what that is, Google says it is a Bachelor Degree in Dentistry, but I'm sure you mean something else.\n\n&gt;and wave a Palestinian flag at the next anti Israel rally. \n\nBecause I am literally Hitler.\n\n&gt;I could care less what you think, live, and do, \n\nYou *could* care less? That means you care somewhat? \n\n&gt;but no need to be defensive when called out.\n\nActually, there is a need to be defensive when libelled as anti-semitic, because as history shows, it is literally the worst thing that someone could be called when they are no such thing.

So about the only route for helicopters and unusual aircraft is north and south over the Verde river.\n\nIn any event, one of these aircraft, which had a 'V' shape, and is extremely quiet, was going to quickly transit over Phoenix in the early afternoon, when they \"threw out their transmission\", as somebody said at the time.  They were still able to maintain their low altitude without forward momentum, so they just drifted in the wind.\n\nAt about 4-5pm, they were drifting over an expensive neighborhood, right when everybody was coming home from work.  People were going inside and coming out with video cameras to record the thing, maybe 200 feet up, in the evening twilight.  It was obviously an aircraft.\n\nEventually the wind picked up and blew it south far enough into the desert for a recovery out of the public view.\n\nIn any event, then the second event began:  the all stops out disinformation campaign.  And it was a sight to behold.  Even a former governor who saw it was told to shut up, as the disinformation team took all sides of the argument.\n\nInsisting that there was no evidence at all and that anyone who presented any was a kook and a fraud, and that bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster were more legitimate, and freaky looking psychics who assured everyone that it was indeed a UFO.

Plus some none-too-subtle threats that if you shot your mouth off, they would ruin your reputation.\n\nThe bottom line is that they sunk a lot of bread to make some very cutting edge technology out of sight of those who would shoot at it, so didn't particularly want to share this information with them.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381704300", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Although love has many forms, from my experience this is love to me at least. From a male's perspective.  \n\n* **Wanting more for that person than yourself** -When you look into the future you see your life with and for that person. Not in a servant like fashion (unless that is what you're into, hey I don't judge.) but in a way that when you leave the house in the morning your goal is my SO needs to eat, a place to sleep and be comfortable doing it. And *I* can rest after. \n\n* **Being able to correct them** - A lot of people differ about this simply because who likes to hurt their SO's feelings? A psycho. But if you feel it will make them a better person for it then by all means, fight, argue, complain, whatever you have to for them to be able to be effective as an all around person, at home, at work or in the relationship. Is it personal? *Extremely* , because you can't be happy together without compromise. \n\n* **Being able to adjust and knowing when to!** - I have been guilty of both changing too much and not enough. It is extremely destructive if you don't find the right balance. Some things can't be compromised, you have to look at it like you're stuffing your mouth. (Crude, but bear with me a moment.) you have two cheeks and room in the middle but you can't stuff one cheek forever, it'll burst eventually. And boy when it does it will hurt you both and leave a scar that all the cocoa butter in the world won't heal. But know your and your SO's limits. And don't change *everything* at the drop of a dime. It'll shows back bone that your SO will never forget and learn to depend on when they need it. \n\n* **Instinct** -You may say /u/Passthedopamine what do you mean by instinct? You can't control that. Or can you? When I say instinct I mean that you without question will lay down your life for this person with no expectation of a thank you. This IMO should go both ways, because it's an *amazing* feeling to know someone has your back to this extent. \n\n\n* **Unconditional**- this is a toughie. For everyone. Not everyone can do this. My brother just got married a few months back and within two weeks of the wedding his wife had a stroke. They are both very young and have a lot of time ahead of them. However, his wife is in a wheelchair on a long and stressful road to recovery, he is not complaining one bit and takes care of her at all times of the day. He spent weeks in the hospital only going home to shower at her side through surgeries, therapy and the more gruesome side of her current state. The problem with this is, there is no way, to my knowledge of how to gauge this. Until it happens really. \n\nThat's all I have, thanks for reading. \n\nTL;DR: Tree Fiddy. \n\nEdit: Excuse any typos and stuff. It's late and I'm on my phone.

{"body": "All names have been changed to protect the guilty. So if you are from Georgia or the South in general this will resonate more than those of you in other regions. My friend \"Adam\" wanted to have a more laid back bachelor party as his fiancée is morbidly conservative and religious and generally opposed to drinking, strip clubs and fun. So the best man, \"Tom\" decides that we should rent a cabin up in the north georgia mountains and go whitewater rafting. It would placate the fiancée since we couldn't get into too much trouble and we wouldn't have to worry about drinking and driving and all that nonsense.\n\nI wasn't too excited about a cabin as it sounded boring, but Adam was on board and he was the ultimate say. The cabin turned out to be pretty damn nice. It had a pool table, some arcade games, and room to fit the 10 of us comfortably. So we all start drinking...heavily. We are playing beer pong, flip cup, quarters, you name it. We are having a great time when Peter, the crazier one in the group, decides we should visit other cabins in the area to see if there are any girls around. Looking back it seems like a really dumb idea, particularly since the likelihood of finding  an all female cabin seems pretty stacked against us. But, at the time we were drunk.\n\nSo we (me, Peter, another guy Chris, and Tom) head out of the cabin, temporarily forgetting we are in the middle of nowhere, and set off to find some women. We approach the first cabin stealthily (boisterous and loud) to see if we can spy on the occupants. The cabin seems vacant so we decide to move on. Suddenly Tom stops us and points to a window in the upstairs room of the cabin. A light had turned on (probably because we were so loud outside). We rush into the woods to avoid detection when I hear peter shout \"fuck, my leg\". Peter had tripped over a root when his foot got stuck. The cabin door suddenly burst open and a big, corn-fed, behemoth of a man shouts \"y'all get the fuck off my property or I'm calling the cops\". We panic. Everyone darts in a different direction and I just make a beeline to where i thought our cabin was.\n\nI'm running like mad, knocking tree branches and shit for about five minutes before I realize I'm not sure where I am. I have zero survival instincts and I'm still drunk as hell. Further, I can't get any cell service on my phone. I start calling out for my friends hoping someone is near by. Nothing. Eventually I hear footsteps and start calling out My friends names. I head towards the sound, cautiously as I'm starting to get freaked out in the dark. As I get closer, I realize that it's not my friends at all, but country boy from the cabin. He has what looks like a pistol in his hands. I'm hiding behind a tree but I know he knows I'm there.\n\nHe starts walking towards me when I hear a loud \"thwack!!\" and see country boy go limp. Peter emerged behind him with a big branch. Now I'm really freaking out. I shout \"what the fuck man\". I'm not sure if this dude is dead, knocked out, or what. Peter bolts and I'm stuck with country dude laying on the ground. I hear a groan and country boy starts to move. \"I need a doctor\" he mumbles from the ground. \"Call a doctor\" he says again. I tell him my phone has no service and ask him if he has one at the cabin. I'm still freaking out and call out for Peter. He tells me there's a pay phone at a gas station about half a mile. Im thinking, a fucking pay phone? I haven't seen one of those in about a decade. I ask him how much does it cost to use the pay phone and he says \"about tree fiddy\".

We both laughed a bit, you told me to \nnot tell anyone(sorry...) and went back inside while I finished cleaning the windows.\n\nAnyways about the other incident. I was cleaning the windows on a Friday morning and after a shower you began searching your car keys and wallet like crazy. You found your car keys but not your wallet so you came close to the window and said \"Wait, can you help me? I need one thing..\". \"Sure\" I said \"What do you need?\" , and then you replied \"I need about tree fiddy\". I stood there in shock and looked at the car keys you were holding. They were actually... a sponge.\n\nFinally everything started making sense, why you were always naked and dripping wet after your constant \"showers\" and why you never went out of the house. Your house didn't actually have windows, it was completely surrounded by glass and filled with water.

{"body": "**Actual experience in this exact situation here.**  \n  \nIt was approx 9pm, in a very rural area, where we have very few cops. A few months ago, a couple of 100km north, there was a bunch of cases of guys impersonating cops at night with flashing lights and pulling cars over. I don't have good eye sight, even with contact lenses on it was hard to tell with certainty what was behind me (through a rear-view mirror, with headlights in my eyes).\n\nI kept driving, a well lit area was more than 20 minutes away. The speed limit was 100km/h - and I hadn't been speeding or given any other reason to be pulled over that I was aware of. Something about the (what i perceived to be erratic) driving of the officer (speeding up then dropping way back behind me) and the situation didn't make me feel comfortable to stop.\n  \nWhen I did stop, I was immediately pepper sprayed, ripped out of the car, handcuffed, and assaulted. No questions asked. I was kicked and my head was stomped on. I received a concussion. I was charged with failing to stop, dangerous driving, refusing a blood sample and resisting arrest (to cover the officers ass from the assault). I was asked for a blood sample because I 'failed' an impairment test I was made to undergo **after being assaulted and concussed**. I refused on principle and legality.\n\nWhen this went to court it was my word against the officers. I lost. The only concession I got was dropping the resisting arrest - but only if I agreed not to pursue assault charges. \n  \nI am currently serving 4 months of electronic monitoring with a curfew - because I wanted to find a well lit area to pull over.\n\n**TL;DR** DO NOT DO THIS.

There are far more profiles that I read that say creationism should be taught in schools and they believe in the power of prayer that those that say they don't believe in a god and that evolution is the only scientific theory that should be taught in school. \n\nTrust me, I read enough profiles of guys proclaiming their love for jesus and god (okcupid has the six things you can't live without question, and god is often one of the six), declaring their faith in the power of prayer, and indicating their potential match must have faith in a higher power (doesn't always matter which one) so he can be sure she has a moral grounding. I just read one tonight that said he'll accept a girl of any religion (except those without religion) although he prefers a Christian since \"shared faith can be so much fun in a relationship.\")\n\nedit: the profile I am reading right now - \"About him: I have been called by God to go into a full time Christian Vocation. I am unashamed to say I love God and am very involved with the Church that I attend. Right now (and forevermore), God is #1 in my life and I want people to know that. For some reason in this country, people are leaving our traditions and turning to finite wisdom and materialistic gain, when we have infinite love and grace available to us.; What I like to do: I like going out to the movies, or staying in for the new release. Spending time with friends and family and serving my Lord Jesus.\"\n\nedit #2: \nHere is my recent conversation from okcupid - I loved the completely missed irony of his last statement (I copied and pasted so the spelling errors (their vs there) and capitalization of He, God, and Bible are his)\n***\nme: Thanks for the message and you have a good sense of humor that also comes through on your profile. Unfortunately I don't see us as a match. Your last picture of you with a large cross necklace kind of shows me that. I don't mean this in any way disrespectful, but what I am looking for in a potential partner is someone who doesn't believe in a god like myself. Just as many people say faith in god plays a major role in their life, seeing through the perils of religion plays just as important role in my life. I realize people often don't see it this way- they have no problem telling me I have no moral compass and will one day be burning in hell for not accepting jesus as my savior, but think I'm being militant just for saying politely that I am looking to date an atheist. \n\nSo, just being honest. Thanks for your message and good luck in your search.\n\n*him: it takes more faith to believe their is not God than He lives.*\n\n*If you really believe their is no God, how do you account for history of the Bible and it being irrefutable?*\n\nme: I don't even know how to answer that. Considering every part of the bible has been refuted or completely lacks any evidence of truth, it would be like trying to convince you 2+2 equals 4 and not 5. \n\nAnd trust me, it doesn't take faith to believe something with complete lack of proof of existence doesn't exist. It simply requires using your brain rationally. It does take quite a bit of mind bending, ignoring details, and lacking any sense of rationality to believe it does. You sent me an answer that is vague, nonsensical, and basically the party line for trying to validate your own belief. It really doesn't pay to keep sending me messages. As Douglas Adams says, \"I really do not believe that there is a god; in fact, I am convinced that there is not a god (a subtle difference). I see not a shred of evidence to suggest that there is one … etc., etc. It’s easier to say that I am a radical atheist, just to signal that I really mean it, have thought about it a great deal, and that it’s an opinion I hold seriously.”\n\n*him: What kind of proof are you looking for to believe that God exists?*\n\nme: Do you need proof Bigfoot exists or do you just believe because someone else told you it does? Do you need proof of the existence of invisible fairies, the loch ness monster, the abominable snowman, ghosts, the tooth fairy, or your toys coming to life when you leave the room? Or do you just believe all these things exist based on faith? And if you don't, what kind of proof would you need to believe any of these exist? The concept of a god makes zero sense whatsoever to anyone with a rational mind. You believe simply because you've never thought about it beyond what you've been told. You do mind tricks to help you prove what you want to believe, and ignore what could possibly cause you to question that belief. Really, this conversation is going to go nowhere. I don't need to look for proof that a god exists. I am not looking to find a god, just as I am not looking for a yeti. It's not there, I don't care that it's not there because my life is just fine without it, and seriously- if there was a god, he is certainly doing a pretty crappy job given the amount of suffering in the world, and the suffering seems to mainly affect those who seem to most believe in a god's existence. Non-believers as a whole are doing just fine.\n\n*him: My relationship with God has nothing to do with what anyone has told me, it has to do with what is in my heart, mind and soul...*\n\n*God lets the sun shine on the just and the unjust, there is a lot of good in the world.:-)* \n\n***So you believe in the devil?***\n\nme: How can you possibly think after all I said that I would then believe in just as fictional of a non-existent character as a devil? \n\nNo, I do not believe in the devil, or Santa, or a fish that swallowed Jonah, or the boogeyman.\n\n*him: Ha, I don't believe in the boogieman either, lol :-)*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381852128", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I can hear another person talking twenty feet away, the fan of the ac above my head, the sound of my owntyping on the keyboard, the sound of someones pants swishing against eachother as they walk down the hall nearby and now that I'm done with that, the sound of the music I'm using to drown the world out and try to keep myself centered.\n\n5.

I can see the speaker system in the ceiling that could be used for announcements but never has, the overhead florescent lights, and the calendar on the wall.

I can feel my sore throat as I swallow while sucking on the losenge, I can feel the tension in my shoulders from constantly feeling like someone is behind me, I can feel the sweat in my shoes that makes me want to take them off.\n\n7. I can see my company award on my desk, my Double Red Cell Donar pin from the Red Cross, and the phone tree for my department. I can hear the creak of my chair as I adjust position, the sound of the person who sits next to me walking up to his desk and dropping his backpack on the floor, and the sound of the music I'm playing. I can feel the desk under my wrists as I type, the headphone wires next to my face, and an itch just below my left eye.\n\n8. I can see the monitor that I type this on and behind it on the shelf a coffee mug. I can hear the rapper in my hear ryming a series of things about clowns for some reason and as the music drops in volume for a moment I can hear the person at the desk next to mine talking on his phone.\n\n9. I can see a loch ness monster a friend gave me sitting on my desk, I can hear the violin of the next song playing, and I can feel the deep breath I just took as I am starting to feel more in control.\n\n10. 4 - Still a little upset but I can handle it. \n\nThank you sothazi.

It would probably add 2-3\" to the board length, and would give the deck a really interesting shape.\n\nCowboy looks cool but would look ice cold with two kicks and a symmetrical foot platform. Also I'd reduce the wheel flairs for riding comfort, to make it easier to press, and to increase the durability of the board. I had a sugar and the flairs didn't like it when I landed upside down at all.\n\nIf I was to pick one as they are now, Dr Evil for sure, looks really fun for going fast and has some nice tight wheelbase options for freeride. Single kicks with delicate wheel flairs are bad news in my experience, as they invite you to try to learn freestyle then break apart before your eyes.\n\nCool stuff man, keep up the good work.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381898832", "subreddit": "longboarding", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Somehow we made it without being murdered.\n\nWe get settled into the Hostel, and head downstairs to the common area to try and meet some of the other guests and introduce ourselves. The instant we cross the threshold into the room I started gagging a little bit. This only one guy sitting in the room and I swear he had been pickled. He reeked of every kind of booze ever, and didn't look like he had showered in years. Though I couldn't blame him after seeing the showers at this hostel. He had his feet kicked up on the couch without any shoes or socks on. You could see the bunions and cracks in his toenails. Straight up nasty shit.\n\nWe tried to nope the fuck out of there, but we didn't move quick enough. He saw us, and he wasn't letting us get out of there without some verbal harassment. So he starts talking to us about drinking, and how we should all be getting drunk with him. He wants us to go out and buy him booze (of course), and we kept denying and saying that we didn't know anyplace and that we just wanted to hang out.\n\nSo he started asking for money so he could just go get it and bring it back for us. I was getting super fed up with this guy so I decide to just give him some cash so he will gtfo. \"How much do you need?\" I asked,\n\n\"About Tree-Fiddy\" the guy said.

Chalk writings were strewn all above him, layering across to the walls and over his vintage paintings and over everything. He only had a few moments left.\n\nDr. Watson grabbed his wet palm. Every part of Mr. Holmes was dripping by now and his face was pale and his lips blended into his skin almost like they didn't exist.

Myth.\"\n\nThe life was visibly fading from Holmes' eyes as he looked to Watson expectantly. Watson nodded for him to continue.\n\n\"Stonehenge was a glorified burial ground for Druids.

{"body": "&gt;What would it take to convince you?\n\nIt's tricky, because due to the nature of NDEs it's all going to be anecdotal, and you can't test humans like you would animals. But I'd like to see a major study from a respected, faith-neutral group with some strong controls in place for bias, and some pretty rigid controls on what constitutes a \"hit\". There should be a falsifiable hypothesis attached, with rigorous attempts to disprove it. The hypothesis should make falsifiable predictions. But so far, the preponderance of the evidence says that the physical brain alone is what is responsible for consciousness.\n\n&gt;So if somebody tells you to come look at a sunset, and you come and look and there is a sunset, is that a coincidence? There are a lot of things out there that make it seem that spirits are far more likely than not. But when you ascribe to a priori dismissal of all evidence because you already know that all evidence is false or misleading then you aren't being particularly open to actually consider evidence.\n\nI'm open to considering evidence, but the evidence so far is pretty weak. You can't overturn a scientific consensus based on some personal anecdotes. \n\nDreams sometimes come true. Most of the time they do not. We don't need to posit a supernatural explanation for the ones that do come true, as coincidence is enough to explain them and is a more parsimonious explanation than the supernatural. \n\n&gt;Ok, leave all of those in. Then rule out the ones that aren't particularly useful. Sample bias resolved.\n\nIf a drug company ruled out all the results where an experimental drug didn't work or caused bad side effects, they'd rightfully be called to the carpet on that. It's still sample bias.\n\n&gt;That allow him to diagnose a broken bone in somebody in another room? That's a pretty good glitch.\n\nIf you had 100 people try to guess the diagnosis of someone in the next room in the hospital, inevitably a few would be right. This isn't because they had supernatural help, it's because they got lucky. \n\n&gt;If you are calling Dr George Rodonaia (MD, PhD) a liar then go for it.\n\nI don't know that MDs and PhDs are less prone to lying than anyone else. There are plenty of them selling quack alternative medicine cures, individually.\n\n&gt;But at some point when every single incident is chalked up to being from a liar, or a crazy person, or a mistaken person or some other category eventually the only rational thing to do is to ask if the reviewer has an unreasonable bias.\n\nThe limits of human perception and memory are well-understood and are more than enough to account for these instances, just as they account for UFO sightings and Loch Ness Monster sightings.\n\n&gt;Who would know better than a neuroscientist?\n\nA large group of neuroscientists.\n\n&gt;But it illustrates that even very educated people reject truth.\n\nOf course. We all suffer from cognitive biases. It's built into our brains.\n\n&gt;The \"entirety\"? Ok, how does the shoe story contradict anything else?\n\nI mean the stories are self-contradictory in general. Some people see Hindu gods. Some people experience traditional Christian ideas of Hell. Some people learn that God doesn't care about a particular religion at all. Some people see the blessed Virgin. The stories contradict each other.\n\nSorry for the late response, was sick yesterday\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381954966", "subreddit": "mormon", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Who would turn me in, a *road weary* traveler? Not likely.\n\nThe owner, an older Korean gentleman, lived in a suite at the hotel. He was easy to get along with, and occasionally strolled through in the middle of the night. about 90% of the time, he would have a little Vicks VapoRub inhaler in his hand, lid on his pinky, just taking deep sniffs of it. \n\nAnyway, I had just finished smoking about half a joint outside and settled in to play away my night. I left the roughly half a joint sitting outside on the bench to finish later. In comes the boss at about 3 AM, inhaler in hand, right up to the counter. Completely somber, he asks me how the night has been. \"How many customer? Is paperwork done? You have uh breakfast set up?\" I let him no we have no occupants at all, and reminded him that breakfast didn't get set up until 6AM. This is when he cracks up, \"Haha Oh yeah. I forgot what time it was. I'm kinda hungry, gonna grab some stuff from the kitchen.\" He says this in a way that kinda sounds like he's asking my permission. Weird, but I tell him okay, sounds good. \n\nBy this point, I'm nervous because the owner had to know I was baked. My eyes are red, having smoked only minutes before. I'm sure he had to have smelled it too. What seems like hours go by, and I'm there contemplating my decision. Suddenly, out comes the boss man. He has a paper plate piled at least 5 inches with fruit, muffins, and a waffle. In his arm pit, there was at least 3 little single serving packs of cereal. In his other hand he was holding 3 cups full of milk and juice. The VapoRub tube sticking out of his nostril. He just looks at me while balancing his haul, cracks a smirk and says, \"Have good night, see you tomorrow.\" Then he turns and heads back toward the back door. \n\nI give it like 30 minutes, then head out for a cigarette. When I got there, I sat down and looked around for my unfinished joint. I found it, right where I left it. Instead of a half finished doobie, there was a tweezer sized roach instead. I put two and two together. My boss had smoked my joint, then raided the hotel kitchen in the middle of the night, and left me there to play video games. Thoroughly amused, and slightly bummed at the lack of weed, I headed back to my laptop. \n\nThe night gets slightly better. About 20 minutes after that, close to 4 am, I get a phone call. It was the boss, calling from his cell phone. He said he was locked out of his suite, and needed a room key. He told me to meet him by the vending machines next to the suite. Made a key, and headed around the corner. When I got there he had both hands on the vending machines, staring intently at it. He turns his head to look straight at me and says, \"My wife has my wallet in car with her. You loan me couple dollars?\" Astonished, I just smiled as I reached for my wallet. \n\n\"How much do you need?\" I asked him with amusement. \n\n\"Oh I guess I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time I realized my boss was actually a 500 foot tall creature from the paleolithic era. I told him, \"Goddammit Lochness monster I ain't gonna give you no damn tree fiddy!\" \n\n\"\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1382049394", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

Besides, he was really good looking and I'm a sucker for the hotties.\n\nNevertheless, it was one particular instance of his overconfidence that lead to the demise of our relationship. Although, in the end it had little to do with him and a lot to do with me. I feel it's necessary to say, before I go on, that I have a phobia of making a scene in public places. It's crippling really. Unfortunately, if I get very uncomfortable, I get a little uh...*gassy*and...well...you'll see.\n\nDespite my fear, I'm actually quite a sociable person and love to go out. My boyfriend, being as he was, wouldn't pass up an opportunity to demonstrate his 'skill' and so we ate out quite often. I happened to have a little problem with my cash flow while we were dating but we always ended up at an upmarket restaurant even though we promised to cut back. Our feeble attempts to stop this pattern were solely to appease our consciences. I was closing in on 'kept girlfriend' status when we decided to try out a newly renovated restaurant relatively near our apartment. Little did we know that it would supply the setting for our breakup. I admit it was appropriate, now that time has allowed me some perspective.\n\nAfter fighting back a ferocious hunger all day (dieting), I mercilessly devoured my starter and was halfway through a rather tasty sea bass main when I heard the arguing. My boyfriend was beginning to lose his temper with a snooty waiter who had presumably insulted his knowledge of the wine menu. Neither looked like they were ready to back down and the waiter even looked like he might go on the offensive. Other customers were staring and an uncomfortable silence was spreading. Ominous rumblings in my stomach had begun at this point and I was beginning to regret wolfing down my food. My boyfriend had taken to his feet and was hammering the table when I finally interjected with a hesitant \"stop?\". He glanced at me briefly and then continued, squaring up to his adversary . I stood up to grab his arm, but instead let loose a mini earthquake. The surface of the wine in the glass he was holding rippled. A split second of sweet release followed by shame. Oh god the shame. One horrified glance around the utterly silent room and I promptly lost consciousness.\n\nI came to as my boyfriend was applying a cold bottle to my forehead. My head was fuzzy and it didn't help that everybody was cautiously eating their food, expecting more drama to take place. Mortified, I looked into my lover's eyes and burst into tears. His conscientious side had kicked in but his attempts to peel me off the floor failed (partly due to my weak willed dieting campaign). He then began hurriedly asking me what I needed, demanding that I give him something to do. This is when it hit me. What I needed all along. So I once again looked into his glistening, concerned eyes and said \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was about this time that everyone realised I was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Palaezoic era. My boyfriend was furious. \"God damn you Loch Ness Monster, you're not gettin another penny outta me\" Crushed, I swam away once again in search of another unsuspecting patron/lover.\n\nTL;DR - I'm so sorry\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382117928", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Let me tell you my buddy and I were hunting and he's a big guy, former marine, the kind of guy you'd like to have on your side in a bar fight, tough motherfucker. We see some turkeys, have a few laughs at them and then he decided he wanted a funny picture with the turkeys. Bad call motherfucker. This one big ballsy looking turkey motherfucker, apparently just lost all kinds of his shit and started attacking my friend. I thought it was funny, until the turkey is literally ripping and beating the living fuck out of my friend. My first instinct was to shoot the motherfucker, 12 gauge would do the trick, but that 00 buckshot would get my friend too. So I drop the shotgun and draw my smith and wesson 629. I still could not get a shot off without risk of hitting my friend, my friend being the badass he was, happened to have a [ka bar](http://www.self-reliance-works.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Ka-Bar-Knife-With-Sheath.jpg) and was able to stab the son of a bitch to death. My friend had all kinds of cuts all over him, his cheek was split open and it looked like a vagina. I noticed his left arm was putting out a good bit of dark blood. I take a closer look this turkey had managed to clip his brachial artery (its the continuation of the axillary artery below the teres major (its the artery that runs down your arm between your bicep and tricep, stupid motherfucker) ). I tried to  let him remain calm as much as possible considering he'd been in a knife fight with a turkey from hell. I got my belt over his arm and we left virtually everything we were carrying to shuttle him back to the truck while we had time. Its not something that probably would have killed him given the situation, but having me there probably saved him a lot of nerve damage. A lot of people who tear their brachial artery suffer nerve damage, loss of function, it can cause you to lose the arm or even kill you in some cases. My point is a turkey beat the shit out of my friend and almost killed the bastard. Don't fuck with turkeys.  \n\n&gt;In the truck on the way to the hospital it was around that time I started realizing my friend wasn't the guy I had previously known. In his weakened state I realized he was actually so big that the truck was leaning to one side and half of him completely filled the bed of the truck. I said how are you doing buddy, do you need anything? He looked at me with those beady eyes and said \"i need about tree fiddy\", it was about that time I realized this wasn't my friend but was a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  \n\nThere you go graff.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382156744", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 713, "controversiality": 0}

I asked him to explain and he says two guys are here evicting him and telling him to leave.

The guy on the porch is trying to get the tenant to hurry up and get his shit out of the house. There was a loud crash from inside the house from what we later learned was a second mangy fucker kicking in a locked door in the basement.\n\nSo I yell at the dude on the porch to get the fuck out of here and dial 911 on my phone. The dispatcher picks up and I explain there are men breaking into my house with the tenant still inside and that I think it's a home invasion and they might be armed and will she please send a cop. The dispatcher says, \"This is not an emergency. Hang up and call this non-emergency number\" which she rattles off. \n\nI hang up and dial 911 again, got the same lady.

{"body": "Late as usual, but here's mine:\n\n**TL:DR** Thought I was happily married, was convinced otherwise by new co-worker. Amazing sex. Now with co-worker after having eyes opened.\n\nWe met as freshman in college, and were engaged less than three months after meeting (idiot...) The sex was good, and plentiful. The relationship blossomed into something that probably all marriages start with, so I was feeling a little better about all the 'too young' chatter from family and friends. We moved in together, everything seemed perfect. \n\nAfter being engaged for 3 years, we decided to set a date for our wedding. It made sense. We both had jobs, steady income, a financial plan to deal with loans, no outstanding credit card debt, cars were both paid off, and we were saving money. Had a dog, had mutual friends we would hang out with every so often, basically everything was amazing in our lives... \n\nExcept in the bedroom. I don't know what it was at the beginning, but she was insatiable. In her dorm room, in her dorm bathroom, in the laundry room, in her car, in the quad at 3 am, in a school playground tube slide etc - just crazy ass places, all her idea. I thought it was amazing (who wouldn't? Other than the playground, it's all fairly cliche college sex, right?) We moved in together before our junior years and it just kept going. In the apartment laundry room, in the fitness center, in the shared back yard, etc. Basically, sex was whenever, wherever and however. Then... nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada. One month passed, and I started thinking she might be getting it elsewhere, which worried me, so I asked. She says no, that she's just tired from work and school. Made sense, so okay. She said she'd work on it. Two months. Three months. Four months. *Five months* no sex. I'm getting fed up. Five months of seduction, questions, chats, talks, promises, confusion, suspicions, etc. It's not like it was 5 months of 'oh, hey, we haven't had sex' - it was a topic of conversation a few times per week. I wanted it, she didn't. She said her 'drive was gone.' I accepted that for a while. Then I asked if she had been to her OB. Yep. Then I suggested we go to counseling, because it wasn't just effecting the sex - it was depressing me, it was a major catalyst to our arguments, and she was completely oblivious to the impact it was having on our relationship. \n\nAfter five months of downhill, I started thinking it was time to end the marriage. It wasn't just the sex, but it was mostly the sex. I contacted a lawyer/friend for just advice. He suggested counseling. I told him I already brought it up. He suggested we speak to our families about it - sort of like an 'intervention' type deal to see if there was anything we could think of to re-rail the train. Did that - all great ideas, none worked out. Vacations from work, alone time, spa days, girls days, boys nights out etc. She was getting happier at the expense of me. I was getting more miserable. I wanted to love my wife. I wanted to be with my wife. Then I met ***her.***\n\nI switched jobs to be closer to home (10 minute commute vs 45 minutes) to work on the marriage. Wife said me 'not being home' was a reason for the distance in the relationship, so I rectified it by getting a new job. Started the job, and I was miserable. Job outside of my degree field, for less pay, more hours and just idiotic working conditions... but I was doing it for my marriage. About the fourth week there, I was in the lunch room with some other people when a woman sat at our table and joined us. I was making 'job-friends' as I call them - people you talk to at work but would only wave or nod at in non-working environment. Anyways. She sits down as the others are going back to work. I've still got 45 minutes left to my hour lunch. I don't know her name. She knew mine, and also asked what was bugging me. I'm a pretty conservative person, so I ask her how she knew whether or not I was 'bugged' - she said she could tell. I don't know if that's an icebreaker, or if she was just some savant, but in those 45 minutes, I covered the last 4 years of my life in detail. Then I stopped talking. She called me a pussy, and spent the last 5 minutes of her break making fun of me for not having the balls to stand up to my wife. I felt like ***shit.*** I spend the next four hours wondering whether or not she was right. I decided that, right or not, I was going to 'stand up to my wife' tonight. We were going to figure out what the fuck was wrong with our marriage. We were going to right the ship... tonight. \n\nI get off shift, fully amped for our conversation, and race to my car to get home and get started. This was going to be the talk that either advanced my marriage, or ended it. I get to my car. She was standing there. I was confused. She had just gotten done berating me for being 'a pussy' and insulting me and basically calling me a loser for letting things get worse despite working so hard to fix everything, and there she was, standing at my car for what I thought was her night-cap insult. I braced for this seemingly combatant woman's insult. She opened her mouth, and asked me to go get a drink with her. I told her to shove off. She said 'running home to put a band-aid on that severed limb of a marriage'? I was *enraged.* I was mostly pissed at myself for opening up to this bitch, but also at her candid nature of twisting the knife. I went to yell at her, and before I exploded, she says 'that's what I figured... well, if you're going to do that, you should probably cool off a bit - let's go grab a drink.' I told her to fuck off. She laughed. Not a sinister laugh, more of a 'uhmm hmm' laugh. I unlocked my car, and she said 'whatever, I'll be at [local pizza joint/brew house] when you change your mind. She drove off. I was just as pissed as after my lunch break. I got into my car, still determined to go home and repair my marriage.  Then I heard her in my head 'band-aid on that severed limb' and it just clicked. \n\nI got to the pizza place/bar. Found her. Just as I sat down, the bartender handed me a drink she had ordered for me 5 minutes before I got there. Didn't say a word to her - didn't have to. Felt like she knew me better than I knew myself. Ate, drank, and left. I got home that night, and didn't talk to my wife at all. I was mesmerized by my encounter with this woman. Next day, I leave for work, and go to say goodbye to my wife, when I stopped myself. I would see if she said anything. Nothing. Pretended to forget something and came back in. Nothing. Left again. Nothing. Lunch time. 'Job friends' leave. Bitch/savant sits down. I prepare for either being lambasted again, or just more 'no-talking because what's the point?' It was the no-talk stuff with job complaining here and there. This went on for a few weeks. Didn't talk to wife. Wife didn't care. 'Non-talked' with less bitchy/still savant-y woman during lunches.\n\nThen she was at my car on a Thursday evening again. Asked to meet for food and drinks again. I obliged. Same thing. Eat, drink, leave, but this time, instead of going home, I was asked to make sure she got home safely, as she 'lived in a tough area.' I ask her where she lives. It's a upper middle class, affluent housing area. Instant boner. I'll spare you the embarrassing details (you go 5 months without sex and no time to rub one out and see how long you last...)\n\nHad the 'I'm leaving you' talk with my wife the next weekend. She broke down. Wanted to 'work it out.' Etc. Etc. Etc. Typical break up stuff. I'd had enough. I laid out everything that I was going to say the night I was so pissed off all those weeks ago. \n\nGot to work the next week, and get to lunch, anticipating meeting her again for lunch to talk. Maybe there's something there for us, maybe not, but it's a start. She shows up as the JFs are leaving, and she can just see it on my face. I did it. I left my wife. She pulled out her lunch. We did our usual 45 minutes of chit chat. Right at the end, she hands me a note. This is it. Either we're destined to be together, or I'm back on the hunt. I open the note with 7th grade fervor. \"you pussy\" was scribbled in green crayon on the paper. I look up confused, and she's gone. Then the lochness monster pops it's head out of the water faucet and says 'imma need tree fiddy'\n\nWow, that was longer than I anticipated writing. Thanks for sticking around to hear my end of a terrible marriage veiled by a decent looking marriage from an outsiders perspective. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382221300", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not a good argument.\n\nFirstly, the transition from cult to religion necessary for growth is generally conducted by 'organisers'. Cults with just the central con man tend to die *because* that con man is in it for themselves and that becomes obvious - tainting the central figure. The faster and more obvious is the realisation of those feet of clay, the less likely the transition and growth. Mormonism and scientology survive, despite the evidence, because the of the brutal methods of those organisers in suppressing the con-man basis of their founder.\n\nSecond, if you track the time history, the growth of christianity, you tend to track back to Saul/Paul and the 60+ CE timeframe, not 30CE. So yes, the realistic founder was Saul/Paul; part organiser, part con-man on the make, looking to want a piece of the action and accreting mythos which he could employ. The 'stories' he used were probably in circulation, he just changed the names to give it a central figure from 'over there'. Who wrote the gospels? Well I think its pretty well understood they were fanfic to round out Saul/Paul's stories, and thus invented later.  \n\nLast, you put far to much store by a group of academics, cloistered in a university, who don't even really comprehend the society they are in, let alone the societies of 1000 years ago. Too much projection of the university and its squabbles as a model for the world. \n\nI've no doubt a christian would dismiss - the unreasoning faith is why they believe after all. I would, however, suggest that on the balance of probabilities there was no historical 'jesus' figure that could reasonable be attributed any of the characteristics of the biblical figure - more a Sherlock Holmes figure being used as a character in a set of stories. Frankly it fits much better, even if you, or Fincke, personally don't like it. I'd contend, rather, that it's you clinging to the idea of the wandering madman called jesus that needs to change their approach with a little self-reflection.

Think of it kind of like Mardi Gras but more Dutch. \n\nSo it was pretty awesome that on the week that me and some friends decided to go to Amsterdam it was this huge giant party. We decided to hit up a dance club in the center district of the city. We get some drinks, bop our heads to the beat, etc, when this super hot guy comes up to me at the bar and starts making small talk. He can tell we're from America, has a thing for American guys, etc, so he buys me a drink and we talk some more. \n\nWe eventually go out to the dance floor where some heavy grinding starts, we drink more, things get sloppier and we're really going at it. We're making out while we dance, and I can feel how hard he is when he grinds up against me. \n\nEventually he reaches down into my pants and asks if I'd like to go further with him. I tell him that my hotel room is just a few blocks down and we can get some privacy. But no. He wants to do it right there in the club. \n\nNow, I've always been a pretty shy person and have never done anything this crazy, but I'm in another country, there's this huge festival going on, so I figure what the hell. I tell him to get to it. Before we escalate things, though, he tells me that he needs just one thing: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" \n\nIt was at that moment I realized that he was in fact about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolothic era. I tell him, \"God damn it Loch Ness monster, I don't have no tree fiddy!\" \n\nHe let me be, and we enjoyed the rest of the time at the festival.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382322606", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

She leaned forward, the scent of her spicy perfume washing over me, intoxicating me.  She took my head in her hands and pushed my face against her breasts, grinding their softness on my cheeks.  A soft gasp escaped her full lips, and she drew back, her hands trailing down to my belt where they moved like magic, unfastening the buckle and opening the front of my pants.  She arched forward again, her crimson lips pressing against mine, her tongue slipping into my mouth.  Lifting herself slightly, she reached behind me, picking up the stack of papers I was supposed to have vetted the day before.\n\n\"Why are these still here?\" she whispered into my ear \"They should be ready to be sent out now.\"\n\n'Guuhhhh....\"  I replied.  She smiled, her eyes glittering with intent,  \"Naughty boy.  Now I'll have to punish you.\"\n\nLong story short, it turned out she was the Loch Ness Monster, and I almost gave her tree-fiddy.

{"body": "We through selective breeding, could force desired characteristics to be passed on more frequently than our offspring. As of right now the only traits that make an individual unlikely to reproduce are genetic disorders and predispositions to unhealthy immune systems or other health conditions. All other traits that prevent humans from passing on genetic information in first world societies aren't easily controlled or accounted for so there isn't much we can do about those (Attractiveness to the opposite sex, Premature deaths through accidents, Suicides, homicides, etc.)\n\nBasically we would need to selectively breed for traits that would better enable us as a species to fly. There are several huge problems to overcome, we are very heavy, we have no method of aerial locomotion, and have a high volume to surface area ratio. Note that this drastic of a change would probably take millions of years. The first thing would be to remove individuals with the densest bones from the gene pool. Eventually by only allowing humans with the least dense bones to breed, and pass on their genes, humans as a whole would have much lighter (and probably more fragile) bones. Thus cutting down some weight. Next we would need to selectively breed for short legs. Human legs are very heavy, having the largest bones and muscle mass of anywhere in the body. \n\nFor humans to fly, muscular legs are a hindrance rather than a boon. Selectively breeding for shorter and less muscular legs would be the next process. By now it's been millions of years and we still aren't close to flying. All we've achieved is the majority of humanity consisting of lightweight short legged hominids.\n\nNext, we need to breed for longer arms and fingers, (assuming we would be trying to evolve wings to fly) these would provide the basis for wings. At the same time we would be removing individuals with the most muscular arms from the gene pool, by not allowing them to have offspring. While at the same time, favoring those with powerful pectorals, deltoids and back muscles (as these are used for flapping, not muscles on the arms. \n\nThe next problem is the most difficult to overcome and would probably take the most time. Actually evolving wings. To do this we would need to give massive breeding priority to those with genetic mutations that increased the surface area of their arms. Allowing them to generate lift in order to fly. \n\nThen once the population had extremely long arms and fingers, with massive surface areas, we would need to continue to cut our weight in many areas. Smaller livers would be needed, thiner skulls etc.\n\nAt this point it's been tens of millions of years and we might be able to fly. Who the hell actually knows. I've just been talking shit. Or we could just manipulate our genes using bat DNA to develop those traits in just a couple of generations.

{"body": "&gt; How do you think globalization and the shift from a type 0 civilization to a type 1 civilization will play into all of this?\n\nI don't think that the [Kardashev scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) is a tremendously useful criterion, save as pessimistic goalposts.  By the time we reach type-1 status, then these problems will necessarily have come to some kind of equilibrium (if not exactly \"solved\"), but that's like saying that water at 150 degrees isn't frozen.\n\nThe labour disruptions we see nowadays aren't energy-based.  Telecommunications, for example, enables all kinds of automation and outsourcing, but it happens *today* without order-of-magnitude jumps in energy requirements.\n\nBut with the advent of globalization and free(-ish) trade, I think it isn't possible to look at countries in total isolation.  Until multiple-order-of-magnitude differences in wages settle out, we'll see a global imbalance of trade that's reminiscent of old-style colonialism: high-value goods (and increasingly IP) get exported to the periphery while high-labour goods and raw materials are imported.  That's not necessarily a good thing, as historic colonialism generally didn't end well.\n\nThe losers of this system are poor-nation capital (out-competed by wealthy capital, especially if we also allow for wealth to influence regional politics) and wealthy-nation labour, made redundant outside of labour-poor, high-value industries.\n\nSpeaking from our privileged positions, we're caring about the plight of labour in wealthy nations, so I'll stick with that for now.  I think there are three possible medium-term outcomes:\n\n* First, wealthy nations abandon laissez-faire domestic economics, adopting explicitly redistributive policies.  We see that somewhat in some European countries (notably Norway with high resource-royalties for oil revenue, and now Switzerland with the national debate over minimum income).  Of course, this policy also repudiates the \"American Dream,\" acknowledging that most people *won't* and *shouldn't* make it really big on their own.\n* Second, wealthy nations turn into poor nations.  This would be possible if wages and standards of living *objectively* fall for the bulk of the population.  Short of massive political disruption this usually doesn't happen, since people tend to be attached to their expectations, but it might happen on a gradual basis.  Arguably, this is the plight of young workers in the United States nowadays, in that a \"typical\" career is both insecure and low-wage.\n* Third, wealthy nations shrink.  There's no issue with a shortage of jobs if there's an equal shortage of people to fill them, and low population density means low service demand means less service-automation impetus.  The downside, of course, is that this is a very, very slow process (barring violence or disaster, which are both horrific), which might not be adaptable enough to effectively equilibrate an economy (meaning solutions #1 and #2 may still show up); there are also tremendous transient demographic shifts intrinsic to the process.  Japan is flirting with this option, and it's caused its own problems.\n\nI don't think that nations need to *deliberately* target any of these outcomes, but the failure of policymakers to think of the problems invites social disaster.  For example, if the US really is heading towards #2 (where the lower and middle classes continue to not experience real wage growth), then the leaks in the patchwork of social benefits will keep getting bigger.  Eventually, large groups of economically-disenfranchised people [get uneasy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army), and that doesn't tend to end well.\n\n(Edit: adding)\n\n&gt;  do you think it's necessary for us to become a type 1 civilization first?\n\nI don't think that type 1 will be as big of a qualitative shift as many think.\n\nRealize that the economy is regulated by some number of *binding constraints*.  In the paleolithic era, that was universally the (variable) availability of food; after agricultural development that shifted to arable land, crop suitability, and beneficial weather (on the whole more stable).  That era persisted for a *very long time*, but was finally alleviated by industrial agriculture; the binding constraint shifted to hard resource availability (and labour to process it) and a nation's utility could be measured in tonnes of steel.\n\nNowadays, I think we're shifting away from \"stuff\" (or at least \"volumes of stuff\") as a measurable thing, and instead our binding constraint is *design* (and consequently information).\n\nAfter all, your cell phone uses *less* silicon than a 1990 desktop computer, but it's far more powerful -- because of design and technique rather than a bulk constraint.  The story of the 21st century might be one of humanity doing \"better\" rather than \"more,\" which dovetails with the above issues since \"warm body labour\" is nowhere near a constraint.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382375491", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's my standard response;\n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing. I'd also add that there isn't a single tangible benefit that religion provides that can not be attained through secular means.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382457960", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Thursday night was to be the night of the love cruise. The air was warm and there was a slight breeze that was cool enough to visibly harden his girlfriend's under her thin shirt. He revved up the engine and began speed towards an isolated part of the lake where they could have their fun and not worry about being charged with indecent exposure. He looked truly manly as he steered that boat shirtless and his beer gut and moobs cast an impressive shadow against the moonlight. Suddenly out of the corner of his eye, he saw a something move ion a distant shore and he quickly sought another glance. Forgetting his objective of motorboating while motorboating, he steered towards the shore in search of the mysterious figure. Suddenly he felt large waves crash against the bow. His girlfriend was immediately swept overboard and subsequently drowned because she had the swimming skills of an African orphan.

{"body": "Yea the names are very off-putting. There are many early childhood television programs that seem to follow that naming convention model. At least here in the US (don't want to make assumptions) but the major use of 'made up' words that sound silly are often viewed as baby-talk. The names are also somewhat hard to follow in any meaningful way. Though I'm sure after a few drinks, the words could be a source of entertainment, but the barrier of entry to older audiences would surely hurt the chances of it being played in that context.\n\nNow going straight from the top of my head, I'd attempt to keep your basis idea of using household items to lure the creatures; much akin to the diets of creatures from [Ahhh! Real Monsters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaahh!!!_Real_Monsters). Blending in a bit of safari motif, it would be cool to travel the world trying to capture different closet monsters from different regions. North America would have stuff like Sasquatch, Scotland has Nessie, Central America has chupacabra. Mixed in with the \"big names\" would be alot of more generic and country neutral monsters to serve as bread and butter. \n\nAesthetic wise you can keep the style you currently have (I like it personally) as it reminds me of the animated credit sequences that Pixar likes to end their films with. The designs of the creatures should be a mixture of frightening and adorable, much like a real zoo. The lions are big and scary, but the penguins are there for the kids. Maybe playing with that scary vs cute idea can lead to some gameplay ideas.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay, putting more emphasis on the Zoo couldn't hurt either. Looking at your core card list, it looks to only be made up of creatures. The first time we seeing anything related to the actual Zoo itself beyond the name is in your expansion cards. Buying things like specialized pens, food carts, mascots, and staff like keepers could go a long way to pulling in an older audience as 'tycoon' games are popular.\n\nThe idea of a monster zoo is a fantastic playground for ideas, and your mechanics look solid enough.

{"body": "I started by doing what gabeoldwell said. Only money invested was 30 cents to become premium. Now I have a 3.5 buds unusual.\n\nMy best friend was www.trade.tf/deals (although at the time you didn't need to be premium to see live deals).\n\nA couple of tips: weapons are (usually) much easier to sell than cosmetics. Stranges that are used mostly, don't expect to sell a nessie 9 iron or a strange fireax very quickly, but if you can find a strange scattergun or strange axetinguisher for .66 less than its normal price, then you'll probably resell it almost instantly.\n\nDon't waste your time with Genuine, Vintage or painted items. This is as a general rule. If it's a cheap item, like a vintage Kritz going for .33, then sure, you can probably resell it for more. If it's a Vintage Hounddog going for 2 keys, it's going to take weeks probably. Even more if painted, do not buy items that seem to have a big profit margin if this is because they are both vintage/genuine AND painted. I've made that mistake more than I care to admit.\n\nSome items are a sure sell: Buy a Hi5 for a key, you can make a ref profit. Same with the Kringle collection, and there's a few more.\n\nTry not to buy keys for metal. If you manage to find an item that costs a key for 5 ref, you can then resell for a key, so you got a key for 5 ref.\n\nBe firm, and polite. There's LOTS of deals and sellers/buyers out there, if someone says something like \"wow 10 people added me and someone is offering .xx above the price I posted, can you top that?\". Just say \"no thanks\" and move on (unless you really want the item for yourself, of course). Same with buyers offering stuff instead of metal, although this can very often be beneficial to you.\n\nAt first, if it's too much to keep track of, just make sure you're making a profit, or in the worst case, selling at the same price. For this, I made a simple spreadsheet: Item name, buying price, selling price.\n\nLearn to recognize scammers: private backpacks, extreme overpays, wanting to pay with paypal and refusing to do steam wallet/buying buds. Anything that seems shady is worth stopping and thinking about it. Never rush a deal, unless it's a straight up simple thing and the trader is in a rush because he's quickselling. But I wouldn't worry much about scamming for now, until you reach the point of a Bills Hat or if you happen to get a Salvaged Crate.\n\nThat's all I can think for now, hope it helps, and good luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382485858", "subreddit": "NewToTF2", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I consider myself a skeptic and strive to have as few false beliefs as possible. It's important to me that what I know (or think I know) is based on evidence and in general, *good* reasons. Because of this, I reject all sorts of things that have yet to be shown to be reasonably true, things like ghosts and bigfoot and alien abductions and the Loch Ness monster and... gods. If I were shown sufficient evidence for any of these things, I would likely change my view regarding their non-existence.\n\nWhile I'm not a parent (yet), I do intend to pass on this skeptical nature to my offspring. So if my son or daughter announced that they were interested in Christianity, I'd simply discuss it with them and ask them questions like \"*how* do you know that Jesus existed?\" This would begin a discussion about the historicity of Jesus, for example, and would offer an opportunity to critically examine whether we have good reasons for believing what it says in the bible.\n\nI was raised in such a way that there was no one specific faith in the home. Growing up, I had a mashup of Protestantism, Buddhism, and New-Age spiritual ideas. I learned about the parables in the bible, about things like the Good Samaritan, but I also was introduced to the concept of past lives and karma. My parents gave me a book when I was about 8 that, among other things, told me that I had psychokinetic powers and that I could move objects with my mind if I tried hard enough. Needless to say, it took a few years to sort out all those conflicting ideas. I did, for a while, try very hard to move a party balloon with The Force. I guess I didn't try hard enough.\n\nI began asking myself questions. Questions like \"what are the criteria for entering heaven?\" Do non-believers still go if they are good people? Do non-Christians go to *their* afterlives while Christians go to heaven? How did karma and past lives fit in with the idea of going to heaven and spending eternity with Jesus? If we have fossils of human ancestors going back millions of years, then that causes problems for the story of Adam and Eve. And so on. These were questions that I asked myself without any prompting from parents or other adults (as far as I can recall). It didn't help that I grew up during Star Trek:TNG's original run from '87 to '94 and technology and the scientific method were big influences early on.\n\nIn the end, it was being introduced to so many different religious ideas and evaluating them simultaneously that eventually made me realise that the only way for anything to make sense was if these religions were largely false and man-made. Even Richard Dawkins has said that he would applaud an elementary-level comparative religion course in schools for kids, perhaps beginning around age 7 or 8. So consider that if you expose a child to *many* different religious ideas, you'll likely see the child reject them.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382487071", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, for starters, iOS has completely changed let alone the jb community. \n\nIn terms of how jbing has evolved, well, it's gotten much harder to do. (Going to explain things as simple as possible). To Jailbreak, we need to somehow modify the code to inject the new code. To do this, an injection vector is needed. BootROM level exploits are only in select idevices (this was a \"hardware\" jailbreak - with the newer 3GS and up, apple fixed this. Jailbreaks like winpwn, pwnageTool, 24kpwn were bootROM level). Jailbreak.me was an exploit vector that used a vulnerability in...PDF (I think) to corrupt memory in order to get access to the...kernel (I think) in order to modify it. Shsh tickets were used in some idevices, but apple switched things to APTickets making shsh blobs useless on a5+ devices. Now, there's an open source jailbreak called opensn0w (limited to i4's only I think).  Some devs got trigger happy and announced the release of their jailbreak in x amount of days (called SHAtter1 or something like that). This break dealt with an exploit in the hashing algorithm. I think it was geohot who released his jb first (limera1n) before chronicdev(I think) release SHATTER. They ended up never releasing it (i think) because apple had patched it and limera1n was out). Now, everyone and their mother is making a jb. Not sure how because its fuarking hard. I  understand the stuff but doubt I'd be able to do it on my own. /u/winocm_the_programme is 16 (I think) and he's ported a kernel to an IPhone 4 (I think - and THAT is really REALLY fuarking hard to do). Chronicdev, ih8sn0w, geohot, have all made programs. Limera1n, sn0wbreeze, greenp0ison, the list goes on. There are the original devs still around (musclenerd, pod2g, and more). /u/saurik is an active member here (he made cydia). AND, there's been a bunch of trolls praying off the people who don't know better \"buy our jailbreak! Only tree fiddy!\"  There's an ongoing joke now.. Something like \"R U FAKR\" because some fake JB group (there are so many, idk who anymore...DreamJB?) got everyone's hopes up but then the release didn't work. Just recently, here in r/jb, there was AllineJB...\n \nIn terms of jb-ing, better tweaks for apps. But it's all pretty similar to what was around in the past. As in, new tweaks are created if there seems to be a demand for them. Other tweaks have seen improvements because they were so popular.

It was an earlier in the morning delivery, and I stopped by this house at around 10:30 am. Nothing out of the ordinary so far. I grab the package, take it to the door, and do the whole standard \"knock and wait\". Yes, we do actually wait for a full 90 seconds before going back to the truck. Well, I made it to 90, and as I turn to leave, the door creeks open.\n\nAs I noticed this, I turned around and said \"Oh, ma'am, good morning. I have a delivery for you.\" She opened the door fully, and it turns out she was just in a towel. She was in her early 30's, I would guess, but she wasn't that attractive. I mean, the towel was wrapped up around her body, and it's not like she looked overweight, but her face was clocking in at around a 6/10. Whatever.\n\nShe says \"Oh, I just got out of the shower. Can you leave it there?\" But I actually can't. Company policy won't let us leave a package without a signature, so I tell her that. She just sighed and said \"Fine, I'll sign for it.\" And as I hand her the pen and clipboard, her towel drops.\n\nI just said \"Oh, shit\", and it took her a moment to register what just happens. After a couple seconds, she dropped the pen, screamed, and slammed the door in my face. I had no idea what to do. Should I wait for her? Should I leave the notice and just come back tomorrow? I eventually decided to just wait another 90 seconds and pretend that never happened.\n\nShe did eventually come back to the door in sweatpants and a tank-top, and she was blushing like crazy. I thought it was pretty funny how flustered she was, but she eventually signed for the package and took it inside.\n\nAs I was going, I said back \"Is there anything else you need from me today?\" I thought it was being funny, but now that I think about it, it probably just sounded stupid and awkward. Still, she seemed not to notice. She just smirked and said \"I need about tree fidy.\" That's when I noticed that this girl was actually a three story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.

I have no idea why, just one of those things you get in your head for whatever reason. I had just gotten off of work and was dirty, sweaty stinky. I probably shouldn't have gone to the dealership like that, but I was young. Anyway I find it, the car I've always wanted. But I couldn't find a sales person in sight, I end up walking around for a minute and finally find 2 guys; almost hiding in the back. Like they were hoping I wouldn't find them. I asked if I could test drive xc90. One guy actually laughed at me. They refused to even hear me out. I was so pissed, I went to the bank the next day and took out the money in cash and returned to the dealership,in the same clothes I wore the day before, ready to show those fuckers what was what. Unfortunately, the dealer who laughed at me was busy, but I did make sure to position myself real close to him so he could hear me. So me and the delaer are going back and forth for a bit, and I tell him that I think I'm ready to buy, not only that, but I'll be paying cash. You should have seen the look on the other guys face. Priceless. So we go back to the office to hammer out the details and sign the papers. The delaer says \"I heard about you from the other salesmen this afternoon. \" I was kinda surprised. I asked him if I really smelled that bad. He said that yeah I did. The entire time the salesmen from the previous day kept walking by the office and you could see how upset he was. The dealer said\" I'm sorry that guys a dick. But thanks for letting us serve you.\" I told him about how bad I always wanted a volvo and how upset I was when I got turned away.  The dealer actually threw in a bunch of free stuff. He then was about to hand me my keys, when he said \" I just need one more thing from you.\" I said \"the paper work is signed, what else do you need?\" He said \"I need about tree fiddy\" now it was about this time that I noticed the salesmen was a 3 story creature from the paleoithic era. I was pissed. \"Dammit monster I ain't giving you no tree fiddy. Stop following me! I ran out as fast as I could. I never did get that volvo.\nTL; DR - I waneted a volvo.

{"body": "My worst consensual sex story took place a long time ago. It was highschool, I was the kid who put more emphasis on school than I did on social workings and thus I really only had two or three good friends. Ergo, we were pretty much nerds. Regardless, I had my eye on this girl named Emily. Now, she isn't the storybook \"cheerleader miss popular\", she was just an average girl that I thought was quite pretty (and rather attractive).\n\nSo to begin, in senior year I ended up in a simple history class with her. I had taken a precursor class similar to that one before so it wasn't all that difficult, and after we got our first test back guess who was struggling? None other than dream girl numero uno, Emily. I told the teacher I would be open to tutoring anyone who was struggling, and the oblivious Mr. Almond referred me to her the very next day. I was standing putting my books in my locker when she walked up to me, but she walked up behind the open door and I didn't see her. I closed the door and she was right there and I screamed and sort of half lunge jumped. Unfortunately I knocked her water bottle right into her face and it pretty much soaked her.\n\nI apologized profusely and she couldn't stop laughing. My fuck up worked, I was in. We set up a time to study, and to my surprise, she volunteered her house. We would go over every Monday and every other Wednesday night to review, often alone in her room. Of course over this time I tried subtly flirting and I started to get hints she would flirt back. After about two months of this, it heat its peak. It's climax.\n\nIt was a Wednesday night, we were alone upstairs as her parents had gone somewhere, I think maybe to dinner but I don't quite remember. We were reviewing the roman town of Corinth when we took a study break. \"Hey I need your opinion on something!\" She said. \n\n(Note, this was second semester and hot weather was approaching) \n\"Can you tell me if this bathing suit looks good?\"\n\nNow I know what you are thinking, no fucking way in hell right? Same thing I thought. My 18 year old body trembled at the thought of her beautiful curving body scantily clad. \"Sure!\" I mustered, approvingly. She grabbed one from her closet and went to the bathroom to change. I awkwardly stood up and began just gazing around the room, looking at some pictures. Then the door opened, slowly. I turned and there she was, in a tiny red bikini. Holy fuck! We made eye contact for what felt like five minutes until she walked forward and pushed me down on the bed.\n\nWe started kissing, and I had basically no idea what I was doing but it was certainly working. That's when she, now on top of me, sat up and looked at me. \"Do you want to have some fun?\" She smirked. \n\"Do you?\" I (almost smoothly) attempted in return.\n\"Yes, but I'm going to need one thing first.\"\n\"What's that?\" I said, body trembling.\n\"Well, I'm going to need about tree-fiddy.\"\nIt was then that I realized Emily wasn't a girl but an 8 story tall leviathan from the Paleozoic era! That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! How could I have let this happen?\n\nMy friends asked me the next day how it went and I could only shrug and say maybe next time. I had just come so close to steaming hot sex but I had came up a little short. It haunts me to this day.\n\ntl;dr was a nerd in highschool, tutored my mega crush, came super close to everything but had a terrible awkward meltdown mid session.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382592836", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright but this one is pretty bad lol. I was waiting in a pretty slow night at a local restaurant and an already awkward looking couple walked in (they were holding hands that's how I knew). The woman was about 6 foot 2 and probably almost 40 years old. The guy... looked about 19 and was at least 8 inches shorter. I had to hold back some giggles when I went over but I asked them how they were doing and what they'd like to drink. The woman took a second but ordered  a daiquiri. After she ordered there was an extended pause, and then she ordered a cole for the guy; he never said a word. \n\nSo I come back with their drinks and they both look a little unsettled. They weren't looking at their menus but they asked for some more time. I obliged and retreated back to the kitchen to check on another table's order. About 2 minutes later I hear loud tire screeches outside and then see an older man running to the door. He barges in and looks around sporadically. He looks right at the couple in question and storms to the table. He screams \"what the fuck!?\"  And stares at the woman while she sits there quietly. The young guy got up and ran towards the back exit and the older guy runs right after him. I'm assuming the chase went on for a little while because they weren't anywhere to be seen after several minutes had passed. I walked over to the table and the woman calmly asked what she owed. I said about tree fiddy, and that's when I realized I was actually a 400 foot tall mythological sea monster.

{"body": "Alright, let's get a real-world comparison going here. Folklore from all over the world mentions all sorts of fantastical creatures, like unicorns and giants and goblins and bigfoot and the loch ness monster and, yes, even dragons. And if any of those appeared out of the blue and waved hello, we'd all be flipping our shit. And as far as our own history's concerned, we've got a lot of records implying that bigfoot and the loch ness monster exist. Photos and personal accounts and eyewitnesses and whatnot. \n\nNow, we all know that bigfoot and nessy don't exist, and that clearly all the photos are fake, and the people who saw them are mistaken or lying, and all that common knowledge stuff. Back to Skyrim, as far as anyone's concerned in that time period, the same holds true for dragons; of course they can't really exist even if people say they do, they're mythical creatures, and mythical creatures aren't real.\n\nSo Barbas referred to two things: The first was the dragons, until now widely accepted to be fictional creatures, and now people are flipping their shit because a few popped out of the woodwork to say hello. The second was the khajiit, which are clearly a real thing, but nords still think they're weird and stuff. \n\nBy comparison, we have a lot of things in real life that are frankly bizarre, but we take them in stride because we know they're real. We have fish that electrocute other fish, we have trees that reproduce by violently exploding, and we have birds that imitate human speech.\n\nSo, let's think of a hypothetical, real-life scenario. Through some bizarre turn of events, Australia is overrun by murderous unicorns. You go to Mexico to battle against the unicorn menace, and during the hunt, you bump into some sort of local parrot, and it immitates some stuff you say for about ten minutes, and flies off. The next day, you encounter a talking dog, and you're genuinely surprised by the turn of events. The dog asks you, \"Australia is now host to vicious, horned horses and talking birds, and you're surprised by me? Yes, I just talked, and am continuing to do so.\" Is the comment really out of place?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382603968", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was working as a waiter a few years back, and the following is my personal 'favourite' (if thats the right term for it) awkward situation:\n\nI was working in a reasonable mid-range restaurant in one of the tourist spots in London. Nothing too fancy, but because of the location, prices were higher than what you would pay for the same elsewhere. Classic London, unfortunately.\n\nA couple are sat in my section, and while I'm taking their drinks order it becomes clear that this is an early-stages date. Not a first-date, still-basically strangers situation, but a 3rd-date getting-to-know-you-better situation. They were still a bit cautious and not completely relaxed around each other (as in, not in the same way that good friends or an 'established' couple are), but they were clearly smitten and flirting. It was quite cute, and I always enjoyed these sort of customers (especially as the guys would generally tip well to show-off a bit to their dates).\n\nThe girl was pretty cute, with a girl-next-door thing going on. Attractive, but in an accessible way, if that makes sense. She had obviously spent a lot of time on her hair that night, and it looked really good (relevant later). She looked the sort to be rather well-off, but unlike a lot of people I encountered in this area (men and women), she didn't give off a 'I'm better and posher than you' vibe. Obviously had nothing to prove and was very pleasant to me.\n\nThe guy, on the other hand, was obviously a bit of a city-boy type. Fancied himself as a Johnny Big Bollocks, and he very obviously did have something to prove. You can spot his type from miles off - they just seem to exude a type of slimy arrogance. He was not very nice to me; didn't say please/thank you, didn't look me in the eye, very dismissive etc...\n\nAs their date went on, you could see the woman getting gradually more annoyed with how he was speaking to me. She was always engaging, and to me it seemed obvious she was trying to make a point to him. He remained completely oblivious and got ruder as he made his way through £5 bottles of imported beers.\n\nAs his rudeness increased, so did his boasts - about how important he is, how much money he turns over for his company, and how much money he has. For her part, she still seemed pretty smitten but I think the shine was coming off him somewhat. He must have hidden this side of him quite well in any previous dates, or she was having a bad day, as she was definitely not smiling as much as when they walked in.\n\nEither way, it gets to the end of their meal, and they ask for the bill. He even *snaps his fingers* to get my attention, like I'm some sort of goddamn slave. This is INFURIATING, as anyone who has worked in customer service can appreciate! As I come over, I hear him saying something to the effect of 'Its on me; don't worry, you can thank me later' to his lady-friend, who just rolls her eyes.\n\nHe thrusts his Amex Double-Gold-Super-Platinum card at me, I pop it in the reader and it does its thing. He puts his PIN number in and... Nope! Card declined. I apologise and we try again, in case its some sort of mechanical error (and I don't want to ruin his facade and jepordise my tip). Nope, still not working! I'm taking a lot of pleasure in this now, but he's keeping his cool. 'I just booked a holiday this morning for me and a couple of mates, they've probably locked my account just in case as it was a BIG spend.' Dick. Its ok, he has cash.\n\nHe has a look at the bill and whips out his wallet and pulls out his cash. Looks like its everything he has in there (someone didn't pay attention to how much he ordered...) and he has a quick count. His face starts to drop and he goes quiet.\n\n'Sorry babe, I'm just a little short, could you lend me a little cash and I'll pay you back on our next date?'\n\nShe's fine with it and pulls out her purse, 'How much do you need?'\n\n'About tree-fiddy!'\n\nAt this point we realise she's been on a date with the slimy 50 foot Loch Ness Monster himself, and she runs out of the restaurant shouting 'GODDAMIT I AINT GIVING YOU NO TREE-FIDDY'.\n\nI didn't get a tip.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382611096", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;on logical grounds alone...\n\n*Were* it possible to definitively prove if God exists or does not, I am certain some thinker would have done it in the last 3000 years. \n\n&gt;...you are certain a being with absolute knowledge doesn't existence anywhere in or outside the universe\n\nThat is a slippery argument. Atheists don't make any claims regarding the divine, theists do. Theists claim that a God exists. By and large atheists find that this claim has not been substantiated. Again, atheists are not making the positive claim here. There is not default belief in God and it isn't a proposition that needs disproving. Quite the contrary, a believer is making the claim that a God exists and [bears the burden of proving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof#Holder_of_the_burden) that this is a true assertion.\n\n&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof#Holder_of_the_burden\n\n&gt;So you dislike the term belief based not on it's definition but on what it is perceived to be based on your cultural experience. Christians \"believe\" things so therefore no logical person could believe things too.\n\n&gt;you are claiming absolute knowledge. \n\nHere you are using belief and knowledge interchangeably when again I must argue that they are 2 different concepts. Knowledge and belief are not equivalent.\n\nAlso this gets into the case of **knowledge**. How does someone *know* anything? Atheism most certainly is not the claim that one *knows* with absolute certainty that a God does not exist.\n\nMany hold the belief that it is impossible for any human being to know anything with absolute certainty. While philosophically this is not an unreasonable position. However the only 2 positions wrt belief it permits are *agnostic atheism and agnostic theism*. So in terms of the real world and how we use language I find it is  not a useful proposition.\n\n\nIt is impossible to disprove the [invisble pink unicorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn) or [Dragon in my Garage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJRy3Kl_z5E) or [Russell's Teapot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot#Russell.27s_argument) propositions. Yet we don't assume that they are automatically true until disproven. In this case the person making the claim must make their case and demonstrate through some means that such a thing exists.\n\nIn my estimation we know things exist because we have proof, evidence or are able to infer the existence of such a thing based on the concrete. This is how we understand reality and decide what is real.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster\n and levitation are not real. I have seen no evidence or proof that any of these exist. This is a reasonable conclusion to arrive at based on what we know about how the world works. Presented with incontrovertible proof of any of these existing it would be likewise reasonable to re-examine ones position and decide that they do.\n\nBased on this procedure above for determining if something is real or not I have concluded that God is not real. If I am presented tomorrow with evidence to the contrary I will examine such evidence and amend what I find to be true if and as required.\n\n\n*As an aside* I rather like how /u/rhubarbs articulated how we know things. Note that it is from an /r/atheism thread with 0 upvotes, but 93 comments. I only ever browse /new over there that's where the good discussion and content is.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g6hdk/i_disagree_with_ratheisms_goto_diagram_for/cah8oen", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382626539", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I'm certain you can see a difference between a child deliberately disobeying their parents to their face and a child peeking behind the curtain to determine the source.\n\nAgain, a terrible, horrible analogy. No one is saying you'd be disobeying god. Merely testing him. And you would be. Of course it's an indeterminate source, you have no proof that it's god. You also have no proof of any of the crap written about in the bible, but the bible says you should not test god, the bible speaks of faith. And so many Christians, yourself included, take it all on faith.\n\nExcept for this voice. This voice, you need to test. You need a sign that it's actually god. \n\n&gt;Based on your statements, it seems that you're making the case that Christians should follow literally anything that ever claims to be God or else they're acting in deliberate defiance to their Creator. You're needlessly eliminating a broad swath of Biblically-supported middle ground.\n\nNope. See if you can follow this. I'm saying Christians should be consistent. Either question the bible as much as you question the voice, or question the voice as much as you question the bible. You have two different standards of proof. I'm saying live your life consistently and with ONE standard.\n\n&gt;Disembodied voices require different types of evidence than historical texts.\n\nSure. But there's no evidence that substantiates the bible anyway. Not any more than there is for any other religion/supernatural phenomenon. You can find eyewitness accounts of bigfoot, Santa Claus, the Loch Ness monster, Buddha, Mohammed. Whatever, none of those things have a shred of corroborating evidence. And any real attempts to verify them scientifically fall completely flat. \n\nAgain it's about consistency. You are incredibly skeptical of the claims of other religions to be the one true religion with the true god(s), but not for your own which you just accept wholesale.\n\n&gt;but these types of guesses are not accurate, provable, or conducive to the discussion.\n\nOkay, where were you born and raised? \n\n&gt;There are people all over the world who hold to Christianity. I'm surprised you'd assert otherwise.\n\nCompletely missed the point. Again. People from all over the world also come to Judaism, \nIslam, and various eastern religions. Are those religions the truth now as well? All at the same time? People from all over the world come to atheism as well. Is that the truth now? The point was that there is an absolute consensus on scientific theories. Regardless of where you are in the world, evolution is evolution and it is the goddamn truth. It is objectively true. It doesn't matter if you were born and raised in a different culture, it will still be true.\n\nThe same cannot be said for religion. People born into a predominantly muslim culture will absolutely believe that Islam is the truth for the very same reason you think Christianity is the truth. That's because there's no objectivity there. It's all just stuff you're making up. You can't run any tests or experiments to verify either religion to see which is real and which is not. \n\n&gt;The concept of \"the Law,\" especially as Paul uses it in Romans, is pretty readily understood by people with a basic understanding of the theology contained in the New Testament.\n\nNo, you have one interpretation, other people have another. 7 years of Catholic school was enough for me. Don't even begin to pretend like it has a set in stone meaning. Everyone takes from it what they want. This is the problem with religion. Complete subjectivity masquerading as objectivity.\n\n&gt;Such a claim ignores the very serious theological issues inherent in the teachings of both of those groups about God\n\nRight, and Protestants and Catholics could hurl the very same objections at each other (and do). \"CATHOLICS WORSHIP THE SAINTS AND MARY. THAT IS COMPLETELY UNCHRISTIAN.\" \"PROTESTANTS IGNORE JESUS' COMMAND THAT ESTABLISHED THE PAPACY AND THE CHURCH.\" \n\nI would consider those major theological issues. Shit, I consider those fundamental theological issues. In a religion where it's said you have only one god and should worship no false idols, an accusation that someone is worshiping false idols is a pretty huge claim. Likewise the assertion that you are ignoring the founding statement of the religion by Jesus himself establishing Peter as his \"first pope.\" \n\nBut, you all self-identify as Christian. You all use the same book. You all believe that god is the only true god and Jesus was his son and was sent to earth to save mankind and died for our sins. That is the foundation of Christianity. (Hey look it's in the name too!)

Atheism is not a claim that god doesn't exist, it's just the lack of belief in a god.\n\nLet me give you an example:\n\nAsk yourself if you currently believe that my mother's name is Donna.\n\nWould you say that you currently *hold the positive belief* that my mother's name **is** Donna?\n\nYou don't have any evidence suggesting that it is, do you? So, you wouldn't claim that it is, right? If someone asked \"Do you believe baalroo's mother's name is Donna?\" You would answer \"No.\" You don't really currently know the answer, and \"Donna\" is only one choice out of a nearly infinite number of possibilities.\n\nAt the same time, you probably also wouldn't go so far as to say that my mother's name *isn't* Donna either, would you? I mean, you don't know her name, so it *could* be, right? \n\nThis is how the question of gods work for most atheists. We don't *believe in* any gods. I don't personally go so far as to say gods *can't* exist, I'm just *not a theist* because I'm not convinced by the argument theists are making.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382659078", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "the car analogy sucked -- I'll give you that.  \n  \nYour entire concept above is flawed.  The intellectual superiority in which you present your perspective though is common among Christians and Muslims that I've discussed with.  The security of their *rightness* and the fact that me, the ignorant and naïve atheist is so flawed in my reasoning as to be childlike and woefully uneducated.  \n  \nThe key problem here is that in your worldview you cannot accept that a belief system does not exist.  For you reality to be true, and your superiority to hold its station you must re-work logic to fit into this model.  Lack of belief in God is itself a belief, a Faith, just as much as belief in God is a Faith and the two are equal, the opposite sides of the same coin.  This is wrong on all levels.  \n  \nThere is no credible evidence that any deity exists.  Therefore it is only logical to conclude that none do.  I conclude that no deity exists based on the absence of evidence.  I do not have to present *proof* of non-existence of this deity just as I do not have to present proof of the nonexistence of bigfoot, or unicorns, or the loch ness monster.  \n  \nThis logic statement does not ipso-facto mean I hold a belief in another scenario other than the one you adhere to.  It just simply means that I have no belief in any deity.  Really, that’s what it means.  It’s like the olds saying:  “I say what I mean, I mean what I say.”  If you want to present another scenario to determine if either of us holds a belief in that then we can address that on a scenario by scenario basis.  However, when one uses evidence based reasoning to determine what is most likely true and what is not this won’t work.  Belief doesn’t play any role in this.  Evidence does.  \n  \nNow, if you want to convince me that any of these exists then you must provide proof to me that they do.  The onus is on you to validate the existence, not me to validate the non-existence.  But, that’s only if you desire to attempt to convince me that it’s true.   My counter to people tends to be in the proclamation of Truth, as opposed to what they believe.  I have no issue with what people choose to believe, it’s their right to follow whatever path they desire.  \n  \nWhen I talk with Muslims in person and I tell them that I’ve read the Koran and still hold no belief in it or God some of them respond with that I did not understand it.  I need help to understand it so that I can recognize the Truth of it.  But this is that arrogance.  That in their belief they are so right that they cannot entertain any difference.  Muslims aren’t the only ones that fall prey to this.  \n  \nI was introduced to the Baha’i  Faith and read some of Baha’u’llahs’ writing.  When I spoke to a Baha’i about this they were shocked that I could read Baha’u’llah’s words and not instantly become a Baha’i.  I’ve also studied Buddhism and some Buddhists are amazed I’m not one.  In fact I've even talked to Buddhist that believe I actually **AM** a Buddhist but just in denial.  I think it’s human nature when someone holds a belief as the definition of their reality they cannot accept that someone cannot exist outside of that definition.  \n  \nThis is what I think we’re experiencing here in this exchange.  \n\n  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382663482", "subreddit": "islam", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

He's the kind who would bring you food if you asked, and deliver it to school and pretend to be the delivery guy.

{"body": "I think there's a much deeper distinction between \"mythology\" and \"religion\" than you allow for. For example, I would say that \"ancient Greek mythology\" and \"ancient Greek religion\" are two completely different things.\n\nLet's define what *ancient Greek religion* is first, considering the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece. The religion is the social construct around their conceptualizations of the metaphysics and cosmology. It is the temples, the prophets, the dogma, the history, and the cultural intricacies thereof. It is the societal outcomes and socioeconomic roles and impacts of the \"Second Estate\" of ancient Greece.\n\nGreek *mythology* is a completely different situation, generally leaning more toward *folklore* than faith. *The Illiad* and *The Odyssey* are epic poems of Greek mythology, yet they are little more than tangentially related to ancient Greek religion. This can also include actual historical events that have been exaggerated to the point of legend, such as the siege of Troy; it is something that we agree happened, but it is an event that is impressively veiled by the added mythology surrounding it.\n\nIn particular, the mythology gives us an insight not into how people worshiped, but the way they chose to see the world around them. In the labors of Herakles, the eponymous hero meets Atlas, the Titan who must hold up the sky on his shoulders for all eternity as punishment for betraying the Olympians. This doesn't necessarily imply that everyone in ancient Greece thought that the sky was held up by Atlas; I don't know of any ancient Greek expeditions searching for Atlas, Prometheus, or some other such beings. It simply uses something we take for granted as a narrative device to tell a story. What did the Greeks value? What did they fear would be the downfall of society? Were the gods beings of justice or of whimsy?\n\nIt's something we still see in recent history in things like American folklore, like Paul Bunyan, John Henry, or Champ. For people unfamiliar with these characters, here are some brief descriptions:\n\n* **Paul Bunyan** is a skilled lumberjack from North American folklore, most typically portrayed as a giant wearing stereotypical lumberjack attire of the late 19th century -- a red plaid shirt, denim trousers, and a cap. He is often accompanied by Babe, a giant blue ox.\n\n* **John Henry** was a black American man who worked \"steel-driver\" for the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway around 1870. While there are many variations of the legend, oral tradition generally agrees that John Henry was a laborer employed in the construction of the Big Bend Tunnel in West Virginia. One day, a businessman with a \"steam drill\" shows up, making it abundantly clear that the tunnel was being outsourced to an independent corporate venture. John Henry wagered that the machine couldn't do the work as well as good, old-fashioned elbow grease and challenged the drill owner to a race to see who could lay the most track in an afternoon. John Henry wins the race, but dies of exhaustion.\n\n* **Champ** is a sea serpent believed to dwell in the depths of Lake Champlain on the USA/Canada border. Although some tie the story to a 1609 sighting from Samuel de Champlain himself, no such account can be found before a newspaper clipping from 1970. This is pretty much the USA version of the Loch Ness monster, thought by believers to be a descendant of the plesieosaurus.\n\nDo people believe in these? Well sure, some do \"believe\" in such tales. In particular, John Henry and Paul Bunyan are generally described as Christian characters, and folksier versions of the John Henry story often incorporate God deciding to \"call John Henry home\" as his gift was being spent on those who did not value it. Does this mean that Christians factually believe the story of John Henry? \n\nMythology and religion are two completely different things. Mythology incorporates cosmology and projections of contemporary social values in narrative form. It is called this instead of \"folklore\" because they are no longer \"folk tales\" in any sense.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382743484", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\n\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\n\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

How?\n\nA few years ago I was doing my daily jog towards the city and back a few years ago I always went the short route, this is my story of me switching from the short route to the long route. So I was jogging and I had the sudden urge to go to the long route, I jog a bit longer than usual since I took the long route and I was kind of upset with myself because I was very tired.\n\nHowever, as I was nearing the end of the highway about to enter the city a BEAUTIFUL girl stops by me and says \"Hey, do you need a ride?\" I didn't really need a ride obvious but I was hoping that maybe I could get lucky with said girl, the only problem is is that since I had taken the longer route I was sweating more profusely and was a very disgusting human being.\n\nI get in, we talk a bit and asks if I want to go over to her place.. Well fuck yes I want to go over to her place! She drives us over there and I expect us to get out and small talk a bit, but nope, right when she stops the car in front of her house she tells me that she has a fetish for sweaty men (Really weird, I know), and so we start kissing a bit, after awhile we go inside and things really started really heating him, asking me to do things to her that I happily obliged in.\n\nA few hours later we're lying on her bed and I am amazed at my luck and what had just happened, she turns around looks me in the eye and says \"I need something else\", eagerly (I'm expecting a round two) I say \"What?\" and she replies \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was about this time I realized that this girl was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era, that goddamn loch ness monster had tricked me again.\n\nTL;DR:The longer route is always the better route", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382764333", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade in High School I took a psychology class, one of our assignments was to do an amateur psychology experiment on some people or someone we knew.\n\nThere was this girl in the class, lets call her Amy, Amy was a really good friend of mine but she was also fine as hell. At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward. And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.\n\nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward. So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\n\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, Tetra, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\"\n\nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"\n\nEveryone in the hall heard. The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.\n\nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.\n\nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"\n\nWat.\n\nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying.\nA few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.\n\nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.\n\nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered. I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.\n\n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her. Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"\n\nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her. She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.\n\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"\n\nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\" I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\n\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.\n\nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear. This is great.\n\nIt slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time. After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life.\n\nWe're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\"\n\nI personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time. Then she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\" The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\"\n\nShe says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.\n\nI stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.\n\nAs for my psychology project, I never did get it done, and instead dropped the class because of the terrible memories it had given me. To this day I hate reading about Psychology in general.\n\ntl;dr: Psychology experiments have forever ruined because of one stupid mistake.

Traffic info etc so they could have an extra \"sense\" so to speak, allowing them to drive faster and break more laws basically.\n\nWe'd have a 2 hour INSANE drive through the mountains. I had no idea cars could move that fast. 100 miles an hour on a 600 meter stretch of road, with a 90 degree turn ahead and a 200 feet drop right after that. Scary shit, but awesome as fuck.\n\nThen we arrived at some nice place to get a drink, everybody walk in, order what they want, have some talks and take a rest, and then just leave. Somebody paid for it. They probably just take turns to pay for everything. Nothing to them. During these dinners we'd talk about lots of stuff, most often cars. And they'd be like \"oh you see him? He's gonna get a mclaren mp4. And you see him? He just got this ferrari 458 spider.\" I'd ask them about cars, and most of the people also had lamborghini's next to the ferrari they were driving in that day. The dude I contacted to join the club actually had 5 ferraris and a porsche Carerra GT and another porsche and a maserati. Freaking insane shit. All of these people just looked pretty normal, and sometimes even just class-less.\n\nThen we went back to the city, through the tunnels this time, pretty sick shit. And met up at a multi-star hotel/restaurant. We'd sit in a private room, circular table. With like a 6-7 course dinner. Everybody talking loud about business and rich people stuff. My wineglass was empty? Some garçon would immediately just fill it up again.\n\nThen the dinner was over and we just left. Somebody had paid for it again.

{"body": "Part 2:\nBodyfat:\n\nThe calculator I use is http://scoobysworkshop.com/body-fat-calculator/, this site also has instructions on how to measure it.  This will take practice but I measure every week.  Other people prefer other time frames but I would suggest no more frequent than once a week.  Also there will be some fluctuations sometimes it will jump up for a week, so don’t over react to each measurement, and rather look at patterns.  If you gain a pound of bodyfat, then this means that you ate ~3500 calories over you caloric needs.  That means you are at about a 500 calorie surplus everyday lower it by 500.  The ratio is ~3500 calories: 1 pound of bodyfat.  \nAlso just because you gain 10 pounds and the calipers show no fat gain doesn’t mean you have super high testosterone levels it means it’s probably water.  Creatine or glycogen can do this or a combo of both, and sometimes things just vary.  Or you measured inaccurately and will be in for a surprise next week.  When taking these numbers don’t try to flatter yourself and squeeze harder this time so it looks like you have less millimeters of fat in that location.  Lying to yourself about these numbers doesn’t change your fat, it’s there whether you acknowledge it or not.  \n\nExceptions:\n\nAlong with gaining weight quickly comes losing weight quickly.  If you lose 10 pounds of what the calculator shows is lbm (lean body mass) doesn’t mean you lost 10 pounds of muscle.  It could once again be water or miscalculations.\n\nCardio:  \n\nPersonally I don’t do cardio very often although I did the couch to 5k program (part of it I did about half).  Cardio should not be too impacting on your weight training as long as you are eating enough which will be talked about later in the next couple of paragraphs.  But if you are doing high intensity programs for more advanced competitive leagues then you need to figure out what matters more to you, because this can impact weight training because of recovery.  \n\nRates of weight loss and gain:\n\nThe general consensus on the best rate to lose weight and gain weight would be 20% decrease on TDEE for losing weight.  Gaining weight on the other hand I prefer to test with calipers.  I eat a certain amount of calories for a couple weeks and check my bodyfat and adjust accordingly.  If I gain a pound of fat in two weeks that means I ate 250 extra each day. I would adjust accordingly to make sure I’m still gaining weight without gaining fat or at least not a significant amount of fat.\n\nWhen to cut and bulk:\n\nI generally cut from 13-15% bodyfat to 10% I would like to go lower but I normally just agree to bulk again because I like food a lot and am not fat at 10% so the extra 3% for a nice 6-pack isn’t really worth it to me and I found that under 10% it’s harder on sports performance.  So basically I bulk to 13-15% depending how I look and then cut to 9-11% this doesn’t seem like it’s that efficient but keeps me relatively lean all year long while still lifting hard. My progress will be posted below with numbers that took about two years of counting calories and measuring progress. My lift numbers aren’t exactly where I would like them to be considering I have only been strength training since about February of 2013.\n\nPopular diets: \n\nSome popular diets right now include keto, leangains, eat stop eat (not as popular but I tried it once), paleo, and vegan or vegetarian diets.  As long as the diet does not go against your beliefs, religious or personal then there really is no ideal diet besides what you prefer.  Each has their ups and downs but overall they are all manipulations to get people to eat less and “higher quality foods”.  \n\nKeto consists of mostly fat and protein, below 20-50 grams of carbs I believe.  This is supposed to have high benefits on your body because some people have insulin problems and fat is generally a hormone regulating macronutrient from what I remember reading.  This is good for fixing metabolic problems I have heard but don’t really see any point in it you just need to focus on calories and how you feel.  Keto works for a lot of people because first people see a larger drop right away from loss of water weight and then people like it because they can still eat fatty foods such as bacon.  The fat from this diet helps to make people feel fuller along with protein.  Generally protein and fat keep you fuller than carbs, but certain types of carbs such as those with a lower glycemic index value or glycemic load such as whole grains and vegetables.\n\nLeangains is very popular right now, this was popularized with the hodgetwins or twinmuscleworkout on youtube because they are dedicated to what they do and have interesting personalities although many fans follow them blindly always be open to advice but think about it, question it and try new things out. Basically this diet limits the time period in which you eat, generally people fast 16 hours and eat 8 but other variations have been done such as the warrior diet which is a 20 hour fast then 4 hour “feast”.  This helps people lose weight because the limited eating windows helps people eat less because it’s a lot harder to eat 2000 calories in 8 hours instead of 16.  But this doesn’t mean that you can eat any and everything in those 8 hours it still follows the principle of calories vs.  calories out.  The idea of limiting time is what intermittent fasting is in general, this relates to eat stop eat too because this is another form of fasting. Eat stop eat is eating maintenance or bulking calories 6 days a week and then fasting, eating nothing, for 1 day a week (this is varied some people do more than one fast).  \n\nPaleo or “the caveman diet” is a diet in which people only eat vegetables, fruits and meat.  Basically any type of food that cavemen had access to in the Paleolithic era of time.  No processed foods.\nVegetarian diets consists of no meat.  Vegan diets consists of no animal products.  I never looked too far into either because I like animal products although I do not agree with some of the process that is implemented to mass producing these foods.  People argue that there is not enough protein in these people’s diets.  But this isn’t necessarily true, although people also argue about quality of protein but I don’t necessarily argue with quality, lower quality protein is better than no protein to me.  Most green vegetables have a protein % that is equal to or better than dairy products, only problem is that it is going to be a lot harder to eat enough.  Have you ever ate 2000 calories of broccoli?  That’s a lot of broccoli and about 180 grams of protein which exceeds most people requirements.  These people feel a lot fuller most of the time and generally more energetic but this varies person to person.\n        \nConclusion:\n\nSo overall this is almost everything I have learned about fitness through my experiences over the past 4 years. I will continue lifting weights and eating to build muscle and lose fat.  I will keep implementing tips and tricks that I learn as long as people are interested in what I have to say, thanks for reading.  If for whatever reason this is replicated or posted in other locations I would like to hear the criticisms, questions, and comments.\n         \t\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382825889", "subreddit": "Fitness", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So it's late (I want to say about four in the morning or so), and my friends and I are leaving a bar in NYC. Usually we'd just take the subway since it was a pretty direct line from the station by bar to my friend's apartment, but we were with this one kid who liked to buy people shit when he was drunk, so we let him buy a cab for us. We figured it would've been easier... boy, were we wrong. A cab pulls over, and everything seems normal enough. I forget what he said his name was, but he was really chatty at first and seemed pleasant enough. We told him the fastest way to get home would probably be down Broadway, and he was just like, \"No, shortcut, shortcut!\" So he's going up some street I didn't recognize and he's continually trying to make small talk even though we're starting to doubt his \"shortcut\" was even a real thing. Eventually, my one friend who lives in the city just yells at him and says, \"Sir, this isn't the way back to my apartment building. You're going in the wrong direction.\" The guy apologizes and makes a turn down a sketchier street. We're all starting to get really uncomfortable. This is where shit hit the fan. He makes another turn and there's a cop car parked along the side of the street. Immediately upon seeing the cop car, he BOLTS. He accelerates and goes straight through a stop sign and gets the fuck outta there. The cop car immediately puts on his lights and follows us. We're freaking out in the back, screaming at this dude to stop. He's having a pseudo-panic attack and yelling at us, saying \"It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok!\" But it's clearly not... he's zooming up and down back alleyways, going up the wrong way of a couple one-way streets, and just driving like an all-around maniac. The cop is continuing to chase us, but we are gradually getting away. Obviously, we're freaking out in the back of the cab. Why the fuck did this taxi driver just go insane? All I knew was that he just panicked when he saw the cop car, so something was very, very wrong. For all I knew, we were going to be taken hostage or some shit. Basically everyone was in the back pissing their pants. So he drives extremely crazy for another fifteen minutes, and luckily there's not much going on in the street since it's 4:30am. After not much longer, we can no longer see the cop car, and surprisingly, no other cops came (I was expecting a full-out chase with multiple cops). We are all speechlessly freaked out at this point. He turns down this HELLA SKETCHY alley and my friends whispers we are in Spanish Harlem. The taxi driver turned off all his lights and goes \"keep it down and don't move.\" I actually tried to go for the door to get out and he goes, \"DON'T YOU DARE!\" So I folded my hands and shut the fuck up, not sure if he had a gun or some other kind of weapon. There we are, three drunk guys and an insane cab driver sitting in a dark alley of Spanish Harlem. About a minute later, we watch as the cop car literally speeds past the road we just got off of - as if it is right out of a car chase in a movie or some shit. We're all sweating bullets and freaking out still. After a few more moments of us sitting there in silence, the cab driver turns around and says, \"Ok, you guys can get out now. Sorry, you're going to have to find another way home.\" We just mutter something like \"Ok\" because we want to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. I go to open the door to leave and before I can get out, the driver yells, \"WAIT!\" I nervously turned to him, half expecting him to pull out a gun on me or something. He looks me straight in the eye and says, \"Your fare'll be about tree fiddy.\" It was at that exact moment that I realized our cab driver was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I was like \"God damnit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!!\" I was so pissed - and we had to walk all the way home from Spanish Harlem too!

{"body": "&gt;My older brother and I were very close for years. He was the type of person who would always stand up for me and shield me from the bullies at school. My brother also had a dark side, he has anger management issues he lives with which caused me to resent him over the years. Needless to say, things slowly accumulated and we grew apart and eventually stopped talking for the past few years.\nI was sitting in the comfort of my room one day and I was ready to play some GTA Online. I logged on and realized that my estranged brother was also playing GTA-O. I guess neither of us got around to deleting each other off our friends lists. So I got online and I was suddenly stricken with a glorious idea. I was going to hunt my brother down and finally make him pay for all the stress he has caused me over the years, I'm also fully aware of the nerdiness of my virtual revenge, but hey its something.\nSo i drove to the nearest Ammu-Nation and prepped for a bloodbath. I strapped on my vest and fully loaded my arsenal, I was ready. I hopped in to my coupe and headed in my brothers direction. As I was nearing his location, I clipped a metal post going full speed and ended up flipping my car. I ran out and couldn't see another vehicle in sight. I noticed my brother circling closer to me and suddenly my heart began pounding, my plan of sweet revenge was about to blow up in my face which would result in a crushing and humiliating defeat. No. This was not going to happen. Not today. I darted through an alley and hid between two buildings. Just as I was figuring out my next move, from the corner of my screen I noticed another players car racing towards me like a bat out of hell. It all happened too quickly for me to react and I was smashed against the wall behind me and I fell to the floor. To my amazement I was still alive. The car containing this random homicidal maniac was now jammed in a corner and trying to reverse to finish me off. What's worse is that I notice on the map that my brother is closing in on our location. There was no doubt in my mind that he was going to execute me before I could get back up. At this point I was praying the other guy in the car would mercifully put me out of my misery before my brother could obliterate my dignity. At this moment I was on my knees and struggling to get back up when suddenly my brother showed up, I braced for heartbreaking failure. To my absolute disbelief he casually walks right past me and shoots the driver point blank in the face with his shotgun. My brother then turns to me and I get up and we just stare at each other for a few moments. He then turns and begins to walk away.**I ask what do you want? He turns to me and says I need about tree fiddy. At this very moment I realize that my brother was a fifty foot tall crustecean from the paleolithic era. I tell him god danm you lochness monster, I aint given youno tree fiddy.**He continues to protect me even if it's in a virtual world, just like he protected me on the playground when we were kids. As I unloaded a clip in his back as he was walking away, I realized that maybe I'm the one who's been ungreatful all this time. In the moment he dropped to the ground, I know what I had just done was wrong, but I felt all my pent up stress, anger and resentment towards my brother evaporate in a single moment. I'm now ready to talk to my brother again in real life.\n\nwhat I expected TBH", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382871185", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, I can't answer all of this right now as I'm in a hurry and have to get somewhere in like a half hour, so let's see how much of this I can do in 30 minutes!\n\n&gt;I'm not talking about 100% certainty or anything. Let me rephrase the question: Do you believe that one can't rationally accept any belief unless one has a good rational argument (an argument from reason) for the conclusion that the belief in question does enjoy warrant (or justification or rationality)? And/Or do you think one can't rationally accept any belief unless one has empirical evidence in order for that belief do have warrant (justification or rationality)? Do ALL positive claims require support in this way, yes or no?\n\nI think it's unreasonable to hold all claims to the same standard of evidence. \"I went to the store and saw John\" is a lot more mundane than the claim \"I went to the store, and was attacked by ninjas, but I beat them in my epic blackbelt karate skills, then i went to buy milk and was ambushed by Spetznaz commandos. And then I saw a ghost who told my the secrets of the universe.\"\n\nThe first claim is rather reasonable to take at its word (unless the person is a known pathological liar), but the second is like, whoa, whoa, i'm gonna need some evidence. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. \n\nThe problem with the reformed epistemology worldview is it seems to treat the most basic claims as equal with the most extraordinary. And let's face it, God is probably one of the most extraordinary claims you can make. A maximally great being who supposedly created the universe? Yeah, I'm gonna need some evidence for that one. \n\nThat being said, I think there are different kinds of claims, and I think the source is of some importance too (known untrustworthy sources would probably require greater evidence than ones known to be trustworthy).\n\n&gt;The first two horns of the Münchhausen Trilemma advocates two types of reasoning that are flat out illogical. The first horn flies off into infinite regress and the second horn begs the question. The trilemma, then, is the decision among the three equally unsatisfying options. \n\nIf you force that dilemma, I guess you could call the arguments circular, and claim you can't know anything, but to me, this isn't a big deal. After all, any alternate explanation sounds much MORE unreasonable.\n\nIf I don't exist, then what's thinking? What's typing? You have to account for that. Claim it's a dream? Well, the dream requires even more proof, and the dream still requires a perceiver.\n\nSame with the universe, if the universe does not exist, a much more complex and less supported answer must be true.\n\nSo honestly, I really don't care about the trilemma. It doesn't concern me, because my conclusions are still the most reasonable I can make. Any alternate explanation has no evidence and requires even more explaining than what I accept. Seeing how I have no evidence of a delusion of some kind, and how delusions would require existences of their own, and even if the universe IS an illusion it still \"exists\" in some form or another, it's better to simply accept existence than to grasp at other straws. Besides, I don't think it's a big leap anyway. It's all we have to work with really.\n\n&gt;However, this is where I think Reformed Epistemology can answer the Trilemma quite well, and might perhaps be the only answer, and we will delve deeper into that in another message as you engage with my epistemology more in the other messages you posted.\n\nYou're gonna have to explain that, because from what I read the logic seems to be \"well, you accept other things on faith, why not God?\", and then it starts with God as a starting point and its arguments simply attempt to confirm said belief.\n\n&gt;Is solipsism the default position? Is moral skepticism the default position? Is non-realism the default position?\n\nI think solipsism is a good starting point. But as I said, I think it's more reasonable to accept existence than nonexistence, since nonexistence requires much more complexity and has no evidence.\n\n&gt;No you don't have to do that. We can just have properly basic beliefs in necessary truths/logical truths themselves for example, and then weed out other purported positions that violate the laws of thought/laws of logic.\n\nI'd argue you do.\n\nAlso, I fail to see why God is a properly basic belief at all. It seems to be grounded in an attempt to convince people of the Christian religion than an honest look at truth. Really, if you look at my worldview, God seems so unnecessary. Moreover, I'd argue it DOES violate the laws of logic unless you do some serious mental acrobatics to define your way around the problems. When you deal with infinity, contradictions are rife. This is THE big reason I lost my faith to begin with. Between the lack of evidence and the mess of contradictions and unsupported rationalizations, it seems unreasonable to believe in God, let alone claim he's a \"properly basic belief.\"\n\n&gt;Are you sure about that? Do we ever know enough about anything? We always seek more with science, so why not seek more with philosophy/logic/metaphysics?\n\nI can be sure enough of some things that the alternate positions become highly unreasonable. \n\n&gt;That is false. The affirmative is the believer and the negative is the skeptic. Being objective means not leaning towards either or. Being objective does not mean lean towards the negative versus the affirmative, that would defeat the point of objectivity.\n\nDo you believe Leprechauns do/don't exist? Can you be 100% sure of this? What about bigfoot? Loch Ness Monster? Santa?\n\nJust because you don't believe in something doesn't necessarily mean you have a burden of proof. I think it's only when you affirmatively believe something CAN'T exist that you have a burden of proof.\n\n&gt;I understand where you are going here. Its just that in your previous posts you've said that we can't have 100% certainty on anything, but then I asked if you were certain about that claim and you said yes, which seemed rather contradictory is all. But I see what you mean here in this comment.\n\nI forget the exact answer I gave to this honestly, but I don't recall agreeing, at least not in entirety.\n\n&gt;No matter what worldview we are using, we need a properly functioning epistemology, an understanding of metaphysics, and even if one is a moral skeptic then they need an understanding meta-ethics and the nature of moral truths.\n\nI honestly fail to see the need in my worldview. I believe I know enough, and am aware of the limits of such knowledge.\n\n&gt;I believe I did respond, check out the posts.\n\nAre you sure you actually responded to the argument rather than talking past me with your worldview as I mentioned earlier?\n\n&gt;Perhaps thats what you observe in your philosophy of politics class, but when discussing logic/metaphysics there are rules to it and you can apply the same rules to my reasoning. I can't put any \"spin\" on it, I can only provide valid arguments with true premises. The form of my reasoning is either valid or invalid. IF my reasoning is valid, and IF my premises are true, then my conclusions MUST be true. This is how deductive logic works.\n\nAh, but your starting point will always have a bias. Even if you apply the logic objectively, the assumptions built into your worldview will betray your argument. If you notice I'm always skeptical of an argument's premises.\n\n&gt;We need science, yes, but I also think we need philosophy. We need to use the right tools for the right jobs. If we want to observe, explain, describe, predict natural phenomena then lets use science. If we want to talk what what is real/what exists then lets use metaphysics. The right tools for the right job.\n\nExcept I don't think the results of metaphysics are really trustworthy. The premises are rather unreliable at times, and quite frankly, you can get some weird things out of logic that I don't reflect he real world. Hence my skepticism of the ontological arguments Christians like to make. I think that when you cross reference these conclusions with the physical reality, they don't really hold. This is why I made those ivory tower comments.....by that I mean out of touch with the world, academic with no practical purpose.\n\nAnd looking at OTHER APPROACHES to philosophy, you can reach the opposite conclusion. I believe I've posted arguments before, and above, stating that maximally great beings can't exist because they're self contradictory. \n\nSo you have  arguments in favor of, you have arguments against. Both are logically valid. How can you reach objective truth if philosophy operates in such a subjective manner, that depending on what assumptions you start out with and what arguments you make you can reach completely opposing conclusions?\n\nI'll get to your other responses later.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382976214", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

And then I saw a ghost who told my the secrets of the universe.\"\"\n\nThis is applying a standard to certain claims, but where did you get such a standard? Who determines what claims need evidence or not in your epistemology? **The main question at hand is, do all affirmative claims need support or do only some affirmative claims require support?**\n\n&gt;\"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\"\n\nExtraordinary evidence is not required, only sound syllogisms and strong enthymemes are required. We only need sufficient evidence, not extraordinary evidence. I've heard this slogan a lot, but there is a big whole in it. Who decides what is actually extraordinary? Extraordinary is a subjective term that could mean many different thing to many people. For example, given the light of the Trilemma presented earlier, I believe one claiming that we can gain some knowledge at all seems like a extraordinary claim, but the only thing required is sufficient support.\n\n&gt;\"And let's face it, God is probably one of the most extraordinary claims you can make. A maximally great being who supposedly created the universe? Yeah, I'm gonna need some evidence for that one. \"\n\nGod is extraordinary but we use the same standards of logic/evidence on God as we do any other claims to be quite frank. Only sufficient logic/evidence is required, not extraordinary logic/evidence.\n\n&gt;\"I guess you could call the arguments circular, and claim you can't know anything, but to me, this isn't a big deal.'\n\nDo you fully comprehend what it means if we have no knowledge at all? If we have 0 knowledge at all then you can't claim to know that anything you're saying is true, or that anything I'm saying is true. If we have 0 knowledge then you have 0 justification for any of the beliefs you hold. If we have no knowledge, yet you still believe in things, then all you have is faith.\n\n&gt;\"If I don't exist, then what's thinking? What's typing? You have to account for that. Claim it's a dream? Well, the dream requires even more proof, and the dream still requires a perceiver.\"\n\nIf you're the one making the positive claim then you're the one who has to account for that, and as the the Münchhausen Trilemma as shown us, that isn't as easy as it sounds.\n\n&gt;\"So honestly, I really don't care about the trilemma.

I could better answer this by addressing your last message about my epistemology, if you are ready for it.\n\n&gt;\" But as I said, I think it's more reasonable to accept existence than nonexistence, since nonexistence requires much more complexity and has no evidence.\"\n\nThe person who claims existence does exist has the burden of proof, not the person who claims existence doesn't exist. Kind of like how the burden of proof is first on the theist, not the atheist. I think its also more reasonable to accept the existence of existence but the only way we can do so is by accepting it in a properly basic way. I'm not asking about solipsism as a starting point, I'm asking does solipsism hold the default position right now?\n\n&gt;\"Do you believe Leprechauns do/don't exist? Can you be 100% sure of this? What about bigfoot? Loch Ness Monster? Santa?'\n\nI do not believe in these contingent beings no. Michael Scriven, for\nexample, maintained that in the absence of evidence rendering the existence of some entity probable, we are justified in believing that it does not exist, provided that:\n\n1. it is not something which might leave no traces\n\n2. we have comprehensively surveyed the area where the evidence would be found if the entity existed\n\nHave humans been to he north pole?

I've been dealing with these alleged contradictions for years and they are nothing new to be quite frank. The Omniscience Paradox, the Omnipotence Paradox, The Logical Problem of Evil, these are all classical philosophical problems that the Greeks dealt with centuries ago. I suggest you do some formal research on these matters I just listed as most contemporary scholars actually reject them. In order to accept them then this means you have LITERALLY disproved the existence of God and you now know for a fact that God doesn't exist. I ask you, do you KNOW God doesn't exist, have you disproven God? If you say yes, isn't that quite an extraordinary claim? If you say no, then we still have some work to do.\n\n&gt;\"Both are logically valid.

Bring me back my gold, and I'll let you keep as much as you can carry!\"\nThe man needn't have finished his sentence, as Kitty Peditti had already raced her eager little self into the hole, needing a shove from Fluffle Yarn to shift the back of her into the hole, because yarn is strong enough to shove a cat in this book, because he's yarn and yarn is awesome.\nInto the hole they went, in search of the Gold of Wales.\n\nAs Kitty Peditti and Fluffle Yarn went deeper and deeper into the cave they started to think that maybe there wasn't any gold, that the jolly green man had lied to them and that they'd be stuck down there for ever.\n\"There's gotta be something down here\" Kitty Peditti said.\nFluffle Yarn was quiet, concentration on keeping his Yarn-A-Light in order, as it was all there was keeping the cave lit.\nAs Kitty Peditti and Fluffle Yarn began to think about turning back, a faint shimmer shone ahead, at an opening to a larger area.\nThe two races towards the light, images of gold and gold and gold running through their minds, the ideas they had: \"I can buy a solid gold mouse!\", Kitty Peditti though.\nFluffle, however, thought nothing. As he is yarn. And has no brain.\nThey burst into the opening, frozen with terror as soon as they looked in.\nThere was the gold, mountains and mountains of it as high as it could be stacked, in coins, bars, cheese and pools, ready for the taking.\nWere it not for the dragon with flames billowing from it's nostrils glaring at the two.\n\"Who dare to enter my chamber?\" the dragon roared.\n\"We do...\" squeaked Kitty Peditti.\n\"okay, 'we'\" smirked the dragon, \"answer me, these questions three, and I shall leave this cave and never return\"\nKitty Peditti looked at Fluffle, an agreement that Fluffle would answer the questions.\n\"Go on\", said Fluffle Yarn, showing no fear, as yarn is incapable of fear, being yarn as he is yarn as yarn can be yarn.\nThe dragon sat up, tightly and pondered, before leaning down, it's nose centimetres from Fluffle Yarn's stringy string.\n\"Your first question is\", it said, pawsing, \"What is the name of the owner of this gold?\"\n\n[At this point in the story I asked the person I told it to to answer the questions. She forgot the answer to the first question]\n\nThe dragon roared with laughter.\n\"Do you not listen to what you've been told fifteen minutes ago?\"\nHe lifted up his tail and slammed it down onto a pile of gold.\n\"A third of your precious gold has been destroyed, you had better know the answer to this one!\"\nKitty Peditti looked at Fluffle Yarn worriedly.\n\"You can do this one, that was just a fluke.\"\nFluffle Yarn looked determined... Somehow, but I assure you it was very intimidating for the dragon, as dragons have super yarn determination detectors.\n\"I can sense your determination, foolish yarn, but you shall not be able to answer... QUESTION TWO!\"\nThe dragon roared and erupted fire into the ceiling, singeing the stone black and grey.\n\"Where do you two live, house and couch names?\" the dragon smirked, as the two had been shaken, and could probably not even remember their homes.\n\n[She answered this question correctly, so the third question was asked!]\n\nThe dragon spread it's majestic wings, making a show out of the question.\n\"What... Is my name!\"\nThe dragon thought he'd bested the two, until Fluffle casually called out: \"Nessie, you silly twit.\"\nThe dragon screamed like a dragon, thrashing around, causing rocks to fall from a nearby pile.\n\"How, how could you know my name!\" he roared, shoving his face up to Fluffle, causing him to roll back a bit before his Yarn-Stabilisers kicked in.\nFluffle quickly replied: \"Because we found gold in Wales, we found a leprechaun in Wales, we found a monster in Wales, why wouldn't I guess that it was something Scottish?\"\nThe dragon looked taken aback.\n\"But... But... You can't break the fourth wall to answer the question properly!\"\nFluffle Yarn put on his shades, expanding himself to contain all the gold as Kitty Peditti rolled around on the floor in laughter.\n\"Watch me\", said a gold-laden ball of yarn, doing a haters-gonna-hate walk out of the cave, with a happy little kitten following close behind.\n\nOutside the cave, the leprechaun jumped with delight at the sight of the gold Fluffle was holding.\n\"you did it, you did it!\" Musshea exclaimed, \"you gots me go-ho-ho-hold!!!\" his voice breaking on each ho.\nFluffle dropped the mountains of gold at the man's feet, not needing any for himself, as yarn knows not of the flippantry called greed and had no desire for money.\n\"You can can keep what you can carry!\" the leprechaun yelled happily.\nKitty Peditti gathered up all the gold she could carry and races back to the airport with it, Fluffle on her back, bouncing up and down in his relaxed state, his sunglasses removed and placed back in his stringy body.\nHalf a gold coin was given for the ride home, the whole plane chartered and the pilot paid off so that Kitty Peditti and Fluffle Yarn could fly the plane home themselves, a glorious event for all!\nAs the [my surname] family pondered over how a plane managed to crash in their back garden, Kitty Peditti and Fluffle Yarn went back to Bouncy Sofa in the front room province, Kitty Peditti curled up with her diamond mouse which she had spent all her gold on, with Fluffle Yarn curled up in her arms, and the book, \"The Gold of Wales\", curled up on top of the shelf, to be found once more.\n\n**The End**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383007443", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students. I heard most of the drama but there is one student that I will always be reminded of when people ask this question.\n\nThere was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip. She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't. Everyone could hear her, including me. Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about. She gossiped most days but one day was different.\n\nI heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom. I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not? It could be fun.\n\nAnyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with.\n\nMr. Bodom.\n\nI was shocked when I heard this.\n\nBut stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young. She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess. If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress.\n\nAfter class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work. It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head.\n\nAs soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, \"Hey Kathy. I heard you talking about me in class...\" she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, \"Oh my god! You heard me say that? I'm so sorry! And-\" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, \"I want to have sex with you too.\"\n\nShe stopped her sentence and smiled. Then she said, \"Do you know what my rates are?\"\n\nConfused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in. It turns out she mentioned that she would have sex with me... if I paid that is.\n\nI decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her. \"Alright,\" I told her. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll do it, but I need some money of course. That's just how it works.\" she said. I replied, \"Okay, what do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had tricked me again! \"Godamnit monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away.\n\nClass was really weird after that with Kathy gone. I never told any of the students about our encounter but I sure as hell would never mention it to anyway. Ever. Of course I'm telling Reddit, but isn't that what the internet is for? To tell strangers your deepest, darkest secrets?\n\nThe year ended without being... too weird.\n\nTL;DR: Overheard a student talking about having sex with me... things got... weird and it ended in an unexpected way...\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383058621", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 103, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's a fun and cool story for you guys.\n\n\nFallout 3, game of the year edition, here's why...\nAround 4 years ago when Fallout 3 first came out I was in 8th grade and my cousin was a senior in High School.\nDuring a family reunion I went into his room and he was playing the Playstation 3, he was a bit of a loner, even in the family so I knew he wouldn't talk to me. I looked over to see what game he was playing. It was a game I'd never really seen before.. was it in the call of duty series? Medal of honor? Maybe a new series? He never said a word to me, but he played the game for 5 hours,all with me watching him play it.\nI finally got the nerve to speak up, \"What game are you playing\" I asked, as he was ejecting the disk from the PS3. He said nothing. He simply put the game in its case and handed me the case.\nFallout 3.\nAs I was looking at the game my parents called to say that we were going home, as I was exiting his room he said, \"I play that game all day, it's a pretty new game, if you want to come over and watch me play again you can.\"\nAnd so began our tradition of me going to his house to watch him play Fallout 3.\nThis continued for months. Me and him because sort of the best of friends even though our age difference, every family get-together we'd rush to his room and play Fallout 3 for endless hours. We beat the game several times in those months.\nOne day I went to his house and knocked on his door. His mom answered the door crying her eyes out, I was shocked because I'd never ever seen her so sad, I'd never even seen her cry.\nI asked what was wrong and she said that my cousin couldn't play today. Disappointed I walked home, wondering what would have made her cry.\nLater that evening I found out. My cousin had been with a group of friends who had been drinking. They had tried to drive home and ended up driving into a ditch. The driver was killed, my cousin was in the passenger seat and he was in the hospital, the girl in the back was paralyzed and also in the hospital.\nThe next day I went to the hospital, crying my eyes out because I genuinely cared for my cousin now, and not just for Fallout 3. That game really made us connect though. The doctors said that my cousin was not expected to live, internal damage had been far too bad.\nAs my cousin lay dying on the hospital bed, he motioned me to come over. He said, \"I need you to promise me something if I die.\" Tears streaming down my eyes I said, \"I will promise anything.\" he told me, \"I want you to go down to the store and buy yourself a copy of Fallout 3, beat that game multiple times over for me, just like we did back at my house.\" I nodded and promised him I would. I started to walk out of the room when he said, \"Wait, I need something else.\" \"What do you need?\" I asked. \"I need about Tree Fiddy\" It was around this time I realized that my cousin was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned loch ness monster had gotten me again! I said, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy\"\nBut in the end, I never did get around to buying that Fallout 3 game. I would really appreciate if you bought it for me.\nThis is why I would like Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition\ntl;dr: Eh... you'll just have to read it.\n\n(thanks /u/thehealeroftri)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383090732", "subreddit": "RandomActsOfGaming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Why? Why would you do this to me?\" And then my stomach would growl in correspondence, asking the same question.

I remember as if it were only 4 hours ago....\n\n------------\n\nI pulled out my leather wallet that said \"Bad Motherfucker\" on it, but the contents within said wallet begged to differ.

At any rate, tonight looked like a night that I would have to ball on a budget.\n\nI looked around the frozen food aisle to see what Target might have for a dollar, and then I saw it: A pepperoni hot pocket, frozen in all of its tasty goodness. Since it was a singular one, I picked it up and sauntered to the checkout line. \n\nThe cashier lady, whose face hid partially behind her curly blonde hair, read the total to me. \"That'll be Tree Fiddy.\" she said with a toothy grin. Unfortunately, I didn't have time for her to change into a loch ness, so I took back the expensive hot pocket and decided to try my luck again.\n\nI looked high and low, left and right, up and down, here and there for something. Something, anything to fill my stomach for tonight. Something to keep me from going hungry.

{"body": "&gt; I found nothing wrong with religion.\n\nWell I have. It makes many claims that it can't support. It stifles progress. It cause harm, suffering, and can lead good people to do bad things. Furthermore, it doesn't provide a single tangible benefit that can't be achieved through secular means. \n\n&gt; along the line you've taken a leap of trust. \n\nWhere? My position on the existence of gods is that I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing. \n\n&gt; Now I love science, but it yet proven or disprove the existence of God.\n\nI agree that science has not proven the existence of god, but, it certainly has shrunken the realm where god might still be hiding over the history of civilization.\n\nMany definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\n&gt;  Would it still turn you off?\n\nNo, but, why should I think it's true?\n\n&gt; What I found to be the underlying reason why people disbelieve in that concept is that they would have to be accountable for their actions (heaven and hell). \n\nReally? I have never heard this given or implied as a reason for disbelief. \n\n&gt; Is this true?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt; Why is atheism appealing to you guys?\n\nIt's not 'appealing', I get nothing from it. There are no rituals, teaching, dogmas, or scriptures. It is merely a label to denote that I do not believe in any gods. \n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\n* edited because I accidentally   a word.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383195139", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I completely agree, there is no definitive paleo diet. I think a lot of people coming from a world of other diets with specific rules get confused about this. Even if we knew exactly what paleolithic people ate, we do not have access to the majority of these foods. I think paleo diet is more of a concept/framework for evaluating what modern foods provide the same benefits as foods eaten in the paleolithic era. The truth is that even those who claim to be eating a paleo diet are in fact eating mostly the products of the agricultural revolution. \n\nBroccoli, cabbage, sweet potatoes, and zuchini were no more available to pre agricultural people than grains and legumes. If we were trying to make a definitive paleo diet, there would be so many questions to answer. A real paleo diet would consist of all wild foods with an emphasis on foods from tropical regions, as most of our evolution happened there. I doubt anyone here is eating a diet like that.\n\nThe main idea is to learn from the past, but not replicate the past, because that's impossible. One final thing to consider is that there is no way to know which foods that were eaten in the past were actually health promoting. For instance, was someone healthy because they ate a certain food, or healthy despite the fact that they were eating it.

I do so and decide to take a boat that was nearby. It was going to be a glorious escape. Just then a 10 foot tall monsta from the paleolithic era comes streaming out of the water, and you know what asked? He wanted tree fiffdy.
