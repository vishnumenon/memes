{"body": "As I rode the stream on and on, I could eventually see a huge light coming. I knew it was the first light; the Higher Self light matrix of our solar system. Then the entire solar system appeared in the light, accompanied by one of those velvet booms.\n \nI saw that the solar system we live in is our larger, local body. This is our local body and we are much bigger than we imagine. I saw that the solar system is our body. I am a part of this, and the Earth is this great created being that we are, and we are the part of it that knows that it is. But we are only that part of it. We are not everything, but we are that part of it that knows that it is.\n \nI could see all the energy that this solar system generates, and it is an incredible light show! I could hear the music of the spheres. Our solar system, as do all celestial bodies, generates a unique matrix of light, sound and vibratory energies. Advanced civilizations from other star systems can spot life as we know it in the universe by the vibratory or energy matrix imprint. It is child's play. The Earth's wonder child (human beings) make an abundance of sound right now, like children playing in the backyard of the universe.\n \nI rode the stream directly into the center of the light. I felt embraced by the light as it took me in with its breath again, followed by another soft sonic boom.\n \nI was in this great light of love with the stream of life flowing through me. I have to say again, it is the most loving, non-judgmental light. It is the ideal parent for this wonder child.\n \n\"What now?\" I wondered.\n \nThe light explained to me that there is no death; we are immortal beings. We have already been alive forever! I realized that we are part of a natural living system that recycles itself endlessly. I was never told that I had to come back. I just knew that I would. It was only natural, from what I had seen.\n \nI don't know how long I was with the light, in human time. But there came a moment when I realized that all my questions had been answered and my return was near. When I say that all my questions were answered on the other side, I mean to say just that. All my questions have been answered. Every human has a different life and set of questions to explore. Some of our questions are universal, but each of us is exploring this thing we call life in our own unique way. So is every other form of life, from mountains to every leaf on every tree.\n \nAnd that is very important to the rest of us in this universe. Because it all contributes to the Big Picture, the fullness of life. We are literally God exploring God's Self in an infinite Dance of Life. Your uniqueness enhances all of life.\n\nAs I began my return to the life cycle, it never crossed my mind, nor was I told, that I would return to the same body. It just did not matter. I had complete trust in the light and the life process. As the stream merged with the great light, I asked never to forget the revelations and the feelings of what I had learned on the other side.\n \nThere was a \"Yes.\" It felt like a kiss to my soul.\n \nThen I was taken back through the light into the vibratory realm again. The whole process reversed, with even more information being given to me. I came back home, and I was given lessons on the mechanics of reincarnation. I was given answers to all those little questions I had:\n \n\"How does this work? How does that work?\" I knew that I would be reincarnated.\n \nThe Earth is a great processor of energy, and individual consciousness evolves out of that into each one of us. I thought of myself as a human for the first time, and I was happy to be that. From what I have seen, I would be happy to be an atom in this universe. An atom. So to be the human part of God ... this is the most fantastic blessing. It is a blessing beyond our wildest estimation of what blessing can be. For each and every one of us to be the human part of this experience is awesome, and magnificent. Each and every one of us, no matter where we are, screwed up or not, is a blessing to the planet, right where we are.\n \nSo I went through the reincarnation process expecting to be a baby somewhere. But I was given a lesson on how individual identity and consciousness evolve. So I reincarnated back into this body.\n \nI was so surprised when I opened my eyes. I do not know why, because I understood it, but it was still such a surprise to be back in this body, back in my room with someone looking over me crying her eyes out. It was my hospice caretaker. She had given up an hour and a half after finding me dead. She was sure I was dead; all the signs of death were there - I was getting stiff. We do not know how long I was dead, but we do know that it was an hour and a half since I was found. She honored my wish to have my newly dead body left alone for a few hours as much as she could. We had an amplified stethoscope and many ways of checking out the vital functions of the body to see what was happening. She can verify that I really was dead.\n \nIt was not a near-death experience. I experienced death itself for at least an hour and a half. She found me dead and checked the stethoscope, blood pressure and heart rate monitor for an hour and a half. Then I awakened and saw the light outside. I tried to get up to go to it, but I fell out of the bed. She heard a loud \"clunk\", ran in and found me on the floor.\n \nWhen I recovered, I was very surprised and yet very awed about what had happened to me. At first all the memory of the trip that I have now was not there. I kept slipping out of this world and kept asking, \"Am I alive?\" This world seemed more like a dream than that one.\n \nWithin three days, I was feeling normal again, clearer, yet different than I had ever felt in my life. My memory of the journey came back later. I could see nothing wrong with any human being I had ever seen. Before that I was really judgmental. I thought a lot of people were really screwed up, in fact I thought that everybody was screwed up but me. But I got clear on all that.\n \nAbout three months later a friend said I should get tested, so I went and got the scans and so forth. I really felt good, so I was afraid of getting bad news.\n \nI remember the doctor at the clinic looking at the before and after scans, saying, \"Well, there is nothing here now.\"\n \nI said, \"Really, it must be a miracle?\"\n \nHe said, \"No, these things happen, they are called spontaneous remission.\"\n \nHe acted very unimpressed. But here was a miracle, and I was impressed, even if no one else was.\n\nThe mystery of life has very little to do with intelligence. The universe is not an intellectual process at all. The intellect is helpful; it is brilliant, but right now that is all we process with, instead of our hearts and the wiser part of ourselves.\n \nThe center of the Earth is this great transmuter of energy, just as you see in pictures of our Earth's magnetic field. That's our cycle, pulling reincarnated souls back in and through it again. A sign that you are reaching human level is that you are beginning to evolve an individual consciousness. The animals have a group soul, and they reincarnate in group souls. A deer is pretty much going to be a deer forever. But just being born a human, whether deformed or genius, shows that you are on the path to developing an individual consciousness. That is in itself part of the group consciousness called humanity.\n \nI saw that races are personality clusters. Nations like France, Germany and China each have their own personality. Cities have personalities, their local group souls that attract certain people. Families have group souls. Individual identity is evolving like branches of a fractal; the group soul explores in our individuality. The different questions that each of us has are very, very important. This is how Godhead is exploring God's Self - through you. So ask your questions, do your searching. You will find your Self and you will find God in that Self, because it is only the Self.\n \nMore than that, I began to see that each one of us humans are soul mates. We are part of the same soul fractaling out in many creative directions, but still the same. Now I look at every human being that I ever see, and I see a soul mate, my soul mate, the one I have always been looking for. Beyond that, the greatest soul mate that you will ever have is yourself. We are each both male and female. We experience this in the womb and we experience this in reincarnation states. If you are looking for that ultimate soul mate outside of yourself, you may never find it; it is not there. Just as God is not \"there.\" God is here. Don't look \"out there\" for God. Look here for God. Look through your Self. Start having the greatest love affair you ever had ... with your Self. You will love everything out of that.\n \nI had a descent into what you might call hell, and it was very surprising. I did not see Satan or evil. My descent into hell was a descent into each person's customized human misery, ignorance, and darkness of not-knowing. It seemed like a miserable eternity. But each of the millions of souls around me had a little star of light always available. But no one seemed to pay attention to it. They were so consumed with their own grief, trauma and misery. But, after what seemed an eternity, I started calling out to that light, like a child calling to a parent for help. Then the light opened up and formed a tunnel that came right to me an insulated me from all that fear and pain. That is what hell really is.\n \nSo what we are doing is learning to hold hands, to come together. The doors of hell are open now. We are going to link up, hold hands, and walk out of hell together.\n \nThe light came to me and turned into a huge golden angel. I said, \"Are you the angel of death?\"\n \nIt expressed to me that it was my oversoul, my Higher Self matrix, a super-ancient part of ourselves. Then I was taken to the light.\n \nSoon our science will quantify spirit. Isn't that going to be wonderful? We are coming up with devices now that are sensitive to subtle energy or spirit energy. Physicists use these atomic colliders to smash atoms to see what they are made of. They have got it down to quarks and charm, and all that. Well, one day they are going to come down to the little thing that holds it all together, and they are going to have to call that ... God. With atomic colliders they are not only seeing what is in here, but they are creating particles. Thank God most of them are short-lived milliseconds and nanoseconds. We are just beginning to understand that we are creating too, as we go along.\n \nAs I saw forever, I came to a realm in which there is a point where we pass all knowledge and begin creating the next fractal, the next level. We have that power to create as we explore. And that is God expanding itself through us.\n \nSince my return I have experienced the light spontaneously, and I have learned how to get to that space almost any time in my meditation. Each one of you can do this. You do not have to die to do this. It is within your equipment; you are wired for it already.\n \nThe body is the most magnificent light being there is. The body is a universe of incredible light. Spirit is not pushing us to dissolve this body. That is not what is happening. Stop trying to become God; God is becoming you. Here.\n \nThe mind is like a child running around the universe, demanding this and thinking it created the world. But I ask the mind, \"What did your mother have to do with this?\" \n \nThat is the next level of spiritual awareness. Oh! My mother! All of a sudden you give up the ego, because you are not the only soul in the universe.\n\nOne of my questions to the light was, \"What is heaven?\"\n \nI was given a tour of all the heavens that have been created: the Nirvanas, the Happy Hunting Grounds, all of them. I went through them. These are thought form creations that we have created. We don't really go to heaven; we are reprocessed. But whatever we created, we leave a part of ourselves there. It is real, but it is not all of the soul.\n \nI saw the Christian heaven. We expect it to be a beautiful place, and you stand in front of the throne, worshipping forever. I tried it. It is boring! This is all we are going to do? It is childlike. I do not mean to offend anyone. Some heavens are very interesting, and some are very boring. I found the ancient ones to be more interesting, like the Native American ones, the Happy Hunting Grounds. The Egyptians have fantastic ones. It goes on and on. There are so many of them. In each of them there is a fractal that is your particular interpretation, unless you are part of the group soul that believes in only the God of a particular religion. Then you are very close, in the same ball park together. But even then, each is a little bit different. That is a part of yourself that you leave there. Death is about life, not about heaven.\n \nI asked God, \"What is the best religion on the planet? Which one is right?\"\n \nAnd Godhead said, with great love:\n\"I don't care.\"\nThat was incredible grace. What that meant was that we are the caring beings here.\n \nThe Ultimate Godhead of all the stars tells us:\n\"It does not matter what religion you are. The price to get into heaven is the same for everyone. That will be tree-fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that the Godhead was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383334291", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Didn't the wife/husband team of Condry and Condry fail to include any evidence that biology greatly contributes to the differences in how reactions of male or female are perceived? \n\nI wish I had the studies at my finger tips, but there's a lot of them that link hormonal levels in blood as to the reasons why men and women generally (but not *always*) react to certain situations in a certain way.\n\nI know most APA situations don't include medical data often, and are highly qualitative studies, but it's been known in the medical community for a long time some of the most violent male offenders in our prison systems have genetic markers for extreme aggression.\n\nIf you were in a dark ally, would you rather have a man mug you or a woman? I think that alone tells you there are real gender differences that are tied directly to our genetics with or without societies help.\n\nNot that I don't think environment plays a role too, it does, but I think no matter how much telling little Suzy she needs to be a big, strong woman and fight in bloodsports -- she probably won't without at least some genetic backing or serious trauma.

When women were pregnant, they were given the best food the tribe had and were held in supreme regard, as is depicted by their most ancient art (because they could produce life). \n\nSo there were obvious gender roles back in those days, derived from biology, but that didn't mean women can only do this or men can only do that. It just simply meant that most often these things would occur because nature rolled the die that way.\n\nThe same could be said for modern day gender roles (not 1950's, 2013). Sure, a woman can be a fireman, but often she'll not. A man could want to be a dress-maker, but often he'll not.\n\nIt's strange, when it is suggested women seem to always score higher on management evaluations (studies done on people who are management), people applaud loudly and celebrate our culture. But, when studies also show that most women would rather be shot then be computer programmers, we blame society and decry our civilization.\n\nYet, both probably come from the biological workings from our brain (brain structure) as much as they do from society.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383342665", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My dad constantly talked to himself, and usually didn't realize it until my family told him. His conversations were as real as if there was another person talking to him, and he would have had them all the time if he lived alone. He had major problems, and they started getting scary at the end. \n\nOnce, we heard him planning to murder all of us, with him going into details on the things he would do. At first we thought he was making some sick joke. We heard him saying that he wanted to rape my 3-year old sister, then stick a knife in her head. Then he started planning what he would to me, but I stopped him, and told him this joke wasn't funny. At that point, he realized that we heard him, and started getting angry at me for 'disappearing' his friend. Apparently his murderous conversation started because we would do make his conversation 'partners' disappear constantly, and he's had enough.\n\nHe then came up to me, and started punching me. My mom went to him pretty quickly and stopped him for a second so I could get away. He pulled a pocket knife from his back pocket, and did something (I'm not going to go in detail on this part, because it brings back awful, painful memories.)\n\nAfter he was done, I was hiding behind a couch 10 feet away. I saw him going after my little sister next, and I was terrified. I didn't want him to do anything to her, but I didn't want to hurt myself, so I just kept watching. He grabbed her from her crib, held her close to his face, and said to her \"Gimme tree fiddy, you stupid bitch! I was just talking to the lochness monsta and he wants his tree fiddy!\"\n\nMy mom then told him to stop it, because she had tree fiddy and would give it to him if he stopped. He was threatening to cut her painting (which she was very proud of) a few minutes ago, if she didn't give him tree fiddy.  He ended up cutting it, but she realized he was crazy and she didn't want any more trouble, so she decided to give him the tree fiddy when she realized he could hurt her daughter. After she gave him the tree fiddy, he ran outside and rode on the lochness monster, which flew off into the sky. \n\nThis was 5 years ago, and to this day, we still haven't seen him, and I'm glad.

{"body": "Cool, I will answer all of these!\n\n&gt;-Why are you guys Atheists?\n\nSame reason I don't believe in Santa Clause, Big Foot, fairies, the Loch Ness Monster, U.F.O.s: **The case for them is not convincing.**\n\n&gt;If you knew a God existed (say He presents Himself) would you believe He exists?\n\nYou might want to rephrase that question, because knowledge is a subset of belief. Everything you know, you also believe, just to a higher degree of certainty. What you probably meant to say is just the second part (if God presented himself, would you believe that he exists?) so I will answer that. First, a God has a lot of explaining to do - extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If he claims he is the creator of the universe; that he can make something of nothing; that he sent himself to earth, had himself tortured and killed, rose from the dead to walk on earth again; he better demonstrate all of that. And I have to be sure that I am not hallucinating, dreaming, making stuff up in my head, etc. This works best with independent verification from other people. **The time to believe in something is when there's enough evidence for it.**\n\n&gt; -Were you at one point a Christian? What made you change? Do you blame the church?\n\n**No**, and I wouldn't blame the church; though they certainly aren't helping when they're defending child rapists, embezzling taxes and building $40 billion mansions instead of feeding the poor.\n\n&gt;-If a connection with a God could only bring you so much to gain, and nothing to lose, why be an Atheist?\n\nGood ol' Pascal's wager. First and foremost, it's **because I actually care about what's true**. It doesn't matter if there's personal gain involved. Secondly, it is not true that theists have nothing to lose: You lose time and resources worshiping a false deity, you abide by rules that don't make sense in a secular context (e.g. bash homos, discriminate against women, condone slavery - at least you should be doing all of this if you took the bible seriously).\n\n&gt;-Is it possible that a God has allowed for humanity to learn about it's environment to a certain extent? (Meaning: a creationist POV, God controls the extent to which man makes discoveries)\n\n**Creationism is definitively false.** We understand evolution better than gravity, so you might want to check on that. Most creationists simply don't understand evolution. The good thing about science is that it's true whether you believe it or not.\n\n&gt;-Are you angry at a God? Meaning, you voice harsh opinions on this subreddit due to bad experience?\n\n**I'm as angry at God as you are angry at Sasquatch.** What do you mean you don't believe there is a Sasquatch?\n\n&gt; Edit: I'm a Christian who believes that science is a method of learning about our world, where God places fixed limits on what humans can achieve. Plate Tectonics, The Big Bang, Physics, Chemical compositions, Biology, all the sorts are true/acceptable theories/ 100% fact. However, I believe that a God has given humanity the opportunity to learn about themselves and our world. Sooo Im a creationist.\n\nThat doesn't make sense. **You can't cherry-pick your science just as long as it fits your presuppositions.** Evolution is a fact and stands in contrast to creationism. Scientist know that there has never been a flood that covered the entire planet and killed everyone but Noah and his handful of buddies. A virgin birth is impossible. You can't rearrange the molecules of water into wine or walk on water. The earth is proven to be much older than 6000 years old. How do you reconcile these mental gymnastics?\n\n&gt; After an hour or so of taking down answers, I would like to thank you guys for being decent and answering those simple questions...just proves that atheists aren't bad people, like Christians would suppose.\nWe can now only sit back and wait for anything to happen. God or not, I think I'll stick to Faith...call me what you would like, it's something that I won't leave behind.\n\nFaith is not a virtue. Faith is gullibility. **Faith is the excuse people give when they don't have a good reason to justify their beliefs.**\n\n&gt; Thank you, r/atheism!\nActually\nI'm still checking on the responses...I have free time\nKeep em coming!\n\nNo problem, I'd also enjoy getting some answers from you. I believe you're a decent person and the fact that you like to have your views challenged speaks for your curious mind.

{"body": "Good questions.  \n\n1. I'm an atheist for the same reason I don't believe in unicorns, ghosts, the Loch Ness Monster, etc. It's nothing *special* about God. There's just not enough evidence for, and plenty of evidence against. The hypothesis that God exists is so extraordinary that it would take a lot of evidence, especially since many Christians' conception of God is self-contradictory in various ways: omnipotence itself may be incoherent, and it's probably logically incompatible with omniscience and with moral perfection, as a start. I guess I could make it a policy of never deciding to believe in God, since if God exists, He can make me believe anyway. \n2. Kind of. Not really. I blame Christians a little bit, since it was Christians who started me investigating the evidence for and against Christianity, by attempting to harm people. I first noticed it when Christians tried to prevent people from learning true theories (e.g. evolution). I don't have much objection to personally believing in something, but when you try to harm other people because of it, that's a problem.\n3. There are lots of things I could believe that would make me happier, but I find that I can't intentionally start believing things. Why not believe that you are God? Wouldn't that make you even happier than believing in God? (Cf. Nozick's \"Experience Machine\" here.)  \n4. That's at least in tension with moral perfection. It's also a fairly complex hypothesis; the simpler one, clearly, is that we're just learning about our environment under our own power.\n5. I'm not angry at Lex Luthor, nor at Voldemort. I tend not to voice harsh opinions, but I'm fortunate enough that few Christians have harmed me directly *qua* Christians.  \n\nOn your edit: *Why* use faith? Do you believe in other things that almost certainly don't exist, *via* faith? Would you agree that theistic belief itself frequently leads to people harming other people in unjustified ways? (Cf. 9/11, e.g.) Isn't it irresponsible to believing in things for no reason such that those beliefs increase the probability that you'll unjustifiedly harm other people?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383450247", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not a trucker, but an experience with one. Back in 1981, I had just graduated college and was wanting to do the proverbial \"road trip\", but change it up a little and hitchhike. Well, during the summer, it was HOT during the day, so I did some of my walking between rides at night. Truck drivers seemed to be the most likely to pick up a walker (day or night); I looked fairly unassuming at the time, so I don't think I scared anyone. \n\nAnyway, I was walking one evening around 8 or 9 oclock along some boring, no-name road in the middle of nowhere. I heard it long before I saw it- a Peterbilt cabover, but an older one (one of the big square ones). I stuck my thumb out, and it stopped. I crawled in, the driver was a woman- only the second woman semi driver I'd seen on my trip. Pretty cool, I'm impressed. We rode along for about an hour or so, she didn't stop talking the whole time. \n\nFinally, she said \"I'm turning off about 5 miles up, depending on which way you want to go you can stick with me or I can let you out at a diner up ahead\". Shit, I was hungry, she wasn't the best-looking (or smelling, for that matter) female I'd been around, so I said let me out. \n\nShe pulled over a few minutes later, the neon light from the diner illuminating her haggard face in weird reds and greens. I thanked her for the ride (I really DID appreciate it); she threw me a quarter and said, \"I'll buy you a cup of coffee. When you go in, tell 'em Nessie sent you.\" It was about this time that I noticed that she wasn't a truck driver at all, she was an 8 story crustacean from the paleolithic era. Goddamn loch ness monster, giving ME money when she looked like she needed it a lot worse than I did. \n\nI did the only gentlemanly thing to do- I politely declined, and gave her what little bit of cash I had on me for her fuel; I think I had about $3.50 on me.

{"body": "&gt;Why are you guys Atheists? If you knew a God existed (say He presents Himself) would you believe He exists?\n\n*Why* I am an atheist is a complicated question that would take a long time to answer.  If I knew that a god existed because it presented itself, I would have to believe.  By the same token, if someone captured the Loch Ness Monster, I would believe it exists.  At this point, both of these events seem highly unlikely.\n\n&gt;Were you at one point a Christian? What made you change? Do you blame the church?\n\nYes, raised Catholic.  The biblical narrative contradicts reality.  I'm sorry, but it does.  There was no Garden of Eden, hence no original sin, hence no need for a savior, hence Jesus, if he existed, was not divine.  I don't blame the church for me not believing.  I blame them for countless other wrongs they have done over the centuries, but not for having a religion that is stuck in the middle ages.\n\n&gt;If a connection with a God could only bring you so much to gain, and nothing to lose, why be an Atheist?\n\nAh, Pascal's Wager. The dichotomy between Christian and atheist is a false one.  There are countless other options, and the probability that you were born into the correct religion is infinitesimally small.  Furthermore, if I do not believe and only give lip service in hopes of some reward, your all-knowing god would see right through such a scam and I would be doomed anyway.  \n\n&gt;Is it possible that a God has allowed for humanity to learn about it's environment to a certain extent?\n\nNo, I doubt that.  Every time science pushes a boundary, the zealots among us claim that god has set what we are allowed to know and we shouldn't go farther.  But we always do, and there's no fire and brimstone.  We climbed Olympus, we crossed the seas, we landed on the moon, we cloned a sheep, and still not a peep from a deity.  \n\n&gt;Are you angry at a God? Meaning, you voice harsh opinions on this subreddit due to bad experience?\n\nThere's no god to be angry at.  As an American, Christians frustrate the hell out of me, mostly because the one's here have some crazy notions about god and Jesus, and most have never read the bible to know they're completely wrong. \n\nI appreciate you asking these questions.  You're young, and you're not being confrontational, so I won't complain about the fact that these are common things people ask of atheists.

{"body": "-I am an atheist because I have truly searched many religions to find truth, but I find them lacking. If a god of any kind made himself/herself/itself evident I would certainly convert because I am in search of truth. I would also apologize for my years of wrongness.\n\n-I was born and raised Roman Catholic, and yes, I do believe the church was largely responsible for my atheism, though not entirely. Certain choices the church had made (especially ones having nothing to do with the bible, such as their stance on abortion) were an early catalyst for me to start exploring the truth behind religion. I eventually went through an exploratory phase where I learned a lot about many religions, and for a while I even tried to almalgomate the truths behind them all, but eventually realized I was just inventing my own religion with practically no basis in reality. That is when I became Agnostic. I only started declaring myself an 'athiest' after learning a significant amount about Quantum physics which explained to me in very real terms how the universe could have actually come into being without a creator deity at all.\n\n-I used to ask this question a lot, but not about the Biblical God (whose stated mechanics are contrary to understood fact). I thought that a Diety could exist and could be allowing us to discover more about him through the methods we call 'Physics'. I even began thinking that in a way Physics is a God unto itself. In my current understanding of the world, I even allow for the fact that there could be something simply beyond my comprehension. I use the example of a Dog watching the President on TV. The dog can see an image of something, but without smell, without dimension, the President doesnt mean anything substantial to the Dog, yet he can feel the effects when the family who owns him moves to another house due to the descisions of the president affecting the family's financial status. All of this is outside the comprehension of the animal, as something like this could be unseen by Humans. However, as Humans continue to learn and explore, the questions that could be solved by a 'god' continue to shink. this means that there is less of a chance that God exists today than there was yesterday, and as time goes on this number will eventually approach 0. We have the capability to comprehend far more than we do now, and this comprehension will eventually eliminate the possibility of God.\n\n-I am not 'mad' at God. I dont think thats really possible for any true Athiest. It would be like asking if you were 'mad' at Santa or the Loch Ness Monster. I dont mean to belittle your beliefs with this statement, but to ask you if you could be mad at either of these.

{"body": "&gt; The preface with \"I graduated from Liberty Magna Cum Laude\" did an awful lot to throw up red flags.\n\nIt should raise red flags. Liberty University is horrible, I'm actually not proud at all that I graduated with that high of a GPA. But honestly, there were many excellent classes. The problem is, the ones that weren't... oh man... they were terrible.\n\nI also graduated with Highest Honors from ITT Technical Institute. I'm told that's a difficult school but to be honest I never felt I learned anything I didn't already or couldn't learn on my own. I just apparently am one of those people that seem to test well. Except when it matters, last week I took a test to qualify for a job with my City Engineering dept. Boy I failed that one with flying colors.\n\nNo man, no offense taken. Honestly I am only an occasional people person, which is not fair to other people, but that's my issue, not yours. Liberty, particularly Towns, was all about Presupposition. I'm a former Jehovah's Witness and I have a lot of \"religious baggage.\" Presupposition is just one of those hot button words for me, so I should be apologizing to you. So seriously man, my apologies. I shouldn't have unloaded on you. I'm sure your position is perfectly valid the way you formulate it.\n\n&gt; Why do you feel the need to justify the existence of God when the Bible already asserts that everyone knows He exists?\n\nI actually don't, and what you're saying here is dead set, from the Biblical point of view God's existence is never questioned. But in apologetics we deal with opponents who feel the Bible is irrelevant and that it's point of view is no more appropriate a validation of God's existence than the Book of Mormon or the Qur'an. This of course is a separate argument. \n\nI'm actually not saying God's existence *needs* to be justified, I'm saying that arguments for God's existence are valid. I'm saying that to say God's existence *does not* need to be justified is a red herring; in some, well many peoples minds who remain unconvinced, to whatever degree, this is probably the most important hurdle they may come across. They are fundamental to apologetics, and yeah, the argument that the Bible never questions that God exists is one of the valid ones. I'm just saying, include it. Don't ignore it. To those of us who are convinced, sure, it's not that big of a deal. Maybe interesting at times but it doesn't effect our faith. But to a lot of people... you just can't ignore it.\n\nAnd yes I also acknowledge that apologetics might answer \"Is there a God,\" but not \"Is it the God of Christianity.\" There are some imperfect arguments that do... it really depends on the situation. Which is why we study, and honestly if it serves to point to God I'm not the person to rule it out... \n\nI guess just from my personal background, people who say \"such and such is this way, because it can't be any other way, or it's obvious, or common sense,\" I'm extremely turned off to these people. Like, I literally do not believe in Common Sense. There's more evidence for UFO's, Big Foot, and the Loch Ness Monster than there is for Common Sense. And I believe in none of those things either.

{"body": "&gt; “Good Guys” in the patriarchy are harder to find than the Loch Ness monster in a desert. But according to many people I hear and talk to, “good guys” are everywhere. The propensity to acknowledge the shortcomings of men, overlook them even in obvious examples (such as gang-rape) and excuse their moral responsibility with the magic words, “But he is a good guy,” is an epidemic phenomena at the very least.\n&gt; \n&gt; “I am amazed continuously with the amount of forgiveness people are willing to grant men, as if the majority of rapes aren’t committed by them, as if the majority of businesses aren’t owned by them, as if they majority of pornography isn’t consumed, produced, and profitable to them, and, as if they aren’t somehow affected by the extreme privilege granted to their gender class.\n&gt; \n&gt; “By existing as men, men directly aid in the oppression of women.\n&gt; \n&gt; “Every time a man uses pornography, beats his wife or coerces a woman or dismisses or laughs at her, he is simultaneously denouncing her humanity and reaffirming his own. He does not just do this to amuse himself; her subjugation is a vehicle necessary for his continued existence. That is why men accepting responsibility and acknowledging their complicity in women’s oppression is so extremely uncommon. It is also why there is no such thing as a ‘good guy’ in the patriarchy.”\n&gt; \n\n- University of New Hampshire student Whitney Williams\n\n\n&gt;“Most people know the tragic tale of the Titanic, and one part in the movie and true story always struck me as a NeW lady: “Women and children first.” Chivalry is not about superiority or inferiority, and it does not trample equality. Chivalry is on a completely different level – acting out of concern and respect for those who you believe should be respected.\n\n&gt;“Even biologically and anthropologically, the male traditionally acts on behalf of the female because she is important – perhaps more important than himself.  Being a gentleman is a selfless and natural way of life, not one that diminishes women or elevates men.”\n\n#\n\n- The Network of Enlightened Women\n\n&gt; “Boys in a ‘crisis’? in my grandmother’s day, only men could vote. When I was a girl, only boys could play sports. In the Roman Catholic Church, only men can be priests. In certain societies today and throughout history, girls can’t attend school, and women can’t work or show their faces in public. In China, girl babies are discarded because boys are favored.\n&gt; \n&gt; “In America, glass ceilings block females from access to power, money and leadership. On playgrounds, a common taunt among boys falls along these lines: ‘You cry/act/talk/throw like a girl.’ So for the fraction of a nanosecond in human history that boys are perceived to be on the short end of the stick compared with girls, you call this a ‘crisis’? C’mon, guys. You take a turn at second-class status for once.”\n\n- Sandra J. Anderson, former professor of law at Ohio State University\n\n&gt; “The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race.”\n\n - Dr. Sally Miller Gearhart, in her article “The Future – If There Is One – Is Female,” ironically featured in a later book promoting nonviolence: Reweaving the Web of Life: Feminism and Nonviolence, p. 266\n\n&gt; “Everybody wants to tax somebody else: Tax the rich, tax the fat, tax the bald, tax pet owners, gum chewers and those who like manicures. I would like to offer a different solution: Let’s tax men. In fact, let’s tax men a lot, more than they’re already being taxed, and let’s not tax women at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; “Sound fair to you? Good. Me too.\n&gt; \n&gt; “After all, women are not the ones wrecking the nation’s infrastructure. We’re not the ones shooting at the “No U-turn” signs on rural highways. It’s not women who are trying to make our names as graffiti artists. You’ll rarely find a bunch of broads gathered together attempting to create weapons of mass destruction or figuring out how to really get ahead in next year’s arms race.\n&gt; \n&gt; “We’re not the ones running Fortune 500 companies into the ground or manipulating the stock market. As many people have noted, had the firm been called Lehman’s Sisters it might not have gone down the fiscal toilet, taking Wall Street’s profits with it.”\n\n- Dr. Gina Barreca, in her article “Send Men the Bill – They Made the Mess” in The Courant, 10/6/11.\n\nBut of course, feminism is just about equality. These are just strawmen, right? These women do not exist, right? \n\nThe fact that you find it okay to say that every man is an potential rapist should be just as offensive to you as saying every black man is a potential thief, or every Jew is a potential fraudster. And me finding that logic offensive equals me being a potential rapist? \n\nThere isn't a pressure for men to just jump out into the workforce, there hasn't been for a few decades. Now the pressure is to get a good education so you can get a good job so you can be a good provider.\n\n&gt;You mean the cultural standard that women are weak and to be victimized is backfiring?!\n\nThis is idiotic. It's the cultural standard of protecting women, and letting men suffer. In Norway we welcome men at 90% of our shelters. That is not a result of feminism, it's a result of human decency.

{"body": "Somewhat throwaway account for reasons you'll come to find out:\n\nBack in November of 2007 I was living off of bread and butter, literally. I was flat broke. I just got laid off from my job. Life was hard. I was contemplating suicide. \n\nI decided to do a little side job as a buddy of mine was a mall Santa and was able to pull a few strings to get me a job. I thought it would be a good idea so that I could take my mind off the slump I was in. \n\nIt wasn't bad at first, common things kids asked me for were Puppy That Grows and Knows Your name (girls) and Nintendo Wiis (boys). It became tedious. Day in and day out of the same requests. A couple of kids peeing on me here and there (poor things were scared shitless of a fat dude in a red suit) mixed with the judging eyes of the parents making sure I stayed in character drove me insane. How insane? One day I decided that I was going to off myself. I fashioned a noose that morning and was going to do it when I got home from what I thought my last day of work ever.\n\nI get in and it's 3 hours of spoiled rotten kids. Except for one. I'll never forget him. He was the happiest child I had ever laid my eyes on. I could tell that he came from an impoverished family as his shirt was full of holes and he reeked of BO and feces.  \n\nHe sat on my lap and I gave my spiel: \n\n\"Ho Ho Ho! Merry Christmas, young man! What can Santa bring you?\"\n\nI shit you not he looked me dead in the eye and said:\n\n\"I wish you were happy.\"\n\nThere he was, this poor kid that didn't have shit asking for the happiness of a stranger. \n\nA tear rolled down my cheek and he asked why I was crying.\n\n\"Well son, Santa has never met such a selfless young man! You're wish has already came true.\"\n\nI went home that day and burned the noose. That kid changed my life. I applied for a couple of positions in the area and landed a high-paying job. Been there ever since. I was hoping to run into that kid again so I could repay him for what he had done for me but the sad thing is that in 2011 I was reading the paper when I stumbled across his obituary. I attend his funeral and was talking to his mother. He had been struck by a bus while trying to help a disabled man walk across the street.\n\nI asked her if there was anything I could do for her and you want to know what she requested?\n\nAbout tree fiddy.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383626781", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 38, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In my early days as a Raid Leader in WoW i had a player that was amazing. He was phenomenal at his class and would always whisper good tips and generally had a great handle on pretty much every aspect of a fight. I valued and relied on his input a lot, he simply was the best player in the guild. But he never talked in Vent, said he didn't have a mic. As happens, people came and went and it got to the point that i absolutely needed him. I pulled him into a private chat one day and asked him for his address so i could mail him a headset. Much to my surprise he keyed his mic and said he had one. He explained that he had a pretty bad stutter and was extremely shy. He just always avoided talking. I set up some bindings so he could talk directly to me and only me. I also encouraged him to throw random comments out in public. He didn't have to go into a lengthy explanation, just an occasional \"roger that\" or something. \n\nAfter a little while he got extremely used to talking to me, we would chat over heroics and generally played a lot together. After a while we quit using the private binding in our daily heroic grind. Gradually the whole guild came to know him. I pointed out how he had chatted over the mic with every single guild member in a heroic. How he had no problem giving us shit when we screwed up from laziness. Pretty much from that day forward he started using his public key. He started slow at first, just pointing out small things or chiming in on a certain aspect. But before long he was recognized as a guy that new his shit. The entire guild would quiet when he started to talk and patiently wait for him to finish, hell we knew what he was saying was important. When i eventually left them to join a world ranking guild he was the one i left in charge. \n\nMuch to my surprise he led my old guild to a much higher rank than my current. It got to the point i was begging him to let me back in. But my spot had been filled. He was a honorable person and would not kick a core player out just because i wanted back in. So i talked to the other guy. He said he would bow out, all i had to do was pay him. So i said “God Damnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain’t gonna give you no tree fiddy!\". Then he laughed and melted in front of my eyes and lo and behold it was the Lich King! My friend rushed to my defense and took the blow that surely would kill me. As i watched him fall all i could think about was the tender moments we shared. I cradled him in my arms as the Lich King sucked out his soul to be imprisoned forever. \n_________________________________\n\nTLDR - stutterer became world ranking guild leader, all he needed was a little encouragement.

He said she was just standing there, staring at him, and he ran out of the room. This isn't a story he tells, he truly believes he saw a ghost and you could't change his mind with a gun to his head.  \n\nAnother one of the things he believes, because he is so highly gullible to anything, he believes in the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot. I believe it is from the stupid history channel special that have \"*evidence*\".

{"body": "These two events occurred on the same day years ago. Pretty sure they forced me to get my drivers license.\n\nMy friend and I took the bus downtown to go see a movie. I think it was the first Transformers (Michael Bay). Being the young fucks we are, we sit at the back of the bus. Shortly after, an older fellow with a big, bulky coat comes aboard and sits beside us. He then starts to chat us up, generally giving his old-man complaints while bitching about how he has to take public transportation ever since the gov't revoked his license after his sixth DUI or some such. \n\nI wasn't really paying attention to the conversation, as while he was talking, he was pulling out block after block after block of high quality, expensive cheese from his jacket. Just cheese of all sorts. Gouda, smoked cheddar, asiago, Parmesan, oka, you name it and he had it. This guy was a walking dairy farm. And he just kept pulling it out.\n\nWhen it was finally all on the seat (which was like 20+ blocks) he looked at us dead in the eyes and asked \"Do you guys want some cheese?\" My friend answered first \"Uh, how much?\" Leaning back, the old man told us \"I'll need about tree fiddy.\" It was at that point that I realized that the old man was - No, I kid, this actually happened. When he asked us if we wanted any cheese we politely declined, he collected it all back up and got off the bus.\n\nThe next story is a little shorter - on the way back from the movie we were a stop away from our transfer. This kid gets on (aboriginal, mid teens) and sits down in front of us. All is normal until the bus starts moving, and this kid proceeds to slump over to the side into the window as blood starts running down the side of his head onto the glass. We nope'd, told the bus driver about the potential dead kid in the back, and got off the bus at our stop.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383844003", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Except as he's going through the line they run out of candy bars and Ike and instead of just letting the kids meet the players, they abruptly end the whole thing. Garber's left behind, literally blocking the kids from seeing their idols. He takes Opara aside, specifically and says, \"You probably would have disappointed him anyway. Now here's tree fiddy, go buy yourself a soda.\"\n\nOpara swore from that day on he would one day play a sporting event so big it would make Garber take notice and finally admit he wasn't a disappointment. \n\nAnd today, on Twitter, Opara made his dreams come true.

You were saying that there is no ceiling to how high MW can go up, which I interpreted to mean it could escalate to the extreme.  \n\nIt's a argument without grounds in rationality or logic because MW is not intended to make everyone middle/upper class.  It is intended to be a livable wage.  If people require government assistance to afford the things they need on a daily basis, that means MW is not high enough. \n\n&gt;Are you dense?\n\nNow look who is being intellectually dishonest.  You linked me to a home page without any deer skin clothing,  and a youtube video of caves on a property that are not being used as a residence.

When I get back upstairs, she's awake and asks why I didn't make her a sandwich.  I tell her she was asleep and she says she wasn't (she was, the narcoleptic liar) and that I should go make her one.  I tell her I've run out of bread and so she says that she wants to eat mine.  Not \"Can we split it?\", not \"Can I have something else?\", just \"Give me that sandwich\".  \n\nI tell her she can have a bite, but that this motherfucker is my dinner, all the while thinking about how this shit wouldn't fly if the roles were reversed.  \"Nice place ya got here, I like your vagina, now make me a sandwich\" doesn't play all that well, but I digress. \n\nShe groans - and not in the good way, mind you - and says she doesn't want it anymore, but instead wants some of my chips.  I've got plenty of chips and who doesn't like a little sea salt and vinegar after that many orgasms, so I'm of course perfectly happy to oblige her.  There is one condition, however, which is no chips in the bed.  There is no way to eat potato chips in a bed without leaving crumbs everywhere.  It's simply not humanly possible.  If you're like me and enjoy the feeling of warm sheets on your bare ass, you know that Pringle's pieces to a penis are the modern equivalent of a pea to a princess, but I tell her that she can sit up and join me if she'd like.  \n\nShe groans again - still not in the good way - and says to just give her a bite of the sandwich.  She sits up enough to take it and starts chomping on my sandwich.  I tell her to take it easy (because it's my dinner, goddamnit) and she stares at me, right into my bewildered, starving eyes and literally stuffs her face with my sandwich.  This wasn't a playful, \"Oh yeah, what are ya gonna do, spank me?\" kinda much-fest, it was a petulant fucking asshole trying to have a goddamn staring contest with me over a sandwich.  \n\nAt this point, it's not even about the sandwich.  There's a principle at stake.  I don't buy the sex as the start of a quid pro quo negotiation thing.  It's not something to use as a bargaining chip, withheld or dispensed in a bartering battle of the sexes.  It's a one night stand.  We both got off (some more than others, but I'm no Marxist, so fuck it) and we're even.  If she wanted food, she could have food, but not chips in the bed and not my *last fucking sandwich*.  We are now in a guest-host scenario and while I'm more than happy to feed your sandwich stealing ass, a good guest is a respectful guest.  \n\nI tell her to give me my fucking sandwich and she does and after I eat what's left of it (and offer her something else to eat, by the way) I hop back in bed to watch some more TV.  She then enters complain-about-everything mode and my patience is wearing thin.  After trying to Bogart the covers, bitch about my lack of cuddling (I don't cuddle, fucking sue me), and criticize my decor, she has the gall to say the show I was watching (*Community*, by the way) sucked.  \n\nI told her she had officially lost her re-vite privileges and that she should enjoy the last night she'd ever spend in my room.\n\nShe got dressed and left.\n\nI watched three more episodes and slept with such a wide stance I took up the whole bed.  And no, there's no tree fiddy jokes coming, although I'll take a hellbound she-devil over a Harmon-hating sandwich thief any day.  \n\ntl;dr: Shows before ho's.

{"body": "It was the holidays and I was shopping at the local mall with family.  Now the mall is no way equipped to handle the holiday rush and neither were their bathrooms.  About an hour into the ordeal my stomach started to make the noises letting me know that an assault was coming.  The mall bathrooms were already packed and overflowing, so being super smart I held out till we stopped at a local sandwich chain that had its own bathrooms, assuming they would be a bit more sanitary.  I entered the bathroom and there was only a guy using the urinal and I celebrated my small victory as I was ready to unleash.  When I entered the stall to my horror I saw the seat had shit smeared all across it.  I was ready to burst at this point and had neither the time nor the materials to clean.  I also knew I would never make it to the nearest mall restroom, so I went into hover mode.  I mounted up best I could and aimed at the toilet.  As I was prepping my shot another person came in to use the urinal.  I tried to hold out but I couldn't and my ass unloaded a torrent of wet shit like a shotgun blast.  About 75% hit the toilet area, but the other 25% of wet christmas colored shit struck the floor and the wall.  The man at the urinal yelled in disgust and stormed out of the bathroom.  I quickly tried to clean myself when I heard the bathroom door open again.  I got as quiet as I could, then I heard the knock on the stall door.  I couldn't speak,  but continued to try to clean myself ready to run out of the stall and into the mall like a mad man.  The person knocked on the stall again, I peered through the crack and saw what I assumed was an irritated manager holding a mop.  I feebly said occupied and finished cleaning myself.  I then desperately tried to think how I could rectify this situation, when the man knocked again.  I said occupied more firmly this time an asked the man if he needed something?  The mans voice rang through the small bathroom and he said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\"\nAt this point I opened the stall door and realized the man was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the palezoic era.   So I said \"I ain't giving you no treefiddy you goddam Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddam money!\".  With that I ran out of the bathroom, leaving my horror behind, free to enjoy my holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383904574", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "This seems about my time to share. I'm sure this is far from the craziest around, but figured you'd enjoy.\n\nAbout two years ago I had a friend who bartended a club in Seattle. Now I'm not the biggest of guys, but they were short on security due to some flakes and said friend convinced management that I knew what I was doing (suffice to say I didn't) and I was worth the extra pairs of eyes. Had I known what was coming that night, I would've most happily forgone those few hours of work...\n\nSo I get to the club and I'm paired up with another guy - this dude is bloody huge; 6' something and big enough that most people could wrap their arms half way around them. The first few hours were pretty uneventful - mostly watching the crowd trickle in and the night get started. The club starts getting hopping and I'm thinking this has to be the best gig ever.... I'm get paid to just hang out and listen to decent music. The gods love a joke.\n\nSo I'm scanning the crowd and my coworker for the night, Steve, hit me on the shoulder and gives me a \"follow me\" nod. He moves through the parting crowd, and I follow in his wake, when we come upon some dumb-ass thinking it would for some reason be a good idea to smoke a blunt in a crowded club.... my mind's blow already. Steve walks up this this guy calm as hell and just says \"put it out or get out. What's this guy do? Oh of course he doesn't put it out, that'd be way too easy, no he decides fuck it... I'm going to \"put it out\" by smoking the whole fucking thing as fast a I can. Steve was not happy. \n\nHe grabs this guy's wrist with one hand, and takes the blunt with the other, and smothers it in his fist. I have to assume he got a little burnt by it, but he never indicated as such. Well this guy, we'll call him Bob, flips his shit. Not the usual hey screw you kind of flip you shit, no. This guy trips out like someone just killed his cat. He starts screaming and takes a swing, hitting Steve in the shoulder. Now Steve is annoyed.\n\nI try to step in to help defuse the situation but Bob's having none of that. Well it turns out Bob's not alone; he has some friends with him. These friends apparently think their number advantage is going to do them some good against a monolith of a man. The four of them collapse on Steve (who's still holding Bob by the wrist) and start getting in his face whilst the crowd around naturally parts because hell... who wants to be a part of that. \n\nI'm standing their dumbstruck; this was supposed to be an simple gig... what am I supposed to do now? I needn't have worried at that point. Steve just literally picks Bob up under his arm like a freaken kid and just starts walking to the door. It's at this point I realize I should never be a bouncer and I should leave it to monsters. A few other staff members are reacting now and Steve starts to make his way towards the exit. Needless to say Bob has gone from freaking out to straight up kicking and screaming like a baby... I wouldn't be surprised if a few people caught a fist or foot in the kerfuffle. \n\nWell they finally make it to the door and Bob's dropped outside. I figure at this point we had our absurdities but we're done.  NOPE. Clearly getting kicked out of club is an even bigger insult than losing a blunt for this guy and he wants to make something of it. What on-one knew at the time was this guy actually had connections. Bob is demanding he be let back inside and Steve's just giving him a fuck no blockoff. Finally he storms off with his friends clearly pissed as hell.\n\nAbout two hours later he shows back up trying to get in. Steve notices him at the door and starts heading over just in case while giving a \"no\" head-shake to the doorman. He gets over the entrance and Bob starts giving him even more shit talking about how he's a dead man etc. Everyone had just wrote him off as kinda crazy by this point. \n\nSuddenly he composes himself all calm and and asks \"seriously, what do I need to do to get back in\"? Steve just turns to h him and says \"\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized Steve was a 80 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. How had I missed that? Bob seemed in shock as he came to this realization as well: \"God damnit Nessie,  I ain't givin you no tree fiddy\". Clearly this was not the answer Steve was looking for, so he proceeded to pick Bob back up again, this time with his mouth, and start carrying him down the street.\n\nI wish I could say I saw either of them after that but he disappeared off into the night. My friendship with the bartender broke apart after that as we both realized we'd seen enough of this god-forsaken city and moved onto separate paths. Some days I still do wonder though what happened to them, and can fathom why it didn't make the news. I mean something like that? The things that slip under the radar these days...\n\n**TL;DR: Co-worker kicks someone sketch out, shit goes down, everything turns out ... just fucking read it you lazy bastards**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383904831", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied.\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\n\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.\nThey were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point\n.\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\n\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\n\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.\ntl;dr: Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.\n\ni had to", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383919186", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I got my first car payment at age 29. Before that I'd always just saved until I could afford what I wanted. Now, being \"forced\" to pay it back with interest makes me feel way poorer. Here's why! \n\nBasically, on a car loan, you're paying back the amount borrowed, and paying the bank interest to boot (how they make money). If you can save your money and put it into a high yield savings account until you can afford the car, you won't be paying the bank interest, the bank is paying YOU interest until you pull the money to buy the car. \n\nFor example. If you take a $10,000 auto loan at 5% for 60 months, your monthly payment is $189/mo. Of that, on average, $22.05 is interest. That's not bad, right? Wrong! Over 60 months, you'll end up paying $1323 in interest. Suddenly, that \"5%\" is really over 13%.\n\nIf you save the EXACT SAME money personally at $189/month (also for 60 months), and deposit it into an account at 1%, you'll end up with $11,624. \n\nInstead of you paying the bank $1323 for having them lend you the money, the bank is paying you almost $300 in interest alone, and the extra $1,000 comes from depositing the money you would've been paying them in interest! \n\nThat's a net difference of $1,600 just in interest. Total net savings is going to be $2947. Which goes without saying, is a lot of money. \n\nI should start saving again. Anyone got Tree Fiddy?

He decided to live just then.  Ice broke and crackled behind him.  Once he'd got to his feet, all he saw there was a few small arrows with shiny black heads.

For a while I thought Charles(the man's name) was my Dad, then I thought he was my Mom's boyfriend. Charles would knock on our door, drink some coffee with my Ma, he'd help her around the house, he played cards with me and chess, and catch. He was really like a father figure for me. I came to love Charles.\n\nOne day Charles and Ma went upstairs into her room together. Something they had never done. I was old enough, like 13 or 14, to know that if Charles was her boyfriend, they were probably having sex. But alas, I was curious and decided to investigate. I peered in through Ma's bedroom door, being careful not to nudge it while I angled my face to see through the small crack. \n\nCharles reached into his jacket and pulled out a brown package. He handed it to Ma. Then Ma reached under her bad and put the package in a shoebox. She hugged Chalres, not in a romantic way or anything but in a sincere, \"thank you so much for your kindness\" way. \n\nThe next day I looked into that shoebox, it was FULL of money.

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied. When I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\n\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned. Me and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him. They were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak. Near the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point . The day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you MattZeAwesome, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as\n I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize an hour had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life. \n\ntl;dr: Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.\ni had to", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384014345", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 26, "controversiality": 0}

Just fucking 10's. Women who typically pay me no attention.\n\nSo they stumble in and are giggling, joking, arguing over where to give directions, and are pretty much all over each other being very touchy-feely. Both are wearing skirts and tube tops. So I begin driving to where I believe is one of their homes. Were merging on to the highway and they're both crazy rowdy in the back, yelling, taking pictures, flashing the camera and I'm trying to stay focused, but come on. Two drunk girls with D cups pulling their shirts down in the backseat?\n\"God I just wanted to get laid tonight, why do some boys have so much fucking trouble being men?\" one of them slurs.\n\"The night is fuckin youuung\" the other yells, \"hey cabbie when's your shift over? We got some rolls and an empty apartment!!\" Seems a boyfriend was out of town. \n\nSo I'm getting back off the highway, trying to ignore a situation that is becoming both very arousing and obnoxious. We pull up to an apartment complex and there is panic in the backseat. It seems one of them left her purse at the bar and can't pay. I fucking knew it. So they invite me in where they assure me will be cash or a credit card. I say I'll wait in the car.\n\n10 minutes passes, 15 minutes, theyre fucking passed out and I'm knocking on 20. I walk to the door, knock, and wait. The door is ajar so I push it and step in. Both are mostly naked in the kitchen, making out and giggling over some spilled shot glasses and then stop when they see \nme. Im angry about money but I hadnt dated in years and these two looked like Victoria's fucking Secret models. One bites her lip and smiles and the other walks up to me and puts my hands on her young amazing breasts and moved them around to massage her nipples. \"So how much do we owe you again?\" she whispers in my ear.

The room was expensive, $300 a night, but I really had to be there, so I was just sort of basking in the amenities as much as possible, even though I knew it was going to come out of my pocket.\n\nThe room was great, and I took advantage of every little perk the hotel had to offer - cheaper drinks at the hotel bar, free hot towels, ice delivery - everything that didn't cost money.\n\nAfter day 1, I wanted to start really blowing cash and started ordering room service. I got burgers and champagne and all kinds of decadence just thrown up to my room. It was great. Then came the day that I actually had to be somewhere, the entire purpose of the trip itself.\n\nI pre-ordered a breakfast that consisted of 8 strips of bacon, a bottle of newcastle, and some scrambled eggs, but I've got a weird thing about eggs. They have to be *really* cooked or else I can't deal. I made a note specifically about the eggs and the newcastle, submitted my order, and went to sleep.\n\nIn the morning I am greeted by my breakfast, and sure enough, the newcastle brown ale is there with it. It seemed like such a \"diet Hunter Thompson\" thing to do, so I was really happy with it. But then I notice the eggs.\n\nThe eggs are *not* well done at all. They're slimy. This would not be a big deal except that the breakfast cost me about $24, and egg requests should not be alien to a hotel that charges $300 a night.\n\nI ended up filling out a comment card for the hotel, bitching about the eggs, and forgot about it.\n\n2 weeks later I get a letter in the mail clearly and specifically addressing the whole egg issue. It read as follows (As best as I can remember):\n\n*\"Dear nutbastard,*\n\n*We are sorry to hear that your breakfast on the morning of 07/22/08 did not meet your expectations regarding the manner in which your eggs were prepared.

{"body": "This is one of those questions that's really hard to answer in just one way. There are so many things about the Amish lifestyle that I don't even know where to start. When I first came out as Amish to my Atheist parents, they were appalled. How could I deny the euphoric logic of Richard Dawkins and Neil deGrasse Tyson? They prayed to the flying spaghetti monster every day for a month, begging him to exude his tomato sauce onto my soul and save me from entering heaven.\n\nI tried to tell them that it wasn't my choice. That I was born Amish. But they either didn't believe me or couldn't handle the truth. I ran away, hitchhiking across the Texas border on the backs of Mexicans until I reached the promised land that every Amish man dreams to go: Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was here that I began to live the monastic lifestyle of a redditor. As the ancient mantra proclaims, \"smoke weed e'ry day\". I rigidly followed this doctrine as I meditated to Pink Floyd in my hot box. I was on a vision quest; a rite of passage for any Amish.\n\nThen, as if from nowhere, I heard a voice inside of my head. It begun as a whisper but then grew gradually louder until it was a crackling roar inside my head. A blinding light filled my eyes and I ran outside my hotbox only to realize that a dangerously discarded doobie had set the entire forest alight. Stinking of weed and covered in cheeto dust, I ran for the hills screaming about libertarianism and bitcoins. As I reached the aphex of the mountain, I saw a man there. He was my spirit guide; a man so ethereal his very voice could sway the philosophical beliefs of the entire world: Carl Sagan. He said to me in his calm and intelligent voice, \"about tree fiddy.\" I'll never forget those words just as I'll never forget Colby. They will be on the back of my eyelids at the moment I die and go to hell.\n\nAnd that, my enlightened friends, is what it's like to be Amish.\n\nEh?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384078702", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

So sunday, I've smoked abouuuuuut 15 bowls and I was high as shit. Well, one of the last artists was a man named [Chief Keef](http://i.imgur.com/lPxnluV.jpg). Not exactly my favorite rapper, in fact I think he is responsible for a lot of the violence in my city, but his music is catchy, and he gives a shoutout to Derrick Rose in one of his songs, so that's pretty awesome. But I always like to listen to every artist, so I'm like the only white guy in the crowd of 3,000 black people. \n\nA little after he's done, Vampire Weekend went up, and all of white people flock back to the stage, while most of the black people leave. I get to rush to the front, and I'm up close. So we're dancing white people style, (me \"white person who is extremely high\" style), and I see this really cute girl, who also looks high. I go up to her and go \"Hey, I'm Chief Keef\" hoping it would break the ice as a joke. She gets this stunned look on her face and goes \"REALLY? I've never met a celebrity before!\" I can't believe this works, and we start dancing. \n\nShe's grinding on me, and we're really having fun. All of a sudden, she grabs my hand and we start walking away from the stage. Just about every body is watching VW, as they're the last act of the festival. She takes me behind the stage, and we start making out.\n\nThings are getting pretty hot, and I ask if she wants to have sex. She goes \"Absolutely Chief, but I need something that only a rapper can give me.\" And I go \"What's that baby?\" And she says \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that this concert hook up was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

It would probably be the first Pokemon I caught.\n\n* Yanmega - Chances are good I would be searching for Pokemon in the swampy areas near my house, around the creek that flows into the Lake; dragonflies are a plentiful in these locations, Yanma would be a relatively common sight. (Bugs in general, in my area but I suppose this makes sense around the world... aside from fireflies and spiders, I figured Yanma would be relatively uncommon compared to other regions)\n\n* Milotic - Due to the toxicity in Lake Erie, at least in my area, there are very few species of fish to choose from. Feebas is a hardy fish that can survive in terrible conditions; not to mention, our lake has it's fair share of \"Loch Ness monster\" sightings. Carp are seen in a lake to the south but I doubt I would travel there to capture a Magikarp.\n\n* Noivern - Bats are very common in the summer months, I expect that Noibat would be among them; I chose Noibat over Woobat simply based on looks, I really dislike Woobat's design, although I expect they would be common in this area as well. I highly doubt I would see many Zubat, however, due to Golbat's penchant for blood-drinking; Vampire bats do not live in my region.\n\n---\n\nAside from Sawsbuck, my team has a weakness to Electric-types. However, regionally, there are likely very few electric Pokemon that would live in my area; there are huge communities of Mennonites in this area who use comparatively no electricity. Pikachu might be common, being that they live in forested areas and we are prone to huge summer thunderstorms. But I don't think I'd be running into any trainers with a Magneton, Luxray, or Lanturn; they simply don't live in my area. The only possibility is Mareep, as it is a rural farming community.\n\nIce-types would also be a problem. Oddly enough, even though we have some brutal winters, Snover is really the only Pokemon that would have adapted to live in this region.\n\nMilotic checks both Rock and Fire weaknesses. Though I doubt either type would be common in my area.\n\nI would likely face a lot of trainers using Pokemon like Tauros and Miltank, beasts of burden and the like. Ponyta would also likely be common for this same reason.\n\n---\n\nThere are a ton of ways I could have build my team, based on my surroundings; I just went with what seemed cool and realistic considering my region. \n\nThe possibilities are really endless; Mudkips probably live in the swampy areas, Teddiursa are seen occasionally in the woods, there's a billion Buneary that live in my front yard, Fearow patrol the skies looking to pick-off scurrying field Rattata, Wingull love to crowd in flocks on the beaches and in the Walmart parking lot (lol).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384171281", "subreddit": "pokemon", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

We were making out, and then she got up and sat in my lap cowgirl style. She then whispered in my ear, \"This is so hot, I want to do it here.\" She then unziped me as I sat there frozen for a moment, and began blowing me right then and there. After a few minutes of a sloppy bj, she unziped her own pants and climbed in my lap, and we started going at it. I was already pretty close, and as far I knew she wasn't on the pill, so I didn't want to come inside her. All the sudden a light came on from the right, and there was a movie dude with a flashlight pointed at us.

{"body": "My one night stand sex story took place a long time ago. It was highschool, I was the kid who put more emphasis on school than I did on social workings and thus I really only had two or three good friends. Ergo, we were pretty much nerds. Regardless, I had my eye on this girl named Emily. Now, she isn't the storybook \"cheerleader miss popular\", she was just an average girl that I thought was quite pretty (and rather attractive).\n\nSo to begin, in senior year I ended up in a simple history class with her. I had taken a precursor class similar to that one before so it wasn't all that difficult, and after we got our first test back guess who was struggling? None other than dream girl numero uno, Emily. I told the teacher I would be open to tutoring anyone who was struggling, and the oblivious Mr. Almond referred me to her the very next day. I was standing putting my books in my locker when she walked up to me, but she walked up behind the open door and I didn't see her. I closed the door and she was right there and I screamed and sort of half lunge jumped. Unfortunately I knocked her water bottle right into her face and it pretty much soaked her.\n\nI apologized profusely and she couldn't stop laughing. My fuck up worked, I was in. We set up a time to study, and to my surprise, she volunteered her house. We would go over every Monday and every other Wednesday night to review, often alone in her room. Of course over this time I tried subtly flirting and I started to get hints she would flirt back. After about two months of this, it heat its peak. It's climax.\nIt was a Wednesday night, we were alone upstairs as her parents had gone somewhere, I think maybe to dinner but I don't quite remember. We were reviewing the roman town of Corinth when we took a study break. \"Hey I need your opinion on something!\" She said.\n(Note, this was second semester and hot weather was approaching) \"Can you tell me if this bathing suit looks good?\"\n\nNow I know what you are thinking, no fucking way in hell right? Same thing I thought. My 18 year old body trembled at the thought of her beautiful curving body scantily clad. \"Sure!\" I mustered, approvingly. She grabbed one from her closet and went to the bathroom to change. I awkwardly stood up and began just gazing around the room, looking at some pictures. Then the door opened, slowly. I turned and there she was, in a tiny red bikini. Holy fuck! We made eye contact for what felt like five minutes until she walked forward and pushed me down on the bed.\n\nWe started kissing, and I had basically no idea what I was doing but it was certainly working. That's when she, now on top of me, sat up and looked at me. \"Do you want to have some fun?\" She smirked. \"Do you?\" I (almost smoothly) attempted in return. \"Yes, but I'm going to need one thing first.\" \"What's that?\" I said, body trembling. \"Well, I'm going to need about tree-fiddy.\" It was then that I realized Emily wasn't a girl but an 8 story tall leviathan from the Paleozoic era! That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! How could I have let this happen?\n\nMy friends asked me the next day how it went and I could only shrug and say maybe next time. I had just come so close to steaming hot sex but I had came up a little short. It haunts me to this day.\n\ntl;dr was a nerd in highschool, tutored my mega crush, came super close to everything but had a terrible awkward meltdown mid session.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384294713", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 30, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well... as one of the previously disparaged happy Kimber owners... I'll throw my two bits into the ring:\n\nI purchased a TLE II in 2007 and put 1,937 rounds through the gun before it was stolen in 2010. I had 3 failures to feed and 1 failure to eject, all out of a powder puff handload I had designed for a S&amp;W 625 (want the exact load? I make a lot of notes). The gun was consistent, had no rust issues (Did not carry it much, and I'm a bit of a clean freak when it comes to my guns). I replaced the springs with Wolff springs, used Wilson Combat 47D's almost exclusively and swapped out the grips with some thin rosewoods. I miss that gun.\n\nHaving said that, if I was to purchase another 1911 at this time it would most likely not be a Kimber. They're not offering me exactly what I want, and in a 1911, I might as well get that.\n\nI'm going to have to point out something OP: You rag all over MIM. Yet the Spartan/Trojan line are Armscor guns with MIM parts flowing out of every orifice. That's not to say they're bad, but the only thing STI does to them is the slide/frame/barrel fitting, otherwise they're yet another Armscor clone. Same thing goes for the lower end Springfield offerings and Rugers. In a 1911, MIM isn't a terrible thing, especially when it puts a solid gun into a new gunner's hand at a price point they can live with.\n\nI would, after working for a major distributor and owning more than my fair share give this advice:\n\nBelow $500:\nSave your money. If you can find a used low end Springfield/STI Spartan or if you know what you're doing and can debug some of the low price turkish offerings, go for it. Otherwise, save the money and heartache.\n\n$500-800\nThere's a lot of good stuff in here. Springfield, STI Spartan/Trojan, Low end Kimbers (again, look for the problems that ARE known with each brand), Ruger and maybe the Remington. I'm still out on that one, some of the early ones I saw had teething issues. Stay away from used Colts in this price range, they're here for a reason. Also, fuck Taurus. I've seen more failures out of Taurus than I saw out of mid 90's Colts. I'd rather have a mid 90's Colt and nobody should want one of those.\n\n$800-2000\nMaybe Kimber under 1k. The real problem is their low end guns are built out of the same parts as their top end guns, just with less finish options and shiny do-dads. Solid guns at 750, terrible at 1500. In here is where you can start having real fun. Springfield, Midrange STI, Dan Wesson (My preference in this range), Sig, S&amp;W if you can stomach an external extractor or semi-custom stuff is what's good in here. Para Ordinance has been much better since moving, seeing good stuff out of them now (still stay away from the LDA). At the upper end of this section, some of the \"almost custom\" houses like Les Baer should be considered. Or, if you know a 1911 smith who doesn't have a 10 year backlog, go for it on a Caspian or other decent donor frame.\n\n2000-Blingtastic\nYou're paying custom money, get custom. Start with the right frame/slide and make sure you know exactly what you want. Your smith might be Jesus with a fucking file, but unless he's got a name like Clark or Novak, you're not getting your money out if it's not JUST right. From front sight to beavertail, every part should have a pretty solid write-up on exactly what you want. Finish, rounding, material, etc. I like STI's in this range, but not everyone likes race guns. Ed Brown does solid work. Wilson Combat used to, but I've not seen their work in the last ~10 years up close.\n\n*Edit: Most custom guns aren't gonna get the money out, even with big names on them.

{"body": "CONTINUED FROM ABOVE:  I was almost asleep when out of the blue, I felt the tips of her fingers slide under my waistband.  Was this it? Was this the moment I was waiting for?  I didn't move.  She left her hand there for a while with her fingers resting just inside my boxers touching my pubic hair.  It seemed she realized what it would mean if she took the next step; she had to decide whether or not it was worth it to take the risk.  At that point, it still was not too late for her to pull her hand back out and pretend it was all an accident if I woke up.  \"Oops, sorry!\" and that would be it.\n\nMeanwhile, I felt my cock grow to within a mere fraction of an inch of touching her fingers.  It was adjacent to her hand at that point, and after a very short while, I could feel it pressing on my waistband, begging to be set free.  I didn't know how long I was going to be able to hold out before just letting loose on her hand.  After a long pause, I felt her hand shift slightly as she slowly extended her pinky just enough to touch the head of my throbbing cock.  I was frozen with anticipation. This couldn't be accidental. She moved her pinky back and forth ever so slightly over the head of my penis, and I thrust my hips forward a bit and groaned softly as my cock begged for more. Finally I had what I wanted. Finally all those days and months of dreaming had paid off.  \n\nIn that instant I knew she had been dreaming the same way I had been all this time.  I knew this was what she wanted all along.  I had to hear her say it.  No more innuendo and beating around the bush.  No more elephant in the room.  I had to know right that very moment that this was really happening and that the culmination of my dreams was manifesting itself right there before my eyes.  \n\nShe turned to face me and I looked deeply into her eyes.  She knew that I was awake.  She didn't stop.  This continued for what seemed like an eternity before I finally worked up the nerve to force the words out of my mouth: \"Mom, what exactly is it that you want from me?\"  There was a long pause.  Her eyes met my gaze again.  I could see her mind struggling to come up with the right words to accurately describe what we were both undoubtedly feeling at that exact moment.  I know she knew what she had to say, but I think it was especially difficult for her to actually get the words past her throat, because saying them out loud would mean admitting the feelings she was experiencing were, in fact, real.  It would mean grasping those feelings and running away with them; these feelings that had us in their grip, whether we wanted to admit it to ourselves or not.  We were both breathing heavily as I waited for her to slowly accept the fact that struggling against these feelings was impossible at this point.  We both knew we had gone past the point of no return.  \n\nShe broke my gaze, looked up, and heaved a big sigh before regaining her composure and once again locking eyes with me.  She had a different look now.  I knew immediately she had made her choice.  This shit was happening.  She was going to say exactly what she wanted and consequences be damned.  She leaned closer to me and her hand slid the rest of the way under my waistband and she grasped full hold of my aching cock with her hand.  I gasped slightly. Partially from the surprise of her action, and partially because it just felt so unimaginably good.  This was what I had been waiting for all this time.  All that was left was to hear it from her own mouth.  \n\nShe moved closer still, and I could feel her soft lips brush against my ear as she whispered, ever so softly, the words I'd longed to hear for so long: \"I...I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was about that time I noticed my mother was about seven stories tall, and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  \"Goddammit Lock-ness momsta, I ain't givin you no gaddamn tree fiddy! Now GIT on otta here!\" I jumped out of bed and threw my clothes back on.  What had just happened?  I was so close! I ran to my bedroom and realized what a fool I was for believing something like this could actually happen.  I swore I would never again be duped into a false sense of security by a trusted confidante.  \n\nI decided to live out the rest of my days alone and celibate, never daring to approach another woman for fear of finding out that she was all part of an elaborate ruse; a ploy whose sole purpose was to wreak havoc on my already-fragile emotions.

{"body": "&gt;How can atheism be considered anything other than a religion? It has all the earmarks:\n\nAlright, I'll bite. Show me the dogma and stories of this \"religion\".\n\n&gt;Dogma - \"if you still believe in God after all science has shown in recent centuries, you're clearly delusional\"\n\n[Citation needed] for both this and for the fact that atheists must believe this.\n\n&gt;Faith - \"i believe there is no God\"\n\nYou miss the point entirely. Atheism is a lack of faith. Some may claim knowing that there's no god, but it's enough to simply lack the faith.\n\n&gt;Limited perceptions passed off as objective evidence - \"Where is this so called God? I've never seen God\"\n\nDo you have any evidence? If so, bring it. The burden of evidence is on the theists proposing their religion as truth.\n\n&gt;Propagating ideas that can not be definitively proven either right or wrong - \"God is a concept created by man\"\n\nThis is not necessarily a quest for evidence, just one of understand the probabilities. It is much more likely that gods are a product of human imagination; we know this because we have have plenty of experience with human imagination and how fantasy and fiction forms and because religious stories have been based on as just that, stories, often orally at their beginning. Christians, Jews and Muslims do not own the concept of gods, they bring just a drop in a bucket of thousands of deities, all of which are dismissed because of similar reasons. A tracian from Eastern Europe, 2000 years ago, is as likely to be right about his deity, Zamolxe, as Jew was about his Yahweh; it's only that today, not all religions survived, so the graveyard of gods is big... are you agnostic about  those too? \n\n&gt;Logical fallacies - \"how can God possibly be real when innocent people suffer every day?\"\n\nSpeaking of fallacies, nice strawman there. You see, the problem of evil is not an argument against the existence of a God, just against the proposal of certain religions that there's some god which exits and is good and loving and just and all powerful.  The problem of evil is not a problem for maltheists or misotheism, people who believe there is God and he is evil.\n\n&gt;Arguing creation semantics - \"the big bang created the universe not God\" (would that not make the catalyst for big bang technically God?)\n\nYou're the one confused with semantics. The issue of creation is very simple: it is more likely that the universe didn't have a creator  because it's the simpler explanation; otherwise you get into an endless chain of creation with \"creators\" by asking: who created this creator?  because if  there is a creator, someone must have created him under the theist premise that everything needs to have a creator.  Fact is that with the science we have(from cosmogony to abiogenesis and evolution), it's even more likely that the universe we exist in has no creator. \n\n&gt;Perpetuating division - \"people who believe in God are hindering evolution\"\n\nAnother nice straw-man. Come on, show us some opinion studies or something to back that up. \n\n&gt;To me, it seems obvious the only \"logical\" choice of belief system is agnostic. Atheism is no better than dogmatic, politically inspired religions.\n\nI agree if you explain what sort of agnosticism. Most of us are agnostic-atheists.  Agnosticism works relative to something... how agnostic are you concerning the Loch Ness Monster and Ceiling Cat and The Invisible Pink Unicorn and The Interplanetary Tea Pot? \n\nYou are poor example of \"agnostics\", too. All full of dumb prejudice, constantly appealing to fallacies and negative stereotypes common in the atheism hating circlejerks.

{"body": "This story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago, and someone 'forbidden' is a prostitute which to me, as a man of honor at that time, seemed distasteful. Anyways, here goes.\n\n\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\n\n\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty. Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\n\n\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\n\n\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (Phenom Anal)\n\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit!

{"body": "Telekinesis, spiritualism, faith-healing, telepathy/mind-reading, psychic talents, shapechanging, magical beasts such as yeti, rocs and Nessie, and so on. I was more inspired by Victorian conceptions of magic than by most fantasy ideas. It gives me a different set of things to play with and a thematically appropriate world.\n\nIt's pretty unreliable, which is why people turned to technology and science and established a gaslamp fantasy world, but exists. I guess people know what is considered magical - and they don't really like it. I mean, when a man who is angry with his children suddenly turns into a bear and does more damage to them than he intended, things are going to get scary and people are going to go after other people with the same sort of names.\n\nI didn't want to have a situation where anything could be done with magic. I wanted somewhere where magic was only controllable by a few people, and although most people believe in it and may have minor magical talents themselves - such as the ability to tell a person's exact age just by looking at them (down to the day, if not the minute), or an uncanny ability to win at cards - there wasn't a strictly pseudo-scientific system.\n\nRegarding why I feel things are *unique*... it's a bit like the episode of My Little Pony where Twilight Sparkle gets exasperated by Pinkie Pie's sixth sense. The magic in my stories is much more like Pinkie Sense than it is like Twilight's rigorously focused studies. I think magic could be a bit less reliable and stories still be fun. (Obviously you have to get round the question of 'suddenly, there was a surge of power just when the hero least expected it' as a way out of trouble, but I achieved a bit of balance by making magic not actually central to the plot, and the hero being explicitly un-magical, at least to begin with.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384599975", "subreddit": "fantasywriters", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I could tell he was on something since his eyes were a bit glossy but I ignored it and started trying to catch up.

We danced for a few songs and she turned around to look at me a lot but flipped her head back before I could try anything.\n\nAfter a few songs she looked at me, almost through me, and said why don't go somewhere more private. My heart was pounding because that's what they said in movies when the dude is about to get the sex.\n\nWe walked to the upstairs bedroom and she immediately started teasing me. She just wouldn't let me get anything.

That may sound weird but you'll understand once you step on it. The concave is perfect. Its cradling like the Rayne Vandal but not in a uncomfortable way. I don't see the need for the power orbs mostly because my stance makes them in between where I stand. They're nice for tucking though. Some people have said that they slip off the tail because lack of concave but again coming from the Sugar I find myself knowing where the end of the board is. On the Sugar I knew when I hit the incline of the tail and riding any tail-less board I would always slip but not on the Nessie. On the Sugar I would put my heel off the board when sliding but the Nessie made that feel uncomfortable and I am now sliding with my full foot on which feel a lot better. No wheelbite. Im riding 75mil tall wheels and they hardly come close to contact and I ride turn-y bushings. You can actually notice the formica top dampen vibrations which is weird because I didn't think it would be *that* noticeable. Tail is perfect on the longest wheelbase and I find the shortest wheelbase to be too much tail. The nose is long enough to ollie which is a nice touch. And structure wise it feels stable but I can't really talk to much about it because I have babied this board ever since day one. No curb has ever gotten to meet my Nessie and I hasn't been placed griptape down on the road nor have the sides met pavement. It's bound to happen and then I can fully tell you how that is.

{"body": "Well, at the beginning of last school year, 8th grade for me, I met this girl. I'm going to call her Alice for convenience. From the start, I liked Alice. She was nice, attractive, and had a wonderful sense of humor. I really wanted her, and I decided I would have her.\n\nI went about the school year, becoming friends with her friends, which was easy as she hung out with mostly males, and her female friends were easy to talk to.\n\nAfter I acquainted myself with her friends and made it almost impossible for her not to see me several times a day, I started learning about her. I learned her interests, what she laughed at, what she scolded at. I developed my personality *around her!* \n\nI wasn't really that popular in school at that time, and I usually just sat in the back of the class silently listening, so it was easy for me to make a new personality for myself, as there wasn't much holding me back.\n\nSo, around Halloween time, I started talking with her and a few others on Skype. Nothing special, once or twice a week I would with her and a few other people on Skype, and have a good time. It didn't really place me higher with her especially, but it reinforced that I was now part of *their* social group.\n\nAfter Halloween, in the middle or so of November, she began borrowing my sweatshirt almost every day, and my knee began her honorary footrest during my science classes. I knew this was a good sign, she was counting on me for something every day. Any day I missed after that, she would say that she missed my sweatshirt.\n\nSo, a few months went by just as they had been, occasionally talking with the group, but still focused on my personal group of friends. Around Christmas time, once I was really thought of as part of that social group including Alice, I started focusing on Alice more than the rest of the group, and in return she did the same.\n\nRight after Christmas break I remember Alice giving me her phone number. We started having conversations more frequently, messaging over Skype using the IMing, or just texting. She did this with all of her close friends, and it felt good to actually be considered her friend.\n\nWe went on as we were for about two or so months, leaving us at about February. About then, we started texting quite a bit, along with talking a LOT in between classes. I was really falling for her, and she was as well. Somewhere in the middle of February, we had a Skype video call that lasted until about two AM, talking the entire time.\n\nAnother month went along, me and Alice were talking very frequently, and all was going normal until April. I remember that day, the first of April. Alice had been making small comments on dating for a while, and I had been intentionally passing them off. She was almost mentioning it every other sentence now, which in hindsight was rather cruel of me to do. I knew she liked me, so why didn't I say I did as well? Well, I didn't until that day. The first of April.\n\nThat day was a special day in class, we were doing volunteer hours by sandbagging because of the tendencies of our river to flood quite frequently, and we were grouped in the same bagging machine. Five hours standing right next to each other without break? It was wonderful. We were actually told to stop laughing because my teacher working at the station next to us thought it was too loud even through all of the sounds of the bagging machines.\n\nOnce school was over, I went back home, eyes glued to my phone the entire time. I probably only spent two hours the entire day not conversing with her. The begging of the day's conversations were normal, as they always were but at the end of the day, both of us tired from a long day working, were less careful of what we said, and somewhere in the conversation that night, about 10:00PM, it slipped out that I did like her.\n\nCue a conversation looping over and over again, for about an hour, of what I said to her, and what was obvious to both of us. That night, it was decided after almost an entire school year of infatuation that we were in fact \"dating\". Since I was and am not supporting of the term dating in that age, I said absolutely nothing about it, yet still almost the entire schools seemed to know the next day.\n\nAlice was the one girl at school that was pretty much universally desired by everyone there, so a lot of dirty looks, and \"Atta' boys\" were thrown my way. It was wonderful, I felt like I was walking on a cloud all day. The second I saw her that morning I just ran towards her and hugged her until the first bell rang, almost five minutes.\n\nWe spent every single second possible side by side talking, laughing. When we couldn't, we texted or Video chatted on Skype. After about a month of this figurative paradise, a little sexual tension started building up. There was less than a month of school left at that time, so me and Alice decided until summer started to do anything.\n\nWe waited anxiously towards summer for two reasons, the freedom, and what we would finally be able to do. As summer approached, it got to be too much, and we decided pictures would suffice, and it did.\n\nThe last day of school came, a large party for the 8th grade class. I had a lot of fun the last day of school with Alice, and our friends. That day she told me that she would be leaving for her fathers, who lives in another state for most of the summer. She said she still wanted to go through with whatever we were going to do, but that would be it with us once she left.\n\nOf course I was disappointed, but I knew that that would be the only outcome, as I would never abandon her if I could help it.\n\nWell, two days into summer I went to her home, not for the first time, but this time was special. No one was home, and no one would be for the rest of the day. I was incredibly nervous, but happy as well. We went down to her basement, to a couch and began making out. I was in heaven, it was wonderful. We went on from there, but I will not elaborate unless requested. After we were all finished, I was told that her grandmother would be home soon and I should leave, so I did.\n\nI went back twice more in the next two weeks, the last visit on the day before she left. I knew it was only three months, but it felt like it would be years. I felt completely betrayed by the fact that she was leaving, so much that it almost physically hurt. The last day I was there, before I was leaving she kept on looking at her cell phone. It was weird having her focus on that almost more that she was focusing on me, but I ignored it.\n\nWell, we got dressed, and then headed to her door. This would be that last time I see her for three months, so I lingered there for a while. Finally when I said goodbye, she told me before I left to talk to Johnathon, a friend of ours that we were both well acquainted with. She was standing there with regret, seemingly, but as I wouldn't see her for three months I just passed it off. I hadn't seen Johnathon since school ended, so I thought it was rather odd, but I said goodbye, and left.\n\nWhen I got home, I avoided my parents and headed straight to my room. I cried for the first time since maybe fifth grade when my dog died, and I had no idea why. I spent the next few days sitting on Skype waiting for her to get online, but it was almost a week before her familiar icon showed up.\n\nI tried to video call her right away, but there was no answer, which was odd. I waited a minute or two then tried again. Still nothing. I hadn't texted her since she left by request, but I decide to make an exception this time. I asked her why she was not answering, and about ten minutes later I get this in response \"Have you talked to Johnathon yet.\"\n\nI didn't know why then, but that made my heart drop like a stone. I almost instantly messaged Johnathon asking what was up with Alice, why she wasn't responding.\n\nLike a fucking bullet, he hit me with it. \"Didn't she tell you? She said she would drop you the day school ended.\"\n\nThat person, my *friend*, had been with Alice every day since school ended, on the same days I was there even. I wanted to punch him in the face so fucking hard, and not to mention Alice.\n\nI felt like a truck ran me over, I was with Alice four times and she didn't tell me once. That hurt. I went from looking forward to the new school year to dreading it.\n\nThe summer went by, the first month worse than I could imagine, but the second two alright. In August, I went straight to soccer tryouts, not being able to think about her, or the inevitable meeting. The two tryout weeks went by very quick, leading straight into school.\n\nIt was the first day of school, I was already familiar with my schedule. I knew exactly when and where I would see Alice, and avoided her at all costs. I knew this couldn't go on all day, we had English together, so I stopped trying. Once English came along, I decided to talk to her.\n\nI walked up, looked at her in the eye, and she smiled. \n\n\"Hello, PathwayToHell.\"\n\n\"Alice.\"\n\n\"How are you?\"\n\nI grunted.\n\n\"Not good, then.\"\n\nI blankly stared.\n\n\"Is there something I could ask of you?\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"May I have... Tree Fiddy?\"\n\n\n\nI looked up, and out the blue she was a seventy foot lizard from the Paleozoic Era!\n\n\"OH, NESSY!\" I cried.\n\"YOU GOT ME AGAIN!\"\n\n\nJust kidding.\n\nShe had the nerve to smile. So I had the nerve to smile back.\n\nTL; DR why am i shaking so much", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384753845", "subreddit": "teenagers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Pull up a chair for this one.  It'll take a minute.  It slowly gets weirder.\n\nSo I'm sitting there in an expensive hotel room with my dad and grandfather.  They keep making disgusting jokes to the point I just leave before I wretch.  I'm walking down the hall and I look out the window to see a very active pool way down below, lots of people.  I realize I might as well make a day of not being in the room and go to the pool, so I head back to the room to grab everything I may need.\n\nOn the way back I see this green lagoon of some sort, like some crazy natural hot tub.  It seems much higher up so I figure it must be some private bonus for those of us staying in the top floors.  I decide to go there instead.  So I'm instantly there and walking along the side of it.  I literally mean the side of it because I'm looking into the water at eye-level like it's actually a raised glass tank.  Some woman is swimming like a dolphin, jumping in arcs out of the water and everything.  Then a bunch of other dolphins come from some out of sight location and I think, \"Holy shit you swim with dolphins?  Fuckin badass!\"\n\nSo now I'm instantly sitting on the edge of the pool and about to jump in when it suddenly occurs to me that there's no supervision and dolphins can tend to be thrill-kill rapists.  This makes me nervous as fuck and I'm a bit reluctant now.  So now I'm suddenly thirty feet underwater, still sitting on the same rock edge.  The motion of the water slows down and some trippy music starts playing as dolphin #1 starts coming my way.  At this point I'm thinking I'm about to be an extra victim in an underwater episode of Oz, but I stay there out of rigid fear.\n\nAs he gets closer, he's about 25 times bigger than me and is actually more of some giant aquatic dinosaur.  The fact that I have absolutely no trouble holding my breath this long does not actually occur to me at this moment, and the big dinousaur thing puts his head in my lap.  This action actually looks more like he's attempting to coat me with his giant face.  I scratch his... nose... whatever.  The face is too big to know but I'm trying to be nice because I don't want him to know I'm afraid and then get raped or eaten.\n\nThen all the sudden I... hear him.  Like, in my head.  Some sort of telepathy or being able to understand his whale-like noises, but he's warning me of some inexplicable doom.  So now I'm sitting there in front of my dad at breakfast and he's laughing his ass off.  I keep trying to explain to him that I was... communing... with some giant dinosaur in a green lagoon and that he was warning me of some crazy shit I can't remember.  He challenges me to describe this waterbeast and I point at a construction worker standing next to the table and say, \"That's him right there!  Ask him yourself!\"\n\nSomehow I knew that this construction worker was in fact the big dinosaur.  Don't know why, but it made sense because I saw that lady dolphin-swimming in the green pool before I got there so *obviously* they can change to humans.  This makes my dad laugh even harder.  I level with him and say, \"Look, I don't know if what I saw is what actually happened.  All I know is what I saw.  I did hear some trippy music and it seemed to all be in slow motion, so I could have been drugged or hypnotized, but I can tell you for sure that I *did see these things.*  I'm willing to admit they may not have actually been real, though.\"  \n\nMy dad accepts this option, and the construction worker water dinosaur looks at me disappointedly, and walks away.  No he did not want tree fiddy.  Sorry if you read this far expecting that to happen.\n\nTL;DR - Dream started with going to the hotel pool, ended up being an apocalypse message from an aquatic dinosaur (not the Loch Ness monster) using telepathy in a green lagoon... oh and he's a shapeshifter", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384794425", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

When these types of claims are tested and occassionaly found wanting, most religious systems have an \"out\" for their deity or system (you didn't have enough faith, it wasn't part of God's mysterious will, you have a certain sin/curse/bad karma which prevents those benefits). Believers are invited to have real experiences that they can point to as \"confirmation\" of their faith, but no matter what the outcome there is no reliable way to connect those experiences back to the object of their faith (which always remains unseen).\n\nHume makes a good point in his Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding. When he talks about cause and effect he makes it clear that we associate causes with effects because **we see them together**. Only by apprehending both parts can we reasonably talk about causality. What the scientific method does is it helps us to differentiate true causes from false (perceived) causes...it works the same way as regular observation (ball A hits ball B and causes it to move, fire burns wood etc) but is more rigorous so that it can rule out any possible anomalies and it helps us to discover causes that are impossible to discern with only our limited physical senses (micro-organisms, weak nuclear force, etc).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384796626", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "One night I was lying in bed, trying to go to sleep. After a while, I floated into the stage between being awake and being asleep, where you are still aware of your environment, but are slowly entering \"dreamland\". Suddenly I felt how the room was getting icy cold and my hair stood right up on my neck and arms. I remember opening my eyes, and I was clearly awake in an instant. The room got even colder and I noticed I was totally paralyzed and couldn't move one single muscle in my body. I had a very eerie feeling in my stomach.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, a horrible creature appeared in the opposite part of the room, close to the bedroom door (I was living alone in an apartment at the time). In retrospect, I can see that the creature looked something like how people would describe the Reptilian race; thick, naked, with green, totally hairless and extremely muscular, with his spine sticking up underneath his skin; something I noticed when he was bending down, ready to attack. I can’t remember clearly what his nose and ears looked like, but I vaguely recall that he had pointy ears.  I just “knew” he was a male, although I don’t remember seeing any genitals. His eyes were ruby red and glowed viciously. I estimate his length to about 6.3f – 6.5f, but his body (bone?) structure was thicker and bigger than on a human. He had more teeth than we do from what I can recall, and they were very long, sharp and pointy. His mouth was huge. I can’t say whether he had a tail or not, because I never saw him from behind, and no wings. This creature was definitely physical, at least after he had transformed into our reality. When this happened, I had no other way of describing him than as a demon, knowing nothing about reptilians at the time...\n\nThis creature was staring at me for I don't know how long, but it feels like it was maybe half a minute, while I still couldn't move or scream. Then he suddenly loomed over me, stared directly into my eyes, and asked if I could spare about $3.50. \n\ntl;dr I almost get abducted but it turns out to be the loch ness monster asking for $3.50", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384909427", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Another couple of good comments in the section:\n\nImagine the outrage if the genders were switched in this article?...\n\nMen, gather round. We have a problem.\n\nThe problem is women. They are in crisis. Dreadful things are afoot for them, and they need our help.\n\nDespite the fact most homeless are men, most prisoners are men, most suicides are men, most workplace fatalities are men and most victims of violence are men- women are not happy.\n\nIt's not just because no-one's invented a 0 calorie bar of chocolate, nor because they are so insecure they're more likely to lie about rape than any other crime and waste millions of police time and resources in the process.\n\nNor are they unhappy for the more serious and important reason that women live longer than men.\n\nThey get more funding for their health, are less likely to be attacked, and if they are attacked members of the public (both genders) are more likely to run to their rescue.\n\nThey are not particularly bothered about the fact women in their 20s earn more than men in their 20s and the wage gap today is about as realistic as the loch ness monster.\n\nAnyone who can manage that with half a GCSE is doing pretty well, but luckily there are so many quotas and all-woman shortlists to force in more women to give those women with half a GCSE a chance.\n\nNo, they're unhappy because they have to share the planet with men. How dare babies be born male\n\n\nAnd another good comment:\n\nIf you knew of a group of people ...\n\n- who die years earlier than others on average, and are only 1/4 as likely to live past 100,\n\n- who receive three times higher sentences (in the US) than others who commit the exact same crimes, and are 20 times more likely to be sentenced to execution than others who commit the exact same capital crimes (per the US Bureau of Justice Statistics),\n\n- who are four times more likely to commit suicide than others,\n\n- who (according to a 2000 study at UW-Madison) when expressing the exact same emotion as others, are much more likely to be viewed as angry and threatening, and much less likely to be viewed as deserving sympathy,\n\n- who suffer homelessness twice as often as others, and are far less likely to number among the \"sheltered\" homeless partly due to segregated sheltering reserved for others,\n\n- whose diseases receive only 1/3 of the funding for diseases affecting others, even when corrected for relative diagnosis and fatality rates,\n\n- whose wages have flat-lined over the past four decades while others have made gains, even thought they dedicate nearly a fifth (16%) more hours/week to work on average than others and are at nine times greater risk of being killed at work than others,\n\n- who are the primary victims of unprovoked domestic violence (70% according to a Harvard study), while others receive special protection from domestic violence under federal law--in brazen violation of the 14th Amendment's \"equal protection\" clause--and vastly disproportionate public and private assistance as domestic violence victims,\n\n- whose victimization under certain crimes committed against them by others is legally defined as a lesser offense than the equivalent crimes committed by them against others, spawning a misinformed culture in which they are characterized as categorical criminals who should be denied equal justice and due process, including presumption of innocence,\n\n- who are often told categorically that they cannot be victims of certain crimes which, in reality, affect them in numbers comparable to others,\n\n- who are far more likely to pay child support when not a custodial parent, yet are still the primary targets of public shaming for not paying child support,\n\n- who are repeatedly told that discrimination against them does not and cannot exist because a diminishingly tiny minority of them hold positions in politics and business,\n\n- who are targets of organized political slander, pseudoscience, scare frauds, historical myths, class libel, bigotry, legal discrimination, and disproportionate attention as criminals by both right- and left-leaning media, while their complaints about these injustices are shamed and ridiculed into silence, and\n\n- who become special targets of media and public abuse on days set aside to celebrate them and the roles they play,\n\n...wouldn't you agree that this group of people has valid issues that deserve to be addressed without dismissive mockery?\n\nToday is International Men's Day.

{"body": "I may be able to shed some light on your sighting. I used to work for the Air Force back in the '90's as an engineer on a few top secret programs. I can't go into much detail, but most of the programs were radar avoidance and stealth projects, the usual.\n\nExcept one. I'm not sure where it came from or who developed it. It was my third week at NORAD when the CIA along side of a few high ranking generals took over one of the underground labs. The area was off limits to anyone and we were warned to stay away under threat of a court martial. I wasn't concerned really as I assumed that It was some Captured Chinese or Russian techs. Nothing came of it so It went to the back of my mind quickly.\n\nOver the next few weeks it started to feel tense around base. More and more new individuals arrived at NORAD. DARPA scientist (or so I believe) started to show up and more and more suits were wandering around base. Security was heightened and checkpoints were set up throughout base. It was abnormal for us, as we never had such a security presence on base. \n\nThen on December 26th 1996 something I will never forget happened. I was leaving the offices at 2 A.M.  having just finished the final revisions on a project. I passed through the security check points and got into my car. About half a mile from the base the heavens illuminated. A white light rose up from the base and an almost silent crack echoed through the night. Instantly I pulled over to the side of the road to reorganize my thoughts.\n\nI was assuming some nuclear project had gone wrong, but then I realized I was still alive. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief and entered my car to return to base to check on the people there. But as I was about to turn on the road I saw the saucer you described in your photo. It was hovering and the shiny black metal almost blinded me. I locked the doors of my car when I saw the object come to a halt. For what seemed like an eternity the ship hovered and then a door opened. A figure arose from the bright light of the ship. I stared intensely at the tall silhouette of the man (or what I believed to be a man) coming out from the ship . It walked slowly in the darkness towards my window. I was paralyzed and could not utter a word. For what seemed like a moment I was captivated by the sheer beauty of facing the most primal fears of humanity and being faced by a truly strange creature. \n\nI was ready to accept the worst, when the creature opened its mouth. from it emerged not a voice, but an almost angelic choir. \n\nI asked Myself under my breath what would happen after this moment.\n\nI assumed death, love or possibly a sensation unlike what humanity had felt before. I closed my eyes as the creature said a single word. \"You\".\n\nI said nothing and as soon as it said that word it dissapeard alongside the ship. When I had started my car again after a long pause I checked my systems, everything looked normal, no electromagnetic disturbances, except my speedometer looked off,\nThe miles appeared to have been altered. When I counted back to my original mileage with realize there were more miles....

I saw this same thing. I was covered in silence. This huge airplane/arrowhead fucking humbled me. Like a how i would imagine that a kayaker would feel with a whale breaching nearby. It was massive, and its vibrations canceled out any sound to the point where i could only hear that faint tone... Like my ear was recovering, and searching for anything to call noise, but it found nothing and made up it's own faint resonance. I was taken up into the core of the ship and suspended in fluid. I was completely dry, but covered in this constricting liquid that absorbed my movements like water and held me in place like sand. I couldn't breathe, and i could hear these shuffling noises around me. I was terrified. I have honestly tried to block this out for years. These things were communicating to each-other with clicks, and deep vibrations which i could feel through the sand.  This is the part i remember clearest of all: The sand opened around my face and i could breathe for the first time in what seemed like a fucking decade... I saw the creature, pale face, lightly wet, and staring at me expressionless. Its vibrations (now unimpeded by the sand) hit me directly in the face, and shook my fillings and teeth. It said: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Now it was about dat time that i realized that this alien was about eight stories tall was was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. \n\nPROOF: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cn7xfBpZ3M\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384927963", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

And so a few minutes pass and it happens again. now she's frustrated and I'm still telling her it's most likely a woodpecker. She still isn't buying it. I go back to watching tv and then on the chimney once again you hear the *papapapapapapapapapapapap*. Now my mom is pissed. She is yelling that i need to stop making that noise and that she is trying to study. So i tell her it's just a bird. I guess she is tired of hearing that because she turns off the tv and makes me do my homework. 10 minutes pass and then *papapapapapapapapapap* It happens again. My mother then informs me that I'll be having a talk with my father about this disrespectful behaviour when he gets back from his business trip the next day. I am sent to bed and that is that. So now it's saturday and I'm grounded until my dad get's home and whenever i come out of my room you hear the *papapapapapapapapapapa* on the chimney. So then i get in bigger trouble because my mother thinks i'm being an ass. So mid afternoon my dad gets home and he comes and talks to me. He asks me if i like seeing my mother upset. I of course replied with a soft, \"no\" and he told me that i'm grounded for the rest of the three day weekend because of my behavior. So we finish and my dad goes and talks to my mom in their room. and for the final time you hear *papapapapapapappapapapa* and my dad asks if this is some kind of joke. So i lead him outside and what do you know. There is a woodpecker pecking on the chimney. Finally my parents see the truth! I wasn't making that noise at all! I'm finally off the hook. So they apologize and ask what they could do to show how sorry they were. \nl said I wanted some taco bell. They said of course and so we go to the drive through. I ask for a crunchwrap supreme, and I hear the worker mumble the total and nobody understood him so we decided to pull up the window to find the actual price.

If you know a thing about crop rotation, some years the farmer planted milo, or soybeans.  But others... sometimes he'd plant corn.\n\nDespite the title of this thread, I wasn't terrified at all.  Cornstalks were just overgrown dandelions in my mind, and I sure as hell wasn't worried about something that was stuck in the ground.  I didn't have irresponsible parents, but they did let me play in the cornfield behind our house, so long as I didn't go *too* far.  It was the best!  My first dose of complete freedom, playing Transformers or Street Sharks.  Karate chopping this innocent farmer's fall investment into so many trampled stems!  Kevin Costner got it right:  Iowa isn't heaven.  He was close, but he neglected to say what exactly heaven was:  a three year old in an Indiana cornfield.  Until that day.\n\n\nI had to get the rest of the story from my mom, since I've long since repressed what happened in that field, so long ago.  She had been vacuuming the living room when she heard my inhuman banshee wail carry over the roar of our Oreck.  This is obviously the last thing any mother wants to hear, so she intercepted me just as I left the field.  And I was in hysterics.  I was a talkative little guy even then, but she couldn't get a word out of my mouth for a good 40 minutes.  I continued to blubber and trying to struggle out of her arms, always away from the cornfield.  And I never went back.\n\n\nSo what happened?  I can see you, sitting there.  Maybe at work.  Sneaking glances at your phone in class.  And trying to guess where this thread is going to go.  Was I hiding in the corn when the combine suddenly appeared behind me, eating up rows of corn like a big green Langolier?  Attacked by a wild animal?  Deathly case of allergies?  Is this a tree fiddy joke?  Relax, put those brain cells to rest, and let me finish.  Thank you.\n\nFinally, my tears dried up, and I sat in traumatized silence in my bedroom.  Mom eventually figured that I'd sat long enough to talk about it.  \"What happened, buddy?\"\n\nI looked up with watery eyes, and said:  [\"... The corn has toes!\"](http://i.imgur.com/erx8Nnc.jpg)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384973148", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's my standard response;\n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing. I'd also add that there isn't a single tangible benefit that religion provides that can not be attained through secular means.\n\nEvery reason to believe or claim of evidence I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and never repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. If faith can be used to justify any belief, what good is it? How can you determine what is true using faith?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384988211", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This reminds me of a date my gf and I had.\n\nMy gf and I love Thai food. We decided to go to a nice Thai restaurant that was recommended by the wonderful people of yelp. The restaurant is located inland from where we live in San Diego and would be a bit of a drive, but seeing as how much we love Thai it wasn't a big issue.\nWe pull up to the restaurant and find the nearest parking, which wasn't hard to find because the surrounding buildings looked vacant and the area was sort of desolate. We get out of the car and walk up to the restaurant and enter. The environment was typical of what you would find in a Thai place filled with Buddhist statues, Asian decor and very colorful and lovely fresh water fish tank. A member of the staff greeted us and she guided us to our seat.\nThe place had a fire in the air. You could smell the spice and the aromas of the sauces. It was quite pleasant. As we sat down the waiter informed us what the special of the day was and asked if we wanted something to drink. We both asked for waters, the waiter complied and handed us our menus.\nAs he came back he brought with him a nice spice rack, which is typical of Thai food restaurants. They usually come with a a dish of seasoned diced jalapenos, crushed red pepper, a paprika or cayenne powder and a chili pastes. Everything you would need to adjust the heat of your meal.\nBy that time we were ready to order and began telling the waiter what we wanted. We ordered a spice pineapple fried rice, pad thai and a pot of tom kha gai soup. (If you haven't tried tom kha gai I suggest you do so next time you order Thai). Again, the waiter complied and took off to the kitchen.\nWhile waiting on our food, my gf and I engaged in light conversation about who knows what and our attention was abruptly disrupted by a kid who came from nowhere with a tray hung from around his neck. My gf and I were quite taken back because he literally just came out of nowhere.\nThe kid looked about 7 or 8 years old and looked Thai. He was wearing what looked like rags and we were not sure of what to take this kid for. He came up to our table and begins picking up objects from his tray and displaying it to us. The first object he picked up was a flower or a rose but I couldn't remember. He then continued to show us more objects, which included a tiny elephant made from some sort of metal, a tiny Buddha that hung from a tassel and some candies we have never seen before.\nIt was about that time that we realized he was a beggar. I felt awkward since I had very little cash (~$2) and I didn't want to not buy something from this kid. I said to the kid \"how much for that little Buddha doll right there.\" The kid then picked up the Buddha and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\nWell it was about that time that I noticed this beggar was about 500 ft. tall and from the Paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384996899", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": -8, "controversiality": 0}

We ran out of Doritos and decided we would go to the store for more. I put my shoes on and my brother and I left for the store. We were walking up the street when a stray cat walked in front of us. We were startled. We then heard a sound from the alleyway we were walking past, so we started running. A police officer saw us running and stopped us to ask us some questions. He asked what we were doing out, and we told him that we were just out for Doritos. He told us to be safe and not to be running through the streets. We waved goodbye and started walking again. We were only four streets over now. We thought it would be faster to cut through backyards to get to the store. We were halfway though the yards when a man came out and asked us what we were doing in his backyard. I told him of our quest for Doritos and he told us to get the fuck off of his property before he shot our stoner asses. We were relieved when we finally had reached the store. I looked at the cashier. She was hot and young, and I decided I would try to hit on her while my brother grabbed the Doritos. I told her some corny jokes, and she started laughing. My brother was on his way back with the Doritos, so I decided to ask her for her number. She said yes and gave me her number. At that moment, my brother returned with the Doritos. She scanned them, and I asked her how much it was.

As I was drinking my dog bolted, his leash came right out of my hand.  \n\nI spent the next hour frantically searching for him.  I lost my voice calling his name.  Countless strangers tried to help... After a while all of them apologized and just gave up.  It was about 90 degrees out and I had run out of water.  I couldn't stay much longer so I reluctantly decided to go home.  I intended to get more water, eat, and come back with some cooked chicken (my dogs favorite) in hopes of finding him.  \n\nBut on the walk back (I was so tired I could no longer run) I heard what I thought was my dog whimpering.  For some time I thought it was in my head, and I aimlessly wandered off the trail trying to find him, but eventually there he was.  He was laying next to... You guessed it, a dead body.  \n\nMy dog was laying next to it, licking the fresh wounds.  They had recently been stabbed.  I called my dog, but he wouldn't come, so I had to get closer.  I gingerly walked up to my dog and looked down at the body.  It was female, dressed in short running shorts and a sports bra.  Blood was everywhere.  She had multiple stab wounds that looked fresh to me.  Afraid the killer was still around I got paranoid.  Turned around, expecting them to be behind me... That's when she moaned. \n\nI looked back at her.  Her eyes were open, as was her mouth.  She was trying to say something to me but couldn't get anything out.  I fumbled for my cell phone to call 911 and almost vomited when the call failed.  No signal.  Tears began streaming from my eyes.  I couldn't think of a thing to do for her.  \n\nI knelt down beside her and cried.  She managed to move her hand onto mine and I took it, squeezed it.  I told her I was sorry.  She was trying to talk, moving her mouth but I couldn't hear her.

But he broke out of the closet and stormed into the church right when the priest said, \"If there is anyone who has any reason why this couple should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.\"\n\nDon't remember exactly what he said...it was something like \"YOU FUCKING MOTHERFUCKING COCKSUCKING PIECE OF SHIT! I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU!\"\n\nBut here's where things got really weird. Someone stood up and said, \"Wait...how do we know you're really the groom?\" (They look *exactly* alike, so no one could tell the difference.) The real groom said, \"I can prove it! My darling bride...ask me something that only I would know the answer to.\"\n\nThe bride said, \"You'll know exactly what I'm talking about...a  few months ago I told you I needed something from you...something no one else here knows about... What was it?\"\n\nThe groom said. \"I...um...wait....\" He completely froze up. He couldn't think of it because he never said it- the twin did. Apparently the twin had gotten really good at pretending to be him and banging the bride when he wasn't around.\n\nThe bride became enraged. She screamed \"You are NOT my husband! If you were, you would know that ^^^I ^^^need ^^^about ^^^tree ^^^fiddy\n\nIt was about this time that the guests realized the bride was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.\n\n**TL;DR Groom's identical twin tricked everyone into thinking he was the groom and got away with it.**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385078422", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 140, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My bride bailed at the altar. I thought everything was perfect. She was beautiful, smart, kind, and the first girl I ever dated that my folks actually liked. That was a big thing for me. After my first girlfriend cheated on me multiple times and left me in a state of depression, no girl was ever good enough for me in my parents eyes. Then she came along. God she was magnificent. We dated for about three years before I finally worked up the courage to ask her to marry me. Frankly I was amazed when she said yes. Even though I had this beautiful woman loving me for three years, I still had doubts in my mind about her agreeing to spend the rest of our lives together. I guess that's what a series of fucked up relationships will do to ya. Anyways we were engaged for about 6 months before the wedding, we were both ready and wanted to be married as soon as possible. Day of the wedding comes and I'm a nervous wreck. I had to borrow my best mans shirt because I completely sweat through the shirt of the rental tux I had. It was horrible. I had gotten it into my head that she wasn't going to show up, thanks again fucked up relationships, but my best man, being the total bro that he is, completely convinced me otherwise. So the time comes for us to take our places, and we wait in position for my beautiful bride to come down the aisle. And we wait. And we wait. And we wait. Finally the door at the end of the aisle opens up, but it isn't her that walks through, its her father. He makes a \"come here\" motion with his hands, and obviously I fear the worst. I get down to him, and he pulls me outside, where he hands me a cellphone.\r\r\"Hi TradocTanker\"\rIt was her. Her beautiful voice was on the other end of the line. I was relieved to hear from her, but in my gut, I knew this wasn't a courtesy call to let me know I was running late.\r\"Hi Jess, where are you?\r\r\"Tradoc I'm so sorry, I love you so much, but there's just... Things I need that you can't provide.\"\rI still remember how much those fucking words stung.\r\"Jess what are you talking about? I've done everything you've ever asked me, I've been the best man I could be just for you, what do you need?\"\r\r\"You couldn't possibly give me what I really need Tradoc\"\rShe kept driving the knife deeper, I wanted to die.\r\"Please, tell me so I can at least try\"\rI thought that maybe, just maybe there was still a chance.\r\r\"Well... I need about tree fiddy.\"\rIt was about that time I realized my fiancée was in fact a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I said \"Goddammit you loch ness monster!

{"body": "Man you wouldn't believe some people.\n\nI was working at a Best Buy at the time. We had 3 TVs for sale. Each of them were 64\" LCD Panasonics. The sale was for around 250 I think. Something completely nuts. So I drive into work that morning and I KNOW it's going to be bad. When I got there I see around 200 people standing in line. \n\nAt the time we really didn't have any sort of order to how people came in. This was before people were getting killed and all. So people were just kind of huddling up. There was a group over to the right with tents and Xbox/TV set up playing Halo, and a bunch of bundled up women in another group.\n\nBut as I walk to the door, I hear a guy tell me \"Psst\". I turn and look and there's this reefer-type dude who is with a BANGING hot chick. Like the type of girl you see in the movies, she was so hot. You could see her tits through her shirt cause it was cold but she really didn't care it seemed. The dude looks at me and kind of smirks. \"You work here right?\" (Duh, I'm wearing Best Buy uniform) \"Uh, yeah I gotta get inside\" He says to me without missing a beat: \"Dude, how would you like to have this?\"\n\nI was pretty sketchy about this time. I asked him \"Wtf? Dude what are you smoking?\" He told me he REALLY wanted that TV deal and this is his 'friend'. yeahhh right. I turned to her and said \"You cool with this?\" She nodded her head and smiled and brushed her hand on my arm. \"I really want the TV too, and you're kind of cute\"\n\nBy this time I'm like completely skeptical and turned on to no end. I had come in early anyway, so I was like, wth, why not? So I told her to meet me around the side, since I knew there was a blind spot on the cameras there. \n\nDude she was fucking amazing. I have never been with someone like this. Definitely worth risking my job to get them the TV. I just placed it in the back room with a defective sticker on it. Then when the store opened, I just rolled it right to them. There were two guys that gave me hell for it, but it was definitely worth it.\n\n3 days later I hear a familiar voice at work. \"Hey, um... we have a problem.\" I looked up and it was her. \"What's the problem I asked?\" She told me she was preggo. WTF? I know it isn't mine. I want a DNA test. She said she needs some money if I want to prove it isn't mine.\n\nI'm pretty pissed off by now. So I ask her how much is this going to cost me? She said \"I need Tree Fiddy.\" \n\nNow it was around this time when I realized the hot chick was 7 stories tall and was actually a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamn it!

{"body": "Back in 2007 I was pretty down on my luck. I had just lost my job and had found out my girlfriend had been cheating on me. Things started to look up though as I was finally able to find a new (and better) paying job and started feeling better about myself. One thing I treated myself with right before I lost my job was a brand new 40\" LCD TV which I still have today.\n\nNow one thing I thought at the time was \"I can just pick cables up later\". Well not right after losing your job. So there I was with this brand new, 1080P HD Television, watching my cable box out of RCA. Sitting on my couch one afternoon I was pondering how I could make this better when I am startled by a knock on the door. Odd, I thought I am not expecting anyone. \n\nI open the door and it's Ron, a guy I had a few college classes with a few years back. We catch up a bit and I hear his story. He started working for a company which travels around the town buying/selling electronics door to door. They will \"buy\" your used electronics off you in the hopes of \"selling\" it to someone else. Most of it in the end was either recycled or donated to charity. I mention my blight and how I was dying for an HDMI cable and sure enough he retrieves one out of his van. 12\" Long, JUST what I needed. I ask him how much he is asking for and I swear the look in his eye changed. He lowered his head down and stared intently in to my eyes. I gulped as I waited for his answer as I scrambled to think what I could have done to change this man's mood so quickly. He silently looks up at me and says \"It costs about tree fiddy\". About this time I realized this isn't my old classmate at all, and was really a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. I says to him \"GOD DAMN YOU LOCH NESS YOU GET OUTTA HERE\". He just cackled loudly and ran away. I ended up selling the TV a couple days later but I can't help but remember the story of the almost HDMI cable.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385173575", "subreddit": "techsupport", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Like maybe tomorrow night?\"\n\n\"Oh I can't tomorrow night, I have to work the double shift. But I'm free tonight... *sir*.\" I could've sworn she threw in a tiny wink in there. It's a date then! We exchanged numbers, I grabbed my purchases and went on my way, excited for the night.\n\nWhen I came to pick her up, she was wearing the a revealing top and shorts so small, they could've been panties. We go over to my place where I laid out some snacks and finger foods for dinner.\n\nWe eat, we laugh at the comedy we chose to watch. It was almost 11:30. \"Sir, it's getting late, and I don't want to be home alone tonight.\" Holy shit she was the one making the moves!\n\nWe find ourselves in bed, furiously making out, practically ripping each others' clothes of.

We later learned that right before the ceremony, the twin locked the groom in a broom closet and stole his tux. No one suspected a thing. But he broke out of the closet and stormed into the church right when the priest said, \"If there is anyone who has any reason why this couple should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.\"\nDon't remember exactly what he said...it was something like \"YOU FUCKING MOTHERFUCKING COCKSUCKING PIECE OF SHIT! I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU!\"\nBut here's where things got really weird. Someone stood up and said, \"Wait...how do we know you're really the groom?\" (They look exactly alike, so no one could tell the difference.) The real groom said, \"I can prove it! My darling bride...ask me something that only I would know the answer to.\"\nThe bride said, \"You'll know exactly what I'm talking about...a few months ago I told you I needed something from you...something no one else here knows about... What was it?\"\nThe groom said. \"I...um...wait....\" He completely froze up. He couldn't think of it because he never said it- the twin did. Apparently the twin had gotten really good at pretending to be him and banging the bride when he wasn't around.\nThe bride became enraged. She screamed \"You are NOT my husband! If you were, you would know that I need about tree fiddy\nIt was about this time that the guests realized the bride was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.\nTL;DR Groom's identical twin tricked everyone into thinking he was the groom and got away with it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385348527", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm sorry but you simply can't support the statements you are making with the sources you have provided (one of them is pretty much claiming the loch ness monster is a real thing I mean come on).  The theories you are putting forth are so far off the scientific grid that I would challenge you to find a single scholarly, peer reviewed article that would support any claim you have made. There is plenty of evidence to support links between species and even more geologic evidence to support the age of the earth and universe.\n\nEvolution is a working theory that helps to explain how life has developed on this planet and where it may continue to develop in the future.  Like everything else, science does not have even close to every answer about the universe.  As our understanding of the universe continues to develop, there will surely be changes in our understanding of how these processes work.\n\nThere is an abundance of scientific evidence to support the theory of evolution and the only argument against teaching it is the possibility that it may be wrong.  The difference between Evolution and Creation science is Creationism's complete lack of reputable evidence.  It is based in faith and traditional religious teachings and lacks evidence from any reputable source to support it.\n\nYou are also combining evolution with geology and referring to them as one thing.  There is also significant evidence to support the age of the earth http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.html and nothing but holes in the young earth theory (carbon and radio isotope dating, fossil record, light from interstellar distances, etc.).\n\nYour attempt to common sense your way out of believing in evolution is also an irrelevant personal feeling of incredulity. Evolution is not a belief system or a religion, it is a theory based on evidence gathered from scientific observation and it doesn't need to pass this litmus test you have constructed (the part about life coming about randomly and it sounding ludicrous).\n\nNow for rules of historical evidence.  You cannot trust with certainty, the observations written in any document as old 2000 years (or more).  These documents aid our understanding of the writer's culture and provides a starting point for collecting evidence.  Historical documents disagree with each other all the time and cannot be regarded as facts in a vacuum without context or bias.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, it is the motives of these Texas legislators are questionable at best.  Not only are they asserting that creationism be taught in schools but that evolution be removed from the curriculum altogether.  They simply don't like it for any other reason than it doesn't fit their world view.  \n\nWhen we start telling students to ignore verifiable scientific evidence just because we don't like what it is telling us, that will be the beginning of the end of our technological and economic leadership in the world.  This is the problem that Bill Nye is citing and he is absolutely right.  Creationism asks questions of faith, not science.

It's almost like \"sic vis pacem para bellum\" works or something.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si_vis_pacem,_para_bellum\n\n&gt; Si vis pacem, para bellum is a Latin adage translated as, \"If you want peace, prepare for war\" (usually interpreted as meaning peace through strength—a strong society being less likely to be attacked by enemies). \n\nI.e. the US should have developed a better relationship with China and other Asian countries so that it could if necessary cooperate with them to deter Japanese aggression in the 1930s. Right now it should cooperate with Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam and South Korea to deter Chinese aggression.  Though obviously each on is a different case - the US has troops in Japan and South Korea. It sells arms to Taiwan and the Philippines and with Vietnam relations are at a much more basic level.\n\nIncidentally this is why I think that if China decides to start a war it will be with the Philippines (militarily very weak, but a US ally) or Vietnam (military probably pretty good but not a US ally). I.e. they won't go for somewhere like Japan because it has a strong military and the US has guaranteed that it will come to its aid if it is attacked.\n\nStill like I say if China is serious in taking on Japan over the Senkakus it means they are willing to fight the US too - by definition since the US had made it clear it would come to Japan's aid in a war over the Senkakus. Hence I'd expect to see an attack on US carriers. Indeed the DF-21 anti ship missile is an attempt by China to have a way to threaten US carriers.\n\nIf they actually followed through on that threat the situation would be exactly analogous to Pearl Harbor - a rising Asian power would be attacking US carriers because it sees the US Navy as blocking its ambitions in Asia.\n\n&gt; Please, read some history books on the subject. And you're basing your paranoia of an invasion by China on a bunch of nationalistic Chinese on the net? And you're calling it reasonable? Do you also believe in Loch Ness Monster and Area 51?\n\nReddit is really going to the dogs if statements like this are regarded as being a valid form of debate.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385395148", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "THE TEN LEGAL COMMANDMENTS OF PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nI. Anyone in a public place can take pictures of anything they want. Public places include parks, sidewalks, malls, etc. Malls? Yeah. Even though it’s technically private property, being open to the public makes it public space.\n\nII. If you are on public property, you can take pictures of private property. If a building, for example, is visible from the sidewalk, it’s fair game.\n\nIII. If you are on private property and are asked not to take pictures, you are obligated to honor that request. This includes posted signs.\n\nIV. Sensitive government buildings (military bases, nuclear facilities) can prohibit photography if it is deemed a threat to national security.\n\nV. People can be photographed if they are in public (without their consent) unless they have secluded themselves and can expect a reasonable degree of privacy. Kids swimming in a fountain? Okay. Somebody entering their PIN at the ATM? Not okay.\n\nVI. The following can almost always be photographed from public places, despite popular opinion:\n\naccident &amp; fire scenes, criminal activities\nbridges &amp; other infrastructure, transportation facilities (i.e. airports)\nindustrial facilities, Superfund sites\npublic utilities, residential &amp; commercial buildings\nchildren, celebrities, law enforcement officers\nUFOs, the Loch Ness Monster, Chuck Norris\nVII. Although “security” is often given as the reason somebody doesn’t want you to take photos, it’s rarely valid. Taking a photo of a publicly visible subject does not constitute terrorism, nor does it infringe on a company’s trade secrets.\n\nVIII. If you are challenged, you do not have to explain why you are taking pictures, nor to you have to disclose your identity (except in some cases when questioned by a law enforcement officer.)\n\nIX. Private parties have very limited rights to detain you against your will, and can be subject to legal action if they harass you.\n\nX. If someone tries to confiscate your camera and/or film, you don’t have to give it to them. If they take it by force or threaten you, they can be liable for things like theft and coercion. Even law enforcement officers need a court order.\n\nSource: http://content.photojojo.com/tips/legal-rights-of-photographers/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385419279", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 24, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "True, the cult of stalin doesn't have all of the aspects of a traditional religion, but it has a lot in common, which is why I called it quasi-religious in nature.\n\nIt teaches worship of the leader, or most powerful, it teaches that stalin is all powerful, he's all knowing, he's the creator of the great state, and the provider for all the people. All the people owe their continued existence to him, and should praise him for it.\n\nJust read the first paragraph on the wikipedia page for [Stalin's cult of personality:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin's_cult_of_personality)\n\n&gt;the Soviet press presented Stalin as an all-powerful, all-knowing leader, and Stalin's name and image became omnipresent. Since 1936 the Soviet journalism started to refer to Joseph Stalin as the Father of Nations.\n\nand the final paragraph detailing the end of the cult of personality:\n\n&gt;In his 1956 \"Secret Speech\" to the Twentieth Party Congress, Nikita Khrushchev famously denounced Stalin's cult of personality, saying, \"It is impermissible and foreign to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to elevate one person, to transform him into a superman possessing supernatural characteristics akin to those of a god.\"\n\nWhile it's not exactly the same as traditional religion, read through that and tell me it doesn't remind you very, very strongly of religion in general. I think it quite comfortably meets the definition of a quasi-religious state.\n\n&gt;Where atheism believes that something other than a God created the universe, believes that nothing happens when they die and because if it they avoid organized religion though sometimes they go beyond that and actively try to convert followers.\n\nBut these aren't beliefs, they're lack of beliefs. You don't *believe* that the loch ness monster doesn't exist, you lack belief in it because it's silly. I don't have a belief that the loch ness monster isn't there, because it's just not important to me, I just plain old lack belief.\n\nJust on the points you brought up too:\n\n1. We don't even know if the universe was created in any way at all. All we know is that tracing the big bang back leads to a singularity. But we can only measure back to about 0.00000000000001 seconds, we can never get to 0, so whether or not there was a \"creation\" point or not, is unknown. Also, remember that no-one ever in this universe has ever experience true nothingness (there's always radiation, or gravity or something), so the idea that the universe didn't exist, and then was created, might not even make any sense.\n2. No-one knows what happens when you die, because we haven't revived anyone from a long death. But for me, I'd say nothing happens, because nothing happens when you get knocked out, or when you drown and are resuscitated, so I imagine that death is the same.\n3. Atheists might try to convert people away from religion for two reasons that I see: 1. They think they're right, and humans love convincing other humans that they're right. 2. They think religion hurts people, and don't want other people harmed by it. Maybe they think it's harming the person they're trying to convert. But the truth is, it's just human nature to try and help others/and/or convince others you're right.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385435101", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The premise of your question seems to indicate that religion and science don't interact and that Prof. Dawkins is the one who is bringing Science into the religious realm. You seem to ask, why not leave religion alone?\n\nDo you really think that our problem is Science trying to force its way into the religious realm? You don't think the real problem is religion elbowing its way into science?\n\n\nReligion is the number one obstacle to people accepting and embracing science. If it weren't for religion, we wouldn't have a debate about creation vs. evolution. \n\nIt's only through completely non-scientific beliefs and wishful thinking that you can conjure an alternative to evolution, and you can barely even do that. \n\nYet here we are, in the 21st century, with Texas Christians playing a major role in what goes in science textbooks, and [in Louisiana a biology textbook uses the Loch Ness monster as an example to disprove evolution.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/25/louisiana-students-loch-ness-monster-disprove-evolution_n_1624643.html) \n\nI think Prof. Dawkins problem with religion is not that he dislikes freedom of religion, or the right of people to believe silly things, and I don't think he set out with the goal of attracting people to science and away from religion. I think he began as a scientist and being in the field of Evolution, he ran into religious opposition quite frequently, and I think his desire to squash religious arguments comes from the fact that actual scientists are being accosted by religious people who know nothing of science and are actively trying to propagandize young people to their side. \n\nSo let's not pretend that Science and Religion have been peacefully co-existing and it's the evil Prof. Dawkins who suddenly changed everything by attacking religion. I do believe you'll find that religion has been trying to destroy science since the dawn of knowledge. \n\nDon't expect the battle to go away either. Religion and Science are absolutely opposed to one another, and the fact that debates and arguments arise between them is not a coincidence or the by-product of people being rude. Religions rest of the idea that you can KNOW answers to unknowable questions. Science rests on the idea that you can't know anything for sure, and the things you can *think* with some degree of certainty have to be proven and proven and proven again. To think these two lines of thinking won't butt heads is ridiculous. \n\nI for one am extremely glad that there are people willing to take up this fight. And I think it's absurd the degree to which people say that Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens are/were rude or unecessarily mean to religious people. The only way one can come to that conclusion is that they have to live in a secular echo-chamber and be unaware of the amount and extremity of the vitriol coming from the religious side. You think this is a fight that Richard Dawkins started?\n\nRepublican Representative Paul Broun of Georgia sits on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, and called Evolution “lies straight from the pit of hell.” \n\nThis wasn't some nutjob on a website. This is one of the most powerful people in America, who has decided that he wants to be one of the few people making decisions on behalf of the country on the topics of Science, Space, and Technology. And he just called every teacher of evolution a puppet of Satan. I do believe the worst thing you'll hear Richard Dawkins call anyone is foolish. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385488247", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, story time. Buckle up, my friends.  \nSo my friend came over to smoke hookah at my place a few weeks ago. In my social circles everyone knows that if they want good hookah, they come to my place. My friend wanted good hookah, so he came over.  \nAs soon as he walked in, I noticed he looked a bit different. I asked him what was up, and after a few minutes of cajoling he told me that he had just taken a teensy weensy bit of LSD. I said cool, how are you feeling? He said good, but he has a bit more on him that he wants to take to get him really high. I suggested we try putting it in the base, and see what happens. My friend agreed.  \nSo we added it to the water, mixing it up well to make sure it got around the vase, and lit up a hookah.  \nThe first few minutes were fine. Nothing different. After about 10 minutes I began to feel a weird feeling in my head. Like lightheaded, but different.  \n20 minutes later I was high as fuck. I have a camel design on my hookah vase, and it started walking in circles around the vase. I felt bad for it. It could walk all day long, but it would forever be contained to the vase.  \nI started trying to blow ships out of the smoke, like Gandalf does. I swear my friend did one. Then the tiles in my apartment started to look weird, so I went to lie down on the floor and press my cheek to them to see if everything was okay. My friend did the same.  \nThen my friend asked if we could look at the coals. Best idea ever. They weren't lit, they were alive. When I blew on them I added more life to them, making them glow hotter, so I kept blowing and blowing until my head was spinning and I had to sit down.  \nMy friend suggested we add another coal, to give it life. Naturally I agreed. I put a coal on my stove and left it. A few minutes later I came back, and it had come to life! All red and glowing and ALIVE. My friend looked at the box of coals. A fresh 108 count box of coconaras, with maybe 10 used.\n\"It isn't really fair to pick one coal to live, and leave all the others in their dead state\" he said, and I could not have agreed more.  \nSo we took all of the coals, put them in the oven, and turned it on full blast.  \nIt took almost a half hour until they were fully ready. I turned to my friend and said \"My hookah isn't big enough to smoke all these coals\".  \n\"My hookah is\". He replied, and walked out the door. 5 minutes later he returned, bringing with him a 40' hookah, and a bowl that could easily contain 250gm of tobacco.  \n\"Wow,\" I said. \"How many grams of tobacco do you put in that thing?\"  \n\"About tree fiddy.\" He replied.\nIt was then that I noticed that it was not, in fact, my friend, but an enormous reptilian beast fresh from a certain loch in Scotland.  \n\"Goddamn it Nessie, I ain't got no tree fiddy grams of tobacco\". I said.  \nNessie turned and left.  \nYou'd think this story has a happy ending, but Nessie also shit in my bathroom before he left, and I'm still cleaning up the mess.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385527452", "subreddit": "hookah", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Today would have been the thirty-fifth birthday of my little brother, Paul.\nMost of the time I manage to get on with my life and keep the memories of him from my mind, but on his birthdays that gets particularly hard to do. Sometimes, when I’m really low, I blame myself that he’s not around anymore. It was me, after all, who suggested the whole adventure caving thing in the first place, and that’s when everything started to go wrong.\nIt was seven years ago now. Around Christmas 2006 (I remember it was Christmas because he’d bought a real tree for his living room and I told him he’d regret it when all the needles fell and he’d have to clean them up). We were sharing a quiet beer in his living room while my wife and sister-in-law played with my little niece in the dining room. We could hear her squealing with laughter. I’d gotten the sense throughout the evening that Paul was depressed somehow. He wasn’t as extroverted as he usually was and more than once I caught him staring out of the window while the rest of us were having a conversation that would have normally interested him.\nI asked him if everything was okay and he grinned and took a swig of beer then said “yeah, I’m fine”, then he thought for a moment and added “just a bit bored with life I think.”\nThis surprised me because he was always so cheerful and busy. He had a job that most people would have killed for – a lead programmer with a well-known computer game development company. The hours were long at times but the pay was pretty incredible. He’d just bought a new house – a cute bungalow in a quaint village called Bishop’s Tachbrook near Royal Leamington Spa. His kid was happy and healthy and doing well in her first years at school. Compared to my own life (at the time I was working 12-hour rotating shifts in a factory in Leicester and my wife and I were barely making ends meet), he seemed to be living the dream. How someone could be bored with such an existence was beyond me. I pressed him to elaborate.\n“It sounds stupid and ungrateful you know,” he said, “but success isn’t really very exciting. I get up and go to work, come home and play with Alice, maybe do a bit of work on the house, watch telly, go to bed and then get up and do it all over again. I think I miss when times weren’t so easy. I miss the thrill of there being things to improve on.”\nAs he said this I happened to glance at the TV, which was turned on in the corner on with the volume down. There was a commercial playing where a smiling guy was skydiving, and with barely even a pause I said, “Maybe you just need a bit of adventure. Go parachuting or caving or something.”\nAnd that was that.\nSo in a way it was my fault.\nAfter the chaos of Christmas was over, Paul phoned me and told me he’d taken my advice and arranged an adventure caving trip for the coming spring. He and a few of his workmates had hooked up with a couple of local professional cavers and they were going to get a guided descent down a small system of caves called Gautries Hole in the Peak District. As far as I know these weren’t public caverns, they just began as some rift in a farm field and opened up into a quite challenging cave system as you progressed through.\nPaul suggested that I come along with them, but I politely declined. Truth is I’m a bit too claustrophobic to be squeezing through dark, wet tunnels underground. I was legitimately chicken.\nSo the snows thawed and spring came and then, sometime in May, Paul went off on his little adventure, and that’s when things started going bad.\nA few days later my wife got a call from Paul’s wife, Lisa. She wanted us to come over because Paul had been acting strange since his return from the cave. She said he’d seemed distant and easily shaken but the thing that pushed her to call us was that she’d taken him a cup of tea and inadvertently scared him by approaching from behind; he’d spun around and belted the drink from her hand, ruining the sofa and smashing the cup to pieces against the wall. They’d had a shouting match then and he’d said some things that were meaner than their usual quarrels (she never elaborated on exactly what they were), and then he isolated himself in his study.\nMy wife said she was crying when she called.\nWe made the drive out to Bishops Tachbrook, which was quite a distance from where we lived, and were greeted by Lisa at the door. My wife took Lisa and Alice out to a local restaurant to give us some space and I went inside and knocked on the door of my brother’s study. It took a while to get him to begrudgingly open it but when he finally did, the first words out of my mouth were “what the fuck is going on?”\nThinking back, it was probably because I was so blunt at that moment that he opened up and told me. Despite his successes in life, I was still his big brother and if I got the right tone in my voice he’d still jump whenever I said so. He stumbled around what he was trying to say at first, but eventually he got going and it was like I could see his shoulders physically releasing tension. He was glad to be unburdening himself.\nBefore I go further, I should probably mention that my brother got all the brains in the family. And I don’t mean he was just a smart kid; I mean he was a bit of a prodigy. He studied math and physics together in university, and before he became a computer programmer there were days where I honestly though he might change the face of science one day – have an Einstein moment and come up with some groundbreaking new theory or something. We’d sit and have philosophical conversations where I’d come up with all these fanciful scenarios about paranormal or science-fiction stuff and he’d smile like he was talking to a three-year-old and explain exactly where the errors in my thought process were and why the laws of physics wouldn’t allow the stuff I was envisioning.\nTo exemplify how smart he was, when I was in my early twenties and he was still a teen, I said one day that I missed the old wooden-veneered Atari 2600 games console. I especially missed the game “Pong” which consisted of two wheeled controllers that you could use to move a block of pixels up and down a screen to stop a ball (which was really a square) from going of the edge of the screen – it was basically the world’s first digital game of tennis as far as I know.\nPaul told me to keep myself occupied for ten minutes and he left the room.\nTen minutes later he called me into his computer room and there on the Amiga (which he’d modded out with all sorts of Back to the Future style gizmos that stuck out of the casing) he’d programmed a perfect rendition of Pong. Ten minutes flat – that’s probably not a big achievement nowadays but trust me, back then before the era of PCs and simpler coding languages, it was a pretty incredible feat.\nWe played his version of Pong all afternoon.\nBecause of how smart Paul was, he was also a die-hard skeptic. He had no time for flights of fancy, even as a teenager. He didn’t believe in God, ghosts, the Loch Ness monster or psychics. He thought Aliens were a statistical probability but frequently said the likelihood of them visiting our planet was practically zero just because of the vast distances involved. If I argued that maybe they had more advanced science and technology than we did, he’d do that smile again, like I was a child, and explain to me that technology is still restrained by the laws of physics no matter how advanced it gets, and the laws of physics apply across the entire universe.\nSorry for the long the digression, but I those details are important. Even the Pong story, trust me.\nIt’s because of how skeptical Paul was that what he told me in his study that day held so much weight for me. It just wasn’t something that I’d have expected him to say in a million years.\n“I saw something down there that wasn’t human” he said.\nHe held my gaze firmly like he was admitting murder. I realize now that what was happening to him was that this solid framework of rationalism and logic that he’d so confidently hung his world on was collapsing around him.\nA long moment passed where we both looked at each other in silence and then he said, “Do you believe me?”\n“Of course I believe you” I said. “I know you’d never make shit like that up. What did you see?”\nHe broke my gaze then and looked at the wall across the room.\n“We were having a really good time” he said, “I was at the back of the team and we were making our way through one of the chambers. We had lights on our helmets and so you could only see exactly where you looked, everything else was black, like pitch black.”\nI nodded; I’d been in public caves before where they turned out the lights to show tourists the impenetrable darkness of the subterranean world. It was the kind of darkness that seemed to have physical weight. It pressed in on you. It wasn’t something you easily forgot.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385689804", "subreddit": "teenagers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;There is no level of open mindedness that can cause harm\n\nI can't think of a more wrong statement if I tried. You have defined simple gullibility and credulousness. There are numerous ways open mindedness can cause harm being open to homeopathy, people like Stanislaw Burzynski and his alternative cancer cures, etc., etc.. \n\nOr to sum it up even better from Steven Novella:\n\n&gt;I listened patiently as the UFO enthusiast explained how humans were transplanted to the earth from another world by our alien forebears.\n\n&gt;“Then how do you explain the fact that humans share 98% of our DNA with chimpanzees, and a genetic code will all life on earth?” I asked.\n\n&gt;“Well, I think you have to keep an open mind,” was her starry-eyed response.\n\n&gt;People who believe odd things–that coffee enemas can cure cancer, that the Loch Ness Monster exists, that art on the dollar bill can explain secret conspiracies–are always telling us to “keep an open mind.”\n\n&gt;To that, the classic reply is: “Keep an open mind, sure–but not so open that your brains fall out.” In the endless sparring between skeptics and believers, the “keep an open mind” rejoinder is the favorite weapon in the believers’ arsenal. It is their all-purpose tool. But what does it really mean to be open-minded, and is it the skeptics or the believers who are truly closed-minded?\n\n&gt;Having an open mind is a curious virtue: Everyone agrees that open-mindedness is indeed a virtuous state, but it’s most often praised by those being decidedly closed-minded. Also, the most open-minded people are those whom you would least suspect as paragons of this particular virtue, skeptics. And those most lacking open-mindedness are those most likely to admonish others for not being so–true believers.\n\n&gt;Let me explain.\n\n&gt;Having an open mind means you don’t dismiss claims to truth out of hand. You analyze first. When you analyze a claim, you consider all the relevant evidence and examine all the logic involved, in a fair and unbiased manner, then grant tentative acceptance or rejection. If new arguments or new evidence come up, then you revise your opinion. Being open means that you apply this standard fairly to all claims. Being open-minded does not mean believing every claim, no matter how improbable–that’s being gullible, not open.\n\n&gt;This process of fair analysis, based upon logic and evidence, leading to tentative conclusions, which are open to revision, is part of science. It is also the very soul of true open-mindedness.\n\n&gt;By contrast, true believers adhere to a desired claim regardless of evidence or logic. No argument is persuasive enough, and no evidence (or lack thereof) is compelling enough to nudge them from the perch of their belief. They are closed to the possibility that Bigfoot might be a delusion, that crop-circles are pranks, that coffee enemas don’t cure cancer–that their cherished belief might be wrong. Yet it is such believers who most frequently claim the moral high ground of open-mindedness, then condemn unbelievers for being closed-minded. They wish others to accept their claims either without examining the logic and evidence, or despite refutation from such examination.\n\n&gt;The “open-minded” police often use the label of “closed-minded” as a personal attack to dismiss the arguments of those who dare to examine their claims. You do not believe I was abducted by aliens, they argue, because you are closed-minded. (Could it be because they lack credibility or any evidence to back up the claim? Or because the claim is inherently improbable?) To them, being abducted by aliens is an article of faith, much as religious believers take certain beliefs on faith.\n\n&gt;That’s fine. People are entitled to their faith. It’s an important freedom, guaranteed in the Constitution. But personal faith cannot be used to justify a scientific claim about the factual state of nature. Scientific claims must be public, open, and transparent–they cannot be based upon secret knowledge, special talents, or unquestioned virtues. If you think aliens have visited the planet, you must be prepared to offer evidence, not just accuse other people of being closed-minded for not believing you.\n\n&gt;Science is also a cumulative process. At this point in history we happen to be sitting on centuries of painstakingly accumulated scientific knowledge. It would be both hubris and folly to ignore all that has gone before. So while keeping an open mind to new ideas and claims, it is to our advantage to view such claims through the filter of established knowledge. Believers would have us view new claims in an intellectual vacuum, as if all claims were inherently equal.\n\n&gt;So let me turn the tables and humbly ask you, dear reader, to be truly open-minded. Adhere to the advice of David Hume, who wrote, “A wise man portions his belief to the evidence.” Keep your brains tucked safely inside your skulls. Be open but not gullible. And remember, it is better to think than to believe.\n\nSo case in point I listened to the truther's \"evidence\"(heck I used to be one) and I read the NIST report and listened to the experts. The latter used logic, evidence, review, reproducible data, review, open discussion, and experiment. The former uses conjecture, anomaly, hunting, supposition, and has provided no real data on their competing hypothesis other than \"Well it looks like a demolition\". Well the moon looks like it is the size of the dime but its not. Not to mention truthers continue submitting the same so called anamolies as evidence when they have been explained again and again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385724308", "subreddit": "skeptic", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This was before the days of Twitter, Facebook, and the rest, so they could actually get away with keeping in under wraps. I had my own theories. I thought that maybe Han Solo was a double agent. Maybe the Death Star they blew up was actually a decoy, and there was some Super Death Star lurking in the midst. \n\nOn a cold, dark night in 1980, I drove to the theater with my fiance. We were all dressed up in our finest Star Wars attire- I went as Luke, my fiance went as Leia. We had a bit of a scuffle with the ticket taker because I thought the ticket price was too high. I refused to give it to him. My fiancé told me I should just give in and pay it, but I stood my ground. So we snuck in through the back.\n\nI could immediately tell that it was better than the first one. The acting, the pacing, the dialogue- all were so much better. When Lando Calrissian betrayed Han Solo, I thought that was the big twist everyone was talking about- but boy, was I wrong. \n\nI remember watching that fateful scene on the edge of my seat. I was trying to stay focused on the movie, but some asshole sitting behind me kept poking me. I turned around and politely whispered that he stop.\n\n\"I know who you are, asshole!\" he said. \"You're the guy who wouldn't pay the ticket price! You snuck in! That's it, I'm getting the usher! You're busted, pal!\"\n\nHe raced off for the exit. My blood began to boil- Luke and Vader were having an epic lightsaber battle, and I knew that something big was going to happen. One of the theater attendants, who had just been informed of the situation, approached me and asked me to show him my ticket. I fumbled through my pockets for a while. After obviously not finding it, I told him I must have lost it. \n\n\"You're not fooling anyone, sir,\" he said. \"Let's go.\"\n\nAs my fiance and I were being escorted out of the theater, I heard those fateful words come out of Darth Vader's mouth. So *that* was the twist, I thought...I never would have guessed it. \n\nAfter making our way towards the entrance, we were confronted by the ticket taker. \"You snuck in, asshole! You better pay up now or you're banned from this theater forever. C'mon man, it isn't that expensive. I need about tree fiddy.\" Well, I wasn't gonna give that asshole no tree giddy, so me and my fiance made a run for it.

{"body": "Yiu haven't given a source, and I said you should NOT feel embarrassed. Your book is crackpot. I don't have to read it, just like I don't have to read a book about the Loch Ness Monster to know there isn't a Loch Ness Monster. \n\nMatthew was composed in Greek. That is the prevailing view of virtually all Biblical scholarship. It *couldn't* have been written in Hebrew because it copies word for word from Greek sources. \n\nYou asserted repeatedly that we have some kind of Hebrew manuscript copies of Matthew. I can tell you I know for a fact that isn't true. Yiu have been unable to identify this manuscript or show any evidence that it exists. The book you're talking about ALSO does not claim such a manuscript exists. That's NOT in the book. When that book talks about \"Hebrew writings hidden away,\" it's talking about Rabbis who translated Matthew into Hebrew themselves for purposes of commentary done in Hebrew. It's no different than how modern commentators might translate the Koran into English so they can discuss it with an English audience. \n\nThis Gordon guy wants to argue *by inference* that the Gospels was first written in Hebrew (and like I said, he's all by himself on an island with that). He does not actually have any kind of early manuscript copy and doesn't claim to. \n\nYou haven't backed up your assertion and even your book doesn't say what YOU said. \n\nFact: There are no early manuscript copies of Matthew in Hebrew or in any language but Greek.\n\nFact: Virtually all modern scholarship is certain that Matthew was composed in Greek.\n\n\nAt best, there is some opinion that the Q material in Matthew may have originally been Hebrew (or more likely Aramaic) oral traditions, later translated into a Greek sayings source that was used by Matthew and Luke.
