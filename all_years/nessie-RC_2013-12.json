{"body": "Yeah, the moral of this is: When in doubt, let everybody into your parties. About 10 years ago, I just graduated from college and wanted to throw an epic party.  My parents had a property that they leased to other college kids in town, but at the time no one was using it.  I took this as an opportunity to throw a party there.  I made flyers and dropped them around campus advertising my party \"The one last party before you leave\".  Honestly, that wasnt even necessary, my school was a decent sized and had a reputation for being a party school.  As long as you had your lights on, audible music and beer, people would just show up.  Anyways, my buddies and I had a beer savings fund and we picked up a shitton of booze and miller.  We started the tunes and drinking at 8 and by 930 there must have been 130 people at the party.  We were getting to the point where we were worried about running out of drinks.  We started chilling by the door and turning away any new people we didn't know.  This kind of sketchy guy in a hoodie comes up and DEMANDS we let him in.  We kindly just say that the party was winding down and people were leaving, which was obviously not true, but we were trying to be nice.  He starts getting aggravated and says that he will cause trouble if we don't let him in.  I started getting a weirder vibe than before and felt reassured that we didn't want him there, so we told him to get lost.  It was about 1130 then and by 1230, we were tanked and forgot about watching the door.  All of the sudden, we hear crashing and the sound of windows breaking. My brother and I run out and see the guy breaking car windows with a wrench.  We yell at him to stop and he says he will if we do something for him.  He said, \"I need about Tree-Fiddy.\" At that point, we realized that he was actually about 8 stories high and a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era. I said \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy, you goddamn loch ness monster! Get out of here!\" And he left.

{"body": "I agree with most of your points, and I discuss them in my book. Yet none of these points detract from these basic arguments that support a \"Paleo template\" diet:\n—the high nutrient-density of meat, fish, nuts and seeds, vegetables and fruits\n—the relatively low nutrient-density of grains and legumes. This doesn't mean they can't be part of a healthy diet, but it does mean they shouldn't be the focus\n—the good balance of fats: the bulk of fat intake should be monounsaturated and saturated, with a smaller amount from polyunsaturated. I agree that omega-6 from whole foods is unlikely to cause problems *if long-chain omega-3 fat intake is adequate*. (Unfortunately it's not for many people.) Industrial seed oils are another story, because they're highly susceptible to oxidative damage.\n\nI've used the concept of \"Paleo template\" for exactly the reasons you mention. There's no such thing as a Paleo diet, there's tremendous variation in what our ancestors and modern hunter-gatherers ate, and we don't live in the Paleolithic era anymore.  \n\nBut that doesn't mean the entire concept of Paleo nutrition is invalid. It just means that it needs to be expanded, updated and clarified. That's what I've tried to do in my book (for example, I have an entire section debunking the notion that Paleo=low carb and suggesting guidelines for how to find your optimal macronutrient ratios). \n\nI debated whether to use the word Paleo in my book title at all, since what I'm recommending isn't technically a Paleo diet (and certainly not strict Paleo). Ultimately I decided to use the term because it's recognizable, and I wanted to debunk some of what I consider to be the myths associated with Paleo.

{"body": "I have quite the story. I had some bad experiences that actually led to my making a lot of money in stocks. I learned that, for all the money I had, was not worth the family and friendships lost.  \n\nI had been in a bad car accident when I was about 24 and had some spinal damage.  Once I recovered, I was left with somewhat of a permanent limp and chronic back pain.  Because of the pain, I was prescribed various pain meds but none really worked well until I started getting some of the stronger stuff, like heavy opiates.  I became really dependent on the pills and was using more than I was supposed to.  My doc saw the problems that might arise, so he cut back on my dosage, but I still needed the medicine for my pain.  I started drinking a lot to make the medicine more potent.  Now, I had received a settlement for the car crash (it was entirely the other parties' fault), which was about $8000.  At the time, I didn't have the full extent of my pain problems, but if I had, I probably would have spent it on whatever pills I could get.  But instead, I had placed it all on some stocks.  Back to the point where I was having substance problems, my stocks TOOK OFF.  When I cashed out, I had made a $730,000 profit.  As you can probably guess, all that money in the hands of somebody fiending for pain relief, is not a good thing.  In the first month, I had wasted 100k on drugs and boose and associated stupid purchases while messed up.  Six months later, I had spent all of my profits.  However, some of it was actually spent on acquiring a small business.  So, I had a reasonable income, but I certainly was not as rich as I once was. \n\n I really hit rock bottom when I found myself staying inside all day, watching cartoons in a drunken-pilled out stupor.  I had forgot my brother's birthday.  When I sobered up a little, I saw 12 missed calls and a handful of missed texts.  It was my family, checking to see where I was.  I hopped in the car and sped off to my brother's place.  On the way, I heard the distinctive cry of a police car behind me.  My heart sunk, I knew I would not pass a breath test, let alone appear sober.  I pulled over as calmly as I could, desperately contemplating ways to fix the situation. The officer began to approach my car as I was trying to straighten up and appear well kept, which is too feasible for someone who has been passed out on a couch for the past 36 hours.  I reeked like Jack Daniels and stale Cheetos.  I rolled down my window and asked the officer how he was doing.  He sternly said \"License and Registration.\"  I had not even remembered to bring my wallet.  I knew I was screwed.  I stuttered as I attempted to explain that I forgot it and could turn around and get it if it was ok.  He asked me to step out of the car.  As I fumbled and stumbled exiting the car, he asked \"Do you know why I pulled you over today?\" I quietly replied, \"no.\"  He said, \" I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was at this point that I realized that this was no police officer, he was an eight story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.  I said \"GODDAMNIT LOCH NESS MONSTER! I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"  He said \"How about two fiddy?\"  I said, \"I AIN'T GIVIN YOU NO TWO FIDDY, GET YOUR OWN MONEY YOU LOCH NESS MONSTER!\" He just swam away.\nAnd that was the second time I ran into the Loch Ness monster.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385929359", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I've got to say though that the three points you got out of the article really don't grasp what it was about. Maybe try reading it more closely?\n\nAs far as the straw man argument goes, Eagleton basically says that what 'Ditchkins' is doing is framing the question of god's existence in a similar manner to asking if a yeti exists or the loch ness monster. In other words, they're asking for objective, tangible proof of a mythical creature. Their criticism of religion stems from this lack of tangible proof.\n\nWhat Eagleton then does is bring in theologists like St. Thomas Aquinas who've said that the idea of religion has really never been about proving God's existence and that true faith requires doubt and skepticism that God may even truly exist. An individual saying \"I believe in God,\" is like saying \"I believe that the Cubs are the best team in baseball.\" It's not a matter of thinking your belief is the only true correct belief, it's a matter of making a personal decision as to what your own faith represents and how it manifests.\n\nEagleton then notes that what both fundamentalist and neo-athiests have in common is that both of their beliefs stem from a desire to extinguish doubt and declare an absolute truth that is not simply a matter of personal choice but something that must be universally accepted for the sake of mankind.\n\nThere's a lot more to Eagleton's book but I'm getting tired.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385973776", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "What evidence, specifically, are you suggesting has been scientifically disproved in reference to the existence of a god or gods?  Such questions simply cannot be addressed by science.  \n\nWhile it is reasonable to say that some things don't exist because of a preponderance of negative results, deities don't really fit on that list.  For instance, you can be reasonably certain that the Loch Ness monster and mermaids don't exist because they're supposedly physical beings living in physical locations on Earth that we have the capacity to sample and model.  In these cases, the lack of evidence is an almost certain indication that these things do not exist, because if they did, we'd probably have seen a body or something by now.  Conversely by definition, God does not exist in the same universe/dimension as humans and does not behave in a predictable manner.  If he/she/it exists, there would be no way to sample, measure, model, or manipulate him/her/it for scientific study, so science cannot provide any evidence for or against her/his/its existence. \n\nYou, and everyone else are free to believe whatever you want, and I'm not espousing one side or the other here.  However, science is no more on the side of atheists than it is on the side of believers.  Everyone's belief or lack thereof is entirely a matter of personal choice.  \n\nI'm probably gonna loose some serious comment karma for this but this kind of thing annoys the hell out of me.

This rifle is what stands between me and a True Believer.  Somewhere a True Believer is training to kill you and me. He is training with minimal food or water, in austere conditions, training day and night. The only thing clean on him is his weapon and he made his own web gear from the clothes of those he's killed. He doesn't worry about what workout to do - his ruck weighs what it weighs, his runs end when the enemy stops chasing him. This True Believer is not concerned about 'how hard it is;' he knows either he wins or dies. He doesn't go home at 17:00, he is home.  You can either remove your claws from my weapon and walk away, or you can meet the same fate as that True Believer.  Your choice.\"  The entire camp was dead silent, and after about a second, the wife released her grip on my rifle.  As I made my way back over to the fire, the group of guerillas parted like the Red Sea, staring at me in complete shock as I passed through them.

{"body": "You could argue that radio [shock jocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_jocks) at times fall into this category when they perform certain pranks.  Also, the tabloid press could fit the description when they intentionally spread false or misleading stories.  The [Weekly World News](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_World_News#History) fits this description nicely.  Orson Wells' [War of the Worlds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_%28radio_drama%29) broadcast could be seen as qualifying (depending on whether or not you believe disruption was his real motive - he was always pretty coy on that), but his [imitators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_%28radio_drama%29#Re-airings_and_adaptations), (particularly Paez and Alcaraz who literally caused riots in Quito in 1949) were definitely out to fool people.  People have also fabricated \"evidence\" for the [Cottingly Fairies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottingley_Fairies), the Loch Ness Monster, and Bigfoot in the past as well.\n\nOn the \"disrupting discussions\" side, you could look to known [broadcast signal intrusions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_signal_intrusion#Confirmed_events), which usually involve hijacking a satellite video feed.  There have been a few pranks (the Max Headroom incident in the Wikipedia article) but some had political motives (Playboy channel and the actions by Polish Solidarity movement).  \n\nIt's perhaps not surprising that the \"false stories\" events all of these occur in the era of mass media while \"disruption\" is confined to the era of broadcasting.  For a false story to be worth an elaborate hoax, you need a large audience.  For the disruption angle, you need that audience in real time.  While I am sure there must have been plenty of examples that predate either periods (i.e. heckling a speaker at a public lecture or spreading a rumor/legend around the village one knew was false), they just don't don't have the same payoff.

{"body": "I want to see this play out:\n\nSaul is hitting his stride, and he's the king of ABQ in terms of TV lawyers. He's fought long and hard about making the best ads after numerous courtroom battles, angry ex wife/wives (I don't remember the details), and a number of hilarious and serious situations. \n\nHe gets a call from a freshly-arrested man, maybe in his 50s or 60s or so. Very odd for someone who would call Saul. He pays him a visit in jail. This guy is in for the usual dumb shit Saul deals with, so Saul pretends it's just another day as he gets the perp's name wrong. He corrects himself, then struggles with the guy's last name - butchers it, and asks him if it's German, and if he has any \"3rd or 4th Reich Buddies\" \n\nWe don't see the guy immediately, but his voice and cadence of his speech is immediately recognizable. He discovers that this guy has a long, odd story. Former police officer - a beat cop - who got into some shit out East, and moved out here. He's being charged with Assault and Battery after beating up some kid who's name will be familiar (one of Gus's henchmen, and one of Mike's \"Guys\"). \n\nHe's odd. As Saul asks him questions, this old man calmly asks questions back. We get the feeling that he's evaluating Saul. Of course he is...\n\n...the camera cuts to the man. The guy's last name is Ehrmantraut. We're not sure if the guy he beat up is just some guy, or if there was more to it (hint: there was more to it). He continues to ask Saul questions - nothing personal, just to see how he deals with the heat and authority figures. \n\nMr. Ehrmantraut (yes...Mike) then asks Saul to get him out of there, and Mike is released on his own recognizance. \n\nAs Mike takes a cab back to wherever he's going, he makes a phone call:\n\n\"Yup - he knows what he's doing. Nope, not suspicious at all. Yup - he's exactly who we need. Now get (Mike's guy) to drop the charges and we'll be good.\" Our suspicions aren't yet confirmed, but they're correct. Gus is on the line. \n\n***\n\nSaul goes back to being Saul, and thinks nothing of his meeting other than making a comment to his secretary that he hates it when he has to represent cops (and adds a colorful metaphor). \n\nMinutes before closing, we see two sets of legs walking through a parking lot to a closed glass door. They try it and it's locked. Saul's secretary, who's not yet \"hardened\" simply responds with a \"We're closed, come back at 10am tomorrow!\" One gentleman (a new, but familiar voice) calmly makes up a story about how he needs assistance and appeals to her heart. She opens the door, and they rush her, asking where Goodman is. She points to his office door, shaken, but timid, as it's her first time being threatened. \n\n***\n\nThey bust down the door, and Saul is tanning himself with a Hammacher Schlemmer desktop tanning machine. In typical fashion, he  talks to the men like they're his secretary as his eyes are closed, and they rip his eyepiece off his face and take a seat. \n\nThey propose a deal, offering specifics that Saul doesn't understand, but we as viewers do.\n\nSaul refuses, but of course, the money they promise him - millions - intrigue him. Fearful of the menacing old man's look, and the odd calmness of his partner (Gustavo Fring), he complies, and so begins his relationship with the Fring Empire and Mike. \n\nIt's here where they could continue with a story arc about setting up the Fring Empire, and how he can only provide services for that, and not Los Pollos Hermanos, requesting that they not be linked. Mike threatens him, but Gus understands the logic behind the decision, opting to keep connections between the two businesses separate. \n\nHere it would be fun to see \"adventures\" with Mike and Saul, but it might be overkill...\n\n***\n\nAt some point, a time lapse is represented and we cut to a beaten down Saul wearing a T-Shirt, next to a big duffel bag, sitting in some tubular prison, being shaken around. The shaking stops, and the background humming that sounded like a diesel engine turns to silence. A dim square of light appears at one end of the tube-prison. \n\nWe hear a man with a Rochester NY accent tell him that he can come out. Saul crawls out and sees a rickety trailer surrounded by a few acres of land out the back and 2-3 similar trailers nearby. \n\nCut to Saul inspecting the inside of the trailer. Ed's voice (Robert Forrester) explains to him that his work uniform is in the closet, and he's to report to his job working as a groundskeeper at 7am. Saul tells him he pictured a Cinnabon or something like that. Ed tells him it's the best he can do. \n\nThe final scene in the series is Saul standing by a lake in coveralls carrying a shovel. A disabled teen with crutches that we all know approaches him with a huge smile on his face:\n\n\"What do you want kid, I'm busy.\"\n\n\"I...um...I need...\"\n\n\"What?\" Saul is irritable, broken, and not his usual corny-charismatic self.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time Saul realizes that this boy is about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten him again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" he yells as the boy swims  away into the distance.\"\n\nEnd series.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386130031", "subreddit": "breakingbad", "score": 53, "controversiality": 0}

See, Joshu was a sillly person who was renowned for his \"lip Zen.\" Because of this, the emperor thought it would be some kind of funny joke to send him to investigate these two hermits who had both taken a vow of silence. So Joshu goes on his way, making his journey through mountain paths, across rivers and through rice paddies. He stopped for food, for tea, and more than a few times to smack someone with some idea about something something Zen something. So finally he arives at this forest next to mount Huang-po where Obaku used to smack Linchi around, and he meets the two hermits.  Joshu went to the First hut of the Zen Hermits.  Opening the door and looking in, he asked:  “Is anything here?”  The hermit thrust up his fist.  Joshu said, “The water here is too shallow for a ship even to anchor.”  Thereupon he left. *So much for the vow of silence,* he thought. Then he made his way to yet another hut of a Zen Hermit.  Again opening the door and looking in, he asked, “Is anything here?”  That hermit also thrust up his fist.  Joshu then said, “Freely you give, freely you take away.  Freely you kill, freely you give life.”  Thereupon he bowed deeply to the hermit. Before he left, the hermit said, \"Since I have now taught you, I will require something in return.\" \"What?\" Joshu asked. \"I am going to need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time that Joshu noted that the second hermit was a 3 story tall ancient sea creature.

{"body": "I was just talking about this with my mom the other day actually.\n\n**Way-way-way-TL;DR:** It's about dropping out of university for a girl and throwing away all the education they paid for. I didn't at any time \"knife a ho\" or \"demand tree fiddy\" from anyone.\n\n*Preamble: I have a wonderful relationship with both of my parents, they love me very much and I love them very much. We talk regularly, and I love seeing them on the rare occasion when we can cross the country to be together. But sometimes we make mistakes that we can't undo, and disappointment can last forever.*\n\nMy parents worked very hard when I was a kid to send me to private schools. I got a wonderful education, I had amazing opportunities, and I was a generally happy and well-off kid. My parents took education VERY seriously. They both got multiple college degrees from private universities, and they absolutely expected their sons to make even better of themselves. Neither of their parents on either side went to college except for my dad's dad who didn't finish, and they always drove home the importance of college and education for our future. \n\nI was the oldest, and I took school seriously, but not TOO seriously. I was smart enough to be bored and disengaged, and I tended to focus on extra-curricular activities to the exclusion of homework. But I tested like a freak, and my grades were never \"bad\" they were just occasionally \"below expectations.\" (Graduated from HS with a 3.62 largely on the back of AP and electives).\n\nThank God for the SAT and ACT...my college career wasn't \"ruined.\" (This was a direct quote from around the dinner table at home)\n\nI applied to twelve colleges and got declined by two (Princeton and Yale), wait-listed by two (Harvard and Stanford), and accepted to the other eight (Amherst, Williams, Wesleyan, Trinity, UC Berkly, Penn, St. Johns, and Reed).\n\nMy mother was ecstatic. When the letter from Amherst got there she almost couldn't wait long enough to bring it into my room. She was visibly shaking, she was so excited.\n\nMy dad was excited, but I'd spurned his alma mater and he was confused by the fact that I was looking largely in New England when I had every opportunity to go somewhere like...Hawaii, or California, or...Florida for god's sake. \"Freeze your preppy balls off\" might have come up once or twice.\n\nAll this was \"right on track\" as far as my parents were concerned. All the time, effort, and MONEY they'd dropped on 12 years of (expensive) private (boarding) schools was paying off.\n\nAnd then I met her.\n\nShe was my HS sweet-heart and she was going to go to Oregon State University to become a Vet. And...like any lovesick 18-year-old boy is wont to do...I decided to change my whole world to be with her. I figured by going to Reed in Portland I'd be \"close enough\" and that would work.\n\nI hadn't counted on the culture-shock of going from a conservative private boarding school to the most liberal of liberal arts colleges in America. I lasted a whopping 8 hours (there's a whole story right there waiting to be told).\n\nThe sound of my mom's voice when I told her I wasn't cut out for Reed was one of the worst things I've ever heard outside of a hospital. I'm sure they could see the direction this was going, but they didn't know how to intervene.\n\nI ended up applying late to Portland State University, and barely had time to register for classes. And by barely, I mean I registered at 4:30p on the first Monday of classes and my options were somewhat limited.\n\nThere was even less surprise when I decided over winter break to transfer to OSU.\n\nWhat surprised my parents was when they found out that in my 19-year-old wisdom I'd decided to propose to her. Words were said. Feelings were hurt. A child refused to listen to reason.\n\nIn the end, I married her at 19, just a couple of weeks before my Sophomore year was about to start. My dad walked up during rehearsal dinner, clapped me on the back, and said \"tomorrow you're doing an adult thing. You're becoming a man, and I respect that. And a man pays for his own college.\" and then he walked away.\n\nI had a job, and I knew that we needed a steady income more than we needed me to focus on a degree...so I dropped out and found better and better jobs.\n\nI never took another university class again.\n\nMy marriage lasted 11 years until we divorced (just shy of 8 years ago) on reasonably amicable terms; we have a beautiful daughter who's turning 13 before I know it. My parents love their oldest granddaughter more than anything and wouldn't trade her for the world.\n\nBut I flushed away so much money and opportunity and potential. I had so many options, so many chances, and I didn't capitalize on it when I had the chance.\n\nMy parents love me, I have no doubt. But my mom can't think about what could have been, perhaps SHOULD have been, without a sick pit in her stomach and a look in her eyes that makes me burn with shame.\n\nShe'll always love me, but almost twenty years later I know she'll never forgive me for throwing my best chance for the future, and the opportunities they struggled so hard to give me, away.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386193362", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; There is likewise no evidence that they are inseparable.\n\n Sure there is. Neurophysics 101. We grow new physical neurons and connections between neurons in the process of learning. Neurogenesis does not stop. It's as evident as the understanding of the inseparability of sugar, flour, butter and eggs from a cake.\n\n&gt; I am less making a \"positive claim\" for an eternal mind than I am responding to the \"claim\" that the mind definitely ceases upon death.\n\n&gt; That second claim is not supported by the evidence either.\n\n Are you saying that there's no evidence proving a negative? There's no evidence that witchcraft does _not_ cause disease, either. There might be a conspiracy to play along with modern medicine to lull us into a sense of false security. It's _nonpossible_ to prove this isn't the case.\n\n We have evidence that the mind is a function of a physical brain, so when the physical brain ceases to function there is no longer any supportable reason to think the mind continues. You might as well speculate that the \"blue\" in the sky continues after the sun goes down and there's no longer anything sustaining [Rayleigh scattering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering).\n\n This is where mysticism comes from, the model supporting the possibility that it \"could be\" is, over time, refined until it reaches a point where it can't be refuted by evidence anymore. Yet as an unavoidable consequence it also works itself into the quagmire of unrestrainable speculation. There is no evidence that gravity doesn't smell like the number twelve, either. There's no evidence that the Loch Ness Monster does not exist, and he's simply excellent at hiding. There's no evidence that our universe is not suspended in the branches of [Yggdrasil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil). And there's no evidence that we aren't just a dream in the mind of a god.\n\n But we don't take any of those things seriously, because they're not only useless, they're uncheckable.

{"body": "The Cold War is filled with risky decisions, MAD being highly relevant to some of the most important, however I'd add\n\n- the Berlin Blockade and the subsequent decision of a Great Airlift. In the midst of heightening tensions from the creation of Bizonia, the polarisation of Russia was solidified by the Blockade's being thwarted by the airlift rather than the SU's demands being met. The airlift itself was deemed logistically impossible, but one plane every 45 seconds (1920 planes a day) supplying half a city with coal, food, water and other resources was both politically, an act of defiance to collaborating with wartime allies, economically, a knife-edge success/failure that turned out well and even militarily, with the militaristic approach favoured by General LeMay among others being repealed in favour of the peaceful alternative. Who knows what would happen if the hostilities in Berlin escalated\n\n- as was said higher up, the Cuban Missile Crisis, every actor. Castro allowing missiles was a defence assurance, the 1961 cooperation with Russia creating a proxy state at the USs doorstep. JFK, going through the motions and resisting calls for the a bomb, the h bomb, an escalation to DefCom 1 even when forced to DefCon 2, and ultimately enforcing - and vitally, taking absolute control of (and responsibility for) a \"quarantine\", a Blockade. Khrushchev for telling the ships approaching the blockade at 6am on the first day of the blockade to change paths or make for shore, then holding his own with the politburo's firm opposition to each of his actions. Truly a phenomenal 13 days\n\n- then Gorbachev, introducing perestroika and glasnost. This was a decision absolutely vital to the completion of Detente, and which took incredible balls. Openness in Russia was about as common as a tree fiddy joke in /r/askscience, yet Gorbachev - and the German President who introduced Ostpolitik (I forget his name) - allowed the dissolution of communism in Russia through these policies. Even in face of public backlash for the years of strict law, perestroika and glasnost allowed Yeltsins dual presidency and then the overall transition to democracy and end of the Cold War.\n\nThese are three turning points in history, knife edge decisions in hostile environments which changed humanity IMO.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386236293", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It's comparable to the god of the gaps argument. \n\nAnd you're assuming things that don't necessarily have to be true, such as the violation of the speed of light. Advanced civilisations don't have to break this fundamental law of physics if they use wormhole technology, for instance. There are other ways around the speed of light limit that don't violate general relativity. And what if these creatures are simply extremely long lived, or machine intelligences for which 10,000 years space travel means nothing? \n\nSo that reasoning falls down straight away.\n\nWe can only make analyses upon what we know. \n\nIf we start to introduce all sorts of unknown abilities of these aliens, why stop there? Why not leprechauns or ghosts or sasquatch? I could use this reasoning to make an argument that the loch ness monster is behind all of this, and because of its paranormal advanced abilities, it makes it *seem* to be alien visitation... and so on.\n\nYou can prove fairies exist with this kind of reasoning. Oh, there's no evidence of fairies? That's because their magic covers it up. \n\nIf we assume these things we lose the ability to determine anything, because we get lost in a mire of speculation. \n\nLogic dictates we make determinations based upon what is evident. \n\nThere is nothing evident to support the alien abduction scenario of the Strieber/Mack/Hopkins model, where the ETs come right into peoples' houses and float them through the walls, and so on.

{"body": "A few months ago my best friend was playing world of warcraft. He had just gotten some new mount. (I think he was farming for ashes of alar but I could be wrong) He got the new mount and was fucking excited. (We were roommates) I heard him scream so loud I swear the window cracked. I play about as much as he does, and I also play with him, and my god he was extremely happy. A few weeks pass and we are raiding thunder king. He tells me that he is considering quitting wow. I am shocked. He has never even considered this thought and now he is seriously ready to quit. I ask him why, but he shrugs it off with the excuse that he is addicted or some bullshit like that. That night he walks into my room while I was sleeping. He tells me that he needs to go to the ER. In a drowsy fade I get out of bed and noticed a bloody mess dripping from the top of his bunk. I look at him, and blood is jut gushing from his mouth like a fucking waterfall. Im scared as fuck. I grab my keys and shove him into the car and we drive to the ER. I gave him a bag to puke blood into but he fills that up fast and gets blood all over the seats. We get to the ER and the doctors let me in. He tells me the reason he wanted to quit wow was because he wanted to try new things because he knew he was sick and was going to die soon. He was very religious and wanted me to experience the new game he wanted to play before he died, was well as something else really important. He believed that his spirit could experience the game through me after he died. He told me to sign up for the Wildstar beta and try to get a key. He was really excited for it but he told me there was something else more important he needed from me. You see, he told me he needed around tree fiddy. It was then I noticed he was actually the loch ness monster. I ardently responded with \"You goddamn loch ness monsta i aint given you no tree fiddy!\" And left the ER. He died later that day.\n\nThats why I believe I deserve a WS beta key.\n\nAlso for reference to what a waterfall looks like: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wusGIl3v044#t=40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wusGIl3v044#t=40) NSFW\n\nTL;DR: My friend was literally cured from cancer with a hitler shaped dildo.

{"body": "Let's take a trip down memory lane. It was a nice sunny day back in June of 2006, I had just gotten back from College and was staying with my parents (I go to school upstate in NY and they live in Long Island, This is important). I had gotten a call from my best friend Mitchell to come down to coney island, Apparently there was some new attraction opening up now that the weather was getting nicer, I don't really remember. Anyway, I take the drive to coney island in my beat up 98 Geo Prism and meet up with him on the boardwalk. Once there I see that his girlfriend Kerry and another girl were standing beside him. I start to walk towards them and notice that the other girl was pretty smokin hot. At this point i'm overly excited thinking that my best friend had missed me and made sure to get me a hot date like the best wingman he is...or so I thought. Mitchell introduced us, let's call her Stacy. This girl was amazing at first glance, beautiful brown hair, amazing blue eyes, big pink lips, and the way she spoke was utterly remarkable, the voice of an angel and with such intellect. SO we had been introduced at this point, gotten on a few rides and ate some food, It's about 7:30 at night right now, the sun is starting to set and we're both about to head our separate ways. Just as Mitchell leaves I turn to head to my car with Stacy when she stops me and says she wants to go to Nathans. I think to myself \"Well, we already had plenty to eat, but Goddamnit I do love me some Nathan's.\" We get to the stand and order our food, I pay for my food and turn around to see Stacy sitting on the ground sitting upwards with her face buried in between her knees. \"Stacy, whats wrong?\" I say bending down to meet her eyes.

So I'm at the wedding and she's actually quite beautiful, so I think good on you bro. Anyway, I wanted to know what happened the last month and was trying all night to get to talk to him, which was impossible 'cause he's the guy getting married.

{"body": "So some background to this story...I know how everybody says there house is buried under an Indian burial ground, but I might be one of the few people who actually has markings and shit in the woods of their backyard. There's some large rock in my yard in the woods that not even Andre the Giant could move and it's often assumed by us that it's a main burial site that can actually be seen. When they built my house they didn't clear out these woods and it's not large by any a stretch, but as a kid I used to love playing in them.\nSo, around the age of 5, I'd go out in these woods for hours on end. It was around November and it was fairly cold out. My mom would watch from the window and since it was November, I was visible from the trees. She said I'd just sit on a log and occasionally get up and look at the ground. Sometimes I'd pick up leaves and study them and she said often it looked like I was talking. \nBy the third straight day home from morning kindergarten, she asked me what I was doing out there. I would respond how I'm talking to fast turtle. My mom assumed it was an imaginary friend and just let me be. \nOne night, late at night, my mom woke up to some thumping. Me being an only child, she heard it coming from my room. There she describes how I was sitting on the floor with my eyes closed. I was in a trance like state and chanting a song that wasn't English. I raised my hands and kept howling. My mom kneeled down quickly and woke me up. She shook me and asked what I was doing. I mentioned how fast turtle had taught me it.

{"body": "I could recreate it for you.\n\nOne time my wife and I had our anniversary dinner planned and booked in advance. At the last minute our sitter cancelled but recommended a friend of hers as a replacement. We contacted her friend and he seemed polite and charming over the phone so we agreed to have him babysit. When he showed up he was a nice, clean-shaven man in his early twenties. My 6 year-old son instantly took a liking to him. We gave him all the necessary contact information and before we were out the door they were already playing with my son's plastic dinosaur toys. Breathing a sigh of relief as we drove to the restaurant we sat down to have a nice evening away from our son. The dinner was uneventful for the first little while but after about an hour my cell phone rang. The sitter sounded frantic and was yelling about how we had to come home right away because there was some kind of emergency and to \"Please, come quick.\" My insides felt like led. My wife and I left without paying the bill and rushed home. I careened into the driveway, jumping out before I even had a chance to throw on the parking brake. My wife and I rushed inside and the sitter was there in our living room. He was holding a gun to our son's head. Our son was crying and screaming but the sitter just stared at us and frantically started spouting off at as, \"Look, I didn't want to do this! I just, I just really need the money!\" My wife was screaming behind me now but rooted to the spot. The sitter continued \"I just need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386550644", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's my standard response;\n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing. \n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386646073", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 22, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So get this, I was wearing khaki pants in grade 4 and was outside playing tag. I was it and just then realized I needed to go pee yesterday so I just ran off and ran for the washroom as fast as I could, leaving everyone there going wtf. When I got to the urinal I tried to unzip my pants but before I could do so the floodgates opened and I started peeing in my pants, in front of a urinal. Now at this moment I was in shock because it was during lunch time and I had half a school day to go through, so I just stood there and peed in my pants for a good 3 seconds before I realized there's a FCKING urinal in front of me so I quickly finished off in the urinal and stuffed some paper towels down my pants to dry up piss. I tried to drain my pants (since they were khakis it was extremely noticeable) for the rest of the lunch break to no avail. So, when the bell rang I just gave up and went back to class with the paper towels still in my pants because I hate the feeling of wet pants, thinking no one would notice. I was a bit late and as soon as I opened the door, the entire class (sitting on a carpet) just stopped and looked at me, the teacher included and tried not to laugh. I just stood there, mortified and ran out into the empty field and just started to bawl. A few minutes later the principle came up to me and goes \"alright mrx009, lets go\" other stuff was said of course in an failed attempt to comfort a 4th grade student who just let his entire class know he peed himself, and we went to her office and called my mom to come and pick me up. After this, I had to sit in the principles office (we were in a portapack so there were no waiting areas, just an office) to wait for my mom. Now, the office was extremely small, and my piss stained pants were starting to stink up the place so the principle gave me a bottle of her perfume and told me to spray it on myself to cover up some of the odour. At this point my sadness has made it's way to rage(due to the lack of care age was showing) and since I was a child I sarcastically remarked \"do you need anything else, *ma'am*?\" In a really disrespectful and rage filled tone. Upon hearing this, she gets kinda of mad and says the whole \"what did you just say to me young man?\" And I repeated what I said before with an even increased amount of disrespect and a bigger emphasis on the word ma'am to attempt to assert myself and she looks at me, clearly angry and goes \"I need about tree fitty.\" And it was around this time I realized my principle was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "This story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago.\n\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\n\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty. Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\n\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\n\ntl;dr: Haha.. Bangkok.. what a funny name.\n\nEDIT: Thank you kind strangers for the gold! However, I feel as though credit should be given where it's due.

Now, are you looking for a single kick tailed, double kick tailed board, or one without any kicks? As a board without any kick tails, or very small ones, I would suggest the [Rayne Rival](http://www.momentumskate.com.au/home/catalog/product/view/id/2013/s/rayne-rival/category/211/) or [Supreme](http://www.momentumskate.com.au/home/catalog/product/view/id/2012/s/rayne-supreme-bundle/category/211/) (depending on your height), as I'm really happy with mine, and nothing I've tried yet has come close.

{"body": "I spent a year of my life working as a pizza delivery guy for a small, hometown pizza place. My employer, and the owner of the restaurant, was an angry Egyptian dude who generally treated any and all of his employees (for the most part this was myself, a 19 year old college kid too naive to know any better, and another Egyptian fellow who spoke no english whatsoever but was very nice) like the scum of the earth.  This treatment regularly extended to making us work way later than operating hours, on odd nights, even if when there weren't any customers. Because, you know, there just might be a chance...right?\n\n\nWell, one night, around midnight, we actually did get an order. It was for a motel two or three towns away. As the only delivery person he had for the entire year I worked there, I was obviously on duty. They order an extra large cheese with sausage, it's cooked up, and I hit the road. It takes me about an hour and a half to find the place, but that's quite alright because, despite it being the middle of the summer, I had all the windows up and the heat blasting in my car. I needed those tips, you see.\n\nSo I arrive at the motel, my uniform, a white button-up, drenched in sweat, my hair plastered like I had just gotten out of a pool, and head into the main office in the vain hope that I could just drop the pizza off there and be done with it. No such luck. The fellow behind the bulletproof glass was very pleasant, however, and directed me to the exact room so that I needn't wander.\n\nSo I head on over there, I knock on the door, and I wait. There's some scuffling behind the door, the sound of both locks being opened, which I'm sure I could only hear because of how rusty they were, and very, very slowly, the door opens.\n\nMaybe it was a trick of the moonlight. Maybe I was delirious from dehydration. Maybe, though, and I prefer to think this, my eyes were not deceiving me. The door was answered by the most attractive woman, in my opinion, that I had ever seen. She was a goddess. Raven hair, skin as pale as moonlight, I could go on. And she's wearing nothing more than a bath towel.  Except she clearly had not gotten out of a shower any time recently.\n\nAll of the lights in this motel room are off, and very quietly, she asks me if the sausage is hot and fresh. I nod, and fairly numbly, I might add. Up until that point, I'd never really had a sexual experience before, and so this was fairly wild. She asks me to come in, and very cautiously, I do.\n\nIt's at this point that shit starts to get weird. It's dark in there, but the first thing I notice is that, situated at the foot of the bed, is a tripod with a camera. Said camera was emitting a faint green glow, which I can only take to mean that it was on.\n\nAs my eyes started to adjust to this, she closes the door and asks me how much the delivery was. I fumble for a moment before removing the slip from my pocket, and as I'm holding it up to squint at the writing in what little moonlight passes through the window, I notice a rather burly fellow in the corner of the room. He doesn't even have a towel. As near as I can tell, he's just naked. Luckily, it was very dark in that corner.\n\nI stammer out the price (21.85. Extra large with one topping. Now, I can remember it exactly.), and she quietly brushes past me to take a seat on the edge of the bed. Contemplating the price, apparently, she crosses her legs, which brings up the hem of her towel ever so slightly.\n\n\"Twenty-one eighty-five? I don't think I have enough for that,\" she tells me, with a pout in her voice, and I can remember her words clear as day. She looks at me rather expectantly, and as can be expected I freeze like a deer caught in the headlights.\n\nIt turns out, luckily, she wasn't talking to me, but that fellow behind me. He asks how much she needs, and she pauses a moment to contemplate things. Now, I should mention that all through this time my eyes had begun to adjust to the darkness of the room, and I was finally beginning to see with a bit more clarity. It turns out she wasn't as attractive as I thought. In fact, it was around this time that I realized she was an eight stories tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. As I dropped that steaming sausage pizza and booked it out of there, all I could hear was her answer: \"Oh, about tree fiddy.\"\n\nI made some really bad decisions that night, but that's ok because it turned out to be a pretty great story. Just wanted to share that after your idea struck me with it. Obviously it's not quite the same- They were expecting me, so there wasn't a hell of a lot of confusion.\n\n**TL;DR** Delivered to a porn shoot. Turned out to be way more awkward than you'd expect.

{"body": "I don't care really at all. For a few reasons:\n\n**1)** I don't really see porn stars as people in the sexual sense. They have made their living turning themselves into sexual objects and thus removing all the human factor from themselves (at least while they're on film). They literally turn themselves, on film, into an object made just purely for sex. They essentially just become living sex toys. I see my boyfriend getting off to porn the same way I imagine he might see me getting off with a sex toy: it's just a tool used for getting off and another person was never really involved emotionally or physically. It is also because of this that a guy can watch porn but still be fantasizing about his significant other.\n\n**2)** I can not possibly be into everything he is into just like he can't be into everything that I'm into. I also can't be \"go time\" every time he's \"go time\" just like he can't be. This means, if I don't want to do something in bed, he can either fantasize about it through porn or go out and find someone else (this is not to say that he can't just \"deal\" but I'm simply talking for a picture perfect sex life where everyone is hopefully happy). In this case, once again porn and the women in them have pretty much again become an unhuman tool to fit a need. And in this instance, the guy would not be fantasizing about the woman in the porn so much as the act that she is willing to perform that I may not be.\n\n**3)** Porn is not real life. It is like an over exaggerated caricature of real life that is taken to extremes that is almost made abstract. Sex doesn't happen like that. Life doesn't happen like that. It is made like that specifically for masturbation and this once again brings it back to taking the human aspect out of it. Real people aren't like that. No one could fantasize about actually dating a girl like those characters because they don't exist, removing the threat. Masturbating to a porn flick is just as threatening to me as masturbating to a character in a Hollywood movie, I'm not threatened because I know that doesn't exist. \n\nWhich brings me to the final point of:\n\n**4)** These women are NOT the roles they play. The woman that your boyfriend would be getting off to on porn is no more real than Harry Potter or the Loch Ness Monster. In real life many of them have boyfriends, husbands, partners of their own and I'm pretty sure they probably pay for their pizzas the normal way like the rest of us instead of with blowjobs. I'm not threatened because there isn't any real person to get threatened by. You can't see the women in the porn as women because in the films they are not. They are roles.\n\nInstead of getting insecure, offer to watch it with him. See what he's into, use it as a sort of foreplay. Porn doesn't have to be just a masturbation tool, it can also be turned into a tool for your sexlife which may take some of the \"evil\" out of it. As long as it never detracts from your sex life, and interaction never becomes a factor in it (such as cam-shows or picture swapping), then unless you let it, it can't really harm your relationship. This is not to say that porn is best and great for every relationship but it isn't necessarily a relationship killer either.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386679626", "subreddit": "relationships", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster in Scotland, most Scots don't honestly believe it exists but as long as tourists come and take pictures, have a good time and buy souvenirs everybody is happy. That Elf School you talk about is more of a tourist trap if anything, I'm not gonna bash it since it's cool that tourists can learn about Icelandic folklore as it can be very fascinating, but it's not based in actual academia. There have been some cases of roads swaying around rocks where reportedly elves live, but that's more about preserving Icelandic literary tradition than actually worrying about the well-being of said mythical beings. Iceland doesn't really have many historical sites because natural phenomena like earthquakes and volcanoes have consistently destroyed them (plus, not many events of historical importance have happened in Iceland, honestly) and until the 20th century people lived in houses [like this](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4055/4413007251_fd6f380e13.jpg), not built to last for hundreds of years obviously. So the \"historical\" sites of Iceland are usually rooted in the [sagas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_saga) or folklore. So if a certain cliff is mentioned in a folk story that is supposed be a troll that turned to stone (they turn to stone when exposed to sunlight), people want to preserve that cliff and visit it and go \"hey, there's the troll\" but don't actually believe that it was literally a troll once. Same goes with rocks supposedly inhabited by elves. It's just nice to keep them around if possible.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that NO ONE believes in elves. There are kooky people everywhere in the world that believe in ghosts, myths and new age mumbo jumbo but a belief in elves does not play a role in daily life in Iceland and is really much more noticeable for tourists than the locals. I've always found it interesting how the myth of the elves, has lived on until the present day when there are so many other creatures from Icelandic folklore that don't get talked about much. Like the [skoffín](http://icelanddefrosted.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130413-154955.jpg), [urðarköttur](http://urdarkottur.blog.is/tn/300/users/8e/urdarkottur//img/urdarkottur_585330.jpg) or the ever sneaky [marbendill](http://www.skakkapopp.is/folders/Thrandur/thrandur_laugavegi/marbendill.jpg), you don't want him to get you while rowing your boat. Maybe it's because the elves are beautiful and pure while most of the other mythical beings are creepy as fuck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386705905", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

So, reluctantly, Keiran drives the few hours out to the farm, and looks around for the fucking guy with the fucking clipboard. \n\nAnd guess what? Again, he runs in on this farmhand, only this time it's a goat balls deep in him! Keiran's, understandably, all like \"oh come on dude\" and the farmhand's all \"oh shit not again\", but Keiran's over the shock of it now, and he gets interested, so he asks the farmhand \"so uh, what's it like?\" the farmhand replies \"oh wow dude, it's like the most intense sex ever, especially when it's them doing you, I keep loads of goats here, fuck some and just milk the others, goat milk is awesome\"\n\nNow Keiran's not really down with the whole \"fucking quadrupeds\" scene, but he knows Pam and Derek are really in to it, so he calls Pam and says \"Hey Pam, how do you feel about goats?\", she replies in the affirmative, saying that she's often fantasised about farm animal orgies, but it's just too hard to get them in a town without people asking questions. Keiran turns back to the farmhand and asks \"Okay, so this might be a weird question, but do you, you know, pimp them out?\" \n\nThe farmhand replies \"sure dude! how many do you want? I'll even drop them off, nice and discreetly\". \nKeiran asks for four, just in case, which is totally cool with the farmhand, and asks for a price. The farmhand looks at Keiran and says \"I need about tree fiddy\" Now it was around this time that Keiran realised this farmhand was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "I'm bored with the sex, but there's a reason for it and it's completely my fault. \n\n\nWe always tried everything; it was never a question as to what the boundaries were. Anything we wanted to try, we did it. Hot wax, bondage, strap-ons, threesomes, foursomes, really, anything goes kind of stuff here. She really fed my adventurous side. She was wild - I am guessing that some of it came from some kind of experience that she had as a kid, but we didn't get into that.\n\n\nAbout six months into the relationship, she wanted to make sure that I wasn't sleeping with anyone else. At this point, that was fine. I could still sleep with other girls as long as she was there. She would let me bring other girls home and watch from another room on a video camera. I know that is pretty much illegal as fuck, but we never recorded anything and figured there was no harm done there. So seriously, I really had nothing to worry about as far as variety. \n\n\nSo that was my thing, I liked the idea of having one girl that I was with all the time and could come home to but wanted something on the side every once and a while to spice it up. I just knew I got bored quickly. I was fine with being \"monogamous.\" I let her have all the passwords to my email and facebook so she could see everything I was doing, that was a bit psycho but I mean, what was I gonna say, it came with the territory. She just wanted to know I wasn't going to fall in love with anyone. I got it.\n\n\nSo about two years into the relationship, I started having a hard time getting off when it was just her and I. We would go for half an hour sometimes and I would just get sore/tired and stop. I read all these stories of people on reddit having a tough time ejaculating too soon and I wish I had that problem (obviously I don't want that problem, it would just be nice for it to not be too much work). \n\n\nAnyway, we talked about it, and one time I told her that I had to fantasize about other girls to get off. That was the wrong thing to say, of course, and she got really angry. For that whole night she was crying and pleading with me to just stop doing that. She wanted me to have an orgasm on her terms with her and me being totally present and in the moment. She even asked me what it would take to get me off, and after all the adventurous stuff we had tried, I really had to rack my brain to think of something to try. There was really only one thing we hadn't tried yet, so I told her, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\n\n*TL,DR: Couldn't get off with my girlfriend, I thought it was because of my her, but then that I looked down at my scaly arms and realized that I was a 500 foot tall sea monster from the Paleolithic era.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386779994", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was gonna make a throwaway, but fuck it I teach at a university. Anyway, I teach an English class at a local state university. I teach mostly freshmen so every girl in the class is fairly young and attractive (not to say the older ones aren't). Anyway, last semester I had this student (with HUGE boobs) in one of my classes who I always caught staring at my junk. It was a class of about 40 people so it wasn't hard to catch her doing it; I would just pretend like I didn't notice. She didn't act or dress like she was, for lack of a better term, easy, but I always had my suspicions. Basically, the more I had her in class, the more I wanted to make her father ashamed of her.\n\nAnyway, one day after class, she came up to me to ask a question about a project I had assigned a couple days earlier. As I was reading over the assignment sheet and explaining, she would move closer and closer. It was crazy awkward, but equally arousing. She ended up close enough for her tits to swallow my arm. It was very, VERY hard to keep my composure. She then said thank you, brushed my arm with her hand and ~~walked~~ bounced away. \n\nTwo classes later was when it really went down. It was the day the projects were due (the class had the entire weekend to finish it and I had decided to push it back a day anyway). I told everyone at the beginning of class to just set them on the table by the door when they left. Of course, the little closet whore came up to me to drop her bad news. She had waited until everyone else had left to tell me she had forgotten to do her project and wondered if there was *anything* she could do to make up for it. As I began to say there was nothing I could do (staying as composed and professional as I could), she ran over to the door, shut and locked it, and ran back over to me. Then I knew for a fact it was doing down right there. She took my pants off and grabbed my junk. I lifted her shirt up and ripped it off her. She reached in my underwear and said \"there's something I need you to give me\". I said, as awkwardly seductive as I could \"what do you need babe?\" Then she said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" That's when I realized she wasn't a slutty freshman at all, but a 7 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era!! \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy you god damn Loch Ness monster! Now get out of my class!\" She slithered away and I never saw her again.\n\nTL;DR: Freshman eyeballs my junk for half a semester, doesn't turn in a project, then it goes down", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386826370", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 288, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm on mobile, so this will come out as a wall of text.  I'm apologizing in advance.  I'll tell you that the whole experience taught me a lot about the people I thought I knew best.  \n\n  A little over 10 years ago I got lucky and won a pretty fair amount of money.  After taxes and such, it came to about $75,000.   \n\n  Honestly, once I finally convinced myself that it was true, I realized that I didn't have the slightest clue as to what the fuck to do with it.  At the time, I was 23, working a pretty decent job and living with my girlfriend of 3 years in a tiny, one-bedroom house.  \n\n  I started off by doing what I thought was the responsible thing, I put the money in the bank, and tried to keep everything quiet.  There was a little blurb in the local paper about it, but most of the people I knew weren't the type to read the paper, so pretty much no one knew, except my girlfriend and my parents.  \n\n  It's not that I didn't want to throw a party or do something nice, but I was at a point in my life where all of my friends and most of my family were living paycheck to paycheck, and those were the successful ones.  I knew more than a few people in over their heads on a car or a house, or because of their kids or whatever.   What I wanted more than anything was just to have some time to figure out how to make the most out of the money and I didn't want it to become a big thing because I knew then everybody would have their hand out.  It makes me feel like shit to say it, but it's true.  \n\n  What I ended up doing was pretty boring.  I took my girlfriend on a little trip to Napa, since she was into that sort of thing and honestly, we had a great time.  I gave some of it to my parents, because it was the least I could do to repay them for all the things they did for me growing up.  I paid off our credit cards, paid off my car, and just sat on the rest.  For a while anyway.  \n\n  I don't know what started gnawing at her, but it took about a week before it was \"we should have a better this, we should have a better that, we should get a bigger place, we should get better cars.\" At first she tried to play it off as if she were joking, but the jokes were just a litlle too frequent, and insistent to just brush off.  And of course, this led to some fights.  \n\n  I want to point out that, at this point in my life I was happy, I didn't have a great job, I didn't have a great car, our little house wasn't that spectacular, but who cares?  I had a girl that I really was in love with, and I was happy there.  If you've heard the Barenaked Ladies song \"the old apartment\".  You'll kind of get the feel, we didn't have a lot, but life wasn't bad, you know?  I just wanted to enjoy this time of my life.  And now that we had this little bit of extra security, I was feeling pretty good.  \n\n  I can't really blame her for wanting more, neither of us had much money growing up, neither of us knew what to do with it, and I was a bit of a pushover.  Ok.  Even before the money, that girl pretty much walked all over me as I dumbly muttered \"yes dear\".   \n\n  It was about 4 months before she let it \"slip\" and all of a sudden things started to change.  I'd be out drinking with my friends, shooting the shit and whatnot and eventually somebody would make a comment about it like I was some kind of millionaire or something.  Like I was supposed to pick up every bar tab, or buy every goddamned round, even though for the most part, I did.  It also didn't help that my girlfriend was always inviting people out and expecting me to pay for it.   \n\n  There was a sense of pressure on me that, while not unbearable or anything, was starting to become annoying as fuck.  Some of the people I lent money to paid me back, some didn't.  A lot of times the ones that couldn't would avoid me or talk shit about me, even though I didn't really give a crap if or when they paid me back.  \n\n  Right about then, my parents happened to hit on some hard times when my dad had to go on strike.  Of course, even though I didn't have a problem helping out with their bills, it was all starting to wear a little thin.  \n\n  I loaned my sister enough to keep her lights on and keep the repo company from snagging the Jeep out of her driveway in the middle of the night after she quit her job.  Which, again, I didn't have a problem with, but it just seemed like everyday there was somebody asking for something and I was just expected to say yes and hand over a pile of cash.  \n\nIt got to the point where I wouldn't answer my phone phone when people called, and I started avoiding friends I'd had since 1st grade, or when I did answer, I'd just say \"hello, welfare office.\" A lot of people didn't like my attitude, they said that I changed, but I don't think so.  I was just so frustrated by the situation. \n\n  Then came the day I got a call that my grandma had a fall and was in the hospital.  I talked to the the doctors from the ER, and they said that she was going to most likely be alright, but she had broken her hip annd was going to need \"long term\" care.  I'm guessing this means \"nursing home\" but the doctor tells me that he'd rather talk to me about it in person.\n\n  So, I called off work, got on a plane and flew to Florida in the middle of the night, because I was the only one in my family who could really afford to do so.  \n\n\n  I was exhausted when I got to her hospital room, but she was doing ok.  I hugged her, told her everything was going to be alright, and let her fall back into her predominantly drug-induced sleep.  I sat down in the stupid little hospital chair when the nurse came in and told me her doctor would be in in a few minutes to talk to me about her \"long-term\" care.  \n\n  \n   So, there I sat, wondering what was going to happen, wondering how long it would last, wondering how much it all would cost, actually thinking I would be happy if I could get rid of the rest of that damn money and just be done with it.  \n\n  I must have nodded off in that chair, because I remember waking up to someone saying \"hello, I'm Dr. Monroe\".   I looked up to see him, and I'll be damned if he wasn't a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era who looked me dead in the eye and said \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy\".\n\n  \n\n  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386830169", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Once I was lucky enough to work with primates, specifically Gorillas and those orange orangutans. So to show us (I was a part of a small group, we all won this \"behind the scenes\" experience) the extent of their current intelligence, they had us do tests. Somewhat simple stuff, but stuff I had not seen monkeys do. \nFirst we started small. They coached us to hold pieces of fruit, and say a color. The monkeys would then hold up a block of that color. We then would hand them a piece of fruit. Kind of like edible monkey currency, lol. That was pretty cool, but I had heard they would show us them doing some sign language, which I thought was more impressive. \nThen they had us do a few more, and then came the signing. I have always been interested in animals learning to do this. It's like learning a second language, which I still have not mastered. \nThe leader would sign the gorilla, and detail the conversation as it went. It was pretty surreal, and the gorilla made my jaw drop at one point. \nThe leader asked the gorilla how it was feeling, what it's name was, what his name was, etc. I believe it was doing all the signs correctly, but I didn't have a guide with pics in front of me. The gorilla stopped signing responses and instead kept signing, \"Fruit\". The leader laughed, noting it had cooperated, and jokingly signed the gorilla, and the gorilla got super serious, locking eyes, and signed something almost urgently. The leader almost gasped, and I asked what he said. The leader had asked the gorilla how many pieces he wanted, and the gorilla replied, \"About tree fiddy\".\nGlancing back at the gorilla, I realized it was about 7 stories tall, and was a crustacean form the Paleozoic Era.

{"body": "This was the craziest thing to ever happen to me. \n\nI was driving to the local supermarket in the city where I live when I saw my friend (let's call him Rob) walking down the street. I honked my horn and he had a very distraught look on his face. As I drove past, I noticed the poor guy wasn't wearing any shoes. Weird I thought... I do a U-turn in the nearest driveway and a pull up next to him. I ask him, \"What's up, man? What the hell are you doing without shoes?\". He goes, \"You're never going to believe what happened to me. I'll give you gas money to take me home, but you have to hear this\". I told him that was fine, but I needed my damn milk so we had to stop there first. \n\nAnyway, he starts telling me this story about how he got locked out of his car at the bowling alley last night (he's always been a midnight bowler). Turns out, the dumbass left his wallet and phone in the car and the last guy had just locked up bowling alley, so he had to start his trek back to his house (a solid 15 miles away). So, he walked and he walked and he walked and his shoes starting getting really muddy, so decided to go barefoot. He said, and I quote: \"I ain't fucking up my new Nikes for this shit. I''ll callous the shit out of my foot. The Pilgrims never had shoes and they got along just fine\". Funny as it was, I had to tell him that the Pilgrims did in fact have shoes. He didn't take kindly to that. He says, \"Ya know man, if you're gonna be a dickface about it, I'll walk home again...\". I didn't want to start another argument with him, so I apologized and kept on with the drive. I did notice that he didn't have his shoes in his hands, so I asked him, \"What happened to your Nikes then?\". He instantly forgets that he was pissed a second ago and goes, \"Oh man... I was walking a little too close to the road and I accidentally dropped them on the side.\" He went quiet after saying this.\n\nA good five seconds go by without him saying anything. I turned my face to him and asked, \"And you didn't pick them up?\". His eyes started to glaze over and he just stared out the window with the most stoic expression I've ever seen. I repeated: \"Rob, did you pick the damn shoes up?\". He. Fucking. Lost. It. He started bawling his eyes out right there... We had just pulled into the supermarket at that point. I shut the car off and turned to face him. I said, \"Rob, what the fuck is the matter?\". He catches his breath and goes, \"Just give me a fucking minute man. Go get your shit and come back.\"\n\n I was wary to leave this guy in my car. I felt like I didn't know him anymore. I reluctantly go into the store and I get the fucking 2% Milk that I wanted this whole time... I saw this cute cashier at one of the two aisles open, so I run up quickly so I can get back to this grown man having a meltdown in my car. But it was weird. She rings me up and angrily demands that I pay. The price wasn't shown on the cash register though. So I said, \"How much do I owe you?\" And she goes \"I need about tree fiddy\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386920429", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I got pregnant by one. I had a nasty argument with my then-husband at 3 in the morning. We've talked about having kids countless times, and what does he do? He gets a vasectomy. Without telling me, or asking me what I thought. We didn't have any kids yet, and his argument was that \"we can just adopt\". I was speechless. I took my jacket and the keys and left the house. I heard him yelling something but I was already out of the driveway by the time he could finish. I don't know what came over me, I must not have been thinking straight. I kept driving... and I finally arrived to the more crowded part of the city, I was in downtown. I kept driving, seeing less and less people. I slowed down as I progressed. I saw two women standing by a corner, one in a short tight red dress, and the other one in a very revealing black blouse. I saw more and more women, and to my left was a group of them talking to someone in a shady old car. I was trying to hear their conversation when all of a sudden I hear a \"Hey!\" and a knock from behind the passenger side window. I jump and turn to see a guy with his shirt off smiling. He motions for me to roll the window down, and as soon as I do, I realize how gorgeous this man is. \"Hey beautiful, you lookin' for a good time?\" I think about my husband then remember how angry I am with him for ruining any chances of us having kids. I smile, \"Yes\". It's why I came here. I look over, all he's wearing is underwear. I couldn't stop staring at it. I mean, it was pretty big. No, it was huge. As I reach over he stops me, telling me we can go inside. He lives just across the street. We walk in and it's a mess, but just in the other room there's a bed. I decide to sit. I look at him all over and to his eyes, and immediately fill with lust. He comes over and pulls down my skirt. He removes my underwear, and slowly starts to put it in. Just as the head is almost in, he comes closer to me, to the point where I can feel his breath and our foreheads touch. He tells me, \"Before we go through with this we need to discuss the price. I'm gon' need 'bout tree fiddy.\" And it was about that time I realized his giant dong was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "Okay so reading this has made me remember three dreams:\n\nThe first is a torture scene. I can't remember how or why, but I was strapped to a table in my school's courtyard, and one of my teachers had a needle and was carving stuff into my face. *Side note:*. I have severe issues with eyes, mainly things happening to eyes, and I think this may have been the first cause even though the main thing that caused it was in middle school... Back to the nightmare. So then they stuck a needle in my eye, and at that point I woke up. It seemed a lot longer than it seems.\n\n\n\nThe next is an idea from one of those transformation human into animal books (animorphisis?). I was with my class on a field trip, and we were in the middle of the ocean on/in this beautiful marble building. We all went out onto the balcony, and for some reason it didn't have a rail (such safety code violations), and of course, someone pushed me in. Little did I know, there were fucking sea monsters in the ocean. They all looked like the loch ness monster (roundish bodies, four flippers and a long tail and neck), and they started to try and eat me. I grabbed onto the neck of one of them, knowing it would protect me from the others because the others were trying to come after me, and it didn't want the others to get me or have its neck bitten off. Then I realized that I was drowning, and I started freaking out.\n\nYou know how in some video/computer games they show a view of what's happening in the entire game, with an overhead of the place you're in? Well that's what happened to me. Then, I heard my classmates telling me it's a dream, so I take a breath, and I could breathe! I started swimming upwards, and right before I got eaten by a monster, I woke up.\n\n\n\nThe last one I don't remember much of. There was a burglar in my house at night, and he had a bomb with him. He went downstairs, and planted the bomb downstairs. Then he slipped out through a window, and my dad went downstairs to see what was going on, and I tried to stop him and tell him there was a bomb but he wouldn't listen! My mom woke me up after that and I started freaking out and telling her a burglar put a bomb in the basement.

As Phil and Jane walked back to their door with smiles on their faces--Jane's arms wrapped around Phil's right arm and her head resting upon Phil's shoulder--they realized an odd sound was coming from the other side of their door. They both stopped in their tracks, their hearts anchored in their stomachs. Phil moved towards the door, taking leave of Jane's embrace. While never looking back, he signaled her to stay put. He reached the door and quietly retrieved his keys from his right pocket, grasping them tightly, as not to let them jingle. He was slow and patient in placing the key into the door, as if it was it was the door's first time having such an experience. As it clicked and he turned the key, he realized he had no idea what he was in for. He turned the knob, releasing the door from its dormancy, and slowly pushed it in, as to prevent any creaking noises. He took two steps in, and his heart had set sail again. Phil laughed with tears, as his panic began to subside. There was his dog, Rupert, and a few shredded books on the floor. Jane entered to see what the fuss was about, and smiled as she saw the comical holiday scene. She closed the door behind her and headed upstairs to see if Rupert had gotten into the toilet paper, as well. As Phil began to clean up Rupert's mess, he heard Jane from upstairs. \"Honey, can you bring a garbage bag and the vacuum up here? It looks like Rupert made a mess!\" Phil went over to the kitchen pantry and grabbed a garbage bag and headed upstairs into the bathroom where Jane was. There was toilet paper scattered all over the ground into amazingly tiny bits and pieces. \"Rupert must have really taken his time here,\" he said in surprise. He handed her the garbage bag, instantly remembering that he was to also bring up the vacuum. Jane took the bag and raised an eyebrow--\"You know this isn't the only thing I need, right?\" Phil sighed, and started to walk out of the bathroom door. \"Wait!\" Jane said quickly. \"There's something else that I need.\" Phil turned around--\"What do you need, babe?\" Jane smiled her pretty pink lips and let out a small giggle. \"TREE FIDDY,\" she said. And at that moment, Phil realized that his wife was actually........................a Redditor. \"I'll get the vacuum,\" Phil said as he rolled his eyes and went back downstairs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387147745", "subreddit": "pics", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

She makes me go after my little brother (whom I am now going to murder) and I find out they let the air out of my bike tires.

I remember this one time, we were chillin' and he says \"Lets go pick on this black guy I met back on my trip to Europe.\"  He also mentioned that the guy lived here in the states near us.  I thought that was just something those 2 did together.  He gets on this stupid looking and obviously fake girl scouts outfit.  Doesn't even fit this guy.  We go to the black guys house and I knock on the door and then hide.  He had an odd condition with his hands too that made them rounder.  He has some messed up problems.  Anyways, this black guy opens the door and they chat it up.  The black guy actually believes this shit.  Then my friend after \"making the deal\" for cookies asks for 3 dollars and 50 cents.  This black guy just starts freaking out yells for my friend to get the Hell off his porch and yelling for him to never come back.  He called him a big green monster which was really messed up for him to do.  He also said \"Loch Ness Monster.\"  That was kind of funny.  At that moment I knew we had to go.

{"body": "lol..\n\nBut seriously a few months ago I felt the exact same way (5mo. ago I had a 2-3gram day habit and have been using opiates since 13 which makes 11 years now, IV H for the last 7)     Just to get an idea of my situation...I found myself thinking this very thing almost daily.   I had gone cold turkey multiple times but could never get more than a month or two clean before I dive back in head first.   What I did was get myself into the mindset of I am quitting for good, I finally decided that I was going to go to rehab while still on my mothers health insurance for the next 9months, shes got the best insurance Ive seen anywhere and she pays for max benefits even though she cannot really afford to, shes a nut about health issues although everyone in my family is fairly healthy, 2 brothers and myself addicted to opiates and everyone smokes weed although we all believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.(weed).\n\nAnd im sorry for anyone not lucky enough to have health insurance like this, growing up we had nothing, this is just something that my mother made sure we had and was made possible by her being the most hardworking person ive ever met, doing it all for her children...  Anyways, sorry for the rant.... but I made a phonecall after 2 days coming off of my 2-3gram a day habit... these 48 hours were horrendous... I was selling at the time and was WDing in bed with over a grand in reup money sitting under the pillow I was resting my head on....   The people I work(ed) for are very dangerous and Ive seen what my connect has done to people who came up $50 short...   So for the two days that he was out of town and I was left with my normal package, well it was way busier than normal so I sold out ahead of schedule and had no idea my guy was going to be away for the last day *which wasnt planned, he was only supposed to be gone for a day and had left me enough for the day I saw him leave and the following day.\n\n\nBack to the advice/story/rant/opi-induced-talkativity...I called a phone number that my brother had told me about when he went to rehab for the 4th time... our health insurance covered him $62,000 to spend 45 days at a place called Desert Hope in vegas....I guess he was constantly getting high over there and my mother was sending him money thinking that he was doing the right thing..... came back and looked better (was eating more food than we have at the house, and got a tan which we were all pale by the time he got home.)  So anyways I call this number and talk to a recovering addict who works for this company that basically middlemans addicts looking to get into treatment and sends them to one of about 6 different rehabs across the country.   I talk for about an hour or so and they take my health ins. info and start calling the rehabs for an open bed.... finally they call back and say they can send me to the vegas rehab if I can pay $7,000 which was weird because they accepted my brother and covered everything (except for plane ride home... they cover the ride there.)\n\nI answer and told them if I had 7k laying around to do this I would not be calling you til I had about tree fiddy ($3.50, not 350... left in my pocket....) they say okay and see what they can do they call back in an hour and say good news... If i can pay 700 they will send me to san diego, again I told him.... I have 0 dollars in my account and absolutely no one to borrow money from...   calls back an hour later and says Great news... were going to send you to florida for free... what time can you get to the airport so we can book your ticket... So i tell them ASAP, I can be there in 2 hours... they say there are two flights... one at 5am that night or one at 8am .... 8am wouldve been better for my ride and everyone else, but that would mean once I got down there and settled in it would be past noon... and they wouldnt be able to script me suboxone til the following day.... that wont work... Ill be there for the 5am.\n\n\n\nthis got way out of hand and if anyone is still reading I will finish this quickly, LsWee_D if your still reading please consider this as it helped me tremendously ( I relapsed two days after getting home after a month in florida ... but tolerance is very low compared to when I went... made some great friends, and with the suboxen and muscle relaxers + sleep meds... I only kicked for the first 2.5days then was able to get a full nights sleep without having to change out my sweat soaked t-shirt 4 times in a night.   I was on a 4 day sub program... 8mg....4mg.....4mg....2mg....0 and the kick from the suboxone was nothing compared to the dope... \n\nAnyways, enjoyed a free month in a hotel on the beach down in florida, with a ton of cool people who were mainly there for dope... a bunch from my city (Boston...ton of dope/addicts up here.) and was given $60 a week for food... which bought more than I eat at home... gained 24lbs in 2weeks  46lbs from the day I went in there weighing 117lbs (male...5'9\" skinny athletic build)... caught a great tan and enjoyed pretty much the whole time save for the 5-6 hours of group everyday... half were awesome and the other half were very redundant and the same questions asked over and over when someone new came in... basically got no where in a bunch of them.... \n\n\n\nTL:DR \n\nchecked into rehab with every intention of quitting for good, made the month there... relapsed within 2 days of getting home....  I chip pretty heavily but I work and get paid bi-weekly so I use for 5-6days on pay week... and not until the following payday... so about 6days on, 8 days off give or take a day.. \n\nTolerance is low enough where I can afford it, no longer get woken up by the feeling of death either puking and shitting at the same time while trying to prep my morning shot in the bathroom...   \n\nOverall, good experience...beach everyday, hot women, amazing cars everywhere, movies every weekend...  Top notch...\n\nAnd this wasnt some passages shit (although the 35k my health insurance said they were covering sure made it seem like it would be,  (having Dr's on hand 24-7 along with therapists for 5-6 hours every weekday adds up very quickly... along with food money, and all the activities that we did.\n\nFor those that do not have health insurance, keep in mind there were about 4-5 people there that did not have insurance but were state scholarshipped to be there... So not all hope is lost...Look into it.... the place I was at is called Singer Island and its through American Addiction Centers....Keep an open mind and if your not ready to quit consider it a month-45 day-w.e tolerance break/vacation that your sick for the first 4 days... if that helps.... Sucked at first but worth it now, 4 months later I still keep my use under control... work full time instead of dealing (hardest part is realizing how much money I was making in about a 1/20th of the time. \n\n\nTL:DR the TL:DR; Try rehab out for a tolerance break if youve got insurance that will cover it... or check if your state will scholarship people to rehabs... most do I believe. (Massachusetts i know for sure... )  Good luck and just remember this feeling is temporary and although its terrible and feels like it will never give up, if you stay in the right mindset youll be in the clear in no time..  watch out for PAWS(Post Acute Withdrawl Symptoms a month or two into abstinence... it takes awhile for your brain to reset its dopamine/serotonin reward system... I believe the formula I was told was that for every year you were using it takes about a month for the brain to reset... and the first year is about 3months....\n\nSo if i have been using for 11 years, it should take \n\n3months (year 1)\n+1          (year 2)\n+1          (year 3)\n+1          (year 4)\n\n      etc \n\n      etc\n\n+1         (year 11)\n\nWhich leaves me with about 13 months for my brain to reset itself where I actually feel happy about small things that normal people would find enjoyment in.\n\n\nSo stick in it for the long haul if you want that back, I couldnt stay away so now I try to chip, but its a losing battle... you'll still build a tolerance and once I get going hard enough... its not the dopesickness that keeps me going.... its the fear of dopesickness that does.... so I do whatever I can to make money before that kicks in because once it does.... theres not much I can do from the bathroom floor. \n\n\nThanks for anyone who read this.... Sorry for hijacking, this is just some advice that worked for me.... always said fuck rehab I dont want to be on a list somewhere if I really needed painkillers.... every professional I had asked said that was false, It does show on my med. record, but if I was injured hard enough... they would give me opiates... Just makes it a little harder for me to try and scam them into a script.... which isnt my thing anyways, I prefer dope.

{"body": "Well first off let me just start by saying I'm really not trying to piss in your cornflakes here just to be a snarky troll.  I just genuinely think this article is fairly weak, but as you seem to be interested in improving I'll be as detailed as you would like.\n\nFirst the Top Unsolved Mysteries angle should be qualified.  Whose top 10?  How was this list compiled?  How did you decide to include Atlantis and not Bigfoot?  The Los Lunas decalogue stone but not the Antikythera Mechanism?  King Arthur but not Jesus Christ?  Or Odysseus?  Or the Jersey Devil?  A brief explanation, or even a caveat that this is just a list of things you think are mysterious would help alleviate the almost immediate aggravation of reading yet another \"Top Ten\" list.  \n\nSecondly.  You begin with a warning that (this list is extremely creepy)  No.  No it's not.  Please feel free to write something creepy, and show don't tell us that these \"mysterious\" people, places and things are creepy, but don't just state that these included examples are creepy with such benign and questionable inclusions as \"King Arthur\".  It comes across as silly and lacks professionalism.  \n\nNext.  Atlantis is not a mystery.  No respected archaeologist truly believes that the place Plato wrote about actually existed.  You don't even need to read any peer reviewed journals to figure this one out, even a quick glance of the Wikipedia page is fairly dismissive of the supposed reality of this place.  Also, if you want to be original then at least mix it up a bit and include some lesser known \"lost lands\" like Lemuria or Lyonesse.  \n\nThe \"Lost Colony\" is certainly a famous mystery but it is hardly the most mysterious of it's kind.  We may never know precisely how or why the people of the Roanoke colony disappeared, but at the end of the day there's very little mystery about a group of unlucky but woefully unprepared would-be colonists either dying off or being absorbed into local native tribes and leaving little evidence.  This is especially thrown into sharp relief when you realize that entire civilizations have \"disappeared\" (real ones not Atlantis) leaving little evidence of their cause.  The Maya, the Khmer empire, even something obvious like the indigenous people of Rapa Nui all would have been I think better representations of the \"mysterious disappearing people\" category you were going for here, and any of them, and many more would be considered greater mysteries.  \n\nI could go on but I think you get the idea.  There are certainly great mysteries out there, some so profound that their omission is less mysterious than a condition of their tremendous scope.  Are we alone in the universe?  Just what the heck is gravity, and why is it so weak?  How does abiogenesis work?  Is consciousness really just an illusion? These questions are staggering in their enormity, and even if we can solve these mysteries they will inevitably lead to more questions, more unknowns.  Now that is genuinely creepy.   \n\nIf I click on something that says it is a list of the greatest mysteries of all time and includes King Arthur, the Loch Ness Monster or something as trivial as that I can dismiss it as fluff.  If you're going to write fluff then at least make it more entertaining; like something you would read on Cracked or even Buzzfeed or something, but don't try to take this sort of thing seriously and don't expect readers to take things seriously when it looks as if you've culled the list from other lists rather than taken a few extra minutes to really think about the nature of the universe and the questions that haunt our shared existence.  Either that or include pictures of half-naked women.  Otherwise you'll never compete with all of the other internet top ten list white-noise.

Talked about this mother who came to talk to him about how disrespectfully her son was acting. He would leave shit all over, wouldn't clean anything, would yell and scream all the time. The minister said, the bible teaches us to be loving of our children, unconditionally, tat kind of stuff. To be stern, but loving with her son. \n\nWell one day the mom came home from work at the hospital, she's a nurse, about 830 at night. The son had basically eatin a bag of chips for dinner, which was bad enough, but he left crumbs and shit everywhere. He was an hour and a half past his curfew AND didn't do his homework. She keeps remembering to be loving and when her son does get home, that no matter what, she loves her son. Well it gets to be about 10 and she hear the door knob turning, she's ready to explode.

{"body": "Tradition dictates that the man is responsible for the proposal-- that's just how it has been. Tradition also dictates the ring is the token by which it is made. Disney, Jared, Kay, etc. are in large part responsible for the idea of cost being introduced and reinforcing it as part of the romantic ideal. I think it places a lot of pressure on the man (but so does the woman taking his name, IMO, because now a days there are all sorts of social pressures if your wife does / doesn't / questions from people)\n\nWhat I think is unfortunate is that the woman in this situation is holding the man responsible for meeting her own romantic ideal. We don't know how much she has / hasn't told him about her hopes for a proposal. \n\nEither side needs to be realistic -- men can't read minds, and I don't think it was the $9 ring that was upsetting in this situation. It was the fact her expectations were not met to such a depressing degree. If the relationship is worth it, however, it should be a negotiable point -- she'd give the guy a Mulligan and have him try again.\n\nNow I don't know either party so there are a lot of unknowns here (social awkwardness of the male in this story, the relationship and any other problems it may have, the maturity level of both parties, etc)... but I know that the ring I proposed with only cost twice what this guy spent on the ring. If I had found the same ring for $9 at Wal-Mart... I would've used that.\n\nWhile the man isn't psychic, there is a certain amount of thought  that should go into things. Example: You don't stop by Walgreens and buy your best friend a $20 gift card to Walgreens for Christmas. You think about the relationship you have, and maybe you buy a beer helmet, a painting of the Loch Ness Monster, etc etc ... something that has more meaning than just a $20 obligation-purchase value that they aren't likely to use.\n\nIt wasn't the $9 ring, it was how it was handled. Even not knowing the romantic ideal the woman held towards proposals... I wouldn't have pointed at the bag or proposed as he did after being asked what was for dinner. \n\nSo what I'm saying is that it isn't misandryst to expect what should be an important event to be treated well. Nor is it misogynistic to expect that the man could be forgiven for having botched the proposal. If the relationship was worth it it would have worked out (or will work out if it is still going).\n\nSorry, this wound up being a lot more rambling than I intended but the TL;DR is -- the guy should've put more thought into a major life event; if the man is worth marrying the woman should be able to see past him screwing up.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387382946", "subreddit": "MensRights", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Plow story thread? Plow story thread.\n\nI live on a little side street over in Brighton, so I've developed a bit of a ritual for when it snows.  Specifically, my ritual is to make a big fuck-all pot of coffee, sit by the window, and wait for the plows like they're some kind of demented Santa Claus so I can Irish up whatever remains of my coffee and head out to start to get things cleared.  Again, I live on a one-way side-street so it can take a while.\n\nWell, last night I pretty much hit the jackpot when I saw that the snow had pretty much stopped by 9:00 and that the plows rolled through at around 10:00pm (very early all things considered).  So the ritual commenced - ridiculous looking hat, big red shovel, coffee, the whole nine yards.\n\nI try to do things properly. I take the snow and ice encasing my tiny Japanese vehicle and I move it into an unused parking spot that my street has spontaneously decided will be the site of this year's Everest. Sure it's a little more of a walk, but then I'm not the asshole burying the car in front/in back of him, and I could use the exercise you know?  It so happens that this year's Everest is off to an excellent start (probably about five or six feet tall) and is on the opposite side of my street, about two cars back from mine.\n\nWithin about an hour, I have the snow cleared off of the car itself, the street-side wheels clear, and am working on the sidewalk side.  I had less than 15 minutes worth of work to go, was on track to take a hot shower and be in bed by 11:30, so naturally I'm feeling like King Shit of Fuck Mountain.  That's about the time I saw what was coming.\n\nSome massive fuck-all bulldozer with the biggest fuck-you plow I've seen outside of highways in Canada came rumbling down our tiny one-way street.  Seriously, it just barely fits between the cars and of course that massive plow is situated to dump the bits of slush and asphalt it's scraping up on MY side of the street.  I remind myself that the road has been plowed already, and at most, this thing is going to give me 5 minutes more work, maybe 10.  Then, I see him start to veer.\n\nNow, maybe he saw my ridiculous looking hat and he was just respecting my space and trying to give me a wide berth.  Maybe he just dozed off at the wheel after what I'm sure must have been several hours of driving that damn bulldozer.  Maybe he was just an asshole.  I'll never know the reason why, but that son of a gun veered away from my side of the street...and towards Everest.\n\nEverest this year is not like the Everests of years past.  Sure it looks like it's made of fluffy white cotton candy on the outside, but at its core is a black heart of ice as hard as stone.  The sound of the plow hitting Everest rang out like the cry from some kind of yeti hellbeast and for a moment, I thought that the plow would stop, or be stuck, or break...but it kept going.  Moreover, it took a sizable chunk of Everest in all of its icy hate with it, and was pushing it my way.\n\nThe car behind me, my car, and the car in front of me were encased in a slurry of slush, ice, and bits of our tiny one-way street.  It took me another hour to undo the damage...and that's when it happened again...the same bulldozer, the same plow, back for seconds.\n\nBy this time it was a little past midnight and I'd had enough.  My street was VERY well plowed and another pass would have only resulted in turning our paved road into a gravel road.  I sprinted to the end of the street, and waved my shovel up at the plow to get the driver's attention.  Thankfully, the driver stopped.  Now, this bulldozer didn't have doors, so I walked around to the side of the machine and shouted \"What do you want from me?!\" up at the driver.\n\nThe driver looked down and responded \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was about that time that I noticed this burly plow driver was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.  So, I yell back \"Goddammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\" right as that sonofabitch swam away into the night.\n\nMoral of the story, Boston winters are hell and although I don't use them myself, I can see why some people use space savers.

{"body": "Sorry in advance for the super long post, everyone, but this is something I identify with greatly. \n\nPets, to my nmom, were things to own, not living and breathing creatures. She loved saying she had a cat, dog, etc. Especially if they were of a specific breed or pretty color. And to anyone that didn't know her, you'd think that she was genuinely distraught when one of them died. Hell, I thought she really cared about them, for the longest time. I was very, very mistaken. \n\n[Trigger Warning: Animal neglect and death]. \n\nMy mother never took our pets to the vet. Even for rabies vacs, which would her her ass in major trouble if someone found out. She uses the excuses that vets are too expensive and that all they want is to take your money. As a result, I had a LOT of pets die preventable deaths, pretty much my whole life. We had three, THREE dogs die from heartworms, which was preventable. \n\nMy first pet, a bird named Paulie, died of some unknown ailment. I found him having a seizure on the floor of his cage. My mother simply told me he was dying and that I had to deal with it. \n\nNext preventable pets death was Cocoa. She started vomiting, urinating blood, and having seizures one night, and she refused to take the dog to the vet. I was holding her while she died. I will never forget that, or how it felt.\n\nNext on the list was my loving, special kitty, Nessie. She had soft, luxurious black fur, and loved everyone. She started urinating blood one night, and just didn't stop. She died three days later, scared and in pain. \n\nJasper: died of a stroke three hours after the stroke started. \n\nMouse the rabbit: Died of heatstroke. Over a days period. \n\nPolar: had multiple tumors, most likely died eaten up with cancer. \n\nThere were also dozens of baby puppies, tiny kittens, ducks, rabbits, and chickens that died of neglect or minor ailments that could've been taken care of at the vets. \n\nThey currently have a donkey that I'm scared is going to drop dead any day. His feet are overgrown, he has abscesses in his ears, a hernia, a swollen scrotum and penile sheath, tooth abscesses, and who knows what else. It's pathetic. \n\nThey also NEVER spay or neuter any of the animals. They currently have 13 cats, three dogs, and two birds, INSIDE THEIR HOUSE. Its insane. I have TRIED to get my mother to take them to a low cost clinic to get them fixed: she says she doesn't want to make the drive. I tell her to give some away: she says that she'd be too worried about them going to a bad home. \n\nI finally put my foot down about the wrongful deaths with my horse, Steele. I've had him for 6 years, since he was 5 months old, and we've been through a series of minor ailments since then. Three years ago, he had a horse kick him in the face and leave a knot on the side of his nose. It wasn't an issue until it hurt too much for him to let me put his halter on. I went inside and told her that I was making an appointment for him at the vets tomorrow. My dad agreed and said we had the money right now and that if I felt it was needed then it should be done. My mother said no. I told her that I would go out and strip or prostitute myself until I had the money to take him. I fucking called her bluff. She was stunned. And she relented, but has NEVER let me forget that she took him to the vet ONCE IN SIX YEARS. \n\nI will never, ever forgive her for letting my pets, my babies, die such horrible deaths.

Everything was going great for the first 3 or 4 days.  Less so on the 5th.\n\nOn the morning of the sixth day, as Walter and Richard were cooking their campfire breakfast, Walter said, \"You know, it's been great getting back to nature. It's been great hanging out with you this week.  Fishing was great.  Hunting and trapping was pretty cool but, honestly, I don't ever want to skin and gut a chipmunk again in my life.\"\n\nRichard agreed except for the chipmunk.  That was a highlight.\n\nWalter continued, \"But, today, I mean, I don't want to say that I'm getting kind of sick of you but, that's sort of what's happening.  I think we ought to take a solo day.  You go that way, I'll go this way.  We'll have our own solo adventure and meet up back here at sunset.  Whoever gets back first stokes the campfire.  We'll drink the rest of the liquor and talk about our adventures.\"\n\nRichard agrees wholeheartedly and they finish their breakfasts, pack their daypacks and wave to each other as they went their separate ways.\n\nAs sunset arrives, Richard makes his way back to camp to find Walter building the fire. \"Hola, Walter!\"\n\n\"Hey, Richard!  I had a great day! How about yourself?\"\n\n\"Great day, Walter.  It really was.  You know that I went up the mountain but, you might be surprised at what I found.\"\n\nWalter and Richard sat on stumps beside the fire and started in on their remaining liquor.\n\nRichard told Walter about his day.  \"I was walking along that trail but, the trail kind of gave out.  I didn't want to get lost in the woods so, I started following that stream that we were fishing the other day.  About an hour into it, this *HUGE* clearing was visible through the trees.  It wasn't a field, though.  It was a massive lake.  I wish I'd thought to bring soap with me but, it didn't matter so much.  I stripped down and dove into the water.  I also wish that I'd tested the temperature before I dove in but, that's not important.  I washed my armpits and my balls and was just generally floating on my back making Lock Ness Monsters with my dick for about an hour.  That's when I noticed that the wildlife had pretty-much accepted me as their own.  The ducks and swans were just swimming past like I wasn't even there.  There was this moose, a buck deer, and a doe that were hanging out next to the where the stream starts.  I was within inches of them and they didn't even try to run.  I guess ol' Nessie isn't all that scary when he's swimming around in ice cold lake-water.\n\nHow about you, Walt?\"\n\n\"Well, \" Walter said, \"like you, I didn't want to get lost.  So, when I went down the mountain trail, I found those railroad tracks we crossed on the way up here.  I figured that I'd just walk along those and see what happened.\n\nI'd been walking for about two hours when I thought I saw something on the tracks a few hundred yards away.  But, then something really scary happened.\n\nI felt the train tracks shaking.  I froze.  Sure enough, I heard a train. I couldn't see it, yet but, there was definitely a train coming down those tracks.  I started running toward the thing on the tracks and I realize that it's a woman who is tied there.  The train is getting louder and now, I can see it coming for us.  I struggled with the knots and just at the last second, we go tumbling off the sides of the tracks just as the train goes past.  I don't think he even noticed.\"\n\n\"Wow!  You're a hero, Walter!\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, and I got repaid for it a half a dozen times.  We started having sex on the side of the tracks before the train had even finished passing.  We had sex on the other side of the tracks because there were fewer rocks over there.  We had sex doggy style, I fucked her tits, I fucked her in the ass.  It was, I have to say, an awesome day.\"\n\n\"Jesus fucking Christ, Walter!  I'm up there freezing my balls off in a lake with Bambi and Thumper and you're off on the railroad tracks getting your balls off thumping on Bambi.  What the fuck, man?  Is she still there?

{"body": "**TL;DR: The internet is a very scary place for young girls and you should be insanely careful about what you post on reddit and anywhere else.**\n\nI have never posted nude pics online but I have an incredibly disturbing story to tell about a girl who posted to /r/gonewild that I recognized. I know that the OP here is asking for funny ways of telling people that they were recognized but I have been thinking hard lately about whether or not I ever want to share this story with reddit and this seems like a pretty good thread to share it in. For all of you /r/gonewild girls out there and those of you who have thought about posting nude photos of yourself, let this serve as a cautionary tale...\n\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\n\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\n\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was. \n\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to /r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was *insanely* open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about. \n\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her /r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\" \n\nNot only did I walk away without any extortion money, I didn't get any new nudes from her which is what I was holding out for more than anything else. The only good thing about the failed sextortion deal is that she never contacted the FBI which works out perfectly for me because if she did, I wouldn't have been able to share this cautionary tale with all of you wannable /r/gonewild gals out there. I was seriously bummed about not getting any more exclusive jerk-off material from this bodacious babe but c'est la vie no smoking hot gonewild noodz 4 me :( Just remember this, girls: If you're gonna get your tits out for the lads, don't show your face. \n\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1387426278", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1791, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have a story about a situation like this. My friend Jared back in the early 2000s was fresh home from college for the summer, where he had torrented an absolute crapton of content with no consequence. He came home, and spent the first half of the summer just downloading every movie and tv show he could find so he could go back to college \"fully loaded\" with content. We would hang out when we could but between work and his torrenting addiction, I didn't see him much. \n\nIt was the tv shows that eventually got him. Stupid shows like Friends and Seinfeld. First one warning, then another. Finally the ISP (this was in PA) called his mother and stated they were turning off her internet connection permanently, and she would also be receiving letters in the mail from various studios demanding compensation or legal recourse. They did turn it off in short order, and they wound up getting a new ISP for the house which was much lower quality. Jared passed it off to her as basically he had no idea what they were talking about, and she bought it because she also had no clue about anything relating to the internet. \n\nWe went back to college (or so I thought), weeks passed and I kept asking Jared on AIM if he had gotten the letters or fines yet. He seemed to be avoiding the questions and just said he wanted to meet up during thanksgiving break.\n\nBreak time came. I traveled home and spent the evening talking with my parents. I noticed my cell phone kept ringing/buzzing but I sort of ignored it since I hadn't seen my parents in so long. Eventually I picked it up and found a message from Jared. He sounded frantic. He wanted to meet that night if possible, and that he was in trouble. I called him back and suggested we to to the Chinese buffet we always liked for late night snacks. He agreed. \n\nWell I showed up at the buffet and found that, not only had he not gone back to college for the fall, but he had moved out of his parents house and picked up a few odd jobs to try and pay back the fines, which DID show up, much to his moms outrage. He looked terrible. He said that they totaled about $4500 and he had paid most of them back. Finally he came right out and said it. \n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this time that I noticed my friend Jared was almost 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "It can be very uncomfortable. Not because I don't like seeing my old students, I do, but when I don't remember their names I can see the heartbreak in their eyes. They think that because I left such a deep impression upon them that they must have in turn done the same thing to me. Many of them do, but grasping their name is what really escapes me (I was never really good with names in the first place).\n\n\nThe worst though is when I don't recognize them whatsoever, either because they were sheepish in class or because they changed pretty drastically. One boy that I had tapped me on the shoulder at Kroger after eyeing me a few times and said hello. I was a bit taken aback because of how large he was, but he smiled really big and I had the familiar feeling that he had been one of my students. \n\nI'm pretty upfront and said immediately, sorry X, I don't quite remember you, can you help remind me? X had been a senior in my advanced composition class his senior year. He was, at the time, a little on the chubby side and had some skin problems. He was still big, but in a good way.\n\n\nI couldn't contain my shock when I put two and two together, he had definitely come into his own. He very humbly explained that he went through a full personality shift when he went to college. He shed some of that baby fat, made an effort to be more outgoing and just generally became a well-rounded person. He said seeing all the girls he had crushes on slip through his fingers drove him crazy. He knew the only reason he got rejected so much was because of his outward appearance. He wasn't a bad looking kid in HS, but he was definitely a looker when I saw him again. It was actually adorable because he said he always had a little thing for me even though I was so much older. I found that really flattering, especially because my own romantic life had been a little lackluster in the last few years. \n\nI gave him my email and said goodbye, really hoping he would stay in touch and let me know how he was doing. He had just finished school with an engineering degree and was about to start a job (this was his first summer out of the university so he was bumming around for a few weeks). \n\nAs he walked away though I was struck with this odd curiosity. I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around flush as a tomato. He stammered a little bit, which reminded me of the old X, still adorable. 'Can I ask you for something?' He agreed as soon as the words came out of my mouth. 'I need about tree fiddy.' It was about that time that he noticed I wasn't his old teacher, but a eight story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. No idea who this X was but I got him again. \n\nWe sat down for coffee and he told me about everything that had been going on with his family and he agreed that he would call me in a few days.\n\ntl;dnr chance encounter at kroger leads to coffee and a (non-date) date.

The fight ensues as Jay drops the camera; screaming, pain, snaps and cracks are heard and gunshots resonate from Alex's lone pistol. Now silence, a few seconds pass and nothing. About a minute goes by and a slight sobbing is heard, one of loss, pain, and failure. \n\nSome thing stumbles over and picks up the camera.  It brushes off the lens and begins showing the carnage. Jessica is slumped over in the corner, blood draining from her head flowing down her body and into the cauldron of the small burgundy waterfall. The camera pans left to Jay and Alex side by side laying face down on the ground, they're clothes in hair soaked through with the blood in which they lie. Two gleaming bullet holes in the back of they're head remind you of an execution, although you know it cannot be because this was a fight, not a massacre. \n\nThe camera continues panning, and it shows Tim, the one who is sobbing. His wales seem other worldly as mourns those souls lost. The thing holding the camera slowly walks over to him and grabs Tim's jaw with a black glove, forcing him to look into the camera. See the camera man lean over to Tim's ear. We see the iconic orange hood and the black mask. Hoody. Hoody leans over and we hear him whisper in a thick german accent, \"What do you think of your friend's now?\" Tim's cries become heavier and more violent but Hoody won't let him look away from the camera. \"Answer me!\" Hoody yells.\n\n\"I think they're dead...\" He cries, tears streaming down his face.\n\n\"And why are they dead!?\" Hoody yells again.\n\n\"Because I pulled them into it!\" Tim yells back, \"It's my fault! All my fault...\" Hoody releases his hand and Tim slumps over, his body seizes because he ran out of tears.\n\nHoody turns the camera around to show his mask. He then goes and pulls down his hood showing brown hair. His fingers go up under his mask and begins pulling it upwards, revealing that he is really Hitler! He cackles and yells \"I am the fuhrer! This is the final Reich!\" He turns the camera around and we see The Operator walk out of the darkness. \"How much do I owe you?\" Hitler says. The Operator reaches up to his faces and begins unzipping himself. But not himself, a costume.

They think that because I left such a deep impression upon them that they must have in turn done the same thing to me. Many of them do, but grasping their name is what really escapes me (I was never really good with names in the first place).\nThe worst though is when I don't recognize them whatsoever, either because they were sheepish in class or because they changed pretty drastically. One boy that I had tapped me on the shoulder at Kroger after eyeing me a few times and said hello. I was a bit taken aback because of how large he was, but he smiled really big and I had the familiar feeling that he had been one of my students.\nI'm pretty upfront and said immediately, sorry X, I don't quite remember you, can you help remind me? X had been a senior in my advanced composition class his senior year. He was, at the time, a little on the chubby side and had some skin problems. He was still big, but in a good way.\nI couldn't contain my shock when I put two and two together, he had definitely come into his own. He very humbly explained that he went through a full personality shift when he went to college. He shed some of that baby fat, made an effort to be more outgoing and just generally became a well-rounded person. He said seeing all the girls he had crushes on slip through his fingers drove him crazy. He knew the only reason he got rejected so much was because of his outward appearance. He wasn't a bad looking kid in HS, but he was definitely a looker when I saw him again. It was actually adorable because he said he always had a little thing for me even though I was so much older. I found that really flattering, especially because my own romantic life had been a little lackluster in the last few years.\nI gave him my email and said goodbye, really hoping he would stay in touch and let me know how he was doing. He had just finished school with an engineering degree and was about to start a job (this was his first summer out of the university so he was bumming around for a few weeks).\nAs he walked away though I was struck with this odd curiosity. I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around flush as a tomato. He stammered a little bit, which reminded me of the old X, still adorable. 'Can I ask you for something?' He agreed as soon as the words came out of my mouth. 'I need about tree fiddy.' It was about that time that he noticed I wasn't his old teacher, but a eight story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. No idea who this X was but I got him again.\nWe sat down for coffee and he told me about everything that had been going on with his family and he agreed that he would call me in a few days.\ntl;dnr chance encounter at kroger leads to coffee and a (non-date) date.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387460205", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Read [Save Our Bucks](http://www.saveourbucks.com).  \"Winning Takes Balls\" is about getting eyeballs to the message.**\n\nHere's the thing: the Bucks weren't *trying* to be bad.\n\nThe Bucks have won fifty games in a season only once in the last two decades plus. This places them better than only the Raptors and Bobcats, two teams who came into the league during that time frame.\n\nThis season was another in a long string of attempts by the owner to win the 8th seed championship, with subservient management unable to even voice alternatives, let alone opposition.\n\nThe Bucks play a brand of basketball two decades behind where the game is now: they have only shot 83 (!) corner threes, the fewest in the league, and 60 fewer than an average NBA team, even though they convert at the eighth-best rate in the league. Awful, long-twos make up a disproportionate amount of their shot attempts, and this is BY DESIGN.\n\nHey, they just started Giannis, you say... and he was only relegated the Tobias Harris role of 'watching a smaller, inferior player (Jennings, and now Knight) dribble around. All of the damage Giannis did last night was pushing rebounds he grabbed or improvising after sets broke down.\n\nThis isn't just about \"tanking\". The Bucks are GONE if a new arena deal isn't in place by 2017, and that only comes with a NEW ARENA, per Adam Silver. If you'd have gone to SaveOurBucks, you'd see that getting Wiggins or Exum or Embiid is only one part of bringing the casual fanbase back to the city -- like the Brewers did with Fielder and Weeks and, later, Braun.\n\nThis is about saving basketball in the city.

{"body": "Lets do this as a thought experiment then and describe what would need to change.\n\nAs /u/Phage0070 says there is no configuration that a circle could be around the globe that all parts would be an even 5 feet.  The globe isn't an exact sphere.  It stretches and is wide at the hips.  So to have a piece of material that is 5 feet off the ground everywhere would need to be shaped weird, although the overall trend would be a circle-ish, it wouldn't exactly be a circle.\n\nSo we have a non-circular shape around the globe an even 5 feet off the ground everywhere, but it wouldn't be for long.  At some places we would get waves of water that would hit it and push it around and pull it different ways, which would effect the whole thing and would cause this crushing everything that /u/MoreK is so fond of.\n\nSo lets say we got rid of the earth moving it in anyway; water, air, fire.. anything.  And while we're at it lets just scrap the earth all together and imagine a perfect smooth sphere about the size of the earth floating in space.  Not effected by anything.  It is just a ball in space.  It has no water or air so no currents.  It puts off no heat so it isn't going to make our material conduct heat and then expand.  It just is what it is, a sphere.  Now lets imagine a ring around.  A perfect ring for our perfect sphere.  5 feet off the surface at every point.\n\nAs long as no forces are exerted ANYWHERE it would remain floating at all points.  That is if it could support its self.  You see gravity is going to be pulling on it at every single spot.  So it's going to have pressure on it everywhere.  As long as the material is strong enough to withstand this pressure it would remain floating.  If not, it would collapse at it's weakest point first and then along each side and around the ring.\n\nBut this raises another question.  What if we could design a ring with no weakest point but is also not strong enough to withstand the pressure.  So Every single point.  Every single atom and bond between them is of equal strength.  Where would the first break be?  It would collapse of course because we designed it to not be strong enough to support the weight of it's self but if every spot is of equal strength.. would the whole thing just suddenly burst into dust the side of each atom? And then what.  I'll tell you what, because this experiment has already happened.  A mini-ring was built in place of a large scale one and small globe in place of a planet.  The experiment was placed inside of a hanger at one of the poles to avoid any disturbances from anything.  When the experiment was underway it was only then that the scientists realized that it wasn't an experiment at all but was really a 3 story tall monster from the Paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387498333", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

It was a really cold and windy sort of night, and I wanted to walk home as fast as I possibly could to get out of the chill and into my warm apartment.

It was not well lit at all.  I thought it would be fine though since I only had to cut through a short section of the park in order to get home.

One was female, and she sounded really scared.  \n\nThere were some trees between me and where the voices were coming from, so I could not see anything that was actually happening.  I just heard a sobbing voice say, \"I don't know what you want.  Please.  I don't know.  I don't know.\", then one of the most sinister voices I have ever heard say, \"I already tolja what I wanted.  Are you gonna MAKE me tell ya \nagain?\"\n\nI knew I had to do SOMETHING, so I peeked through the trees to assess the situation.  Then I saw it.

{"body": "Hope I'm not too late to the thread but I have a great story for this one.\n\nA couple years ago I was in college and in my philosophy class there was this smoking hot blonde Swedish girl with huge tits and a great ass and a perfect face. Just seeing her was enough to give me an instant halfie. \n\nAnyway, so after a few weeks I finally gathered her name when overhearing a conversation she was having with another girl about the way they named Swedes. I'm not going to disclose her name so lets just call her Heidi. I was able to find her on Facebook and I really struck the motherload here because she had a public account. All of her pictures, status updates, everything was available at my fingertips. It was heavenly. \n\nNow the creepiness could have ended there but I decided my balls were going to grow by three orders of magnitude the next philosophy class. Half of her status updates were about John Mayer and I was going to use her fandom to get into her pants. Or at least I would try. The next day in class I took the bold move of sitting down directly next to her and started a conversation with her. I had never even made eye contact with her prior to this and I could have taken the route that I'm a huge John Mayer fan but I had to come to terms with the fact that I'm a solid 6 on a good day and this girl was an easy 9. I told her my name was Mitch Mayer, knowing she'd jokingly ask if there was any relationship to John and sure enough, that's exactly what happened and I could have went with some distant relative but no I said he was my older brother. I went there. I created this whole concoction of a life about myself and what it was like growing up with John and what he was like in person. She was obviously REALLY interested at this point and I felt horrible but I let my throbbing dick get the best of me. I gave her my number, we start texting and she came over to my dorm later that night. \n\nI knew my roommate would be out all night at a concert so I had the place to myself. She comes in and we start making out right off the bat. My penis was about to break the teeth on the zipper of my jeans at this point. The denim caged in my raging member like a bull in a bull cage before a prime time Texas rodeo. Finally she reached for the zipper and I am no slouch in the pants, she was very impressed and she starts going to town on what she thinks is John Mayer's brother's huge dick. After a few minutes I undress her and fuck her and it was probably the greatest sex I've ever had.\n\nThe next day in philosophy class she says to me \"Mitch, can I ask you for something?\" And I thought to myself \"Shit, she's gonna want something from John Mayer that I won't be able to give her.\" So I say anyway \"Yeah, what do you need?\" And she says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was at this point I realized Heidi was an 8 story crustaceon from the paleozoic era.

In the paleolithic era, we were lucky to hit 40, but for some reason people see it as the paragon of nutritional health and that we should live that way (interestingly enough, I don't forsee those people wanting to live outdoors with no technology and hunt/gather food).\n\nAs a side note, Japanese people have some of the longest life expectant periods in the world, but their diet is very rich in white rice. Were it truly that toxic and devious, any epidemiologist would expect to see the complete opposite.\n\nCeliac disease is a real thing that we're only now starting to pay attention to.

{"body": "Well when I was about 9 I ran into a homeless man on the street corner by my families old apartment in the city. He was a legit nice person I guess he was just a product of a few life mistakes and it led him to the worse possible situation. Either way he would tell me stories about everything from baseball to Vietnam and because we kicked it off so well I began to bring him food. Over the next 6 months I had brought him probably 100 meals and he always thanked me and told me how nice of a kid I was.\n\nOne day me and my grandfather were walking down the street and I introduced them to each other. My grandfather was cordial but you could tell he wasn't at ease with the relationship I had formed with the homeless man. As we walked away he whispered to me, \"I don't want you talking to him any longer.\" \"Why?\" was my response. My grandfather began to tell me about the recent cases of kidnappings and molestation that was happening. I come from the town Megan Kanka was from she was a year older than me and Megans law had just recently been past. It was that day I found out what that law really meant. I was scared shitless and determined to avoid talking to the homeless man and all strangers for that matter and vowed to never do such a thing again.\n\nLater that week I had to go to the store to get my mother this and that and walked by the homeless man. He said \"Hello.\" and I just continued I couldn't help but think of the times we had chatting and I knew he was a good person but I just couldn't get the idea of being abducted out of my head. He looked sad but I wasn't going to be another victim. While I was in the store I noticed a bag of dried apricots what happened to be the homeless mans favorite thing to eat. Once again my mind was flooded with how nice he had treated me so with my change I bought the bag and walked back home passing the homeless man. He seemed saddened so I walked up to him with the bag and he lashed out. \"GO AHEAD JUST KEEP FUCKING MOVING YOU PIECE OF SHIT LEAVE ME LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HAS!\" I screamed and took off catching the ear of a nearby police officer after I started to run I tripped about half a block from the homeless man and hit my head. The homeless man saw it and came to see if I was okay just as the police officer turned the corner. All he saw was the homeless man standing on top of me and me crying on the ground.\n\n\"WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?\" screamed the cop. The homeless man attempted to explain but the cop instead asked me \"Did he do this to you?\" and I tearfully replied \"yes.\" \"You lying piece shit! I've only ever done good to you! I would never hurt a child!\" The homeless man condemned me and pleaded his case all in one yell. The cop had seen enough and went to tackle the homeless man to the ground and in doing so smashed his head on the concrete. At that point staring at the man who had changed my life for the better dying on the pavement blood gushing out his head I realized the mistake I made. I was in tears and the cop attempted to comfort me thinking I was in shock about the non existent attack. I pushed him off and ran towards the homeless man and apologized. In anguish I screamed \"PLEASE FORGIVE ME!\" the homeless man then looked up and gave me a half smile he knew one or two things about mistakes and wasn't going to let me live a life of regret over one I had made. \"Don't worry, son. Things are going to be fine, just always treat others the way you want to be treated.\" I was still bawling. \"But you are going to die!\" I bellowed. In a lowering voice he said \"We all die someday but we just do the best we can before it happens. I just need one thing from you to make my life worthwhile.\" \"What, sir, WHAT!? I'll give do anything for you.\" I said weeping. His smile went from half to full and with his dying breath he said \"I need about tree-fiddy.\" Turns out the homeless man I was so fond of was an 11 feet long aquatic dragon this whole time.

We slowly started becoming closer and closer. And I gave her my phone number. We got even closer. We worked out this thing where she would wait at her school until I got to her school, and I would walk her home. Fast forward four months. I start developing feelings for Kim. So did she. We started talking more and more about dating. We have our first date a week later. We went to a park that had been redone (again, for my anonymity, I won't say the name) it was amazing. I kissed her there at that park. Then I drove her home. I walked her to her doorstep, and kissed her once more. I turned to leave, and she stopped me. \"Hey, I need one more thing,\" she says. I turn around and say \"what do you need?\" She said \"about tree fiddy.\" Now it was about that time that I realized Kim was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I said \"dang it Nessie, you got me but I ain't giving you no tree fiddy.\" And she swam away. I never have seen Kim since.

{"body": "The Loch Ness Monster.\n\nI remember being in my kitchen in the 1970's and looking at the diamond shaped fin pictures in a newspaper. I was scared an excited at the same time. Here started my fascination with Nessie. As a kid my dad always promised to take me on holiday to Loch Ness. A year after my mum died, when I was about 18, we finally made it. It was great. Much monster watching happened, well as much as my dad or then girlfriend would allow during the holiday.  But I think we all enjoyed the boat trips, regardless about who believed what.\n\nIt was the last holiday I had with my dad. He died the following year. I really cherish the memory of that holiday. My dad coming through with a childhood promise to go monster watching. It is making me smile now. \n\nFast forward to when I was 23, I got married and we spent our honeymoon on Cromarty on the Black Isle. Strangely enough, whatever we had planned over that two weeks involved driving past Loch Ness at least once a day. My wife was very patient. And I can strongly recommend going monster watching after having a couple of spliffs. \n\nAnyway, I started to read more and more about Loch Ness and then the penny dropped. The Loch could not support a family of beasties and all the arguments that said it could were, well, bollocks actually. So at the age of about 25 I gave up believing in the Loch Ness monster. And directly because of this I then said to myself \"There is more evidence of the Loch Ness monster than god. And the Loch Ness monster does not exist\". So I became an atheist.   \n\n**TL;DR Giving up believing in the Loch Ness monster made me give up believing in a god** \n  \n\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387875127", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Heres a story that I think works here. \n\nDuring my teenage years, I had a girlfriend who was very clingy, and I didn't seem to mind.  We were always together, which means I was at her house a lot, as she had a lot of stuff going on at home, which required her to be home (Home schooled, very sick parent, distant siblings etc)  I worked taking care of one of her parents (Who was on death row by nature) so I had a key, alarm code, and written permissions to be on the property as I saw fit from 0500-1500 to make breakfast, clean, and get the younger child ready for school (she went to public school unlike her sister)  I was paid for my time/services from the company who managed the healthcare.  So we are 100% legit here. \n\nAfter a year of putting in a ton of time helping out, and getting to know the family while smashing pissers with their middle daughter, grandma and grandpa come to visit.  I was not warned of guests comming to the home, but it's not my business to manage guests, only to take care of basic needs.  One thing they should have warned me of was their holy rolling, better than thou Christian religion/attitude.  They stared at me while I made breakfast for the youngest child, and the other parent (I Fed them first while everyone else got up and ready) and the decided they would treat everyone to breakfast instead of my cooking. \n\nLater that afternoon, they stopped me and began to ask many questions that they had no business answering, such as why I was there, who said I could be there without anyone being awake, and why anyone would allow someone like me to date their daughter.  Being a Catholic man, I was slightly disturbed by this, as I had upheld most of the moral standards (not all of course) as I should, espically when it comes to respecting the parents of the house. \n\nAfter what I am sure was a 10 minute brainstorming process, both grandparents asked me to leave, as they would handle everything while the other parent was out getting groceries, and running her errands, which I had no choice but to decline, as someone had to be trained to take care of the other parent.  They explained that their god would heal him over time, and he needs to believe harder to get better, and got extreamly upset when I refused to leave.   After another 30 minutes of bickering between us, the grandmother grabbed me by my shirt, pulled herself 2 centimeters from my face and began to explain how ignorant I am, how I lack discipline, and lastly, how my mother raised me wrong.  \n\nOnce she commented on mom, I pushed her back, and punched her in the mouth. I calmly explained to her and her husband that they can have their opinion of me as they wish, as I change for no one, but talkign about mom is not a wise decision.   \n\nI then notified the local police, explaining I had an issue with two individuals who were hindering my work as a hospice worker, and needed them removed.  After reviewing my work documents, verifing I had a legal key to the residence, They asked the grandmother why she had such an issue with me. \n\nAfter the police officer spoke with the grandmother, he came back and explained that she was only waiting for me to give her what she had asked for.  I couldn't recall this woman asking me for anything other than a problem, and asked the officer what she wanted.  He told me she needed about tree fiddy. That was about that time I noticed  that the grandmother was a 20 foot tall creature from the prehistoric ages. After noticing this, I yelled \"get out of here Lockness monster, I ain't givin you no tree fiddy\"\n\nI have not had a problem since, but I am sure they are quite unhappy with me.

{"body": "&gt;Sure although I'm not so sure broken bones healing in minutes  \n\nAllright, so I am only going to address the broken bone because my line of reasoning is very similar for both. First, let us assume that what happened was that the bone was indeed broken, and within minutes is fused itself together, well there you go, laws of physics indeed broken, congratulations, a miracle. Now, how do we know who or what entity performed this miracle? I am assuming that you are crediting your god with the miracle, right? well, how do you know it was not a different divine being that did it, how do you know the buddha didn't do it through time and space? how do you know it was not the christian devil? how do you know it wasn't muhammad? or the god of an African tribe that you have never heard of? was the bone signed by your god after he did it? did you hear his voice and he said that he is the god talked about in the religious texts that you prefer? did he part the clouds for all to see him/her/it? Most likely not, most likely you attribute it to this god simply because you want it to be this god who did it. Unfortunately, your desire simply is not enough to make it true.\n\nHowever, I am a skeptic, so I will ask a few questions about the miraculously healing bone that you are probably are not used to hearing. The reason that I figure that you are not used to hearing these questions is because if they were to come from someone of the same religion as you, then it would be borderline doubting, and doubting and religion certainly do not go hand in hand. So, about the bone, you can answer these questions if you wish, or just ponder their implications. Was there a doctor present? If so, did he have an x-ray machine? if not, how was the bone confirmed broken and then not broken? if there was an x-ray taken, then what is it that led to the event of multiple x-rays being taken so close together? Was the first one taken, clearly showing a broken bone, and then the patient all of a sudden feels no more pain and says, \"doctor I think it has magically healed itself instantly, take another x-ray\"? If this is indeed what happened, then what was the doctors reaction? To which journals/news organizations did he report this miracle of science? If he didn't report it, then did he say why not? All these questions can easily be dispelled by a simple link to an article or report describing the event which would most certainly exist if the doctor experienced what he saw to be a miracle of science.\n\n&gt;Now while I have not seen any of these 'physics breaking' miracles myself\n\nIt amazes me how these occurrences always seem to escape video cameras, kind of like UFOs, the loch ness monster, and bigfoot. Maybe there is a reason for this.\n\n&gt;Here you go again, does the scientific method not come before personal experience?\n\nFor me they actually go hand in hand, see, the scientific method is a process of taking experiences, applying logic to these experiences, and reaching conclusions that can be replicated. Experience is a crucial aspect of this process.\n\n&gt;You should understand that experience can be biased and if it can be biased why should you trust it?\n\nyou are right, experience can be biased, if fact it can not NOT be biased. why should we trust it? because it has repeatedly shown itself to be more effective at coming to working conclusions than making up conclusions because they support things that we have previously decided that we wish to be true.\n\n&gt; I myself cannot stand it if someone has an inconsistent philosophy.\n\nYou may want to think about this for a bit. You have repeatedly both used logic to try to prove points, and claimed that logic is not enough to prove points.\n\n&gt;You cannot say you trust the facts and then say you trust your personal experience\n\nactually, for me, personal experience is where the facts come from, I do not acquire facts simply because someone that I hold as religiously superior tells me they are true, but because I experience them to be true. Now, if you are wondering about the facts that i take from scientists, i will address that. I actually hold facts that come from scientists differently than I hold hold facts that I experience, for example gravity. Stuff that comes from scientists I place on a bit of a sliding scale, for instance if every reputable scientist that i can find out about agrees that the moon is what causes changing tides, based on extensive study, then I hold that as more true than if i hear about a small group of scientists who many scientists disagree agree with, who are claiming that the grand canyon is evidence of a world wide flood. Neither of these do I hold as highly as I do gravity however.\n\n&gt; I myself love the fallibility of scientific law because it is in the failures which we truly learn.\n\nI found a statement that we agree on :) this does not mean however that i think nothing can be relied on because scientists of times past found out they were wrong about the earth being flat, but it excites me to no end that there could be laws that we currently hold as true that may eventually turn out to be proven as false. This is learning.\n\n&gt;now you are saying that you understand that meanings change\n\nBasically, nobody knows what the intent of the original authors were of a text that was written thousands of years ago, but when you are discussion a text with people who hold certain statements as being accurate accounts of what has happened, for example miracles, then for the sake of discussion you must assume that what is being said is what was meant. But absolutely, we do not know the original intents of anything that was written in these old texts, for all we know they were not describing any miracles whatsoever, or any divine beings for that matter, these could all be things that have just developed over the years by people who wanted a good story.\n\n&gt;articles posted in /r/science or /r/worldnews about miracle breakthroughs which almost always turn out to be far less than the headlines make them out to be.\n\nyou are very right, people love attention grabbers.\n\n&gt;This is interesting specifically due to the topic of this CMV in which you were quite convinced it was harmful and not only that it was bad to be a friend of those committing such 'harmful' acts.\n\nI am in no way conceding that lying to children is unharmful, nor am I saying that I think scaring children with threats of eternal damnation is unharmful. What I am saying here is simply that we are all trying to do our best to navigate this world, that is it. Take for example, one of many parents who are convinced that the best thing for a child is to beat them with a stick when they talk back. I, like many other people, see this as harmful for the child, the child may develop issues with trust, or love that could very well stick with them for many years to come. However, if that parent is convinced that this is what is best for the child, than that is them trying their best to navigate this world and act appropriately, I may not agree with how they choose to navigate it, but it does not mean that I am unable to observe that they are just trying to do what they think is right.\n\n\nIt has been a while since I have tried discussing religion with a person who is religious, I used to do it a lot, but I put it aside for some time and this is why, In many cases arguing with a religious person is like having an imaginary gun fight with someone, you know, the kind where you stick your thumb up in the air and you aim your pointer finger at them and you say \"BANG! BANG! I SHOT YOU!\", the thing is they just keep saying \"No you didn't, you missed!\", or rather, \"you are just using logic, it doesn't count because me and my god is above logic\". See, ultimately it is often an exercise in futility, someone who has spent a large portion of their life reinforcing their own beliefs, and forming relationships with people based on these beliefs are very unlikely to change their mind simply because someone points out the inconsistencies in their beliefs. It takes introspection more than anything else, I have experienced several people in my life leave religion and it is by no means a quick process. For me, it was the result of much time spent alone, as well as much time spent meeting lots of different people with very different views from my own, I feel very fortunate to have been freed from all the self doubt that goes along with the key components of the religion that I was involved in, specifically the idea of sin, and it breaks my heart that so many people are still slave to these self imposed chains, this is why I spend so much of my time and energy trying to understand what is going on, it is because I want to help. \n\nI want you to know that I greatly appreciate the time that you are taking to discuss all this with me, quite frankly you actually are much more reasonable than many people that I have discussed these matters with. As a bit of a side note, you may be interested to know that I have awarded a delta to /u/Omegaile for this [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1tgx6i/i_think_that_if_you_are_friendly_with_people_who/ce7w9ea) that he made concerning my initial point.

{"body": "Ugh, this just happened to me.\n\nI'll start by saying that I grew up with this girl in a way that would make her pretty much my sister; her mom is best friends with my mom and have been since they were little. Now, when I grew up with her she was always the tomboy and I was pretty much her yes man. We would walk to and from the bus stop everyday and after school we would go and play in the woods behind my house. She actually taught me how to swim in the creek that ran through the woods where we built a couple tree forts. The day she taught me how to swim we were both so happy that she gave me kiss on the cheek. Being a bit socially awkward I remember I just kinda stood there and she shrugged it off and said we should go have a stick war.\n\nShe was two years older than me and we sort of drifted apart when she went to high-school and left me behind for middle school.\n\nFast forward a few years to when I got to high school and she was always the girl with a boyfriend. It was around that time that I realized I had caught feelings for her. The timing was never good; the few rare times she was single it never ended up working out - she knew I liked her, and as far as I could tell she liked me too.\n\nAfter she graduated I planned on going to the same college as her but my grades didn't make the cut and I settled for Community College while she went out of state to a \"real College\".\n\nOne really amazing new years everything lined up - both of us had just come out of the typical college flings and were getting really flirty with each other at a New Years party. \n\nAfter that night we began our 3 year relationship. Halfway through she dropped a bomb on me - saying that she wished she lost her virginity to me. She said that about halfway through high school she went to a party after a bad break-up. Some guy who was really good friends with her ex took advantage of her and essentially manipulated her into having sex with him when she was blackout drunk; she said this was the reason why she was always in a relationship - because she felt secure in one, but with me she felt *safe*. She also talked about that one day in the creek when she kissed me.\n\nCurrently, I'm in my last year at Uni and She moved a state away for this really awesome job in her field of study. It's been tough doing the whole LDR, but this holiday we've been visiting our families so its been nice. Last week I took her to the creek where she taught me how to swim. It had just snowed and the creek was frozen over, I got on one knee and pulled out the ring that I used a chunk of my student loan to pay for. She started crying and said that she had done something stupid when she was away this year for work.\n\nNow this was always the type of girl that needed to be in a relationship, and when she was away in the other state she spent the night at one of her co-workers places because she always had trouble sleeping alone. I have never met this guy, but I'd heard her talk about him in the past and something always told me that I didn't like the guy. In the morning she had realized what she had done and went home and showered. She said no to my proposal and she said she would understand if I didn't want to talk to her again. But that she needed some bus change to get home - about $3.50.\n\nIt was then that I realized that my childhood friend, the girl that taught me how to swim and later how to love, was actually about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era! I shouted back \"God dammit Nessie! I ain't given you no tree fiddy!\".\n\n**TL;DR** Childhood Sweetheart breaks my heart when home for Christmas vacation.\n\n**EDIT** Thank you for the gold Anon! It really means a lot to me during this difficult Christmas. While it may not repair mine and Vanessa's relationship - it did bring happiness to my otherwise sad and confused holiday.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1387936009", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 788, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I used to work in the construction industry, and there was a girl on the crew opposite me whom I found extremely attractive. I met her at the bar one time and she turned out to have a great personality as well. We had shared interests, like swimming and history. She didn't recognize me from work, so I explained that I noticed her in the field, and asked her out. She accepted and we became pretty close after that, we would go out for drinks and sushi with my friends and they all thought we made a \"cute\" couple. Except for my friend Jay, he never liked her for some reason, which would eventually become apparent.\n\nAfter dating for a few years after that, I told Jay that I was planning to propose to her with my grandmothers engagement ring that my mother had given me. He never approved of us, and thought this was a bad idea, and urged me not to go through with it. When I questioned him about it he just sighed and said \"you can't even see it, can you?\". He wouldn't explain further.\n\nJay was my best friend since highschool, and his opinion really mattered to me. I didn't want to go through with it without his blessing. Still, I was really puzzled by his seeming disgust with our relationship. After debating it in my head for quite a while, I decided I was going to propose regardless.\n\nI planned a trip to a lake just a few hours from town, my aunt had a cabin which she let us borrow on occasion. We didn't go alone, I invited Jay and his girlfriend at the time, but I didn't tell him I was going to pop the question during the trip.\n\nBefore I get to the proposal I just want to say that by this point in the relationship we had already discussed the idea of marriage. And we were both very comfortable financially.\n\nAnyway, on the third day into the trip I decided to go through with it. I grabbed the ring and asked her to come for a walk with me along the lake. It was a gorgeous summer day, light wind, sparkling water. We walked along the water to the pier, and I felt like the time was right. \n\nI got down on one knee, told her that I loved her more than anything, and that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. I told her that If I could wake up to her smile each and every morning, it would make me the happiest man on earth. She didn't say anything, just stared at me for what seemed like an eternity.\n\nAfter staring at me, almost dumbfounded, she eventually opened her mouth and said \"sure, but I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\". That's when I realized that my beautiful girlfriend of three years was actually a 500ft crustacean from the Paleolithic era. Staring down at me with those big red eyes, I was petrified. That's when Jay came over and it all made sense. That whole time, he knew the truth. The simple and painful truth.\n\nTL;DR: my best friend knew my girlfriends darkest secret and tried to warn me, but I proposed anyway and it ruined my life.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387950278", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think this is part of the issue talking about scientific issues with non scientists is that lay people make assumptions about how claims are evaluated or how they are looked at.\n\nFor example its possible that there is an archaic dinosaur that has always evaded detection and lives in Loch Ness.

Quantum mechanics states that the wave function of any particle is spread out over an infinite volume, and is not in a definite place until measurement. Each particle in your body could therfore under our best understanding of science undergo quantum teleportation to Hawaii in 30 seconds.\n\nIt's possible that the LHC will destroy the universe.\n\nIt's possible that alien life 1) exists 2) developed multi cellular life 2) developed intelligence 4) transported to our star system out of the billions and billions of possible star systems to visit.\n\nAll of these claims however are so fanciful to be discountable.

{"body": "It happened to me once, its how I met my ex-fiance. I met her outside the small little independent theater at my town, I had just broken up with my girlfriend of about 2 years at the time, and I was... well mopey to say the least. Anyhow, I'm walking about and I just sit down on the bench outside for a few minutes and out of nowhere this girl just sits down next to me and starts talking to me. It was pretty obvious she had been going through some sort of relationship troubles (latter found out she was in the same situation, but it was HER who got dumped), and we eventually started to have a good conversation. We got up and started walking around the mall just shooting the shit, having a blast. I can't remember exactly where we were at, it was like JP Pennys or something (She said she wanted to buy 'something sexxy' to make her ex jealous, and even hinted she needed someone new to look sexxy for 0.o), and she gets a call that her best friend just broke her leg. She says 'Oh my god I'm so sorry I have to go see her at the hospital' and I tell her its OK and that she needs to be with her friend, but I forgot to get her number before she left!\n\nAnyways, I went on Craigslist and looked at the missed connections, and it turns out she actually beat me to making a post. So we met up again and things started to get rolling pretty fast, and it was great. We had a lot of fun going on dates, watching movies, getting drunk as hell together (what can I say, we were young), and after about a year and a half of dating I finally popped the question. I was nervous as hell but she didn't even have to think about it, she was basically sitting there anxious waiting for me to finish asking her just so she could accept. \n\nWe were engaged about 6 months before we had the wedding, and it was great. It wasn't a huge thing, we just had our families, our friends and the priest and photographer and what not. Anyways, I just finished my vows and she is about to start hers, but first she said 'Can I just ask you for just one thing?' and I said yes, just tell me what you need and I'll get it for her and she said \"I need about three fiddy\".

{"body": "It can be very uncomfortable. Not because I don't like seeing my old students, I do, but when I don't remember their names I can see the heartbreak in their eyes. They think that because I left such a deep impression upon them that they must have in turn done the same thing to me. Many of them do, but grasping their name is what really escapes me (I was never really good with names in the first place). The worst though is when I don't recognize them whatsoever, either because they were sheepish in class or because they changed pretty drastically. One boy that I had tapped me on the shoulder at Kroger after eyeing me a few times and said hello. I was a bit taken aback because of how large he was, but he smiled really big and I had the familiar feeling that he had been one of my students. I'm pretty upfront and said immediately, sorry X, I don't quite remember you, can you help remind me? X had been a senior in my advanced composition class his senior year. He was, at the time, a little on the chubby side and had some skin problems. He was still big, but in a good way. I couldn't contain my shock when I put two and two together, he had definitely come into his own. He very humbly explained that he went through a full personality shift when he went to college. He shed some of that baby fat, made an effort to be more outgoing and just generally became a well-rounded person. He said seeing all the girls he had crushes on slip through his fingers drove him crazy. He knew the only reason he got rejected so much was because of his outward appearance. He wasn't a bad looking kid in HS, but he was definitely a looker when I saw him again. It was actually adorable because he said he always had a little thing for me even though I was so much older. I found that really flattering, especially because my own romantic life had been a little lackluster in the last few years. I gave him my email and said goodbye, really hoping he would stay in touch and let me know how he was doing. He had just finished school with an engineering degree and was about to start a job (this was his first summer out of the university so he was bumming around for a few weeks). As he walked away though I was struck with this odd curiosity. I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around flush as a tomato. He stammered a little bit, which reminded me of the old X, still adorable. 'Can I ask you for something?' He agreed as soon as the words came out of my mouth. 'I need about tree fiddy.' It was about that time that he noticed I wasn't his old teacher, but a eight story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. No idea who this X was but I got him again. We sat down for coffee and he told me about everything that had been going on with his family and he agreed that he would call me in a few days. tl;dnr chance encounter at kroger leads to coffee and a (non-date) date.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388015577", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

There are so many stories that go along with that, two pubescent boys, shit, I don't even have room here for all of it.\n\nWe complemented each other too!  I, the irascible youth, and he the quiet, loner who found solace in someone with whom he could share something besides his tragic and abusive childhood.\n\nBill's dad died young.  Like really young.  His parents were hardly out of high school when they had him, and a really shitty motorcycle accident took his dad before he was old enough to drink.  His mom had her own problems and a string of bad decisions and even worse boyfriends often made for a tumultuous childhood for my buddy.  I felt so bad. \n\nWe would have sleep overs, at my house, of course.  He would come out of his shell with my family.  He got a good dinner, we got to play video games.  It was so much fun.  \n\nIt continued through middle school, but after that things changed.  We went to different high schools.  He started hanging out with some kids I knew weren't good people.  I remember the last time he stayed at my house; my parents asked me about the missing bottle of liquor right away.   It was all downhill after that.\n\nSo much booze.  So much drugs.  I couldn't be around him after he broke out all the windows of that old warehouse off the main street of our town.  I knew it was him.  The cops even asked me about it.  I had to lie.  I couldn't turn him in.  He lied to their faces too.  I'm disgusted to this day with myself and those police officers, and me crying and the look on my mom's face.\n\nYears passed.\n\nI saw him on the median of the main drag in our town.  Scraggly, dirty, sad.\n\nI thought I could make the light, but I had to stop.  He saw me,  he fucking RECOGNIZED me and approached the car.

She walked down the aisle with his picture in her arms, trying to fight back tears, until she gets up to the front and the mom (I guess, older lady that looked like the bride) started bawling. This caused the bride to start crying and the priest and groom start trying to comfort her. You can feel the awkwardness in the room. \n\nAnyway the ceremony finally finished up and we started the reception. It went ok. I spilled a glass of wine on an old guy (he was really cool about it), but I made this sad looking girl laugh. Turns out she was the brides sister.

Yeah, me neither.\n\nAnyway, back on topic. So apparently I still had the old phone number of a doormat in college. No one else to call, I took the shot.

I should've taken this as a warning, but I pressed on.

{"body": "**1-Eye witness accounts and people’s memory are not reliable.**\nIt has been repeatedly, conclusively demonstrated that human memory is not a process of recall, but rather a process of reconstruction and association. \n\nWe have evidence of alien flying saucers from area 51. We have evidence for big foot, we have evidence for the Loch Ness monster. All these three thing have far more evidence and documented (by name) eyewitness accounts in comparison to the Bible. Yet it still is not enough for anyone to take any of them seriously.\n\nAbout the Gospels, anyone can write a text and claim it to be true, or claim others to be the sources. The hundreds of manuscripts are only copies of copies. Of the original manuscripts, all are just scraps of single papyrus. The story of Jesus was spread word of mouth for decades, we all know what happens with this type of storytelling. Mark was the first gospel written down, Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source. The collection of books written by historically unknown scribes, with historically unknown authors. The names of the gospels were only added after the fact. There were many other books and gospels that were voted out of the bible by church hierarchy. \nPaul never even saw Jesus, he was just having visions of the “revealed” Jesus, Paul never even met Jesus in the flesh and he was never an apostle of Jesus. Muhammad claimed to have the same type of vision of the angel Gabriel, Joseph Smith was visited by the angel Maroney, many religions have this type of “eye witness” vision of celestial beings. Now a Christian will reject these because they believe the Bible and visa versa for a believer of Mormon, Muslim, they all claim to be the truth and everything else isn’t credible, that is the nature of belief.\n\nEven if there were more evidence of the gospel’s account of Jesus’s resurrection it still wouldn’t be enough. Even in the 21st century we have people claiming to have witnessed miracles of their favorite mystic or spiritual leader. EG: Sathya Sai Baba (http://www.saibaba.ws/miracles.htm) \n\nEven today, 53 of first 62 DNA exonerations of people convicted of capital crimes in the United States were convicted on eyewitness testimony. We know from cognitive social science how unreliable eyewitness testimony is today.\n\nFurthermore, even if a guy did do a miracle, in what way does it make what he says the truth?\n\n\n**2- The Gospels are not credible.**\n\n\n* The Bible, is full of errors and contradictions, not to mention several deliberate forgeries. \n\nWhat was Jesus mindset and emotions when he was being crucified? \nWas he indifferent, saying little, with his last words being “It is finished” (as In John). Or did Jesus know even more what was happening and why and where he was going when his last words in Luke are: “Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.” Or, was he questioning god about why he was being killed as in Mark and Matthew when his words on the crucifix were “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”? \n\n\nThe evolving portrayal of Jesus trail: \n\n\n\n*Mark’s portrayal of Jesus trail:*\n \nJesus trial likely would have never happened. Pilot was ruthless, and sent thousands to death and the cross with his pen alone. When Pilot finds Jesus innocent, Pilot asked the crowd if the want Jesus the preacher and traitor to Rome or Barabbas the insurrectionist and murderer to be freed (one prisoner released to the Jews by the Roman governor done as a yearly Passover tradition). The crown demands Barabbas to be freed and Jesus to be killed. Pilot pleads: “why?”, pained at the thought of putting an innocent to death, “what evil has he done?” The crowd only chants louder for Jesus to be crucified. \n\nThis scene makes no sense at all. Nevermind that outside the gospels there is not a shred of historical evidence for any such Passover custom on the part of any roman governor. What is truly beyond belief is the portrayal of Pontius Pilate, a man renownd for his loathing of the Jews, for his total disregard for Jewish rituals and customs. He is known for blindly signing so many execution orders that a formal complaint was lodged against him in Rome. He regularly sent soldiers to the streets to slaughter anyone rebelling his decisions. He wouldn’t have spent a moment of his time pondering the faint of yet another rebel rouser. \n\nThe reason the author of Mark did this is because the target audience was non Jewish people of Rome. The jewish zealot movement the was started by Jesus, ended late 1st century right about the time the gospel Mark was written. The author made to make it sound less jewish and more appealing to this audience, so he made the Jews responsible for the death of Jesus, and the “compassionate” Pilot did everything he could to stop Jesus being killed. The more time passed and the later gospels portrayed Pilot as even more out of historic character. \n\n\n\n*Matthew portrayal of Jesus trail:*\n\nMatthew literally washed Pilots hands of any responsibility for Jesus’s death. Matthew further exaggerates the Jews direct role in killing Jesus, he makes the Jews claim sole responsibility for Jesus’s death:\nSo when Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood;[k] see to it yourselves.” 25 Then the people as a whole answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”(Matthew 27:24-25)\n\n\n\n*Luke’s portrayal of Jesus trail:*\nBasicly same a Matthew, but adds the non responsibility to not just Pilot, but Herrod. (Luke 23)\n\n\n\n*John’s portrayal of Jesus trail:*\n\nPushes this conceit of Pilot’s innocence and the Jew’s guilt to the extreme. John was written in Ephesus, sometime after 100 CE. Pilot not only does everything he can to stop Jesus from being killed because Pilot thinks Jesus is innocent, but also because Pilot thinks Jesus is the son of god. Not only this but Matthew has Jesus personally telling Pilot that Pilot is innocent and it is the Jews whole shall take responsibility for Jesus’s death. And to further his blame and insult to the Jews, John adds one of the worst insults to the Jewish people of the time, on of the most fowl, blasphemous thing a Jew of the time could utter,  he has the Jews answering the question: Pilate asked them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but the emperor/caesar” (John 19:15)\n\n\n* Additional discrediting things of the Gospels alone: \n\n-The last 12 verses of Mark wasn’t originally in the book. The last 12 verses were added centuries after.\n\n-The story of the adulterous woman and casting the first stone wasn’t in the book. Pericope de Adultera at John 7:53-8:11\n\n-Jesus nativity, clearly fabricated adding a fake census. A census of Quirinius: The census had the sole purpose of taxation, roman law assesses a person’s property in the place of residence, not of ones birth. There is no Roman record (Romans kept impeccable records, particularly well when it came to taxation) to say otherwise. Luke’s suggestion that the entire Roman economy would periodically be placed on hold as every Roman subject was forced to uproot himself and his entire family in order to travel great distances to the place of his father’s birth and then wait there for months for an official to take stock of his possessions, which in any case he would have left behind at his place of residence is preposterous. Matthew need Jesus to come out of egypt for the same reason he needs jesus from bethlehem, to full fill prophecy.\n\n-Virgin birth controversy.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388075900", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students. I heard most of the drama but there is one student that I will always be reminded of when people ask this question.\n\nThere was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip. She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't. Everyone could hear her, including me. Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about. She gossiped most days but one day was different.\nI heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom. I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not? \nIt could be fun.\n\nAnyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with.\nMr. Bodom.\n\nI was shocked when I heard this.\nBut stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young. She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess. If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress.\n\nAfter class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work. It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head.\nAs soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, \"Hey Kathy. I heard you talking about me in class...\" she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, \"Oh my god! You heard me say that? I'm so sorry! And-\" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, \"I want to have sex with you too.\"\nShe stopped her sentence and smiled. Then she said, \"Do you know what my rates are?\"\nConfused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in. It turns out she mentioned that she would have sex with me... if I paid that is.\n\nI decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her. \"Alright,\" I told her. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"I'll do it, but I need some money of course. That's just how it works.\" she said. I replied, \"Okay, what do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had tricked me again! \"Godamnit monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away.\n\nClass was really weird after that with Kathy gone. I never told any of the students about our encounter but I sure as hell would never mention it to anyway. Ever. Of course I'm telling Reddit, but isn't that what the internet is for? To tell strangers your deepest, darkest secrets?\nThe year ended without being... too weird.\n\n**TL;DR: Overheard a student talking about having sex with me... things got... weird and it ended in an unexpected way...**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388095703", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 746, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Me and two of my other friends were camping. We were on a river atop a hill. During the day it was a peaceful retreat from the clutter and stress of the average weekday. Birds chirped in the morning, the sun shined an amber glow at dusk. \n\nDuring the night however, it was somehow unsettling. The uneasy tone of the river had no apparent source. We had planed to stay at the campsite for 7 days.\n\nWe only stayed 3.\n\nWe arrived on Monday. It was spring break. We were exited that we could just leave everything behind for a couple of days. We had a tent that was big enough but could have been bigger. It took around and hour to set up the tent and fire. Me and one of my friends, I'll call him 'M', decided to go for a walk. Not quite trusting the third friend's, I call him 'C', defense skills I locked the car we used to get there. So Me and M went on a walk while C stayed back by the fire. The forest was amazing. Trees were like stencils for the sun to show it's rays through. You could see individual rays of light as they shot through the leaves around us. The breeze was just cold enough that it wasn't too hot. However, as the time drew on the feeling of perfection was slowly replaced with the feeling of unease. That feeling you get when you suspect your being watched but, there isn't anything around you. M looked at me. I stopped and so did he\n\n\"Do you feel that?\", M asked.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I don't know I just feel uneasy.\"\n\n\"Same here, you wanna go back?\"\n\n\"Yes!\n\nHe sounded So happy at the suggestion of going back to the camp ground. To be honest, so was I. But, when we got to the campsite C was gone. I looked at him with a scared expression.\n\n\"Where is he?\", I asked him.\n\n\"I'll tell you for about tree fiddy.\"\n\nSuddenly he was a lock ness monster!

{"body": "Long Story Here it goes.\n\nMy family has always had money. My old man worked in stocks from the early 90's until 2005 so We've always been pretty well off. I didn't act like a snobbish prissy rich kid in High School. I was pretty grounded and I didn't have many friends. I was really overweight in my Freshman and Sophmore years but lost a good 50 pounds going into Junior year.\nI had never so much as talked to a girl let alone gone out with one. Then I met this girl and we'll call her Jen. Jen was gorgeous. Long Blonde hair, big blue eyes, decent rack but really nice legs. Almost every guy wanted to get with Jen but never could because she shot down like everyone. We started talking in American lit class and I'll never forget when after about 2 weeks of occasional chatting when She asked me out. I would have never pulled the trigger and asked her I was just happy that she was talking to me. \n\nOur first date was a Movie. We saw the proposal together (Solid flick overall). It went great I did the whole \"Stretch Arm Over Her Shoulder\" move. Didn't kiss she said she just wanted to watch the movie I could deal with that. The movie went on like normal and then we left the theater. I drove her back to her place in my car and walked her to the door. It was like a scene out of a chick flick. She kissed me and I felt like Rainbows would fly out of my ass. One date turned to two. Then Two dates turned to 10. We were in a relationship! I thought \"Holy Shit I did it\"\n\n\nThe next Six months were amazing. She came on the family vacation to Aruba and my entire family loved her. No one could believe I had gotten with this Hot of a Girl for my first girlfriend. I remember it being late at night on the beach and holding her on the beach in my arms as we watched the sun set with my chin rested on the top of her head. Whispering sweet nothings to each other. At the time it was the greatest moment of my life. Nothing could take away from it. \n\nMore time passed and things were going great between Jen and I. I was lavishing her with gifts left and right. Fancy Shoes, Jewelry the works. Looking back on it I can;t believe how much money I spent on this girl. It was all worth it though the memories we just amazing. We hit out 18th month anniversary and that's when It all went south. I booked reservations for this 5 star seafood restaurant that overlooked the ocean. Dinner was fantastic. The Shrimp Cocktail was amazingly fresh the Lobster was to die for and then we split Tiramisu. The Bill came and I guess I was in a rush to get ready that night because I realized that I left my wallet at home. I explained this to Jen thinking it would be alright but I was dead wrong. She got really red in the face and started berating me. I couldn't believe It I never saw this side of her before. She stated that she would take care of the bill. She snatched the check off the table and then I asked her for the dreaded amount.

{"body": "Ohh Do I have a doozy for you! Here is the tale of my brother's friend's step brother. Let us call our hero errr ... Slagathor! Now the story begins...\n\nOne day Slagathor took a trip to Colorado with his college friends after they had all got done with their Midterms. Slagathor was madly in love with this close friend of his. He had taken a liking to her the first day he met her. Sadly he was deep in the friendzone showing no signs of escaping. The trip was his idea of a scapegoat out of the dreaded friendzone. After all the Midterms were taken, Slagathor and his crew of friends loaded up into his van to make the trip from Texas to Colorado. They lived in the Amarillo area so it was that bad of a drive. Slagathor and his lover would ride in the front while the rest of the gang lounged in the backseats. Slagathor asked his crush if she needed a buddy for the skiing they were gonna do. Of course his crush thought nothing more of it and said yes. This meant the world to Slagathor. After about a dozen stops and multiple potty breaks the crew and Slagathor had made it to Colorado. The crush of Slagathor asked to room with him. Slagathor could barely accept her request since he was in a state of shock. When Slagathor and his crush got to their room he collapsed on his bed and slept for 8 hours. When he awoke, his crush was laying beside him. He was baffled by here appearance. Slagathor was about to ask what she was doing, but as soon as he opened his mouth his crush locked lips with him and gave him a very heart felt and passionate kiss. Slagathor was stunned then his crush said something along the lines of \"I've always loved you Slagathor but I thought you didn't feel the same.\" Slagathor then told her the feelings that he had always had for her and the times he would secretly leave orchads at her apartment door because he knew that was her favorite flower. SLagathor became so overwhelm with emotion that he started balling in front of her. His crush asked \"What is wrong Slagathor? Everything is perfect.\" Slagathor responded with \"I am crying with tears of joy for I found the woman of my dreams, the women I want to spend my last days with, the women I love.\" His crush started whimpering and then eventually crying with him. Both were crying for all the right reasons. His crush eventually stopped and had a serious expression on her face. Slagathor asked what was wrong. She replied with \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, he replied, \"What do you need? His crush smirked with an scaly expression and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time he realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten him again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" He yelled as she swam away into the distance. Slagathor was left in anger and heart ache for the rest of the trip. His friends tried to cheer him up but nothing would help. Slagathor was never the same after that trip. He eventually found a lovely wife that we know call Mrs. Slagathor.\n\nI always tell the story as if it was I that was left heart broken and eventually found love.

Now the bombardment of the porcelian lake stops the townspeople think its over and start to repair the damage. But then when they least expect it there is another barrage of \"grout\" coming at them.

{"body": "I was in a pretty serious relationship with my ex girlfriend for about 5 years.  We were perfect for each other, or so I thought. We did the normal \"couple things\", dinner, movies, etc.. Things were going along normally up until about 8 months ago. I had noticed that she started acting a bit strange by her standards, but I assumed it was that time of the month or some work related stress. She would come home later than usual, be really abrupt and short in all her replies and conversations, and I just seemed to annoy her no matter what I did. It was literally a losing battle every single day. I was having a serious inner conflict because I loved this girl with all my heart and even had just finished paying off the ring I had custom designed just for her. It may not seem like it to you reading this but I juat knew something was wrong. Well, as the weeks passed she seemed to grow more distant. She was staying over at her sister's house alot more than usual, looking to start a fight over the most miniscule of things, and basically doing everything in her power to avoid me.  I went and talked to my best friend about it and he suggested that maybe she was feeling inadequate because I hadn't asked her to marry me yet. She talked about weddings and dresses and the like all the time, so I thought he was on to something. Fast forward about a month and I surprise her with a romantic weekend getaway in a log cabin in the smokies. The trip is going perfect, we were back to our old ways, kissing, hugging, just geniunely enjoying each other. So the big night arrives and I plan a horseback ride to a secluded ridge overlooking the forest and a beautiful night sky. So we arrive at the spot and im very nervous about proposing, but I think I have to try. She's taking pictures of the skyline and our fire we built, so I get down on my knee as she turns the other way. She turns back to me and instantly starts crying. I see these as tears of joy and my nervousness immediately leaves. Well she says NO!! I was crushed. I come to find out that over the past few months my best friend had been telling her that I was talking to other women at work and sleeping around, which is completely fictitious, and while shes feeling vulnerable he moved in and slept with her. This destroyed my whole world, how could my best friend do that to me and then suggest I ask her to marry me? We broke up that night and I hadnt heard from her until about 3 weeks ago on facebook. She sends me a message and asks if i will talk about what happened. The whole conversation goes as follows:\n\n Me: Why are you doing this to me again?\nHer: I just feel terrible about what happened and theres something I need so I can have some closure.\n Me: What could you possibly need from me for closure after you destroyed my life???\n\nHer: I need about tree fiddy\n\nWell it was around this time that I looked at her profile picture and noticed that my ex girlfriend was a bout 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That was the last time I ever heard from her. \n\nTLDR; serious relationship turns bad after best friend does the unthinkable", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388135700", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The next night, we went. We pulled up in his beat up Mercury and walked around the really long line to the bouncer. It was only like 10:30 but it was JAMMED. We could just feel it. Inside, we saw the most beautiful women you could imagine. It was surreal. In any case, the bouncer asked told us he'd waive the fee and we got to go. I don't really remember much else about that night.\n\nThe next week, we decided to go again, but the bouncer wasn't there. We waited for what felt like hours. We finally got to the front (no girls with us but it was okay), and the guy told us to pay the entry fee. We asked \"how much?\" And he said \"tree fiddy.\" We looked inside and realized that all of the beautiful women were really 50 foot long crustaceans from the paleolithic era.

About five feet by twelve. I worked at a bank as a bank teller. \nOne day, while walking home from work, I bought a taco from a street vendor. I was about to walk away with my taco when he said to me, \"Would you like to go on an adventure?\"\nOf course, this took me by surprise. But I had nothing to do for the rest of the day, so I figured why not.\nI followed him along the sidewalk down a couple blocks when he turned into an alley. At first I was put off by this but he seemed like a nice guy, so I went anyways.\nSo I turn around the corner, and what do I see?\nThree hookers all in the alleyway, huddled next to a dumpster. The man grins at me and nods towards the prostitutes. They then begin to walk slowly towards me, engulfing me, and begin to touch my crotch. At the time I hadn't been laid in a while, and the hookers didn't seem too trashy, so I just went along with it.\nThey pull my clothes off, push me down on to the ground, and start climbing on top of me, each doing their thing. I finished in about ten minutes, and then got up and went back over to the man.\n\"Thanks so much, dude, I haven't been laid in forever.\"\n\"Sure thing, man.\"\n\"Is there anything I can do to repay you,\" I asked.\n\"Well, there is one thing you could do for me,\" he replied.\n\"Well, what is it?\" I said.\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\nIt was about time I realized that this man was a ten-story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era! \nAnyways, I ran home after that.

{"body": "It happened this summer.\n\nMy gf had just broken up with me and I decided to drive all the way from BC to the Calgary Stampede. Cause, fuck it - right? Now, when I put my mind to something I don't usually fuck around. I was gonna drive this son'bitch in one go, no breaks.\n\nI left at around midday with two cans of energy drinks and a bacon sandwich. This meal prep lasted about 2 hours into the journey. I got a good \"buzz\" going from the energy drinks, but by the time the sun went down they had lost their effect. Awesome.\n\nBut, fuck it - I kept trekking along.\n\n75% of the way there and I was feeling dog tired. It was dark. It was rainy. And the road was winding like a motherfucker. At least the roads were empty.\nOr so I thought. \n\nThere's this one nasty bend coming up that my parents warned me about; it is well known for car accidents. I turn the bend and lo and behold - a car on the side of the road, hood popped with a guy at the front and a girl waving me down. \n\nI pulled over. It was 3 am in the morning and these guys would have frozen if I kept going. I've always been helped out when I was down on my luck and try and pay it forward when I can. Besides- today you, tomorrow me, right?  Well, I park in front of the car and the girl runs up to greet me. With a shining flashlight right in my face. I couldn't see dick all. I heard a male voice yelling at something along the lines of \"get the fuck on your knees, give me keys\".\n\nI complied, and for a brief second I got some reprieve from the flashlight's blinding beam, this allowed me to see an ugly motherfucker pointing a gun at me as his cracked out looking female accomplice handing him off the flashlight as she took my keys. The blinding then resumed as, from what I can only assume, the woman then went and rummaged through my car as the guy shot verbal threats at me.\n\n\"you're going to fucking die tonight, bitch.\" - \"I'm going to shoot you right here.\" - \"You better have some good shit in your car\".\n\nFuck. My mind is racing. I'm not too proud to admit this - I started crying like a little bitch. Looking back on it, I'm pretty sure I pissed my pants. \n\nI could barely choke out a \"Please don't kill me, what do you want, I'll give anything\". He shut me up with a cold smack across my face, which only made me cry harder. I was in deep. I thought I was going to die. \n\n\"You know what I want, motherfucker?\"\n\"What?! I'll give anything, what is it? What is it? Fuck, don't kill me - please!\"\n\"I need about Three dollars fifty.\" . . .It was then that I realized that this mugger holding me up was not some roadside bandit but actually an 8 story tall plesiosaur from the paleolithic era. I yelled back, \"God dammit Nessie! I ain't given you no tree fiddy!\". This yelling spooked his accomplice who yelled back \"Ness! Let's get the fuck out of here!\" And before I knew it they had taken off in their original car.\n\nI cleaned myself up, changed my pants, and drove off back home.

{"body": "So, once I went out to the cockpit country in the middle of Jamaica. In those parts in the night, there is total darkness, and I mean total. No streetlights for miles, you're basically in the middle of a jungle aside from the dirt roads leading out of the place. My family was staying at a little cabin owned by a friend of my mother. The caretaker for the place is a sweet old lady, and earlier in the day she sat with me and told me of the history of the place. She told many stories of heroic battles between the maroons and the redcoats (British). However, later on she got to the more sinister tales.\n\n One of the most terrifying was that of the goat foot woman. In the day time, she would appear as a normal goat, always walking alone never with any others. Any real goats or animals would flee from the creature apparently seeing its true nature. However, as night fell the creature would transform into a woman, however one leg would stay as a goat. The 'woman' would therefore walk with a limp and walk near the edge of the road because the goat foot would be more comfortable in the grass. Typically, the creature appeared as an old woman. They would ask for help and act injured, but once close enough, would attack the person and tear out their heart - a diet of which kept them alive indefinitely.\n\nFast forward to the end of third day, it is a cloudless and the northerlies are coming in so the wind howls gently in that way that half comforts and half terrifies you. Around midnight I decided to go out to look at the moon and hopefully catch a glimpse of a few shooting stars, the house was on a small hill, so I took the dirt trail down through a little bamboo patch into a clearing where I could see the sky better. \n\nI was probably there for 20 minutes when I heard some faint footsteps along the trail, going past the clearing, down to the small town a few miles further on. At first I was a bit scared, expecting some murderer or thief. However, the moonlight illuminated the face of a remarkably attractive woman, I guessed about 22-ish. I said goodnight, and she glanced at me nervously, but didn't respond. I didn't find it strange, I supposed she probably thought I was a murderer or rapist, which was fair enough in the middle of the night.\n\nShe was wearing a long skirt and as she got closer to me, I noticed she was walking a bit strange, yet I couldn't pinpoint exactly what was wrong. \n\nWhen she was about 30 feet from me her she stumbled, and I glimpsed one of her feet, which had no shoe on it, another step later the next - all I saw was the shine of a small hoof. I was overcome with a wave of fear. She was now 10 feet from me, and getting closer. then, she stopped. I could hardly speak, I said 'Please' *pause, shaking* 'What do you want?' then I heard her speak, she said 'I need about tree fiddy'. That's when I realized, this ain't no goat-foot woman, its  the goddamn Lochness Monster!

{"body": "the dragons themselves? They're mythical creatures.  \n\nThe OP refers to a 400+ year old English translation (King James); in modern translations these words are rendered differently (jackals, 'the monster,' and such). There's also many references to Leviathan, a mythical sea creature and the word 'dragon' was used for him too (and no, he didn't need no tree fiddy).  \n\nPoetic effect and imagery isn't all metaphor. And poetry isn't all just effects and imagery. Any contextual examination of any of those passages with a modern translation of your choosing should make clear exactly what the passages are about.  \n\nBUT I know you can't defend 'the bible' on reddit and not know what you're talking about so here are 2 examples:  \n\nFirst (and the only example not in a poetry or prophecy book) Deuteronomy 32:33, \"Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.\" This is one snippet from Moses' Song. Imagine the ruler of a country getting up in front of everybody and beginning to speak (or even sing), \"Listen, you heavens, and I will speak;  \n hear, you earth, the words of my mouth.  \nLet my teaching fall like rain  \n and my words descend like dew,  \nlike showers on new grass,  \n like abundant rain on tender plants...  \n\nIts obvious verse-structure and mode of speech (not to mention the Torah is teaching embedded in STORY) clues us in this is a different type of literature. Moses continues in this style and praises God, criticizes Israel, points out how corrupt everybody has become, lays a guilt trip on Israel since they were the chosen ones, they were meant to destroy the sith not join them--oops, wrong story. Moses goes on to point out how good god was to everybody and they treated Him like a dick and missed the whole point and such.  \n\nI need to point out to 'speak prophetically' means to speak the words of God, and sure enough Moses begins to do this very thing, saying all sorts of things on behalf of God, and God is pretty pissed off at the nation of Israel in this passage, heaping calamities upon them for turning to things 'that were not god' and eventually we find (now in context) the 'dragon' passage:  \n\nThey are a nation without sense,  \n there is no discernment in them.  \nIf only they were wise and would understand this  \n and discern what their end will be!  \nHow could one man chase a thousand,  \n or two put ten thousand to flight,  \nunless their Rock had sold them,  \n unless the Lord had given them up?  \nFor their rock is not like our Rock,  \n as even our enemies concede.  \nTheir vine comes from the vine of Sodom  \n and from the fields of Gomorrah.  \nTheir grapes are filled with poison,  \n and their clusters with bitterness.  \nTheir wine is the venom of serpents,  \n the deadly poison of cobras.  \n\nand yes, 400 years ago English-speaking humans thought those last 2 verses translated better as \"their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter: Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.\"  \n\nSo are there really dragons in the bible? Yes. Kinda.  \n\nExample 2 (from Job 30) is good because it's from the book of Job which is an amazingly fantastic read. This is all written in Hebrew verse but it plays out like a courtroom drama. Context: Job is this super nice guy who loves god with all his heart but one day for kicks Satan comes to the throne of God and eventually says \"sure he loves you but what if you let me fuck him over a whole bunch?\" (I'm paraphrasing). God decides to let Satan fuck with him, Job loses his wealth, his home, his children, and his health. He shaves his head in mourning, sits down in ashes, his friends come and join him and he is so sad nobody says anything for a week.  \n\nJob complains about his situation and his friends say, \"Sure, but you sinned.\" Job maintains his integrity and claims he never sinned, but God just let this happen to him for some 'higher purpose' and even so, god gives and god takes away so blessed be the name of the Lord.  \n\nHis friends think he's an idiot, \"since when do the innocent suffer god's wrath?\" and such reasoning. The entire book is Job saying he did nothing wrong and waxing philosophical (or spiritual I suppose) on the matter and his friends accusing him of sinning and saying to just admit it. It's a humorous book, everybody's arguments and how they each handle an opposing point-of-view.  \n\nOne of Job's friends asks, \"How then can a mortal be righteous before God?\" Job launches into a 3+ chapter explanation and that is where we find the next 'dragon' in the bible. He acknowledges god as all-powerful but beseeches God to consider him now:  \n\n“I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer;  \n I stand up, but you merely look at me...  \n\n“Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man  \n when he cries for help in his distress.  \nHave I not wept for those in trouble?  \n Has not my soul grieved for the poor?  \nYet when I hoped for good, evil came;  \n when I looked for light, then came darkness.  \nThe churning inside me never stops;  \n days of suffering confront me.  \nI go about blackened, but not by the sun;  \n I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.  \nI have become a brother of jackals*,  \n a companion of owls.  \nMy skin grows black and peels;  \n my body burns with fever.  \nMy guitar is tuned to a minor key,  \n and my FB wall contains nothing but drama-queen selfies. OK I made this last line up.\n\nAgain, this 'jackals' line was rendered/translated as \"I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls,\" 400 years ago. In this passage Job is crying out to god trying to explain how he feels and to understand why he's meant to feel that way.  \n\nTo answer your question, in the first example 'their wine is the poison of dragons' is referring to the shitty attitude Israel had at that point in the story and in the second, Job has a few choice words for God about his situation, he feels like 'a brother to dragons,' sitting in ashes, sitting in the hot sun, mourning the loss of everything.  \n\nI think I am out of room to keep explaining these things but you get the idea: Any intelligent and sane person who reads any book in their language should be able to discern what is meant to be taken literally, figuratively, or understand if what they are reading is an ancient and translated text how it could be easily misunderstood.  \n\nAny skewered perspective on anything would seem odd. To me the oddest thing of all is people claiming to base their life on this book even if they haven't read it, or worse: they've trusted somebody else to teach them what it says and never bothered to check it themselves. Some even argue their specific English translation is the 'most correct,' as if that were a thing.  \n\ntl;dr - the bible doesn't say what you think it says or what somebody taught you it says, it says what it _actually_ says. Like, literally. And yes, there be dragons.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1388234981", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 203, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Kinda long, but not a creepypasta and not a tree fiddy, I promise, so I apologize for the length. I used to drive for DHL. I drove one of the vans, so I didn't have a ton of deliveries per drive. Sometimes it would just be one thing in the back. Made for some long boring drives because I'd have to go out of the way, delivering to farms and such out in BFE. \n\nOne morning my boss pulled me aside and told me I had one delivery for the day, but it was an odd one. I was supposed to take an empty casket out to one of the \"old town\" houses up in the hills, and do an \"install\" delivery which means we bring the package into the house. This is an area of town (Brockton, MA) that was popular with the rich people back in the early 20th century. Think Mr Burns' house in The Simpsons, and you've got the idea. \n\nI guess the old woman that lived there had purchased the casket before she died because she wanted to \"get her money's worth\" and display it or something. I don't know, eccentric shit. Anyway, no big deal. It was just a far delivery to a creepy old mansion out in the middle of nowhere. \n\nSo I get in and head out. Took about two hours to get there with the morning city traffic and the shitty country roads. Finally pull up, honk the horn, and jump out.  The house looks like where I imagine Miss Havisham living, all dilapidated and run down but clearly had been a palace at some point. Creepy but in a kind of pedestrian way. \n\nThe casket was on one of those paramedic deals with the accordion legs, and since it was empty it was light enough for one person to maneuver. As I'm unloading, I look up at the house and notice a few teenagers peeking out from the windows. Must be the grandkids spending some quality time with their insane grandma. Fun!\n\nFinally get the casket out, it's covered in wrap and blankets to keep from getting scratches. Wheel it up the service entrance and ring the bell. Wait. Ring again. Wait. Finally on the third or fourth ring this little old lady opens up. I tell her I'm here for Mrs So-and-so and I've got a delivery and is that you? Yes, she says, and gets this super happy look on her face. She tells me to go ahead and come on in.  \n\nI wheel it in and the place is like something out of Hoarders meets American Pickers. Filled with trash top to bottom but it's all old stuff, like from the first half of the 20th century. She tries making a path but is clearly struggling. I ask her if those kids I saw could come down and help. \n\n\"What kids?\"\n\nAhh fuck me, this is turning into the nope of all nopes. I say I saw some kids looking out at me. She says there aren't any kids in the house. Just then I hear a crash upstairs and this woman, she spins around fast as lightning and shrieks at the top of her lungs. Suddenly the lights go out and I hear footsteps EVERYWHERE. All around me. I start to flip out and I turn around to run...and I'm staring right into the face of the Burger King. From the commercials. And he starts singing a jingle for a Whopper in the highest falsetto you can imagine. Now I'm freaked out and crying but this jingle was so good and I wanted a Whopper like now. \n\nLong story short, they kidnapped me and they keep me in their sex dungeon. I can't get out but they let me get on Reddit and eat all the Whoppers I want. No fries though.

As such we were confined to a small wooden cabin whose walls i'll never forget. There was always a peculiar picture of a woman who I later found to be my great aunt, beatrice. But this is off topic, we were hiking through  the many hills and valleys of canada enjoying the scenery, when my Father remarked i was starting to grow facial hair, I was 14 at the time and my relationship with my Father had never been solid, in fact the whole point of the trip was to reconnect with each other. My mother and younger sister were all the way back at home in Brussels; Belgium.\n\nFor my Father to remark this was simply astonishing for me, he was finally recognizing me not just as a child anymore but as the young man i was growing into. I distinctly remember looking down at my feet observing the various insects and trickles of water below me, he then remarked he had to teach me to shave. This simply lit me up, finally my Dad wanted to do something with me, so a mere 5 hours later, after exhausting ourselves climbing, hiking and for the most part sitting and talking my Dad called me into the main hall where a single mirror faced the pine oak door. He gave me his razor, which was his fathers, who had served to fight the 1st and 2nd German army in Antwerp in WWII, in short it was a treasured heirloom.\n\nThe blade was razor shape and the hilt was wood grain, leading to a retracting metal blade, he taught me to shave my beard and keep my moustache under control. He told me I needed to stay my hand and keep calm when doing so, i ask him if there was anything else i needed to do, to which he replied \"I need money\", startled i remarked \"how much?\", he said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this time my suspicions were confirmed that my father was in fact an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era, the damn loch ness monster had followed me to newfoundland. \"God damn it nessie, you aint getting my tree fiddy\" I yelled as he swam off.

I asked her a few basic questions about hygiene and her family life that I usually start off with and all she did was sit there and breath very heavy.

As soon as the refrigerator was born, inventors and indeed many members of the physics community attempted to jump on board the refrigeration train by attempting to integrate refrigerant properties into any home appliances that could be found: notably stoves, cooktops and **ovens**.\n\nWhat does that mean exactly? Ovens could be used for part of the day to heat food in the way to which we are accustomed. But alternatively, they could be used to *cool* various foodstuffs, if kept inside long enough. This sounds like a cool concept, and right now we're seeing a lot of advances in instant-chill technology (note that this has almost nothing to do with the refrigerators of yore) that make the possibility of a food cooler/heater duo a distinct possibility. At the time, however, what quickly became apparent, based on the technological advancements that existed at the time, was that the two technologies were simply incompatible. Installing any type of refrigerant technology, even the installation of a main water line, significantly mitigated the effectiveness of commercially available ovens, to the point that the lowest, baseline temperature an oven might need to be set at in order to achieve the requisite heating properties that were available in standalone ovens was not 100, nor 200, but in fact tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388301176", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "For me, personally I have had only one awful relationship; in the latter part of my teen years, that being 19. For this relationship i realized later that I made a fatal error, once and never again, ill only focus on that one specific relationship.\n\nFor a social outcast such as myself, the actual concept of a relationship was alien and scary to say the least. I was always the kid who had his headphones in and was more focused on viral videos than establishing and form of human connection, however, during the latter part of may 2012 i was thrust into an awkward (for me) situation, to which I was unsure. A female (at least i believe she was) approached me and just started to talk to me, I knew her from school since we had sat next to each other for 2 lessons before our geography course finished. This, as sad as it sounds was my real first form of communication with any girl outside of my family.\n\nShe asked how i was doing, and then my interests and for once someone was taking an interest in me, it was intoxicating to say the least. So we talked, small talk mostly for a couple of months, sometimes speaking at school but mostly via text, skype or facebook. For a paranoid person such as myself, when the initial distrust settled I found someone really special. She was maori, (from new zealand) and lived in a suburb close to mine, sometimes she'd come over and hang out, or chill at the park.\n\nUnfortunately, This didnt last were i asked her out after knowing her for just over a year, i still remember it, It was at our college sports carnival, we were leaning over a fence and i said \"wouldnt it be funny if we dated\" and she giggled and said \"it'd be nice,\" this prompted a long serious conversation of the pro's and con's of a relationship, which eventuated in my impulsive, (in hindsight) stupid decision of asking her out. She agreed but, which was nice.\n\nI can't describe how good the first few months were, she was everything you looked for in a girl, she was pretty, smart, funny all of that. She couldn't spend get enough of me (not to boast) it was amazing, but as usual all good things come to an end. A number of relationship problems occurred and without giving anything away, things soured, we would clash unnecessary, we would start to disagree and then the killing blow, it was 3 am August 10th 2012, we were as usual having our late night/early morning phone call when it just all shattered. Her family was not very financially well off, neither was mine but there was still a considerable gap between us monetarily (not that that would ever matter at all) when she accused me of never supporting her, confused as I was I told her I would always support her, 100%. She simply brushed it off, not taking me seriously, so I told her \"what do you need from me, anything, anything at all and its yours,\" her reply broke my heart and finally unveiled my fatal mistake within our confines, she asked for money, i replied \"how much\" she responded \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this point that it dawned to me that the person on the other end of the phone was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era, the loch ness monster had successfully bamboozled me into dating her, \"God damn it nessie!\" I exclaimed, \"you're never getting my tree fiddy\" as i heard the sound of the waves crash against my nokia phone, and knew, she was gone...\n\n\nTL;DR: **I Didnt Know The Girl Well Enough***", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388304408", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

She gave me back all the stuff I got her during the course of our years together - this included jewelry. All of the stuff was put into a duffle bag, thrown under the staircase at my childhood home... never to be seen again... until the prices of gold skyrocketed. I moved on, moved away and that was that. Sometime later I flew back across the county to visit home. I found myself cleaning up my parents place, and stumbled across the bag. I promptly took it to the pawn shop for my return. Twist: the pawn shop was now under the management of her dickhead father, who purchased the place while I was away for school. Right off the bat he seemed pissed, but looked like a man possessed as he recognized his daughters old jewelry. He initially wouldn't take the items, but seemed to budge when I simply told him I want to do business and leave. Eventually he agreed to deal but only with a premium (fucked up dude thinks he deserves a cut since it was his daughter that led me to buy the gold in the first place). I reluctantly nodded and asked what he wants. He looked me in the eyes and paused for a moment before whispering \"...I'll need about tree fiddy\".

{"body": "Nobody would believe me if I told them, but I am a lover to both my banging spouse and her gorgeous 21 year old daughter. I showed up in their lives about 8 years ago after her deadbeat ex literally abandoned them and ran off to Florida changing his name and number to avoid child support. My stepdaugher and I did not get off to a great start when she was 13, but after a year of me dating her mother she I taught her how to swim and she joined the swim team. You could say it is how we bonded as she bloomed from a scared teenager into a wonderful young woman.\n\nWhen she was 19 years old my stepdaughter went off to college and came home after her first year at college. Around Christmas her boyfriend of 4 years had ditched her and blamed her for not abandoning her full ride from her swimming scholarship... He was pressuring her the entire time to stay local at community college. She deserved a lot better.\n\nThat summer my wife came to be one evening in early July and told me that our daughter 'K' was still really hurting and needed some male attention. She said 'K' confided in her a few months before how she wanted a man like daddy and confided even more she had a crush on me since she was 15. My wife and I have a healthy open relationship and at first I didn't know how to feel about the situation, but I can't say it didn't intrigue me. I thought about it for a couple days and came back to my wife asking how I would be open to the idea. Believe it or not – my wife played matchmaker and went to discuss it with 'K'! She even made a date night for us that Friday.\n\nI took her to dinner and it took an hour in to broach the subject, but she was comfortable with it and was worried I'd find her weird. I didn't and made sure she understood I loved her and only wanted to be sure it didn't ruin our relationship.\n\nThat night I took her back to our home and as I unlocked the door she hugged my back tightly. Bringing her in I was trembling too and we kissed sensually for the first time. She told me she loved me, that she needed her daddy, and I carried her to the guest room which has since become our common area for play as our marriage bed is off limits and her room is a bit too weird from all the childhood memories. It is hard to explain.\n\nPeople really wouldn't believe it if I told them. We've discussed what she plans to do if she gets serious with a guy and she confides she does not wish to stop and they will just have to accept it. Talking to my wife about our daughter moving back in when she graduates next year she has been positive, but that conversation went bad. She said, “R, there is just one thing I need...” “What?” I asked. “...I need about tree fiddy.” That is when I noticed she wasn't a woman at all, but 9 story crustacean from the paleozoic era. I was like, “Goddamn you, LNM! I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!” She then slid back into the sea and swam away.\n\nOur relationship will never be the same.

Monster groups you encounter are based on your level to provide a tougher challenge and you might never survive Arnika Road.\n\n\n- You can cut a hundred hours off that playtime if you download a \"Fast Combat\" mod.\n\n\n- Sleep with the succubus when you're given the option late in the game. Actually, you probably shouldn't do that, but it has interesting consequences.\n\n\n- Save OFTEN. You will die a LOT (this is not a bad thing), especially when you explore off the beaten path and run into something like the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n\n- Make a fairy ninja!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388369925", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "score": 38, "controversiality": 0}

Half the time he was looking down at what he was doing, half the time he was looking up at the others already tied down in their chairs. He took the roll of duct tape in his hand, and fed out several inches as he simultaneously fitted it around the wrists and twisted the tape by twirling around the roll. Over. Under. Through. Over again. Under and back around. John watched him work, from one person to the next, to the next, all around the circle.\n\n\"You like what you see?\"\n\nIt took John a moment to realize the man was addressing him directly, since his agile fingers continued to work as he spoke through his ski mask.\n\n\"I'm just...never mind,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"What, what? Say something or don't ya son of a bitch. Spit it out, for Christ's sake.\"\n\n\"I was just, I don't know, zoning out I guess. Watching you put tape around my employees' wrists.\"\n\nHe lifted his head back and laughed heartily, but not so heartily that he stopped working. \"You know why you gotta twist it like this?\" the man said. \"It's all about *tensile strength.* See duct tape is a damn useful material, damn useful. But schmucks don't know the half of it, especially those Hollywood assholes. My friend here showed me one last week, what was the name of that?\"\n\nA fat man in the corner holding a handgun with a pantyhose around his head nodded slightly. \"Firewall.\"\n\n\"What a piece of garbage that was!\" yelled Duct Tape. \"Besides the godawful story, although no disrespect to Harrison Ford, the worst part was how they restrained that family. Didn't know what they was doin', just slapped some tape on em like they was, like they was a kindergarten project!\" He laughed again, while Handgun remained silent. \"You gotta twist it like this to prevent tearing, and it turns this stuff into *rope.* Nothing short of a knife's gettin' through this here.\"\n\n\"You're horrible men!\" Michelle yelled suddenly through her tears. John's stomach sank. He had noticed her crying, but had hoped that she would stay quiet in her chair. \"You're horrible parasites that, that leech off of hardworking people like us! You're not even people, you're *animals!*\" She sunk into deeper and heavier sobs.\n\nDuct Tape nodded to Handgun, who nodded back. Without saying a word, Handgun strolled over to Michelle and fired a round into each of her kneecaps. Her bloodcurdling screams reverberated off the walls, long and sustained like a pipe organ, yet high pitched and labored.\n\n\"*You monsters!*\"\n\nIt was David this time, her boyfriend. He was one of the last person yet to be restrained. He clutched the sides of his chair, shaking with rage, his face scarlet red with sweat on his forehead. Tears began to form as well. \"*She runs! She's a runner! You sick bastards!*\" And as if some invisible chains had been broken, he emerged from his plastic office chair and ran at Handgun like a rabid coyote.\n\nWithout emotion, without hesitation or remorse, Handgun pointed his gun at David and sent a round through his skull. Blood splattered the wall and several people behind him as he fell forward onto a desk, the last of his velocity extinguished as his corpse rolled onto the floor, his eyes open and glassy. Dead.\n\nMichelle and several other people screamed. Others cried. John sat in shock, his face whiter than a sheet. \"Why....why do you do this? Why do you *do this!?*\"\n\n\"Why does anyone do anything Mr. Dawson? Money, you asshole!\" yelled Duct Tape from the other side of the room, angrily wiping blood off himself.\n\n\"How much money will it take until you stop doing this?! How much will be enough. How much money could a person need?!\" John screamed, before spitting in both of their directions. Just as Handgun was about to raise his pistol a third time, Duct Tape signaled to him to stand down. He dropped his roll and strolled over to him, his grey eyes sneering through his ski mask. He walked closer, and took a knee before John, whose heart was beating furiously and was trembling uncontrollably.\n\n\"Mr. Dawson,\" he began. \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was then when John Dawson realized that these two burglars were 50 foot tall crustaceans from the Paleozoic era.

My father was working full time, living in Detroit at the time working as a independent business owner wasn’t ideal, money was tight. After school I would walk home and help my dad run the restaurant, it wasn’t too bad of a place, in a fairly nice part of town (near the renaissance building for any residents), we served fairly basic italian food, but had always gotten by. With the medical bills continuing to build up, I began to notice more and more stress being put on both of parents.\n\nBeing an only child, I felt extremely alone throughout the entire experience, my dad had to be entirely focused on work, spending the few hours of free time he could find every week visiting my mother. I often overheard the doctor speaking to my father in the hallway of the hospital, usually about recommended treatment paths, but as time progressed they began to talk about “expectations” and “preparations”.  \n\nBeing only 14 I really didn’t understand the gravity of the situation until i began to see drastic changes in my mothers appearance, a mothers face is something that every child loves and knows. Her cheeks began to sink in, her eyes lost their shine, her lips were thin and dry. I could hardly recognize her as time progressed. I remember going into her room, near the end, she was visibly week, her breath was ragged and dry. As i sat down next to her she began to speak, motioning to the other side of the room. I leaned closer to her, asking what she needed, her dry lips formed the words “I need about Tree Fiddy”  Now it was around this time that I realized that she was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

{"body": "Ahh, the first time I sent a dick pic. I remember it pretty vividly actually which is weird. It was sometime in Autumn. It was getting colder, the days were getting shorter and I had gone to see a movie with some friends. By the time I got home, which was around 5 or 6 PM it was already getting dark. Doing what I normally do when I get home, I went into my room and sat at my computer. I pulled open a couple of tabs, one of which was Facebook. While I was browsing through on of the other tabs, which was probably Reddit, the Facebook one had pinged. Someone had messaged me and it turned out to be my crush. We would talk often online. I said Hi and being the geeks that we are the conversation turned from pleasantries to talking about mutual fandoms we enjoyed. We talked about Harry Potter and about how Hufflepuff is the most boring house in Hogwarts. We talked about Star Wars and Doctor Who, about the Death Star and the TARDIS and a bunch of other things. We argued whether Han or Greedo shot first. This went on for a bit before I had to go eat supper. I came back about an hour and a half later our conversation resumed. From then on we talked to each other about school. Which classes we were having trouble with, we helped each other with some homework, we made fun of some teachers and she gossiped a bit. By now it was nearing midnight and since we talked about gossip, it quickly turned to relationships. When I think back on it I find it funny how quickly topics change. She was talking about her ex and how much of an ass he was, I sat there typing a way little anecdotes and what not. Then she asked me if I had ever had a girlfriend. I admitted and said I had not. She said that that was unfortunate since I'm a great guy. At this point, my stomach was filled with butterflies. I thought that this was her way of dropping hints that she liked me. Then she pretty much stated that I was virgin which I also admitted. I asked her if she was too and she said that yes, she was. She then said that she's never even seen a penis besides the diagrams in health class. That's when I did. I have no idea what I was thinking, all I said was \"Hold on\" and I whipped out my camera. I snapped a picture and did all that I had to do to send it over Facebook. I still can't believe I pressed send. The next couple of minutes seemed like an eternity, I sat there practically numb. My stomach was twisted in a knot waiting for her to say something. Anything really. Then she answered. \"Not bad ;)\" was what I got and my god it was the biggest relief of my life. It was incredibly unexpected and also raised my self esteem considerably. Although, then she sent something even more unexpected. She asked \"Do you want to see mine?\". I was blown away by this. I was stunned, I was at a loss for words. I hesitantly wrote back \"sure\". Then  her response appeared on the screen. \"Okay I'll show you, but I'm gonna need about treefiddy\".

As we finished, my friend told me that he had some business to attend to in Dublin, so I said my goodbyes and wished him well. As he was walking back towards the house he stopped and turned a 180, then walked up to me and leaned in close and said, \"Hey Nappyheaded, it is a terribly long walk to Dublin. Could you spare me a small amount of cash?\" It caught me off guard because his peace mission was a paid position, and I thought that he would still have some money left. At any rate I agreed, and asked him how much he would need for a bus ride into Dublin.

You understand that the Big Bang describes the EXPANSION of the singularity, right????  The singularity existed if even a fraction of a second or an eternity before...by definition.\n\nOur math cannot get to the singularity itself it was just seemingly there.\n\nTHE BIG BANG IS AN EXPANSION!!!  Of a singularity.  In the singularity was all energy and matter in the universe...\n\nYou are just catastrophically ill informed.\n\nYour entire argument hinges on this so I understand the hesitation.  But you are wrong, plain and simple.\n\nYou are still switching the burden of proof...\n\n&gt;This is an assertion. Assertions require evidence. Please back up your claim that we KNOW that matter did not come into existence. Otherwise, please retract your statement, plead ignorance, and we can go from there.\n\nPlease educate yourself.  Please.  I gave you a link above.  Look it up on Wikipedia as well.  The Big Bang can state nothing about the singularity.\n\nLiterally all our math breaks down right now...\n\nPlease, to take a page from your book, link me to the article that conclusively proves matter originated at the Big Bang, which is what you are claiming.  I'll wait...\n\n&gt;... with the mathematical and physical properties necessa\n\nSpecial pleading.  Yet you posit an even more complex God that just is.\n\nIf you say he's simple, please define simple.\n\nHere's where the shifting of the goal posts will happen.\n\nI just demonstrated that the initial configuration of the singularity was the simplest version of the universe we know of.  Now you being in physical laws.  What makes them complex?  Why can't they just be like God allegedly is?\n\nYOU DON'T GET THAT EVERY QUESTION YOU ASK OF ME MUST BE ANSWERED FOR GOD!!!\n\n&gt;There is no empirical evidence to show that matter or the quantum vacuum is eternal. Not loop-quantum cosmology, not Hartle-Hawking, not any cyclic-model. If you disagree, please provide evidence or argument.\n\nHonestly?  Do you not understand what \"I don't know\" means?\n\nYOU made the claim that they aren't eternal, not me.  The burden is on YOU!  Stop shifting it.\n\nMine is the actual true answer for our current knowledge.\n\nPlease link the paper that proves they aren't eternal.  Remember I'm not making a claim.  I am rebutting yours ;)\n\n&gt;My ultimate argument doesn't hinge on whether the Big Bang signaled the origin of matter or not doesn't - the point is matter had an origin. (if you are going to say it's eternal, please provide evidence). \n\nWow, reread what you wrote.\n\nPlease provide proof that matter is not eternal.  My answer is I don't know, I have other POSSIBILITIES.  \n\nJust link me to the proof.  Don't claim it, prove it.\n\n&gt; The point is that with our current evidence, the Big Bang is the best explanation we have for the origin of matter. \n\nLol, no.  It was an expansion.  You are catastrophically misinformed.\n\n&gt;Fine, but since the universe is a contingent entity, there must be some necessary cause which spawned it into existence. You now must argue that either the universe is necessarily existing, or posit some other necessary cause which could bring it into existence.\n\nSigh.  In alethic modality, you must know C0 with assurance.\n\nThis is a common misunderstanding of possible possibilities and actual possibilities.\n\nYou have added in being.  You haven't defined universe.  Does universe include a quantum cosmology?  What prevents that from being necessary.\n\nRemember you are CLAIMING it isn't.  Please prove it.  I am raising objections.  My objections illustrate your unfulfilled burden of proof.\n\nLearn more about S5 modal logic and C0 please.\n\n&gt;God is a necessary being. He is self-causing. This is a lo\n\nSo what?  Prove the soundness of it.\n\nArguments must be valid AND sound to be logical.\n\n&gt; have been defending my premises. You say yourself \"it may very well be self-causing.\" This is an assertion. I am justified in asking you to back it up.\n\nSigh, no.  It is an objection to your premises.  If your premises are true you can easily link me to the proof that my assertions are wrong.\n\nSaying we both don't know so you are right is a classic argument from ignorance.\n\nYou are still trying to switch the burden of proof, sorry, no go.\n\n&gt;You are obviously a pretty intelligent person, so you recognize that atheists bear a burden of proof for the statement that \"God doesn't exist\" right?\n\nExcept my stance is that I see no justifiable reason to accept God as real, not that he doesn't exist.  Same as Bigfoot, Loch Ness monster, alien abductions, etc.\n\nI bear the burden of explaining why the arguments used for God are invalid.  Please look up the FAQ for definitions of atheism used here.\n\nYou can get into a semantic argument if you want, fact is the definition of my stance is clear.  Please just address it.\n\n&gt;If you are going to knock down all my arguments with simply saying \"we don't know for sure,\" you're merely pleading ignorance. But if you are going to say \"God cannot be the answer,\" you bear the burden of proof for that statement.\n\nExcept I'm not saying that...I am making you prove your case.  God very well might be the answer.  Not an omnipotent, omniscient, omni benevolent deity.  That is impossible, but a deity of some kind.\n\n&gt;I'm confident that you are going to be very upset with me for all of that, so please tell me which one you want to discuss and we can go from there.\n\nYou need to go through my comment history.  I am well versed in all of these...however...I am an evolutionary biologist ;)\n\nGranted I specialize in mammalian evolution, but I am well well well versed in the Cambrian explosion.  \n\nSo please provide the evidence.  If you could link me to a find of a bunny or squirrel, or elephant, at the Cambrian level that would be awesome.\n\nAlso, please describe the atmospheric condition at the time, specifically oxygen content and it's relation to ozone.  Also, how long do you think the Cambrian explosion lasted?\n\n You can choose another for fun if you like.  It might be more fair.\n\n&gt;But if you keep coming to me and saying \"we just don't know yet,\" you need to give a reason for your incredulity. \n\nThis isn't my first rodeo.  Please provide a claim and I will gladly discuss it ;). More than gladly actually.  Who knows you may provide an argument I have not heard.  You might even convince me of your stance.  Based on the four options you listed though...it is doubtful.\n\n&gt;Offer a reason why some alternative theory might be correct! \n\nNO!!!!!  That is not how crime scene investigation works...at all.  It is not how science works, or the court system.\n\nYou are claiming a scenario.  Back it up.  I will gladly go over the likely errors in your evidence.  That in no way means I need to present an alternate.\n\n&gt;So i you are going to say \"the quantum vacuum could exist a -temporally,\" give me a reason to think so. You h\n\nNO!!!!  You don't get this.  Your analogy is flaws.. \n\nIt's like there are 20 likely suspects.  I'm asking how to differentiate between the suspects.  You are just saying one is right.  I point out why you're wrong on THAT suspect given the reason and you ask me to tell you who actually committed the crime...that is ABSURD and you know it!\n\n&gt;They require existence and yes, some substance, if we take substance to mean \"essential nature or essence,\" but not matter\n\nWhat in the world is that?  I mean honestly what is it?  If you could show it to me or link me to a paper that demonstrates it is anything but a claim I would appreciate it.\n\nHow does the process of thought work for it?  Is there energy transfer when it thinks?\n\nLet's take creation.  What does it mean for essential nature or essence to create?  Can you demonstrate this for me?  Remember you are claiming it.  You asked me to prove quantum cosmology, yet ignored it as an objection on possibility.  So...please don't shift the burden and prove what you are saying here.\n\n&gt;The hard problem of consciousness is still very much alive and well.\n\nIf you could demonstrate consciousness apart from a material brain of some kind that would be good evidence that consciousness exists independent of a brain.  Please link me to a paper that proves that.\n\nEdit:\n\nBtw, from the Wikipedia article on the Big Bang:\n\n\"The Big Bang theory does not provide any explanation for the initial conditions of the universe; rather, it describes and explains the general evolution of the universe going forward from that point on.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388481525", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I have a lot if im honest, but none would be worse than the party I hosted for my brother roberts 11th birthday party. Being that he is my only sibling and more or less my responsibility I decided it was only fair to host him a celebration. 2 weeks prior to the event I undertook the responsibility of planning and preparing, I checked with my mother if she was up to having a party hosted as it had been quite recently that she had divorced my father. The toll it took on her was unbearable, she had enough issues without having to host a birthday party, so i roused her from bed on the 2nd of June and told her my plan. She agreed\n\nSo with my mothers consent i began the frenzied rush of organizing the celebration. I went to my local cheesecake shop to look for cake based candidates, the chocolate as usual won, linda helped me out, if you dont know who linda is she works at the cheesecake shop. I took it home only to find out my brother was lactose intolerant, \"Damn it Dapper-P96!\" my mother exclaimed, \"He's your brother! how don't you know this!\" this prompted a trip to my local cake-shop then for a chocolate mud, free of lactose. However this was only 1/5 of the planning done, invitations were next. I opted for Disney \"cars\" themed invites, with a cute little mater on front, i baby my brother i guess in hindsight he wasn't impressed.  Neither were his 40 little chums from hell who ransacked our house later\n\nHaving finished the invites and cake i moved to decoration preparation, i visited the local \"spotlight\" store to find supplies and after blowing $35.75 i retreated home, to the questions and remarks from my broter hoping he would be able to celebrate his birthday. It was at this point I felt a surge of happiness for my preparation, the recent divorce had not been kind to him, and with his personality and traits it was only natural he blamed himself. So i kept going on, despite cynical remarks from my mother, which i ignored. In the flash of an eye the day of the party arrived, invites check, cake check, decorations check, gift (which I picked up earlier in the week, which was a 45$ nintendo gift card :)) check, entertainment fuck... Somehow i forgot to get entertainment, no performer no music nothing. Now maybe you can begin to see where exactly my mistake occurred. In a frenzy I remembered one of my Dads old friends did party entertainment, (he did some routine or such) so I called him up and after negotiating a price of 50, flipping $50 for half an hour (i know right) he agreed to come down.\n\nSo my brothers friends arrive, all eager eyed, sticky fingered and all that  anxiously waiting for something colorful or loud or simply fun to direct their hyped up bloodstreams towards. After trying to get them to calm down (with my brother looking embarrassed as all hell) the entertainment arrived, in short a fat 40 year old doing crappy magic tricks, but hey better than nothing. Unfortunately problems arose when I went to pay him, I gave him the agreed upon amount ($50) when he refused, confused I inquired as to why, the asshole said it wasnt enough so in an intense debate in front of a group of 11-12 year old children I finally screamed \"well how much do you want!\" to which he replied 'I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was sometime around this point I realized that the entertainment I had hired was an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era, the loch ness monster had successfully hired himself out at my brothers party. \"God damn it nessie!\" I exclaimed, \"You're never getting my tree fiddy!\" And as he swam off, the waves splashing my face I wondered, was he involved in my parents divorce? was he actually a magician? would he ever get my tree fiddy? These questions I pondered as I watched the sea, the moment lost in time, like tears in rain..\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR **I planned my brothers birthday party awfully**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388484492", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
