{"body": "The perfect RPG is like ... the Loch Ness Monster or Utopia. It does not exist. People like different things and look for different experiences in roleplaying games. It is impossible to to make a game, that suits them all.\n\nSo, how would an rpg system look like, that suits my personal needs perfectly? \n\n- First of all, it would have to support different genres. I would be able to play sci-fi, fantasy, space opera and many more genres with it. Just like GURPS, Savage Worlds or Dream Park.\n\n- Second, it should be \"classic\". No artsy-fartsy-playerempowerment. Gamemasters must roll dice as do all the players. There could be gadgets involved, if that fits the style.\n\n- Three, it should be easy to learn and play with. I don't mind having some rules, but systems like Pathfinder, 13th Age, Rolemaster, Eclipse Phase, Hero and the like really make me angry, because games like D&amp;D Gamma World, Talislanta 3rd, Warhammer 2nd, Dream Park, etc. offer similar gaming Experience with much less effort. A simple mechanism should be used for nearly everything. Talislanta 3rd sets the benchmark for me here.\n\n- Four, I want to be inspired. Think of rules like the dragon die from Dragon Age, or the Alpha Mutations from Gamma World. The random galaxy tables from Stars Without Number work, too. This is, what makes a game feel different, inspires and emphasizes the gaming aspect of an rpg. I like that a lot. D&amp;D Gamma World is my star here.\n\n- Five, I want player characters to be unique. Not just in their attitude or background story but also rules-wise. Classes create niches, that give a purpouse. But I don't need classes. There are different aproaches to that like being seen in the Storyteller games. Iron Kingdoms and Gamma World offer a mix of classes, which I really liked. \n\n- Six, I don't want to mess around with meta-gaming. When playing, I want to feel and play with the character and to a certain degree even \"be\" the character. Metagaming like being seen in Fate is a huge turn off for me.\n\n- Seven, I want that game to be supported. Give me stuff to be inspired from! Give me stuff to implement in my campaign! Pathfinder is the benchmark to beat here. \n\n- Eight, (remember, it should be a perfect system) give me great artwork and solid hardcover books! I love the style from Pathfinder, Eclipse Phase or Warhammer. \n\n- Nine, as a GM I want to have little effort to create adventures and NPCs. I want that game to be mine, that can easily be adapted, changed and houseruled as I see fit. Cinematic Unisystem sets the benchmark here. Hard to beat.\n\n- Ten, it suits my taste. Some things just don't feel rigt. Really. Savage Worlds looks like a great game, but I just don't like it. Be it the shaken rules or whatever. Aside from that example, I prefer roll over systems and I try to avoid pool-systems. I don't like gauss-curves. \n\nThat would be the unobtanium of my roleplay-experience. The utopia of my gaming, never to be reached.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388580054", "subreddit": "rpg", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Why are you believing me? \n\nI am talking to you. Whoever the people are that you are referring to (assuming they are even real)... I do not know them and I am not talking to them. Do you not understand how and why other human beings believe the things that they do?\n\nI have no desire to waste hours or days researching who these people are, especially considering that if you believe the ridiculous things that you believe because of them, then the source itself is already suspect. You're not the only mentally ill person out there, and likely they are as well (or just frauds who get rich writing crackpot books about such things... e.g. Alex Jones).\n\nYour response isn't even typical: if speaking to someone who was not mentally ill but who believed incredible things, they tend to try to defend the claim on their own. They don't immediately resort to \"don't believe me, believe these people you've never heard of and will need to spend at least 120 hours reading about before you can even make a solid judgement!\". The only exception I am aware of are fundamentalist Christians, who do the same thing while referring you to the Bible or the writings of various theologians...\n\nAnd quite frankly, I feel like lumping them in with you, as \"mentally ill\".\n\n&gt; You think I'm \"mentally ill\" for giving these people the benefit of the doubt and hearing them out?\n\nNo, I'm hearing you out now. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nYou're mentally ill for believing the things that you do after having heard them.\n\nAlso \"benefit of doubt\" is something that non-skeptical people do. Just a nitpick.\n\n&gt;  The truth isn't going to come from the government.\n\nOf course not. I'm not suggesting that you believe them either. Don't pretend that I'm trying to force some false dichotomy on you.\n\n&gt; The truth\n\nNotice how you keep saying \"the truth\" instead of something like \"this truth\"? That's because you've elevated it to some ultimate level. No longer \"a truth\", but *The Truth* with a capital T. And if you don't have a capital T on it yet, you're not far from doing so.\n\nThis is something the mentally ill do. Well, them and the fundamentalist Christians. \n\n&gt; And these Whistleblowers\n\nThe term \"whistleblower\" holds no special meaning for me. I understand it, I use it in narrow context, but even if what you said was true \"whistleblower\" would be a bad choice of words. I think you prefer it though because it holds some emotional meaning to you.\n\n&gt; Ever heard of William Cooper? He said that the NSA was collecting every single electronic communication in the world and he was mocked and laughed at and called a lunatic.\n\nThat claim isn't particularly far-fetched. Even those who objected did so on narrow technical grounds (no one has the technology to do that yet) or on ethical grounds (sure the government has done sketchy things in the past, but they've got their limits). Lunatic? No, they called him a liar or an exaggerator. \n\nThere's no reason for you to believe me, but even prior to the recent revelations, I wouldn't have thought the man was a lunatic for making such a claim, nor would I have immediately dismissed it.\n\nDo you see no difference between his claim and the ones you're making? His claims were theoretically possible in that most or all experts would have agreed that the technology was merely challenging and not impossible. His claims were ethically possible in that we know that some governments have attempted far worse.\n\nYou're talking about bad science fiction as if it's real. Perhaps the real world isn't interesting enough for you that you have to delude yourself about chrononauts and whatever other gibberish it is you hold dear.\n\n&gt; People that seek the truth always look fucking crazy because the TRUTH is fucking crazier \n\nThe truth is pretty boring. Murder, oppression, genocide... these things aren't crazy. They're just sad. Corruption, abuse, embezzlement... not crazy, just disgusting.\n\nTime travel? Star Trek and portals to other galaxies and hiding the existence of aliens from the public? Not crazy, but only because psychiatry dislikes using the word for fear that it causes stigma.\n\nDo you know why people are more sympathetic to those who believe in Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster?\n\nIt's because people intuitively understand other human beings and by extension, which conspiracies are plausible and which are not. So if some crazy fucktard wants to think Sasquatch or chupacabra is real, they can be patronized. But when you say that the government has time travel technology and then spout off the plot to some low-budget WB channel science fiction television show... it just irks the shit out of us. \n\n&gt; I'm interested in the truth, I'm interested in seeking the truth and finding out how the world REALLY works. \n\nYou're not very good at it. \n\n&gt; And the way it works is so far past what you could ever imagine that it seems crazy to you.\n\nIt does not in fact work like this. You have a child's conception of the universe, and a Hollywood scriptwriter's conception of physics. Even for crackpot conspiracy theorist, you're on the lowest rungs of stupidity. Couldn't you at least come up with something fun and interesting, telling us about how Wolfram's theories on automata imply that something akin to magic would be possible? Maybe throw in some EU ideas on physics, and how NASA was holding back deep space photography that proves em was responsible for the dark matter discrepancies? \n\nThe shit you keep spewing isn't even worth of a Weekly World News article, and their shit was so dumb that they eventually went bankrupt and closed up shop.

We started talking to a group of sexy guys, who invited us to a rooftop hot tub disco. Chelsea got so drunk, she did a cringeworthy **strip tease** to the newly-released song by the Village People, “YMCA”.

Chelsea sat back in her chair with a smug look on her face, then sternly looked at her unlucky friends with a gaze more intense than a thousand suns.

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you.\n\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\n\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\n\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him. \n\nThey were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak. \n\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\n\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\n\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\n\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her. \n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.\n\ntl;dr: Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388767937", "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I don't see the point in becoming an all-out atheist, however. \n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing.\n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\n&gt; Whether there is a god or not, there is, in principle, no way of not just knowing, but even assessing the likelihood of his/her/its existence.\n\nIt very much depends on the definition or characteristics of the god in question. \n\nMany definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388772319", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

After about a week of work doing a few houses in the neighborhood she noticed and signed up for her house to get serviced to. It seems she wanted a little bit more than the driveway serviced /cleaned because one day she invited me in. It was winter (obviously, given the situation) and she only had on a robe. For a guy my age people might wonder why i would find someone like her attractive, but she was busy, and i was /am very into milfs. Long story short, we had kinky sex (including some butt stuff). Unfortunately after a few times i regretted this because she started asking for money. It wasn't much and i thought it a bit weird. First she asked for a dollar and i thought that was extremely odd (since it was so small)  and i gave it to her (in both ways). After a few more times this amount kept rising. Eventually i said no and she ripped off her fake skin revealing that she was the lochness monster and asked for 3.50. I said no and she asked me again, then I said \"That's right, I ain't givin' you no tree-fiddy, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!\"  I had to leave her.

I got a call from a girl that went to our school, let's say her name is Kelly. Kelly is a solid 8/10. We always flirted, but never had a chance to have sex. I decided to try my luck. I told her to come over a good time. She came in with a surprised face, she said \"I didn't know that you had friends over blackmamba329....\" I said, \"Oh I thought I mentioned it, but I hope it's fine.\" She then said, \"Oh it's fine alright. *winks*.\" After a few more drinks, we started to initiate the love making and thungs are getting hot and heavy and decide to take it upstairs. It was my first foursome, so I was a bit nervous. But everything seemed to be going well. She was in her bra and panties and us guys were in our boxers. I led her upstairs when she said that she needs to talk before we start. I asked her, \"What's up?\" She said, \"Well....\" I thought she was backing out of this. \"Well what?\" \"Well, I need some things...\" \"What do you mean?

{"body": "About 5 years ago, I was out in California visiting a good friend who I had met in business school. We had gone our separate ways after we graduated and kind of lost contact, but he (who we'll call John) called me one day and invited me out to visit. He offered to pay for my plane ticket and everything because I had just started a business and was pretty low on money at the time. \n\nWhen I got there, I immediately realized why John had sprung for a round trip ticket for me. He had gotten a high up position at Goldman Sachs and had hit the jackpot. He had the nice car, a drop dead gorgeous wife (who may or may not have done some modeling for one of the biggest lingerie companies in the world), and the nice, if not overtly lavish, house up in the hills. \n\nAs soon as we dropped my stuff off at the house, John and I went for some drinks and clubbing. So here's where it starts to get kinda fucked up. At one of the clubs we went to, John asked me if I had ever done coke. Having never done anything but a little bit of pot and acid (two times) in college, I obviously said no and asked why. He said he was getting some, and asked me if I'd do it with him. I expressed a little bit of concern, and considering I had a family (wife and two kids) back home I told him that my partying days were behind me. But he insisted, saying \"I do it all the time, it's not a big deal.\" I reluctantly agreed, but in doing so I made him promise that we would leave his car at the club and take a cab home, considering we were already fairly drunk. We did a couple lines in the bathroom of the club, and John immediately says it's time to go. I'm fine with this, and honestly kind of relieved he wants to go hit the sack now and stay in for the remainder of the night, but what I don't realize is that John had his keys in hand and as soon as he ran out the door started heading for his car.\n\nHe hops in the car and I'm thinking to myself, \"How much more fucked up could this get?\" and get in shotgun just in the hope that I can coax him out of driving and convince him that we should call a cab like we agreed. But before I can say a single word he is out of the parking lot and skidding into the still packed LA night traffic. We make it not half a mile before we crash head on with oncoming traffic. I look over to check on John and see his bloodied face, presumably from hitting his head into the steering wheel (this was an older car, and thus no airbags). Before I know it I hear sirens, and the cops have arrived. At this point I don't even care that I was in a car with someone who was drunk driving and high on coke, or that I'm drunk and high on coke, I'm just freaking out because John isn't breathing normally and his face looks pretty fucked up. So a police car pulls up, and a cop starts walking towards the car. I roll down my window and wave for him to come to my side because John is unresponsive, and when the cop walks up to my side of the car, all he says is, \"I'm gonna need some tree fiddy.\" It was at this point that I realized the cop was not a normal cop, but a 7 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. The policeman proceeds to help me get out of the car, and as he does so, I turn around, look straight at John, with his bloodied face and wheezy breath, and say, \"I told you so.\"\n\nJohn ended up alright. He had to sell the house to pay for the damages in the accident in addition to being sued by the people he crashed into. His wife then left him and took almost half of his net worth. Guy shoulda had a prenup...\n\nTLDR; Crazy night with an old friend who got super rich, I say I told you so to his unconscious body after an incident", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388898674", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I should use a throwaway for this reply, but here goes.  Serious reply:\n\nI was just out of college and staying on the floor of my best buddy's room in a house he shared with several friends.  I had been pretty sexually active at this point, somewhere like 20 partners, and my bro had only been with a couple of girls.  His high school girlfriend and one other girl, a one night stand.  His high school girlfriend and I were also friends and they had been broken up for a while but you could tell he still loved her.  When she found out I had graduated and was crashing at my buddy's place she came over to visit.  She stayed the night with him in his bed and I was on the floor.  No sex happened as far as I could tell.\n\nThe next morning he had to go to work and I slept in until after he left.  his ex woke me up that afternoon and we got to talking and she confessed that she'd always had a crush on me.  Now in high school she was really cute but she wasn't my type and had gained a bunch of weight since then. I was basically bored and she was offering to fuck me and I stupidly agreed.  I remember I told her we couldn't because we didn't have any condoms and she drove to the store to get them.  She was so excited.\n\nWhen she got back with the condoms I had realized that this was a very bad idea.  I wasn't into her physically and clearly my best friend was still in love with her even though they were long broken up, so even though she and I had a good friendship and flirted a ton I knew I shouldn't.  I told her basically that but she played a trump card:\n\nWe had had sex before in a threesome with my buddy and she basically told me she had to have the real thing.  There was some mumbo jumbo about how I hand't been very good in the threesome because it was hella awkward and while talking about it she'd gotten really close and was playing with my junk and as soon as she could went down on me.\n\nSo I said fuck it and we started having sex on the floor of my buddy's bedroom and it was awful.  As soon as I went inside her she moaned into my ear (btw, here is where I would insert the tree fiddy if I was so inclined but I am **not that guy, reddit**), \"I've always wanted you.\".  That was the thing that utterly killed it for me.\n\nI soldiered on and came quickly.  She kept moaning and trying to get me to look her in the eye and I just couldn't.  When I finished she clutched me to her and started to say something along the lines of, \"I love you,\" and the regret hit me like an avalanche.  The sex was horrible, the feelings were horrible, the awkwardness of having literally nowhere else to stay afterwards was horrible.  Her attempt to blow me in the living room after my buddy had gone to bed later that night was just amazingly awful.  This was over a decade ago and I **STILL** feel bad about it.\n\nThere you go.

{"body": "Join us over at /r/bourbon and /r/scotch. If you're gonna be drinking bourbon, know that there are three main categories. Low rye, high rye, and wheated. This refers to the types of grain the bourbon is made with. Since all bourbon has to be made with atleast 51% corn, it is naturally a sweet drink, but by adding different grains to the mash you can get different flavors. A low rye bourbon will be sweeter, most likely with flavors of caramel, toffee, vanilla, maple syrup, etc. Rye adds a bit of a spicy/floral/minty kind of flavor to the bourbon. High Rye bourbons will still have a lot of caramel/vanilla ish flavors, but they will also have any number of mint/baking spices/baked goods/menthol flavors. Wheaters are not very common (the only really readily accessible ones are Makers Mark, Rebel Yell, and the Weller's... definitely not any of the Van Winkle offerings, which if you get into bourbon you will find all about those), but the most well known version of them is makers mark. I've only had makers and old weller antique, but I get a lot if cherry pie, rich, sweet flavors from them. What I suggest is slowly making your way through these types of bourbons and seeing which kind you like. I would recommend buffalo trace (low rye), bulleit (high rye) and makers mark (wheater) to start. It will probably take you a little while to get used to the flavor of whiskey because it is a very assertive flavor. I would start with cocktails or just mixing it with soda. This will help you get accustomed to the flavor. From there, try adding a teaspoon of water to 1.5 ounces of whiskey and drinking it like that. You could also opt to put an ice cube in your drink and let it slowly dilute the whiskey, but I think the cold kills a lot of the flavors. Eventually try to start drinking whiskey neat. If you really want to get into it, buy a glencairn and start taking down flavor/nosing notes. It's really fun to spend an hour with a whiskey just seeing all the types of flavors you can find. \n\n\nI'm on my phone and just wrote quite a lot, but here's a quick primer on scotch. You probably want a highland, speyside, or lowland scotch. These are fruity/grassy/floral types of scotch and are usually pretty sweet and accessible to beginners. Something like glenmorangie 10, macallan, or speyburn is a good place to start. Glenfiddich ( pronounced with a hard 'ch' like in 'loch ness monster') and glenlivet are some of the most popular speysides so chances are you will be able to get your hands on those. In my opinion, they're both ok but there are better scotches out there for that price. Islay, which is a small island to the west of Scotland is a magical place and makes some of the greatest whiskies ever. However most of them are heavily peated and have a very intense flavor which is not advisable for beginners. After you have a few single malts under your belt try Laphroaig or ardbeg 10. If you got money to blow, lagavulin 16. \n\nThat should about cover a basic primer of bourbon in scotch. Feel free to pm me if you want to discuss. Sláinte! \n\nEdit: just saw you're in Aus.

{"body": "&gt; I'm looking for a reason to not believe in God.\n\nFair enough. \n\nStart with this question: do you want to have as few *false* beliefs as possible, and as many *true* beliefs as possible? In other words, the ideas and knowledge in your head, do you want them to be as close to reality as is reasonably possible?\n\nI can't emphasise this enough, as this is where it starts. If you say \"yes, I want to know about reality as best I can, and want to discard as many false beliefs as possible\" then you're ready.\n\nSo: is there *credible* evidence for a god? Short answer: no. There really isn't. You might disagree, but I think this would make an excellent debate topic separate from this current one. It would be really simple, where you would present your very best evidence for a god. Be aware, though, that what you likely think as being the very best evidence, when closely scrutinised by people who care that their beliefs are true, is likely not going to be very convincing.\n\nYou might say \"well atheists don't *want* there to be a god.\" This is a misconception. Atheists simply don't believe, and the reasons for not believing are varied. But, just as you don't really have a choice in whether you believe that elephants exist or not, atheists (and theists) don't really have a choice either - what we believe or disbelieve is a product of our knowledge. \n\nSome people's standards of evidence are really low, so some people believe that Elvis is still alive because they saw a photo of him buying a coffee at Starbucks. I care that my beliefs are reasonably true, and so I would ask questions about the photo before accepting it as fact: who took the photo? How are we certain it has not been doctored? How are we sure it's really Elvis and not some impersonator (of which there are many). And so on. Under scrutiny, such a photo would quickly be shown to be very poor evidence that Elvis is still alive. \n\n&gt; Atheist have not given me anything to look forward to. Except, maybe, keeping the plants green.\n\nThis is really the wrong way to go about it. If you form your beliefs based on how they make you feel, or whether you *like* them, then there are going to be plenty of things you believe in that are false. [There is a staggeringly long list of cognitive biases that people suffer from](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), including you and me, because we aren't always conscious of what our brain is doing. A simple example is that of \"[Post-Purchase Rationalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization)\": you are likely to think more highly of something you've bought, because you want to be right. If you sink $10,000 into something, you're likely to *want* that purchase to be worth-while, since the alternative means you were foolish. Such bias is something we often aren't aware of until it's pointed out to us. It's just one example of many - I suggest you peruse the list and see if there are some you recognize.\n\nThe only thing an atheistic world-view really has to offer is this: it seems to be consistent with reality. That's it. \n\nIf you, like me, value having beliefs consistent with reality, then the implications of an atheistic world-view take a back seat. It means:\n\n* there's likely no after-life\n* bad people can do bad things and never get punished (but bad people also can't do bad things and repent, either)\n* there is no cosmic plan or purpose to everything\n* there is no fatherly overlord that sets out rules for us: we need to, as people, figure out what rules work best for us on our own\n\nAs an atheist, I'm generally a happy person. Life makes *sense*, even if I'm not always happy with it. But I don't disbelieve because it makes sense, I disbelieve because I care that my beliefs are true, and there just isn't any credible evidence for a god. Incidentally, I don't believe in bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster or alien abductions for the same reason: insufficient evidence. It would be nice to believe there is a prehistoric aquatic lizard affectionately named \"Nessie\" living in Scotland, but as nice as such a belief might be, it has no bearing on whether or not it's *true*.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388951726", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; What is your biggest argument for atheism?\n\nIt's not so much an argument for atheism, rather, it's that I have found the claims &amp; arguments *for* theism unconvincing.\n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388955012", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

The first few days I was still in doubt about wether I should really go through with it, so I just went to some museums, bicycled around the city and smoked copious amounts of weed.\n\nOn the fourth day, though, I decided to go to De Wallen (the red light district). \n\nThey have windows to the street, where the prostitutes display their bodies. So I just walked around and did a little window shopping before I eventually decided I was going to fuck some Slavic woman, because my last crush had been a Russian girl. \n\nSo I started talking about sex with her: what she would let me do, how often she is checked for STDs, and where she was originally from. It turns out that she was from Russia, just like my crush. \n\nBecause of my obsession with my last crush, I had learned to do a few pick up lines in Russian and because this was the only time in my life where I could use them, I decided to do so. She was amused, or probably faked being amused, and said she could give me a small discount for being so funny. \n\n“Normally I charge 50 euros”, she said, “but I’m gonna need about tree fiddy!” And it was at that time I realised that the prostitute was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the proterozoic era.

We also overheard Jeff say the average viewers was like 20000.  So now we can do some math.\n\nAssuming a 5min break inbetween every map, each map takes 20 minutes, we're looking at about 3 ad sessions per hour.  Lets even look at the lowest end of this.  Lets assume only 1 ad is played every break, so 3 ads an hour.\n\n20000 viewers*$6/1000 viewers=$120 per ad.\n\n3 ads/hour*$120/ad=$360/hour\n\nEach day was about 12 hours, so 36 hours*$360/hour=$12960\n\nNow this is absolutely on the low end of the spectrum.  I was at the event so i don't know how many ads were played during each break but there was surely more than 1.  \n\nSo now imagine Nadeshot streaming.  I don't know his CPM, but he averages like 10k viewers.  I'm not gonna do the math because it will get too speculative, but I wouldn't be surprised if hes making more than $500 day.  Since Nade gets the most viewers, lets say Scump, BigT, and Ricky are making $250/day.  Assuming they stream 300 days out of the year, conservatively the team house is generating $375000 a year FROM TWITCH ALONE.  This doesn't include Youtube, Sponsorships etc  Im even using low end guesses...\n\nLet me just reiterate that this could be way off.  Still its fun to speculate.

{"body": "For credibility's sake, I have a graduate degree in nutritional biochemistry. I also qualified for the best tier of term life insurance (required a blood draw), so what I do and eat seems to be working. \n\nFirst, the paleo diet is not a bad diet. It's a significant improvement over what is known as the western diet. However, I would wager that anyone who is exercising (not necessarily Crossfit) regularly won't be eating the western diet. I get asked a lot by other box members whether what they're eating is good. And my knee-jerk response is that \"Paleo or not, if you care enough to ask, I'm sure you're doing fine.\" Which is probably true. \n\nMy problem with the Paleo Diet is that it is fraught with inconsistencies. Its rules make it fairly difficult to follow. **No** diet can be the end-all perfect diet. The reasoning that \"it's what our ancestor's ate\" isn't good enough. They didn't live old enough to have heart disease or cancer. And if they did, how would they have known? A PET scan? Most of what constitutes the Paleo Diet is *assumed* information.  \n\nI'll go over some of the more popular exclusions and limitations that don't make sense to me. \n\n**Grains/Starches**, and other high-glycemic foods (like rice) - For Asians,  South Asians, some Europeans (Spain), Latin Americans, rice is a staple of their diet. Interestingly enough, these cultures didn't get diseases of western society (diabetes, heart disease) until globalization. **Gluten** is a different issue. It's a protein, just like everything else you eat. Some individuals have legitimate problems with gluten; the condition is given a name, celiac disease. It affects about 0.1% of the population. I'm really not sure why gluten is demonized. \n\n**Dairy** - Yes, lactose intolerance is a thing. But what is lactose intolerance actually? Milk contains a sugar - lactose - that requires an enzyme to digest, *lactase*. Sucrose, the sugar you put in coffee, requires sucrase to digest. The vast majority of babies in every population are born with the ability to produce lactase to digest breastmilk. Over time, some populations lose production of lactase, and therefore become lactose intolerant. However, it has been proven via DNA sequencing that some populations (particularly the Scandinavian countries) have *evolved* mutations that allow lactase to continue to be produced through adulthood, and thus continue consuming milk products with no consequence. **This disproves a primary tenet of the Paleo Diet** - humans do, in fact, evolve with their diets and cultures; we are not stuck in the Paleolithic era.\n\n**Peanuts** - part of the Paleo Diet philosophy is that if it causes allergies, it can't be good. I know people who are allergic to strawberries, to poultry, to eggs, to shellfish - does that mean these are bad? Allergies are complex conditions in which a person's immune system reacts against a specific protein of the food item (or bee venom, whatever). It is a reaction against *something that is NOT harmful* to the body. The body *mistakenly* thinks that it is something that will cause disease (bacteria). \n\nIMO, the Paleo Diet leads some people to overload on protein consumption, which is a strong risk factor for heart disease and atherosclerosis.

{"body": "First, a bit  of background: \nI was basically an errand bitch at a local brewery for a year and a half. My manager was constantly assigning me tasks fifteen minutes before everyone had to leave so he could justify having me close instead of waiting around to do it himself. But, I kept the job because I drank free beer all the time and there were hot chicks working the taps. \nMany of you have most likely been to a brewery, especially now that they're growing in popularity, so I won't go into much detail. Suffice it to say that there's a taprooom where people drink, eat popcorn, and throw that shit everywhere, and then usually a back warehousey room where the beer is made. \nThe brewery where I worked used all local ingredients and, because we were always getting shipments at different times due to the different beers on the engine, there were usually sacks of shit laying on pallets. My manager's favorite way of making me stay late was making me rearrange these sacks for use the next day. \nThose damn sacks are heavy, and needless to say, it took me forever to stack them in whatever arbitrary place that also liked that day. \nIn any case, I'd usually finish around 1 am and head home for the night. At first, that place was fucking scary all dark and shit when it was closed up. But, I got used to it... after a month or so, haha. \n\nI started to notice some weird shit about 6 months after I started working there. Small, random things like the sacks not being in the order I left them in the night before &amp; subsequently my manager ripping my face for a few minutes the next day. At first, I figured that I had just gotten a bit too buzzed while working the night before because it wasn't happening all the time. \n\nI was working on a Thursday, and low and behold, my manager made me stay late again, for that same damn task, I was pretty pissed because I was leaving for a long weekend the next morning and head to pack when I got home but went along and did the shit anyway. \nThe next afternoon, after I had gotten off my plane, I found a super angry voicemail on my phone about how the sacks were spread all over the damn floor and obviously I hadn't closed right and if it happened again I'd lose my job. I just wtf'd and decided to deal with it after the weekend was over because I knew I had closed perfectly and figured he was just being an asshole. \n\nWhen I got back to work Monday, one of the girls pulled me aside and asked me why I was coming in. She said that they all figured I quit because of how trashed the place was when they came in Friday. The hair on my neck was starting to stand up a bit but I figured someone just burgled the place. \n\nI went in the back to look for my manager and he was standing at one of the pallets with his back to me. I said hey but he didn't respond so I went up on tapped him on the shoulder. I remember his shirt felt really freaking hot. Like right out of the dryer hot. He spun around and had this weird look in his eye like he was just looking straight through me. I explained that I had closed perfectly and that maybe someone had broken in, and then waited to receive the verbal beating. \n\nMy manager (I'm getting sick of typing that, let's call him Steve) just sat there for like a moment, not more than a second but there was this weird visible pause and then he shook himself and muttered something and left. I just kinda stared after him but figured he already knew it wasn't me so I didn't think to much about it. \n\nThis weird shit with the sacks goes on for a couple more weeks but it's getting more and more frequent. Like whole pallets of ingredients were switched with other pallets when I would come in the next afternoon. It was getting really fucking creepy. I almost talked to my manager about it but he had been out for sick for like a freaking week and hadn't been bothering me since so I figured I didn't want to get into his bad graces. \n\nWith Steve being out for a week or so I had started staying late every night closing the place up because, thanks to that asshole, I was the only one that knew how to do it besides him. Anyway, one night I was carrying a sack of some local hippie hops and bumped into a large metal box that housed some equipment or some shit and burned the shit out of my arm! It burned so bad I dropped the sack and reeled backwards into another pallet. It was weird though, because there wasn't a mark on my arm, only I've been burned before and I swear that pain was worse than anything I've felt. I went home and kept putting aloe vera on it because it would randomly start to burn when I was just sitting there playing video games. \n\nI woke up that next morning from the pain reigniting where the burn should have been. I figured it was really early because it was dark and my alarm hadn't gone off so I went downstairs to play some xbox until I was tired or my arm stopped burning. As I was walking down the stairs I was checking my phone and it was full of messages from my coworkers at the brewery... long story short, I had missed a full day of work because I had been sleep for almost 28 hours as it was now 4am. \n\nI kinda freaked out a bit and hopped in the shower to clear my head. As I got out I looked in the mirror and I saw these fucking burning dark blue eyes where mine should have been. \n\nThen this fucking voice emanated out of like every pore of my being and said, \"Ima need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389222457", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was ~14 years old, I was playing a game of pickup baseball with my friends. The field was located at a four way intersection where the main road had no stop signs, but the perpendicular roads did. I was hitting and was looking at the intersection when a Subaru barreled through the stop sign and nailed the rear driver's side of a Chevy Equinox. The Chevy spun 90 degrees and rolled. It only completed half a roll, wound up on the roof and then slid probably thirty feet. While it was sliding, the driver's dog abandoned ship and took off into the woods. My friends and I all ran over to help. The woman was shaken up and leaking a little bit from the glass shrapnel, but was otherwise fine. I helped her out of her car and she asked me to find her dog.\n\nSince I love dogs, I agreed and booked it to the woods. I saw the dog cowering next to a tree but every time I got close, she'd get scared and run. After a ten minute pursuit, I cornered her in an alley. She was terrified; shitting and pissing all over herself. I slowly approached her and used my belt as a makeshift leash. She wouldn't budge, so I scrapped the leash idea and just picked her up and carried her back to the woman.\n\nBy the time I got back, the local constabulary had arrived and was handling the situation. I walked over to the woman to give her back her dog but as I got close, one of my small town's over-intense, takes-his-job-way-to-seriously-for-the-amount-of-people-and-lack-of-crime cops stopped me like I had just announced that I was going to rape the dog. I told him that it was the lady's dog and I had just chased it down for the woods. He didn't give a shit because, in his mind, I'm about to sodomize a dog. The woman heard him giving me flak and slipped away from the EMT and starts cussing out the cop.\n\n\"You found my Bailey! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you! Why are you yelling at this young man? If it wasn't for him, I don't know if I'd ever have seen my dog again,\" and other praises in my name. The cop relented and let me keep the dog calm while the woman got medical attention. I gave the dog some water and pettings. Eventually, I earned the dog's trust because she lifted her head up to my ear and said, \"I-I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time I noticed that this dog was about seven stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

I stand there for a few minutes semi- hiding behind the bushes and watch him back and forth in rows on his driveway. At first I thought, this guy is high as fuck. Then, he realizes his mail has ran and starts walking down the driveway too. I take notice and run back to my box and start there all nonchalant like flipping through my shit. He sees he, throws his hand up, smiles and gets his mail and goes back up the driveway and starts back cutting his driveway again. \n\nFast forward a month or so later, it's starting to turn fall and the grass cutting season is over and I'm sitting outside starting a bonfire, drinking a Yuengling, and I hear this same dude fire up his lawnmower and the same clankity clank of a million rocks. So I go get my wife and tell her to come look at this shit, and she comes out and semi through the trees we see him, doing it again. She tells me, \"holy shit he was doing that the other day when you went to the store\". So we stand and watch him cut his driveway for about 5 minutes according to my watch. He turns off the mower takes it to the shed. Later we leave for groceries and come back. Except when we get back that mother fucker is standing in my driveway with his lawnmower. He asks if I have a grinder to sharpen his lawnmower blade with, and I apologetically tell him, no. So he takes it home and FUCKING FIRES UP HIS LAWNMOWER AGAIN.

{"body": "I was a cashier at best buy so expect everything from fucking in the back to showing up high all the damn time (that was me actually, they never drug tested except once). What takes the cake is the story of Doug. It was a busy day, so the lines were packed and everyone was growing impatient while the other cashiers and I worked as fast as we could. I look up and see another employee, let's call him Doug pulling up his pants (i assumed they were falling off) near the Blu Rays, and noticed a small brown speck on the floor. I don't know if I was the only one who saw, but like i said it was packed, I didn't have time to clean it up, and I just assumed the speckwas chocolate because kids tend to throw wrappers and candy on the floor anyway and i only saw him near it. So as the day goes on alot of the customers begin complaining about a smell around the DVD's and Blu-rays section (right infront of me and near the main entrance). I begin to smell it too after a few hours, but the brown speck is pretty much gone by then so i have no idea what it could be. So closing time is in about 30 minutes, I talk with the multichannel people (phone people) and other cashiers. We then proceed to straighten out the Blu Rays, and are immediately hit with the smell of shit. We walk around and I hear one of our employees scream, we run over to where the brown speck was, and of course, there is a footprint of shit dragged for about 2 feet. My first thought is, how in the hell did NO ONE notice this? Which i ended up accidentally screaming while my manager made his way over. As we talk, no employee wants to clean it up (we don't get paid enough for that), so the manager agrees and leaves. Like I said before, it was about 30 mins before closing, and as we are back at the counter waiting for that disgusting stuff to be cleaned up I'm telling them about Doug pulling up his pants. One of the cashiers tells the manager about it and he brings the employee to us, asks him if he did this, to which the employee says no then proceeds to tell him that there are security cameras that can tell us if he is lying or not. Doug is fired on the spot without even looking at the cameras after a little chat with the manager (don't remember everything), so he proceeds to flick the manager off, go to the security desk and pull down his pants. Takes a shit right there. He comes back and runs around flicking all of us off then comes to me, the kid that ousted the sick fuck. He says \"I only have one thing to say to you\", and i was fucking terrified at this point, the guy is CLEARLY crazy, the other employees were backing up at this point, they were just as afraid, and unfortunately Best Buys \"Security\" can't physically detain someone... and he says \"I'mma need about tree fitty\". It was about this time that I realized Doug was actually the Loch Ness monsta. I told him \"No you can't have tree fitty damnit!\" and walked away.

{"body": "Was taking the rail (metro) into DC, got on at the New Carrolton station, planned on jumping the green to College Park to visit some friends. The next stop, Landover, a guy gets on and sits at the opposite end of the car I’m on. Noticed him because the car wasn’t that crowded and you tend to watch as people get on and off. The next stop he gets up and changes seats across the car, odd but no big deal. Same thing happens next stop but moves one seat down. Again, odd but no big deal. He proceeds to do this at each subsequent stop but is now giving me a quick glance before moving. Other people are on the train so I don’t feel threatened, again just odd. By the time we get to L’Enfant he is about halfway down the train. I get off to jump the green. This guy gets off as well as well. Get the green, no sign of the guy. First stop he enters the car. I’m thinking WTF he must have gotten on a different car. He sits in the seat that he previously had, halfway down the car. Again moving at each stop. By the time we reach CP he’s only a few seats away. At the stop we both get up and simultaneously exit the car. Not to be confrontational I nicely ask him if I can help him with something.

{"body": "I was a recruiter for the US Air Force a few years back. I have loads of stories good and bad.\n\n\nOne that comes to mind about horror stories is a young female applicant that harassed me almost daily for nearly a month. (I'm male btw, and was married at the time)\n\n\nWe have VERY strict rules about professional relationships. As a recruiter we are in a position of power in the community. Especially since the community I was in had 0 military bases in the area so recruiters are essentially the only military these people ever see. \n\nYes, (some)girls do like uniforms. Mostly when they don't ever see that uniform on a daily basis.\n\nAnyways, this girl was not qualified to join. It's not uncommon. In fact only about 70% of people between 17 and 27 are qualified to join the air force. Anyways, tell her she can't join due to a shellfish allergy.\n\nShe is upset but not freaking out. Tell her I'm very sorry, give her some resources on securing loans for college. (this is her first year out of high school, I think she was 19?) \nLater that week she shows up in my office with some cookies and a pepsi for me. I say thank you very much but I can't accept these gifts. No rules against it but my gut told me not to. It seemed odd for her to come back to my office on a social visit.\n\nShe starts to chat me up and tells me she is doing research on college stuff. I say \"Good job, keep at it! If you ever need help I can help you out.\" My normal canned response. No one ever comes back for help (with one exception)\n\nShe comes back again the very next day. Asks what I'm doing for dinner that evening. Well, this was the time when I realized that shit was weird. I wear my wedding ring at work, it's quite visible. I also had a picture of my wife and I together on my desk that is quite visible to any visitors. So I respond with \"Well, my wife is making dinner and we are going to just hang out and probably watch a movie.\" She frowns and says 'oh ok' and says good night and takes off.\n\nI immediately called my boss to report this. I am normally blind as hell to anyone flirting with me. But this was just obvious. I had to make sure my boss knew about it in case she decides to report that something is going on, or if someone else starts to make accusations that something is going on. When I get home I tell my wife as well. This was a friday evening so I don't see her again until monday.\n\nMonday she shows up the same time I do for work (I normally go for a run in the morning then jump in the shower at the office and start my routine at about 8am. She was waiting at the door at 8am. I let her in ask her if everything is ok. She says yeah I just missed you.\n\nOh fuck.\n\n\nHonestly at this point I'm pretty much terrified. I tell her to come in and sit down. I explain to her as clearly as I can about how serious unprofessional relationships are and how they can jeopardize my career as well as reiterate the fact that I'm (at the time) happily married and am very faithful. She asks me to clarify the rules on the professional relationship. I explain that since she's an applicant it's not appropriate for me to have any sort of relationship with her. I was as nice as I could be but she starts freaking crying. Not like, tears in the eyes, and quite sobbing. Like she is screaming. Fucking screaming VERY loud. The navy guy next door hears it and comes running in from the back door asking if everything is ok. Sees the girl crying and walks out. \n\nI ask her to leave and say I can't help her. She responds with \"Well, you said you would help me with getting into college\" And I explain to her that \"Since you seem a bit to attached to me I don't think it's appropriate for you to be around here anymore. I'm very sorry, good luck\" She continues sobbing and goes to her car and leaves.\n\nI goto each of the other recruiter offices (Navy, Army, Marines) and explain what is going on in case she comes back.\n\nShe does. Very next day she comes in after I got back from a school visit at about 3pm. She has a stone cold look on her face and marches into the office, sits down in the chair and says \"Listen, I know you want to fuck me, I want to fuck you and I think we should just do it. Who gives a shit about your wife I won't tell her\"\n\nThis is seriously some shit straight out of a terrible porno. Now, she is very hot, I won't lie and if I was single I would have been all about that. But fuck no, my dick is not going to be stuck in crazy. Especially when I'm married. She does not even give me a chance to answer. She says that she will be back tomorrow at same time and \"I better be prepared\" and walks right out.\n\nOh fuck. FUck. Fuck. fuck.\n\nI call my boss, \"Boss, I need you here tomorrow at my office to hang out. That crazy chick is back and I think she's going to fucking go ballistic on me or try and rape me I have no fucking clue.\" He's laughing his ass off because he doesn't believe me. \"Fine, whatever I'll be there.\" \n\nIt's a 2+ hour drive for him, I'm a recruiter in the middle of fucking nowhere. He comes out and spends the day with me. We go to my school visit and run an appointment in the morning on some kid who ended up failing the practice ASVAB test with a 23. Sure enough at around 3pm the girl comes in while my boss is talking to me about phone call crap. I indicate to my boss that this is the crazy girl by a quick nod. He jumps in and starts talking to her like she is a new applicant that just walked in, introduces himself as my boss. She tells him that she's not here to join, she says \"I'm pzPat's girlfriend, I'm here to drop him off some cookies\" My boss knows me, he knows my wife. My wife knows his wife.\n\nA line of questioning from my boss and I clarify that she is not my girlfriend, she was an applicant. I show him the paperwork that I drew up and the log in the computer system (AFRISS, piece of shit) Long story short he ends up telling her to leave and not come back unless she wants to have the police involved. Informs her that if she comes back she will be trespassing on federal property. Yup, recruiter offices are just like post offices. Federal property. Any crimes committed there are handled as federal crimes. She storms out crying.\n\n\nThe rest is fairly uneventful but I felt it was far more creepy. \n\n\nShe started leaving notes on my personal car as well as the government vehicle that I drove. All of them said similar things. Mostly along the lines of \"You have a tight butt - Love Ms Crazy xoxoxoxoxox\" or \"I like watching you run\". They got less frequent. I did see her around town a few times. It's a small city. Luckily it was always when I was driving. I made sure to loose sight of her before I got to my destination.\n\nLast straw was when I got home and my wife was out of town visiting her parents. On my doorstep was a basket with some shitty brandy (she was underage, no idea how she got it), some beef jerky, other assorted man snacks and a cigar. I think it was a gift package originally but was rewrapped by her. A small note inside said \"You're wife is not home, call me and I'll be right over.\"\n\nFuck me, how did she find where I lived? Seriously. What. The. Fuck.\n\nTwo options. Call her and threaten her. Or call the police. I was leaning on calling the police at this point. She's obviously stalking me. \n\n\nI take pictures of the basket (sorry, they are gone this was like 4 years ago, 2 phones ago). Unlock my front door and walk in. Turn on the light and there she is. Standing in my entry way wearing almost nothing. I'm shitting myself. What do I do? Run? Before I can decide she speaks.\n\n\nCrazy: \"Listen just one moment before you say anything\"\nMe: \"W-what...\"\nCrazy: \"I need something from you\"\nMe: \"I don't have anything I can give you, this is very inappropriate.\"\nCrazy: \"No, really it's simple.\"\nMe: \"W-what?..\"\nCrazy: \"I need about three fiddy.\"\n\nI now realized that she was actually about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit Nessie, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I screamed as I ran outside and slammed the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all seriousness this story is 100% true up until after my boss visits. She never left me any notes or found my home. But she did bother me for several days and indicated she wanted to fool around regardless of my marital status.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389388432", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I was doing a delivery one day, when lo and behold, my former English teacher answered the door. She had lost a few pounds in all of the right places, and become quite attractive\n\nWhile I was in her class, I was a bit of a shithead so I hoped she wouldn't recognize me. To my dismay, as she signed for the package she said \"Johnny McFakename, is that you??\"  \nWe ended up chatting for a good 20 minutes, and before I left, I asked if she wanted to get a drink some time. \n\nFast forward a few months: We had started to go on dates at least once a week now, and things were looking like they were getting serious. After about a year had passed, I knew she was the one, so on February 12th, 1994 I popped the question. We were married by July and were prepared to spend the rest of our lives together.\n \nThings went great for 5-6 years, and we'd even decided to have a child together. Unfortunately during the pregnancy we started to lose interest in each other. Deciding it would b best for the child if we would get a divorce. Around this time I was laid off of my job and ended up living back home with my parents.\n\n I managed to keep sending in alimony payments due to the odd jobs I would pick up around town, but one night I decided enough was enough. The next time she came around, I raised my voice and shouted \"JESUS CHRIST WOMAN I AM NOT GIVING YOU YOUR GOD DAMN TREE FIDDY!\"\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389412751", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

Sure, they are young and they don't understand everything, but sometimes, memories can be stocked in your subconscious, and it could resurface later, for example when he will see earplugs, it will automatically makes a link between this and his childhood, might cause a trauma event thinking ''Maybe my parents didn't want to listen to me'' or ''Maybe they didn't want me around''\nIt reminds me of a story from a clinical case we had to study, it was a child who used to have colicky (I dont the name in english, but basically, the baby cries for hours for no goddamn reason) and the parents were really tense and everything. So they tried to stay sane by putting some classical music to try to cover the sound of the babies. Note that the family was from UK, this is important for later. So basically everytime the baby starts to cry the parents go into what they called ''the safe room'' and they start playing music. It lasted for maybe 1-2 years and then the baby calmed down, so everything was fine. No fast forward ten years later, the baby who is now a young boy is walking into a supermarket with his mom, and suddenly a music comes on, I don't know exactly which one but for sure it was one of the song his parents used to listen to. The kid then has like a triggering attack, and he starts to cry really loud into the market, for no reason. The mother does not understand what is going on so she stars by yelling at him ''WHATS WRONG WITH YOU?'' and then the kid cries even more. Everyone in the supermarket is looking at them, and she feels embarrassed not knowing what to do, she then shakes him off and this manages to calm him down, he comes back to his sense, not knowing what happened, he just realized this was linked to the music, like the song was making him cry like this but he doesn't know why. This was a one-time event and they didn't pay much attention to it. \nNow fast forward when the kid is to college, he went to a party and you know how parties go. He was having fun drinking, smoking pot (this is important as well for later) and everything. Then he had an altercation with one guy, just drunken stuff, and they almost started a fight. At this point the now college boy starts to have a tantrum, looks the guy right in the face and say to him something like ''if you don't pay me what you owe me you are fucking dead to me'' (I overdo, but in was in these terms, really aggressive) The drunken guy doesn't understand, as they never met before, so he asked what's the deal here. The kid then walks back to him, gets closer to him and whispers in his ear, with the smoothest voice you could imagine ''I need about tree fiddy''\nAfter that you know, everything went back to normal and no one even mentionned this event.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389445786", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": -6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It is logically impossible to provide proof of the non-existence of a given thing.  The premise doesn't even make sense - how does something which does not exist leave evidence of its nonexistence?  You would know this if you knew *anything* about logic.  \n\nBut besides that, the burden of proof is on the one who makes an extraordinary claim.  If a man walks into a restaurant and tells the waitress that he can shoot laser beams out of his eyes, it is up to him to prove it.  As what he is claiming has not only never been witnessed, nor predicted by any of what we know about the universe, nor does it logically follow to even be possible, it is assumed false until proven to be true.  The claim for the existence of a god is an extraordinary claim.  It is saying that there is an intelligence outside of reality as we know it which is aware of everything there is to know about that exists able to manipulate that reality and circumvent all known laws of physics and causality at will.  None of that is in any way in line with anything we know about the universe, so without any proof that it is true, it is just a silly story, and silly stories do not require disproving.\n\nBut since everything I just said probably just went right over your hollow skull, I'll put it like this: if you insist that I must provide proof that your god does not exist, then you must provide proof that fairies, psychics, voodoo, the loch ness monster, pagan gods, Greek gods, Norse gods, Spongebob Squarepants, and unicorns do not exist.  If you cannot provide proof that none of those things exist, then by your own logic, they *do* exist and are just as real as you insist your god to be.

The details were that someone was shouting and making noise in an old burnt down pub, known infamously as \"The Goose\". \n\nThere have been rumours for years about the place being haunted and there was an urban legend that the owner had committed suicide and taken his failing business with him. Naturally my partner Simon and I just assumed that it just had some local yobs or junkies making a racket and headed to the address. \n\nWhen we arrived the street was quiet, but we still had to make sure that there was nothing else going on at the site. From one of the windows Simon noted that there appeared to be someone moving around at the back of the old barroom. The building was condemed and off limits to the public, so now we had someone possibly on trespassing.\n\nWe both shuffled into the side of the building through a gap in the fence and I remember calling out \"Is there anybody inside?\" No reply. Now we were certain it was a homeless person or otherwise, just trying to avoid trouble. As Simon pushed past a stack of burnt old tables to check the main area further , I had a look in the backroom and could not believe what I was witnessing. There was an old man sitting in what looked to be an entirely undamaged area of the bar. He was sitting murmering something to himself. \"Sir?\" I said. He stopped. That face that turned to look at me, I will never forget. the man looked at me sadly and said \"I need about Tree Fiddy\".

{"body": "Had one, and only one really strange experience with online dating translating to real life. I had just had a terrible breakup with this guy who was an abusive asshole. I felt really low and lost after he broke up with me over the phone in front of his friends.\n\nNot really knowing what to do/where to go, I got the Blendr app and just surfed around in my spare time. Most of the guys were creepy and ugly, but a few really seemed nice. I actually made a couple of dates, but they kind of fell through because I was always too shy to actually meet up. Finally, I met this really interesting-seeming guy, and we had a couple of chats, where it seemed like we enjoyed a lot of similar things. He was also a cute guy from Scotland, so that was a nice bonus.\n\nHe worked in midtown, so we met up one day for coffee. He told me about his studies and I talked about my life, and it was kind of stilted, but at this point for me, it was better than being alone. He was also really cute. After about an hour, we got into the sexy talk and were clearly both ready for some action. He lived in lower Manhattan, so we went to columbus circle to catch the A downtown. I really couldn't believe my luck in snagging a guy that was so attracted to me just from going around on a random dating site.\n\nThe sex was quite good, and it felt great after such a bad breakup. He told me he really enjoyed it too, and maybe we should hook up again. I guess I was stupid because I started to think it might turn into a relationship. He's walking me to the elevator and then he says that he was a little short on cash (an exchange student on minimum wage) and timidly asked if I'd reimburse him for my coffee.

{"body": "About six years ago I responded to a call about a break in. The house was in horrible shape, and it appeared to be abandoned. I stepped over the broken glass in the front room with my gun drawn. I could hear noises coming from upstairs. When I called for the person to come down there was no response. I remember a thick layer of fog mysteriously being inside of the house, which I first mistook for smoke. It was a rather clear day outside, so I still have no idea how the fog got inside of the house. \nAnyways, I walked through the fog to the stairs, stepping over a red liquid on the ground. I'm guessing it was blood from something. It was splattered in the shape of a pentagram. At this point I suspect that it might have been an intruder nut job who butchered the resident in some sort cult ritual or something. I'm on edge, but when I try to call for backup my radio was dead. I kept hearing the noises upstairs so I didn't feel as if I had a choice but to continue trying to apprehend the suspect who seems to be up there.\n As I started walking up the stairs the noises I was hearing grew louder, almost as if it wanted me to find it easily. It started out as light rustling noise but by this time it sounds like a sledgehammer. I can tell it's coming from the middle bedroom of the house. I yell for the person to come out again, and this time they responded with laughter. the bedroom door was locked so I kicked it in. I saw myself browsing Reddit on my laptop lying in bed. My mirror image looked up and told me I am not, and was never, a cop. He said I'm making all of this up because the responses here have been less than impressive so far on the net. I was shocked and frozen still in fear. I don't remember how I got out of the house. I just know that everything I had with me; my badge, my gun, my tree fiddy, my hat, my baton and even my right shoe was gone. \nIt was a bizarre time for sure.

We arrived and were treated to a nice hotel and other things. When we went to the show, she was one of the first artist that came up. She started explaining her story and going over how she had help from different people, and actually mentioned my name. I went on stage, per her request, and it was amazing. The atmosphere was astounding, the cheers and noise. She looked at me, gazing into my eyes, as she took my hand and told me \"I need about Tree Fiddy\".

I came to this conclusion before I left college, after I had read the bible and other 'holy books' and learned a little about history. \n\nIt's amusing to be called 'brainwashed' by someone apparently defending religion, which only exists because little kids are brainwashed by their parents, teachers and priests.\n\nIf society didn't brainwash kids into believing this nonsense, religion simply wouldn't exist. \n\n&gt;that you cannot have rational reasons for believing.\n\nugh, what a crock. There is by definition no such thing as rational faith. There's no evidence for gods or any other higher powers. You can't *rationally* believe in something that doesn't exist. There's no evidence for it! There's nothing there! Faith is wishful thinking, by definition. It doesn't qualify for the term rational. \n\nEveryone has the human right to believe whatever they want about the universe, I just wish people would stop being pussies about it and trying to justify it all the time. This just demonstrates their inherent insecurity, and that they probably know, deep down, that it's bullshit, they're just seeking validation. \n\nThere's no evidence for god, the bible is contradictory, full of errors and historical anachronisms, and the same goes for every other religious book. There's simply no rational reason to believe this stuff. If people believe it without giving it proper analysis, then, yes, there's something wrong with their cognitive abilities. There must be. Either that or they're poorly educated, brainwashed, or mentally ill. I see no other alternatives. \n\nYou can be a brilliant neurosurgeon and hold asinine beliefs about Sasquatch or the Loch Ness monster.

{"body": "While it looks like there's a \"war\" between atheists and theists, I think it's productive to look at the teams as empiricists vs. fideists. Let me explain.\n\nMost of us athies are empiricists: we want our beliefs to be true, and to be sure of that we insist that they be backed by evidence. We tend to reject claims about the Loch Ness monster, alien anal-probing abductions and wish-granting genies because no one's ever found convincing evidence for any of those things.\n\nFideists, and this is your parents' team, believe that there are truths, facts about reality, that must be taken on faith even if there's no evidence for them, even if evidence is to the contrary. They tell themselves, in fact, that believing things on bad or no evidence is *virtuous* and makes them better people. Christians think that God is pleased that they believe in Him just because the Bible and their parents and clerics say so.\n\nThe problem with fideism - the faith in faith - is that it's open to whatever bullshit comes along. Since there's no real-world data to test faithful beliefs against, whichever authority grabs a hold of you first and tells you a story is right, by definition. This is why Indians believe in Vishnu, Arabs believe in Allah and Americans believe in Jesus. Each of the appertaining stories is as good, bad and unfounded as any other.\n\nBasically, to be on this \"faith\" trip is to be gullible. Pat Robertson tells us that gay-dom causes earthquakes and hurricanes; and some people will believe him. How could he be proven wrong? Some of the hardliners from Robertson's team went to Uganda and almost succeeded in talking the government there into making homosexual acts subject to the death penalty. Is that reasonable? No, but once you accept that someone speaks on God's authority, how can you disagree?\n\nOK, so your parents don't pay attention to some of the uglier parts of the Bible: they don't keep slaves and they don't try to oppress gays. Cool, but if you think about it, they're a bit arrogant. If they decide which parts of the Bible to follow and which not (and they may do this indirectly by choosing which church to be a member of) then they are overruling the Bible's morality with their own. But if they already trust their own moral judgment above the Bible's, why follow the Bible at all?\n\nThere's a bit of hypocrisy here, some dishonesty: your parents are decent people, they selectively reject the lessons of the divine word of the infallible deity. They act on good human common sense, yet they remain on the team of those people who pretend that living your life according to some ancient fiction is the way to go.\n\nSo while, happily, your parents live and act sensibly, they support the faith team. And as we know, many people on that team are not as sensible as your parents.\n\nIf your parents and 100 million others like them were to officially quit America's faither team, that would leave a minority of gullible, irrational faith zealots whom we could clearly recognize as crazy or at least strange, and American society wouldn't be dominated by people who have no way to tell truth from fiction.\n\nI believe it's immoral to not responsibly strive to hold only justified true beliefs, because false beliefs often lead to erroneous actions, which often hurt ourselves and/or those around us. [William Clifford wrote a beautiful classic piece on this about 100 years ago](http://myweb.lmu.edu/tshanahan/Clifford-Ethics_of_Belief.html).\n\nTL;DR: I'm happy to believe your folks are good people, probably nicer than I am and as moral as the average r/atheist. But they are at risk of falling victim to a whole class of moral errors that atheists are immune from - because we refuse to be guided by unsubstantiated claims about ancient mythology.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389653892", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

How long did Lance Armstrong strike back at his accusers, insisting that he was innocent and the victim of a witch hunt?  I don't know whether or not A-Rod deserves what he's getting, but his strenuous objection to it doesn't tell me anything one way or another.

To be thought of as one of the all-time greats?  To be enshrined in the Hall of Fame?  A future job in baseball?  Will people think of him the way that he wants them to think of him if he lays down and accepts the punishment?  Will he be elected to the Hall of Fame - even if other guys eventually are - as the poster child of the era... if he doesn't vehemently fight to the end?  And even after he's exhausted all legal channels, continue to insist that he's innocent?

It could be any one of a hundred other things.  His kids probably aren't old enough, but what if... and I'm just making this up... he swore to his mother that he was clean?  Something like that.  How often might that happen?  Enough.  In 1934, Robert Kenneth Wilson sold a photograph of the Loch Ness Monster to the Daily Mail.  He refused to have his name attached to it and received no fame from the photograph, just the one time payment he received from the Mail.  A friend revealed that the photo was a fake... *in 1994.*  So this guy, who had nothing to gain or lose from it... except that he promised a friend he wouldn't say anything, *died without telling anyone.*\n\nGo ahead and say that it was shady as fuck.

My friend at the time, lets say his name is John starts to panic a little. It turns out he had borrowed the money we gambled away from a few sources and we had no money to repay. I estimate we gambled away 15,000 to 20,000, and it was just the four of us. But at this point in time none of us knew about how and where we got the money we used and we didn't think twice about it. So when we were back at our room we heard a loud knock, John said he would answer the door. He was talking to some guys in the hall and we went out to see what they were talking about. And then the largest of the men turned to me, face red with anger.

The man who could bring people back to life.\n\n*He should be just a few blocks away,* I thought.\n\nI walked forward in the chilly evening autumn night. There was hardly a sound except my footsteps and the leaves stirring in the trees. The leaves were beautiful hues of red, orange, and gold. They reminded me of her. Occasionally one fell from the tree, landing on the cold ground, dead. The similarities grew.\n\nEventually I reached the alley where he was said to be. I walked cautiously in. I rapped on the side of the brick building forming one half the alley's walls five times, just like they told me too. At first, there was no response. Then, a voice calls out.\n\n“So, you want to do some tampering with nature?” the raspy, slithering voice calls out. A man creeps forward. His hood obscures his face, but underneath the jacket he's wearing it's clear that he is, contrary to his voice, gigantic. He is muscular to an extreme and as tall as a tree. “This is dangerous stuff you're getting into, kid. Are you sure you're willing to do this?” I steel myself to respond to this giant. \n\n“I'll do anything to get her back.”\n\nOur love was a simple one at first. I met her waiting tables at a local restaurant, and her beauty captured me. Embarrassed as I was to ask her for her number, I wasn't going to let that chance slip through my fingers. She agreed. Within the month we were already going steady, in love with each other. It felt like destiny.\n\nHer leukemia hit as suddenly as my love for her.\n\nHer father had it, and his father before, but they had both managed to pull through. It was a tough struggle, and I stayed by her every step of the way, but it didn't take long to see that it was a losing battle.\n\nOne day, it was a Thursday, the doctor broke the news to me. She wasn't going to live more than 48 hours. I went to see how she was doing. She tried to look strong for me, but even so, she looked very, very weak. I left her room, and went right to the jewelry store, and bought a diamond ring. I proposed. She said yes.\n\nThat was the last time I saw her alive.\n\n“Anything? Are you sure?” the giant asked.\n\n“I'm positive. I need her back more than I need anything I have,” I said.\n\n“There's a price to pay,” the man said.\n\n“I'll pay it,” I said, starting to cry. “I'll pay anything. My car! My house! Even my arms! My legs! I just need her back!”\n\n\nThe giant approached me, slowly.\n\n“That won't be necessary,” he said. “All I need...” He put a massive hand on my shoulder. It was so cold and slimy, almost reptilian.\n\n“Is about tree fiddy.”\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n013\n\nMan, I kinda hate myself for ending it like that.

We got this healer named \"Bigtittyheals\" but with some ascii characters but thats what it said. After some hilarious banter from her ( yes it was an actual female OMGWTF ) calling our tank a \"noob\" and \"squishy as dogshit\" they ended up swapping battle tags to queue cross server in the future. Well fast forward 2 months and me completely forgetting about this encounter, I login to mumble to see my friend talking with someone named \"Bigtittyheals\" and I was like WTF?\nShe ended up being pretty cool and my friend hung out with her ingame doing all sorts of shit ( dailies, old raids, pet battles lul ) while eventually exchanging real life info and they found out they lived in the same state.\nSo they met up one day to go see a movie and like magic they end up dating and then about 4-5 months later from that point on she gets pregnant. I asked him \"did you really fuck her bro?\" and hes like \"Ay, she be a whale but the hour be late and her blowhole be wet\" and I'm like \"Alright Bro...but are you the father?\" He's like \"LOL hope not\" and just like that his life was over, the lie detector test determined -HE IS THE FATHER- So now that he dun goof'd I was kinda curious on how much hes gonna end up paying in child support so I asked him and hes like \"Well she knocked on my door and told me I needed to pay child support so I asked how much and she said \"I'm gonna need about a tree fiddy\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

As the submarine surfaced, it struck Ehime Maru, a fishery high school training ship from Ehime Prefecture, Japan. Within minutes of the collision, Ehime Maru sank.

Oh, but we were fools back then.  A small search party of local law enforcement was sent.  The National Guard wasn't even called in.  We should have just thrown the Navy Seals, Israeli commandos, British SAS, the whole book at them right from the start.  Or closed the damn thing off again.\n\nThe search party never came back.

The truth was much worse.\n\nAfter a few weeks, and a few more disappearances, the Guard got called in.  No word was heard.\n\nThe world began to descend into chaos.  Grocery stores emptied.  Revolutions erupted.  A border skirmish broke out between China and Russia.  We were on the brink of total madness.\n\nA meeting was held.  The United Nations gathered.  For once, they were actually united, with one voice.  An expeditionary force was assembled, the UN's finest.  This time, three men made it back.  Every one of them ranted and raved, about thatchers and berries and gathering wood for the fire.  Unrelated things.  We threw them into insane asylums, where all three took their own lives.\n\nWar was declared.  A real state of emergency for the known world, unlike any seen since the Black Death or the Mongolian conquests.  Entire armies went forth.  The world's best military minds were called out of retirement.  Former world leaders called for calm minds to prevail.  \n\nWe heard not a word from the armies, drones, and weaponry that disappeared into the breach.  But as the waiting troops outside watched, from that horrible gap in reality came one lone boy.  He was dressed like a 19th century country bumpkin or farmhand, a little disheveled and dirty.

(Shredder, shredder, shredder).\n\nI scheduled interviews throughout the following fortnight. Two didn't show up; one was Chinese, but the position wasn't math. heavy, hopeless; Three were under-qualified; another had a lousy personality, and a negative attitude; Another was feckless, and smelled faintly of cabbage.\n\nSo bottom of the ninth! I was on the final interview, Anne Frankly, utterly sick of the process. \n\nNow, I didn't think much at first, but in came the most interesting applicant so far. Hard to place their age -- quite old, originally from Scotland, they'd moved here after graduating from the University of Glasgow -- their appearance can only be described as slippery, slightly oily, off-grey. \n\nBut they ticked all of the boxes: An extensive portfolio, GNU/Linux familiarity, and several years of professional programming (in C/C++ &amp; C#) and management experience. They solved the programming puzzles in three minutes flat -- Most applicants required ~10 minutes. They solved all of the silly logic problems/riddles too.\n\nI was ready to hire! There was just one hurdle left to surmount: The salary.\n\n\"So may I ask -- What were you being paid at your previous position at, uh, Prestige Engineering?\"\n\n\"I received a salary of one-seven-five, but I will be expecting; um, I will be needing a little more,\" they replied, seemingly nervous.\n\nNow $175,000 (I assumed) was a hefty salary.

{"body": "I hate when criticisms of the paleo diet are focused around attacking the direct validity of the food choices the diet condones vs what people of the paleolithic era actually ate. It really needs to be given a new name so people can focus more on the science behind the food choices and less about the history. At the end of the day it is irrelevant whether they ate grains such as wheat or not. With our current knowledge we know gluten is fucking terrible for a lot of people and is of little benefit to us. I don't have celiac disease or get completely knocked on my ass if I have gluten; but when I am not consuming it; there is a noticeable difference in how I feel. Gluten for a lot of people is like a low level nagging. It's not strong enough to easily attribute these \"off\" feelings to gluten; but you notice these subtle annoyances subside after you abstain. \n\n\nThe paradigm is pretty simple. Most of it is pretty intuitive. The hardest aspect of it I find for people to grasp is the idea that high healthy fat intake does not make you fat (in fact, the results are fat loss). Not only that, but the fat for energy typically keeps you more level in your energy levels throughout the day as opposed to leveraging carbs for energy which results in your energy levels going up and down as you get hungry and re-feed. You eat carbs relative to your physical activity level. I load in tonnes of fat on a daily basis. When you look at labels and see the % daily fat intake; I am literally taking in many many times that in saturated fat every day. These percentages are garbage. Throw in some veggies and minimal low sugar fruit and you are set. \n\nJust for some anecdotal evidence for my use of paleo. I had suffered a concussion some time ago. I have also been a very active person all my life with sports and going to the gym, but during my concussion recovery period I put on some weight (as my post concussive symptoms lasted quite a while). I switched to the paleo diet and quickly got back to my baseline weight sitting on my ass recovering. I literally couldn't walk around too much due to the injury, so my activity level was significantly below what you would consider average. I felt better energy wise AND lost weight. As an added benefit; foods with high healthy fat are delicious. Grass fed steak anyone? High fat intake absolutely kills your food cravings for bad stuff. People think I have some godly level of willpower as I am able to turn down all sorts of shitty food, but really there is no willpower here. You simply just lose the desire for this shit when you eat properly. Carbs are addictive; so stop eating so much of them. \n\nI kept hearing people tell me I was crazy for taking in so much fat (as it directly opposes what dietitians have been cramming down our throats). People told me I was going to \"die of a heart attack at 30\" and bs like that. Funny enough though; my already awesome blood work improved even more since switching to this diet. With the current state of what people think about diet you really need to take a critical look and do your own research. The \"standard\" diet the government supports, while better than eating McDonalds every day, still doesn't fuel us for optimal human performance. The whole diet paradigm that has been followed for quite some time is going to be really flipped over on its head within the next 5-10 years. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389881625", "subreddit": "asktrp", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

I never found take-off to be particularly bothersome but this time was different. The fog made it hard to tell where in relation with the ground we were and there was turbulence as soon as we got off the ground. I noticed the stewardess wipe her brow as she buckled in, she looked very concerned.\n\nOnce we reached maximum altitude the stewardess in front of me unbuckled and walked to the back of the plane to grab the snack cart. I'll have a water and then I'll try and sleep the rest of the way like I always do. My stomach began to grumble. \n'Now that you mention it, stomach, I think I'll get a sandwich as well' I said under my breath.\n\n'What was that?'\n\nI forgot that I was sitting next to someone. The feeling of embarrassment and panic began to set in. \n\n*Why do I always do this to myself*\n\n*Think idiot, say something to make this person not think you're totally insane*\n\n'Oh nothing, nothing, just talking to myself, its been a long day' I chuckled, cracking a smile. I didn't even notice her when I sat down, and I'm not sure how, she was gorgeous! Her long hair was neatly tied back revealing all of the characters of her face, and my personal rule breaker... dimpled cheeks. She was perfect.\n\n'You can say that again, I can't believe how long the delay was over a bit of fog.' She said smiling. 'I'm Jessica'\n\n'I'm Pete, errrr, Peter. You can call me Pete or Peter, whatever you like.' I stumbled, barely able to keep myself from keeping my jaw shut.\n\n'Nice to meet you Pete' She smiled, extending her hand for a handshake to which I fumbled hitting every conceivable object I could before shaking her hand.\n\n'Nice to meet y-' I nearly finished as a voice interrupted behind me\n\n'Would either of you like a snack or drink?' The voice said. It was the stewardess.\n\n'Oh perfect, yes, I'll have a water... and could I get the roast beef sandwich? Are you still making those at this time of night?' I asked.\n\n'You are in luck sir! We are serving food on this flight' She replied.\n\n'How much is it?' I asked\n\n'I need about tree-fitty' she said abruptly.\n\nIt was at this point I noticed the stewardess was actually a giant crustacean from the palaeolithic era.\n\n'I ain't givin' you tree-fitty monster! I worked hard for my money and you should too. Bring back the stewardess!' I yelled, intentionally trying to cause a commotion. 'Can you believe the service on this airline?' I turned and said to Jessica.\n\nIt was at this point I noticed, she too was a giant crustacean from the palaeolithic era.\n\n'Goddamnit Loch Ness Monster! What are you doing in Jessicas seat?!' I said loudly.\n\nI looked back and the entire plane was filled with giant crustaceans from the palaeolithic era.\n\n'Oh great' I said under my breath.\n\nI reached into my pocket and grabbed my wallet. Tree-fitty exactly. This is when I remembered that I too was a giant crustacean from the palaeolithic era. And this was not a plane at all. It was a bus.\n\nThe end.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389946622", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There are a number of mythic beasts, spirits and undead in my world, yeah. Not an awful lot of the story is centred around them, but it's part of the supernatural elements to the world. \n\nThe mythic beasts aren't sapient --- I took more of my inspiration from cryptids than D&amp;D style monsters. Yetis/sasquatch/wendigo, sea/lake monsters similar to Nessie or Leviathan, rocs and so on exist. (My last entry into the writing contest here was about a leshy, or a forest spirit, which I made similar to a humanoid ent.) The cognate of 'harpy' when speaking ill of a harsh or cruel woman is 'roc', for instance. (I thought actual harpies would be a bit odd. Yetis can be passed off as apes with magical hair keeping them warm, just like there is a specific strain of mountain pony, the Carriger, which has similar magical hair, though a lot coarser than yeti hair, which is the equivalent of cashmere or karakul wool, and therefore the Carriger is more useful as a beast of burden than being shorn for textiles. But harpies would have to be sentient, and I specifically wanted humans to be the only sapient race.)\n\nSpirits and the undead exist. Rusalki are the spirits of people - men and women - who were murdered but got no justice, stalking the people who could obtain that justice for them (rather than the people who killed them). One of my characters in the third book is chased by the rusalka of the man he killed precisely because he could obtain justice simply by turning himself in, as well as by the disapproving spirits of his family that he can perceive naturally. Rusalki can't be seen by everyone, and given the nature of their deaths they can be pretty unpleasant beings to have attached to you. (Although the MC encounters a kinder one in the fourth book.)\n\nSpirits also incarnate. There's a supposition that some people have the spirits of angels. Named valkyries, they're usually unaware of their status and placed within an institution, like a prison, to guard the vulnerable. They might feel a presence within them helping them to overcome cowardice at opportune moments, but they are designed to be unobtrusive and inoffensive most of the time, until their moment of bravery needs to manifest itself.\n\nI also experimented with malicious homunculi summoned by a magician to off his political enemies, but this seems a little like something I can't give enough drawbacks to naturally enough for the characters to plausibly fight against them. In the first book they appeared it killed three people, but in the second book a woman who had studied theoretical magic showed her terrified friend how to banish it. I think I might have got the balance right, but expect a submission here to try and cement the idea when I come to editing those books.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390040640", "subreddit": "fantasywriters", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Shouldn't most if not all Atheists simply be Agnostic? It's my opinion that Atheism in itself is very much someone saying \"Well, there is no evidence so therefore I must be correct, there is no God.\"\r\rWell, simply put: your \"opinion\" is wrong.\r\r*Most atheists* **are** *agnostic.*\r\r**Atheism is simply the lack of belief in gods.**\r\r Personally, I've never seen any evidence for, or heard a believable argument in favor of, the existence of gods. Thus, I don't hold the belief that they exist.\r\rDo you *believe in* bigfoot? The loch ness monster? Fairies or leprechauns? I doubt you do. I assume that you haven't been convinced by the claims that these things exist, right? Well, that's the position most atheists have about gods. You guys say they're real, but you've yet to convince us. So, we don't believe in god... and what's the English word for people who don't believe in god? \"Atheist.\"\r\rThere *are* atheists who claim that gods specifically \"cannot exist,\" but generally they're referring to specific gods (such as the Christian god) and the fact that these specific gods have paradoxical or self refuting qualities. Obviously anyone can think up a conceptualization of a \"god\" that can't be disproven. For example of un-disprovable gods just take a look at the flying spaghetti monster, the church of the invisible pink unicorn, or the wishy washy and vague god of the Unitarian. Anyhow, these particular atheists are referred to as \"strong,\" \"hard,\" or \"gnostic\" atheists, and they are a small subset/minority of atheists. Personally, although I often agree with many of the points they make, I believe identifying as such tends to actually cause more confusion than it clears up, and overall is a less important philosophical statement than making it clear that my overarching position is that I ultimately don't really *know* that there isn't a god, only that there isn't any compelling reason to think that there is. There are an infinite number of possibilities for ways in which reality could all be a grand illusion, but I can only operate within the parameters that my senses and reasoning will allow.\r\rAlso, as an aside, \"atheist\" isn't a proper noun, so it's actually incorrect to capitalize it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390046612", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's my standard response;\n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing.\n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390073967", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

After about a week of work doing a few houses in the neighborhood she noticed and signed up for her house to get serviced to. It seems she wanted a little bit more than the driveway serviced /cleaned because one day she invited me in. It was winter (obviously, given the situation) and she only had on a robe. For a guy my age people might wonder why i would find someone like her attractive, but she was busy, and i was /am very into milfs. Long story short, we had kinky sex (including some butt stuff). Unfortunately after a few times i regretted this because she started asking for money. It wasn't much and i thought it a bit weird. First she asked for a dollar and i thought that was extremely odd (since it was so small) and i gave it to her (in both ways). After a few more times this amount kept rising. Eventually i said no and she ripped off her fake skin revealing that she was the lochness monster and asked for 3.50. I said no and she asked me again, then I said \"That's right, I ain't givin' you no tree-fiddy, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!\" I had to leave her.

{"body": "So I would have an office in the back of the house.\n\nI spent probably 14hours a day out there as I was an official homeworker.\n\nI had a great salary and some savings that allowed me to say I was 'comfortable'.\n\nMy ex-wife would do the nice things e.g. bring me coffee, come say hi during the day.\nSlowly this stopped and she was spending a lot of time out with her mum or spending time with the kids (3).\n\nThe plan was, after having kids, my wife would go back to work. Kids cost a lot to raise andnmy savings where slowly being eaten away. \n\nSo my wife gets a weekend job and I look after the kids while she's in work. One weekend she comes home and tells me that she thinks we're confortable enough for her to stop work. I say she needs to continue contributing to the home/bills etc and we finally get down to the reason for her statement.  Her company was making her redundant and she didn't want to go back to looking for a job. She just wanted to spend time with the kids. \n\nFast forward about 12mths, and us growing further apart, I start to look closer at my finances. I'd never bothered before, because I was fortunate enough to not need to worry about that. The trigger for me looking, was after an argument with my wife who basically demanded I get a better job to support her and the family. \n\nMy answer to this was \"why don't you get a job...\"\nAnyway it turns out she had maxed out one of my credit cards on clothes and shoes and other crap that just wasnt necessary and it had gotten to the point now where she couldn't hide the letters because they where now calling to speak to me. \n\nSo my credit card is now 8k in debt. I go to my savings account to make a payment, as agreed with the credit card company to show \"good faith\" and the balance was only a couple of hundred, as opposed to thousand. \n\nI demand to know what has happened and again she tells me I should get a better job to support her and the kids. \n\nThis was the tipping point. \nAnother 12mths of me telling her that she should be working finally got out the issue of why she never wanted to try and get another job.  My wife had not been made redundant, but she was dismissed. The reason for dismissal was due to her poor attendance. The reason for her poor attendance was \"she was out shopping\".\n\nThis was the straw that broke the camels back and I decided enough was enough so I moved out.\n\nI've since started the divorce process and after asking my wife what she wants she told me she wants to keep the house,  the kids,  the car, i asked her if she wanted the shirt of my back, but instead she said she'd only need about tree fiddy.\n\nWell, it was about that time I noticed that this petite young woman was about forty feet tall, and was a creature from the paleolithic era!

{"body": "So, I go to public school in Oregon. Middle schoolers in Oregon have to take standardized tests in every core subject a few times every year. The tests were computerized and usually comprised of word-problems with multiple choice answers. While some students were able to speed through the exam, myself included, before the class period was over, others struggled on until class was over. I'd had a particularly irritating classmate try to fight me the previous day over nothing. Needless to say I was still bitter, he'd questioned my manhood. I had to get back at him. I knew that every student in my grade had a code that served as both username and password. The code was a conjunction of our first initial, last name, and our student ID number. I figured out his login info and waited until our test which was during our last class period. It was an Eighth grade general reading assessment if I remember correctly. I finished my test as fast as I could at the cost of a lesser test score and check on him over my shoulder. This lumbering idiot is barely half-way through his test and struggling. I log out of my user and return to the homepage of the testing program. Since a student canon lune on a single computer at a time, logging in to a user from one device logs that user out of any others. So, when I logged into his user, his computer was logged out and his progress on the test was erased. What makes it better is that the program only allows you to take any given test three times. After three attempts have been made, you are allowed the highest of the three scores. Our class had taken the test once before, but this asshole had been absent and opted not to make up the missed test when he got back. Since he was on the class list, he got a \"no-score\" and one of his three attempts was marked as having been used. Now, he'd lost another attempt. He, stupidly, decided to think nothing of it and log back in. I knew that I'd used up one of his three strikes, but not that he was already short of one. So, without hesitation, I logged him out again. He was locked out and couldn't take the test, at all. He was visibly upset. Fast forward a few weeks and I've almost forgotten about the whole ordeal, but he hasn't. I told the whole story to a friend, who accidentally started a telephone game that ended with him hearing the story word for word. I guess middle schoolers are dangerously good at the telephone game. He finds me at lunch and looks me dead in the eye and that's when I realized he was a large crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "The day before my uncle passed away we were visiting during a family get together. It was right before lunch and everyone was sitting around chatting while my aunt and mom were getting plates and everything ready. 6 of us were sitting in the living room when my uncle walks up from downstairs and takes a step or two in the living room. Myself along with 2 others were the only ones that saw him walk in, but the next thing that happened I still can't even understand. He walked a couple steps into the living room and then disappeared. I shit you not he just disappeared right there in front of us. My sister, another uncle, and I immediately stood up and looked at each other like we just saw what happened. We didn't even say a word, I instantly walked over to the door that lead downstairs and called my uncles name, he did answer and I and my other uncle ran down to see what was up. He was standing there holding a set of darts like he was about to come up and ask if anyone wanted to play. We stood there looking at each other for a good minute, him looking as confused at us as we were at him. My other uncle asked if everything was ok. He answered, yea, why, what's up?. I swear it was another minute or so until we could gather our thoughts. My uncle then mentioned that he felt kind of funny, but reassured us that he was ok. He then said, actually, I'm not ok, but if you guys could give me about tree fiddy I'd be feeling a lot better. It was about that time that I noticed that my uncle was about five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era. We promptly screamed for him to get out of there and never bother us again.

{"body": "* Lack of specialized education for gifted students\r\r* More funding for troubled students\r\r* Abstinence-only education\r\rIMHO there are many other issues, but these are the big 3. I'm a 17yo high school senior taking 5 AP classes. It amazes me how much money is put into the education of students who never try or have decided they will just drive trucks for a living (no offense to anyone who drives trucks). Personally, I think schools should be required to test all freshmen for intelligence and possible career opportunities. If your intelligence level is below a certain point, you should not be allowed to attend college. College should be free to those who score above a certain point. Anyone in the middle should be allowed to continue high school taking specialized courses for the career that they were best matched to. For example, I want to develop software. I have to take history and English classes because it is required. Why on earth should an engineer be forced to learn anything about the Paleolithic era, ancient Chinese dynasties, or the meaning of A Tale of Two Cities? I want to focus on my Java, Calculus, and Physics.\r\rNow, for sex-Ed. Because there is no mandatory education regarding birth control, nobody knows how to use it. Think about it, when you are given a new tool, do you really read the directions first? People are going to have sex. That's how it works. We should be taught how to use the tools given to us that help prevent unwanted pregnancies. Granted, there are definite religious issues with this idea, and parents should therefore be able to waive their child from this part of whatever class it would be taught in.\r\rFor anyone who may have been offended by my statements, feel free to discuss it with me.

{"body": "The summer between my junior and senior year of highschool, my family rented a house on the beach in North Carolina. I had just gotten done swimming, and was laying in the sand listening to my iPod, trying to get a little tan. My family went on a walk, but I decided to stay behind and take a nap. I'm half asleep at this point, and then over the music I heard someone yelling \"HELP\" and a woman screaming. I prop myself up with my elbows and see a woman on the shoreline frantically running about, so I ran over and asked her what was going on. She said that her son got pulled out really far by the riptide, and her husband went out to help him, but couldn't do it. I saw them waaaaay out there, far past where the waves were breaking, and like a dumbass, the first thing I did was pull my shirt off and run into the water, eventually switching to swimming. I swam the fastest I think I ever have and got there in about 45 seconds. And I was confused when I got there because the kid I was going out after was actually a 500 ft tall creature from the paleolithic era.... Just kidding. He obviously had a sort of developmental disorder and looked like an older guy in a kids body. Weird thing to see at that moment. His dad was older, and when I asked him if they were alright, he didn't even acknowledge me, so I grabbed the kid and started to swim back to shore. By this time, the lifeguard was on his way out, and a guy in a kayak was on his way over. Now, I'm a pretty good swimmer, never on the swim team, but I had been recreationally swimming for years and was in good shape. However, what I hadn't noticed was that the riptide was VERY bad, and it seemed like I was just going forward and being pulled right back. The lifeguard got there and helped the father, and we slowly made it back, although it was very difficult. About 30 people were standing around watching, and no one came and helped, which really pissed me off when I thought about it later. Even the guy in the kayak was staying ~20 feet away. Everyone started clapping when we got back, and I went and passed out by my umbrella. The college aged people nearby were telling the story to people that missed it, and they said something like \"yeah, that kid over there pulled his shirt off and hauled ass into the ocean and got there before the lifeguard. Fuckin crazy man!\" followed by some chick asking him why he didn't do anything lol. The only person from my family who wittnessed it was my aunt, who came back early and only saw me getting out of the water, but fortunately she had the camera and took a picture of me coming out of the water looking exhausted, which I used as my profile picture for months. \n\nI can't say for certain that they would've died without my help, as the lifeguard go out there pretty quickly, but they were clearly exhausted, and the lifeguard wouldn't easily be able to take both of them back.\n\nI like when I get to tell this story to girls.\n\nEDIT: It sounds kind of shitty for me to complain about, but the people that I rescued, or their family, never said thank you or anything.

{"body": "Just know all their arguments.\n\n1. **I believe so it is true! Faith!** The counters to this are obvious. Billions of people around the planet believe in tons of crazy things. Belief doesn't make reality. \n\n2. **There is morality and it must come from god!** This has multiple angles. First, is it moral because god says so? Then it's arbitrary and god could change it tomorrow by just changing his mind. Which he seems want to do quite often according to the bible. If god were to say murder was okay tomorrow, would the congregation change their mind on it? Doubt it. You could also point out that this supposedly \"objective and unchanging\" morality from god seems to have changed quite a bit throughout history. Christians used to think slavery was okay by the bible, for example. (And there's plenty of passages to support that) Also, why do many animal species appear to have a sense of morality as well? They share food, they cooperate, they take care of their sick and each other's children. And what kind of just god prescribes infinite damnation for finite crimes? Especially when the \"crime\" could be something as innocuous as not believing in something that has not a shred of evidence.\n\n3. The **\"Ontological\" argument.** There's a good chance if the person they pick is a hardened apologist, they'll know this and consider it a trump card of sorts. Just wiki it for an explanation and why it's so full of shit. It requires unevidenced assumptions and defines god in a pretty arbitrary way. It doesn't even prove the god of the Christian religion, it just asserts the existence of some being. And then once they've done that they think they can just get away with transforming it into the god the bible. A hilarious bait and switch. You could do the same with a sandwich or a unicorn. It proves *nothing*. \n\n4. **But we need god or our society will crumble!** Well, first bring up the fact that just because an idea is useful, doesn't make the idea true. Even if the idea of a god made for a better society, it is not even close to being evidence that god is real. Santa Claus gets children to behave, does that make him real? Of fucking course not. Moreover, you could point to the various studies and statistics showing just how happy, crime-free, prosperous, and caring that secular/atheist societies are.\n\n5. **But he's answered my prayers!** How do you know? How do you know it's not just coincidence? You heard a voice? Any other time someone says they heard a voice they get looks, put on medication, maybe even committed. And what prayers? To ace a test? Why do their prayers get answered but not people that are dying? Is god so petty? \n\n6. I'm assuming it's not a ridiculously crazy church full of creationists and such. If there are, you're going to have to brush up on all of science basically. Evolution, the Big Bang theory, Abiogenesis. Good luck.\n\nDon't forget to make it expressly clear that they have the burden of proof. Come up with some examples. Claim that you believe in a god of a now defunct religion. Claim that you have faith and that's all you need. Ask if they just take you at your word. Ask why you should take them at theirs. \"You just should!\" is no reason. \n\nMaybe they'll pull out some miracles. Ask for evidence. Bring up things like UFO's, Bigfoot, Yeti's, the Loch Ness Monster, dragons. People used to believe they saw dragons. Eyewitness accounts are pretty worthless without supporting evidence. So unreliable. \n\nI think what you've gotta do is know what they're going to throw at you. Shouldn't be hard. They haven't come up with anything new in forever. Because you can't when your beliefs are fucking bogus and ridiculous and based on nothing but superstition and nonsense. Then come up with some examples, analogies, to illustrate why that *shit is bogus and superstitious nonsense.* Simple and easy to digest analogies.

{"body": "I was an introvert mostly throughout High School. I didn't go to many parties, nor did I have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked.\n\nUnfortunately, I had 0 skills on picking up girls even though I was trying really hard to get a girl.\n\nIn 11th grade there was a party around my school's christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it. I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.\n\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where. I still remembered her name though, Vanessa. She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\n\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me. I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\n\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible. She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back. I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\n\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of. Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\"\n\nI started saying more things.\n\nShe laughed even more.\n\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl. But then it dawned on me. I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where. A strip club. Vanessa was a stripper. Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.\n\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously. My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once. I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\n\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"\n\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\n\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house. This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue. I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself.\n\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\n\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone. A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms. I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside.\n\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\n\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off Vanessa's clothes. Finally, she was fully naked, as was I. She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.\n\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\". Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\" I couldn't believe it. This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin. I still can't believe it. I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock. She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to. I told her I was a virgin too and she said good. As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\" \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\n\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life.

Sad time for us all.\n\nThere was one last hope though, our doctor was apparently part of some medical testing group that had their hands on a new type of treatment for the cancer that was similar to chemotherapy but didn't have as bad of side effects as the other, more commonly used chemotherapy had.\n\nSo, we decided we'd give it a shot, we didn't have much to lose anyways.

Everyone in our family was overjoyed.\n\nBack at the doctors office, I was worrying and worrying over what the bill was going to be, I mean.. new treatment.. not only that but it worked.. and extremely well at that.\n\nThe doctor came up to me and I asked, \"So, will my insurance cover any of the costs?\" and he replied, \"yes, most of it actually.\" I was relieved,but who knows how much money would be left...

{"body": "And you're ignoring the fact that the idea of romanticism and over-romanticism has nothing to do with these \"facts\" that you're writing about.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nWestern cultures tend to *over-romanticize* Africa as a majestic, mysterious place of tribal people, shamanism, and simplicity. Whist it is a *fact* that some Africans still live in tribes, practice shamanism, and live relatively simplistic lives, that is not the *reality* of the continent as a whole. Almost 50% of Africans live in highly urbanized areas and the vast majority practice either Christian or Islamic based religions.\n\nMy point is that whilst Helen Keller may have been an amazing person, I think that over-blowing her as one of the greatest people in American history is what makes her, if you bend the definition of the word far enough, a modern day myth. She's severely over-romanticized. She's one of the historical American figures that everyone of every age knows of, up there with the likes of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein (yes, he was an American citizen), and MLK Jr. These four literally changed the ways things in this country, and even things around the world, were viewed and looked at. However, Helen Keller was a deaf/blind woman who supposedly wrote some books and gave some lectures (again, I seriously doubt she did either alone without extreme amounts of guidance, regardless of what your Mark Twain's and such wrote about her). She simply shouldn't be viewed in the same light as those people who helped shape the country and the world.\n\nThe reason I posed this question and then quickly followed up with this idea of Helen Keller being a myth was to challenge people to think outside of the box of something like \"Santa Claus\" or \"The Loch Ness Monster\". And because I was gauging ideas from a wider audience about a paper I need to write within the next... 5 hours or so.\n\nBut you actually did enough to throw me from trying to convince my TA that Helen Keller can be skewed as a modern-day myth if viewed in a certain light. Instead, I think I might float the idea of \"Charles Manson's genius\" as the \"myth\" I'm looking to delve in to. Ya know, since there's this cult following (on the internet at least) that Charles Manson is actually a super-genius rather than a severely deranged psychopath.\n\nAnyways, you forced me to look a little further into Helen Keller's antics, and whilst I still don't fully believe that everything she did was totally of her own doing, I can say that I know a little bit more about Helen's life at the very least.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390386449", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, created an alt account just for this. Under the guise of Internet anonymity and IP proxy, I'm letting out my story. \n\nI've stolen over $8000 by shoplifting from Walmart and various other stores over the last year and a half. I don't really regret what I've done, but I do feel sorry for corrupting several of my friends by showing them how easy thievery is. If I ever get caught by the authorities, I'll probably have less than $50 of merchandise on me at the time and get almost no punishment compared to how much I'm really \"worth\". \n\n#**The First Step**\n\nIt started two years ago, when I was 15 years old. My mother had just been putting some clothes away and looked in my sock drawer, discovering my mildly impressive stockpile of Swiss Rolls and jelly beans that I had bought in bulk and slowly eaten away. She confiscated it all and took my wallet so I wouldn't be able to buy more. I was, of course, devastated. I wanted candy, but what could I do with no money? The answer came to me a week later while at Rite Aid picking up some batteries for my dad. I had his card, so any purchases would be registered, but what if I didn't purchase the candy? This was a crazy idea, of course. The cameras would see me. The cashier would see me. The bulge under my shirt would be obvious, and the crinkling would sound like a goddamn earthquake. None of it mattered, of course. I fucking NEEDED that sugar, so I grabbed the smallest bag of sour worms I could and hurried to the back of the store. Under the guise of crouching to look at band-aids, I surreptitiously tucked the bag into my waistband. Though I was insanely nervous, I walked up to the cashier, paid for my batteries, and left. I was giddy yet terrified. I had a way to get free candy any time I wanted! However, there was a nagging doubt in the forefront of my mind, constantly informing me that I had just stolen something. Committed a crime. Broken the law. But I shook it off. I was a bad-ass! And so I merrily proceeded home, full of vigor and soon to be full of candy. \n\n#**Learning the Ropes**\n\nOver the next two months, I was constantly learning. Whenever I biked to a friend's house, I would stop at Rite-Aid and pick up some goods. I began taking a string bag for higher food capacity, and with it, I started grabbing larger items. Bottles of soda, bags of beef jerky. Even small bags of chips. I learned that the black camera domes were not all seeing eyes, but merely contained one camera that faced one direction, and with that knowledge found blind spots in the camera coverage. One spot right between the soda fridge and the candy aisle was particularly well used. I was getting bolder. I would grab extra for friends and once even stole a fairly expensive bottle of deodorant. I was the king of thieves, and Rite-Aid was my domain. Even though I had been trusted with a wallet again, I would usually just walk out the front door of the store without even buying anything. I had learned something in that time: most people really didn't care what happened in the store so long as it didn't stare them in the face. The cashiers would ignore crackling in my bag and customers would make up an excuse for the shoveling noise in the other aisle *as long as they didn't see a thing*. They were complacent. I was complacent. Life was good. \n\n#**Gotta Get Em' All**\n\nAt this point, I was confident in my ability to steal from Rite-Aid. I was almost bored. However, meanwhile something new developed. Several of my friends began playing Magic: The Gathering at school during lunch. I wanted in, but had no money to get cards with. That would change. A couple weeks later, I was looking for a book at Books-a-Million when I noticed a card rack. Dozens of packs of cards from every expansion you could imagine. I had a purpose again. I worried about the foil packs which could have tripped the door alarms, but I stayed calm. I took a half dozen packs, tucked them into my back pockets, and went into a bathroom stall. I took them out of each pack, tucked the cards in my bag, and left the store. I was ecstatic. Candy was one thing, but cards could be worth real money! With my excitement, the naggling doubt was back. This was a whole new level of crime. But if I stayed calm and followed a procedure, I could do this. \n\n#**The Fat Pack**\n\nThis is a small chapter, but a major milestone in my progression of crimes. One day, when I came back to Books a Million, something new was there. A nine deck fat pack with deck box and D20. I had to have it. One small catch: there was a SpiderWrap alarm on the box. I had to loosen it before I could get the cards out. I took the box, tucked it into a lower shelf of the Bible aisle, and began slowly loosening the packaging. It took almost twenty excruciating minutes of slow work, worrying every time some woman came through to pick up a new bible. Finally, I got it. I was in the big leagues now. I was ready for large merchandise. \n\n#**Walmart**\n\nAt this point, I was 16 years old and had built up a large stockpile of cards. I finally had a driver's license, and with it I decided to try stealing from Walmart. I had heard on the internet that Walmart had almost no asset protection and was easy to steal from. I gave it a try. I grabbed two fat packs of Magic cards, several bags of jelly beans, and some other food. I found a corner and stripped the packaging, tossed everything in my bag, and walked out. This was easy! I wanted to take advantage of the hilariously bad security, so I decided to move up to larger items. The next time I went \"shopping\", I grabbed a cart as I went in, stocked it with several nerf guns and various consumables, and just walked out the front door once again. No second glances, no concerns, no security. I had an infinite storehouse of free stuff, with no danger. I figured I could get literally any item in the store, and decided to test my hypothesis. One day, I just walked through the store and passed the electronics section. What was the harm? Once again, I had reached a milestone in shoplifting. I saw a nice gaming mouse. Grabbed it. A new pair of headphones. Grabbed them. A new iPod case? Grabbed it. I didn't care anymore, I just stole whatever I wanted, and once again walked out casually. No alarms, no watchful employees. No accountability. I was *truly* living the high life now.\n\n#**Parental Evasion**\n\nAt this point, I was acquiring things more valuable and conspicuous than mere bags of candy. I needed an alibi for my parents. Though I was able to explain away Magic card packs and decent headphones, if their son started using a brand new $80 gaming mouse they would become suspicious for sure. So I created a fake Ebay account, listed my stolen items, and began \"bidding\" on them. Yeah, mom! Look at this great deal I got on a mouse! Here's the page, and he even has a gaming keyboard for cheap too! I abused their trust, but I had to prevent suspicions from arising somehow. While I was waiting to \"buy\" items, I would stash them in our attic, as there was a ventilation shaft between it and my closet that I could push things through. When the items would be \"shipped\", I would place the boxes outside after the mailman dropped packages and be sure to retrieve them before my parents noticed the lack of shipping materials. As long as I kept control of the situation, everything would be OK.\n\n#**Introducing a Newbie**\n\nOne time, when I wanted to go shoplifting, a friend decided to tag along. At this point, I had kept it my own secret, and decided that when we got to Walmart I would reveal the truth: I wasn't going to be buying anything, but I would be getting things anyway. He freaked out. He refused to believe me that the process was easy and risk free and refused to stay near me when I walked out of the store. He tagged along several times after that, and eventually asked me to grab several items for him. I felt proud that I had something to offer for him and that I was excercising the spirit of giving. I fancied myself Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Eventually, my friend began making his own cart, filling it with fervor. I'm glad I have a partner in crime, but I often wish I never dragged him into this whole thing. If I get caught for good, I never want anyone else to come to harm.\n\n#**Falling into a Routine**\n\nAt this point, me and my friend went shoplifting several times a week, grabbing whatever we thought would be fun to have. We've stolen Nerf guns, had one fight, and then thrown them away. We've grabbed a half dozen mobile speakers and tested their merit, and thrown every single one away afterwards. We just don't care anymore. There's no risk. We've covered every angle. And so we developed some rules. Only steal from large chains, no hurting small shopkeepers. Only give up to three things to other friends to keep our crime ring small and keep others out of harm's way. And so we just steal and steal and steal. Whatever we want, whatever we need. With no risk, we often end up stealing more than we could ever need and leave 20 pounds of valuables on the side of the road. \n\nI wish I could end this with tree fiddy, with some silly joke, but it's real. I've done all of it. Sometimes, I feel like Patrick Bateman, just hoping beyond hope for some sort of end to it all, some sort of punishment. But then I listen to music through my high end headphones, type and game on my mechanical keyboard, and look at the dozens of disks I could plug into my Xbox at any time, eat my endless chips and candy, and I know I won't stop. I wish I could say I hate doing it. I wish I could say that I lay awake at night and hate myself. But I don't. I like free stuff. It doesn't bother me one bit what I have to do to get it. Often times, when I go shoplifting with my friend, it barely occurs to me that we're stealing. We're just shopping, and the part where we walk out before paying is implied. I barely think of it as crime. \n\nSo there. That's my story of criminal mastermind. My trip down the path to criminality.

{"body": "Not exactly how we met, but it's a nice story.\n\nWe had dated once before, but it hadn't really ended well. We remained friends, but it was a little icy for a while. Eventually, through some extra curriculars, we grew closer again. We just became super good friends, and left it at that. \n\nI dated a few girls in between, but they never really felt right. Something was always missing, and I didn't know what. My junior year of High School I dated a girl a grade below me. We had a good passion, but other than a few makeout sessions, we didn't have enough in common. It just wasn't working.\n\nDuring this time, my ex and I were still close, and talking. She had a huge crush on me, but didn't want to act on it while I was in a relationship. I liked her too, but I was fighting it. I didn't want to go down that road after I had been burned before. \n\nEventually I broke up with my girlfriend, and had to accept the fact that I liked my ex. I facebooked her and asked her to meet me the next day after school. We met up in a changing room, and she asked me what I wanted to tell her. I poured out all of my feelings, like how I liked her, my lack of passion in other relationships, how much I fought to not like her, ect. She stayed quiet through most of it, letting me have my say. After about 10 minutes, there was some silence. I told her that if it was too late, I'd understand and not bring it up again.\n\nSuddenly she stood up and kissed me. Hard. It wasn't making out, but I had hadn't felt a passion like that in ages. She was breathing hard, she was just as excited as I was.\n\nAs she kissed me, she sudden;y pulled back a little, and whispered something in my ear that I will never forget:\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nThat's when I realized that the girl I had been in love with for half a year was actually a 300 foot tall monster from the prehistoric era!

{"body": "Hi, I have things to say about my cat. But I won't talk about the cat right now, since I'm going to talk about jacob. Jacob was my friend, but he died yesterday. It was kinda sad, he wasn't killed by someone or anything, he just has a brain tumor that finally put him to sleep. Jacob found out about it eight of days ago, when he passed out during a game of hockey with me and my friends. We though he might have just taken one too many hits and had a concussion. The doctor however, knew otherwise. Within three hours our stop to make sure our friend was going to be okay was met with crippling realization that it was most certainly not. The doctor gave him two weeks, but he didn't even last that much. \n\nTwo days ago it was just me and him, on what would be his death bed. We were talking about all the great times we had. My favorite was when he finally pressured me into going on the Top Thrill Dragster in Cedar Point, it took hours and hours for me to even get in line. His favorite was a time that we both had gone to get pizza after the 2010 superbowl, and the waitress had bet us that if we could eat a whole pizza each and then chug a half gallon of milk within an hour, then the meal was free. I don't think I've ever thrown up that much in my life. Through the years, I've known him as my very best friend. But as I watched him fade away in what felt like a blink of an eye, all the time I wouldn't be able to see him became what would I know is going to hurt the most now that he's gone. \n\nYesterday he died. I'll never, ever forget his last words. He talked about how glad he was I stayed with him until the end. He never had a family, and was an orphan all his life. I was all he considered his family. I nearly broke down, but kept talking to him, trying to tell him how much of a friend he has been all these years. He was never mean, never ungrateful, and had never even asked for anything from me. He was just glad that I was a part of his world. \n\nI could tell he was about to go, he started to flatline, then recover, then fade, then recover. I called for the nurse. \"I don't need a nurse anymore, NikolaTesla1.\" He said. \"I only need a fr...\" He faded again. \"What do you need Jacob?\" I was sobbing at this point. \"I'm right here buddy, anything you need, I'm right here.\" Jacob faded in once more and said' \"I.. Imma need about tree fiddy.\" I stared, mouth agape, as I realized my lifelong friend had actually been a dinosaur from the Messesoic Era. \"God dammit, Nessie!\" I yelled as he finally flatlined. He was dead. \n\nThe funeral is tomorrow, but I still wonder how they fit a 80 ton dinosaur into a normal sized hospital room.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390449498", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The whole platoon was silent while Sgt. Shaftoe reminded them the objectives. \n\n\"TWENTY SECONDS TO DISEMBARKING, YOU'LL RECIEVE HEAVY FIRE FROM THE BUNKERS AT YOUR 2 AS YOU REACH THE COVER IN FRONT OF YOU SO BE DAMN QUICK!\"\n\nHis voice was muffled by the mortar fire at the beach while speaking. He tried to gaze their landing spot over the ship door, planning where to sprint and where to cover. He felt again that strange heaviness in his guts, the same feeling he got in Dunkirk. The Sword of Damocles swinging over his head. The feeling of time slowing down as the adrenaline kicks in.\n\nThe boat stops abruptly as the front hull makes contact with the sand in the surf zone. A deafening sound as the ramps fall to the sand. \n\n\"MOVE MOVE MOVE\"  \n\nHis muscles are burning as he sprints, the humid sand of the surf zone sticks to his boots. He has to jump over something, was that a body? He hears some metallic and repetitive sound behind him as he makes it to the first cover under an anti-tank defense. As he looks back where the sound is coming, he can see sparks over the hull of his boat, and half a dozen of bodies in the trail he had just sprinted. \n\nHalf of the unit has taken cover in the back of the boat, where the MG42 placed in the german bunker cant reach them at all.\n\n \"Tuktuktuktuktuk\", Hitler's Buzzsaw they called them, and the motherfucker operating that very one was giving hell to the boat \"Tuktuktuktuk\". \n\nHe can hear the sailor in charge shouting them to charge to the beach, but the platoon is terrified.   \nA wave lifts the boat from behind, which keels to the right, and the cover in the boat vanishes. One of the new replacements of the unit is in front, and Sgt Shaftoe sees the first tracer bullet hitting his chest and four holes appear in his torso, spraying blood over the ramp. \n\nShaftoe sees the blood spraying from the wounds, and time feels like is slowing down again. He thinks of a coin dropping from your hand, as he always does when he gets this perception of time, spanning over an instant.\n\nHe expects the blood drops to suddenly accelerate as his mind tries to recover from whatever causes this sensation. But this time the feeling seems to last longer. The blood and salty water drops are now moving so slow that Shaftoe barely percieves the movement. Are those moving at all? \n\nHe realizes the silence. \n\nNot a complete silence... he can hear himself breathing.\n\nBut the boy is frozen in the deck of the boat, with an expression of pure terror, one of the tracers is frozen as well. In mid air, at aproximately 4 feet from the boy. The tracer is glowing and leaving some sparks in the air, and there is more. Shaftoe can see four bullets frozen as well. \n\nHe is paralized, and tries to move his arm. His body moves, but it's like moving underwater. Every movement is like overcoming an opposing pressure against his movement. \n\nHe looks back at the beach and this strange effect is happening everywhere. He can't see anyone else moving. \n\n\"ANYONE CAN HEAR ME?\" \n\nHe shouts, but his voice sounds strange, he can't hear any echo and his pitch sounds lower than ever. He waits for a response in vain, with the only sound of his respiration breaking the horrible silence. Against his common sense, that screams to duck the fuck up, he wakes up and runs to the next cover, expecting to hear the sound of a k98 sniping at him as he was the only moving object at the omaha beach right now. \n\nBut no gunshots are heard. \n\nSo Shaftoe keeps sprinting, towards the sandbags nest that covers the path to the bunkers where a german machine-gun is frozen in firing. He has to take advantage of this shit while it lasts, so he jumps to the top of the sandbags and points his rifle to the german gunner.\n\nPulls the trigger. The firing pin hits the bullet, and Shaftoe glazes in surprise as there is no detonation from his rifle. No effect. Nothing. \n\nHe pulls his knife and tries to kill the gunner but the skin is hardened and his knife cant make a single cut on the gunner's neck. Shaftoe is raging against the german, hitting the gunner's face with the butt of his garand with the same effect as the shot and the knife. \n\nHe starts shouting in rage as he drops the rifle and starts hitting him with his fists until exhaustion. Shaftoe misses a fist and falls on top of the machinegun, breathless.\n\nHe runs towards the beach, moving from soldier to soldier, trying to shake them. Trying to wake them from this frozen spell. \nHe makes it to his landing boat, and he tries to move the replacement he was seeing when the time froze. He tries with all of his mates with no effect. \n\nShaftoe tries to run to the beach again while panicking, but he bumps into something. \n\nOne of his mates lays dead in the front of the landing ramp. He must've been shot when he was sprinting to the first cover. He realizes his face was hit directly from the machinegun fire, and is now a mess of open flesh and bone.\n\nShaftoe turns pale as he sees the soldier's tag on the chest of the faceless dead soldier, as he reads in open voice \"Sgt. Shaftoe\"\n\n\n\nNote: uberpredictable ending... but it could have been worse, as I was at first thinking of making a tree fiddy ending...\n\nEDIT: Whoa! Cake day!

{"body": "I am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing.\n\nI call myself an atheist to denote that I am not a theist. \n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n\nWhat is your single best evidence for the existence of a god?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390530178", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

There is evidence of a general decline in health in some areas; whether the decline was caused by dietary change is debated academically.[9][170][171]\n\nIf it sounds like I'm mad, it's because I am.

It's really hard to tell.\n\nYou mostly seem to respond based on emotion and outrage, rather than rational contemplation of what I am suggesting.\n\nMy belief, as shared by authors such as Ted Kaczynski, is that modern life is essentially unsatisfying for the masculine psyche, because autonomous risk taking has largely been eliminated from life. \n\nKaczynski for example cites the fact that men in the frontier territories used to be able to resolve disputes among one another through conflict, which they actually preferred over having government take over the role of conflict-mediator. In today's society, a guilty party is sought and thrown in jail. One reason modern society abhors the death penalty and only applies it after years of imprisonment is because the threat of long imprisonment and continual rape is far more worrisome to men than the death penalty. It's well known that attempted suicide rates in prison are extremely high. The reason for this is because modern society uses all means available in an effort to reduce conflict between people, as conflict is economically destructive.\n\nI believe that the golden age of masculinity was the paleolithic era, when multiple different species of hominid all coexisted on our planet and giant megafauna existed that men would hunt for food.\n\n&gt;One of the big ones is that risky behavior isn't inherently a masculine trait, nor is my masculinity being threatened. Whatever it includes, the concept of masculinity is a social construct. To borrow Sartre's terminology, a man precedes his masculinity. Don't tell me what qualities I need to embody or exhibit to be a man.\n\nThis is the crux of your argument. You're essentially suggesting that masculinity doesn't exist. I don't agree with you here, as an abundance of scientific literature reveals that men have a different personality and different interests than women.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390583496", "subreddit": "lostgeneration", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My brother hired a PI back in 2007, He didn't know where else to turn. He travels a lot for work so he's not home much. His wifes name is well...let call her Hannah, She's not very good with computers so their daughter helped her set up skype so they could talk every single night over webcam. After about a month she started getting on there every other day. Eventually he was lucky to talk to her once a week. Whenever he asked her about it she would just say \"I'm tired\" or some shitty excuse. \n\nHe was so upset I didn't feel like I could offer much help over the phone. He couldn't just fly home and fix things though, he needed the money for his daughters medical bills, she was hit by a car when she was six and had to have brain surgery. I did the only thing I thought I could do I went over to his house to check on Hannah and their daughter Haley. I showed up at about 11 after I got off of work. When I knocked on the door Haley answered and let me in, there was some talking in the kitchen so I headed in there. Hannah was talking to a man across the counter, turns out he's just her boss, that's cool, we get to talking and everything seems fine, he's even got a wedding ring. I call my brother the next day when I'm at the airport (I'm heading out with my SO to see her family this day btw so I wasn't able to do anything at this point). He tells me his wife's boss...is a woman. So I fronted him some money and told him to hire a PI cause it didn't look right, so he did. I gave him the number of a PI my friend told me about, Gary. This guy was a badass, PI for 8 years, was a detective before that, bodybuilder, Marine, you name it. Gary's the best and that's why he's not cheap but my friend managed to talk him into taking payments instead of paying him everything at one time. \n\nAfter a few days my brother got a call from Gary. Gary told him he had pictures of Hannah going into a motel with that bastard. My brother booked a flight straight home, he had to figure this out. Turns out Hannah had been fucking almost every guy in her office. They ended up getting a divorce and she got custody of Haley. This on top of all of the medical bills and being out of a job meant my brother was screwed. I wasn't exactly loaded on cash right now but I told him I'd help pay off Gary since he was still working on that. I went in to see Gary the next day to pay him the rest of what my brother owed him. My wife was pissed that it was going to be a lot but I assured her we could handle it, this was my brother I couldn't just leave him hanging like that. I got to talking with Gary and he said my brother hadn't been keeping up with his payments. So I replied \"what do you need?\"  he said \"I need about tree fiddy\" Now it was around this time that I realized this that Gary was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \n\nMy brother ended up getting custody after two years of waiting and gathering up evidence to use against her. He's a great father and even through all of this he managed to come out on top.\n\nTL;DR Don't get a job where you need to travel and please watch your kids when they're outside.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390630770", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I closed my eyes. Ha! I'm lying. I couldn't keep my eyes open. I could feel the steering wheel. In that distant part of my mind, my thoughts were clear. This is a steering wheel. This is where the key goes. This is the gas pedal. This is the brake. This is the key. If I stick it in there and turn, the car starts. If I pull this handle down to the big *D*, the vehicle will move forward. In that part of my mind, alcohol couldn't touch it. I knew what I was doing, but the piece of my mind that listens and obeys was in a different part. \n\n*We are not driving this car. We are way to drunk.* I didn't stutter. I know exactly what I said. I was in that clear part of my brain when I said it, but that other part didn't speak sober-ese. He spoke drunken-ese. He did the exact opposite of what I told him to do. *We are not driving this car.*\n\n*Fuck you.* The other part shouted back. *You're not the boss of me.* He yanked the shifter down and hit the gas. The car jerked backwards with the sound of barking tires and slammed into a dumpster.\n\n*Dumb ass.* The lucid part cried.\n\n*Shut up. I got this.* The other part replied.\n\nHe most certainly did not have this. He managed to put the car in drive and tore off down the street. The lucid part watched the entire length of the trip and if that part had hands, it would have been gripping my brain stem in fear. We collided with one brick mail box, ran over another on a pole, sideswiped an off-duty cab and after that, the lucid part of my brain gave up and closed its eyes. We didn't open them again till morning.\n\nThankfully, I woke up in charge again. The other part of my brain was gone and the lucid one was now in charge. I was in a hospital bed, and I was congratulated upon waking by the mayor of the city. He thanked me for a job well done. A firefighter showed up next and broke down in tears promising me anything I wanted. Evidently, I had saved his brother. So many people showed up to thank me in the first hour, I realized I must have saved a lot of people. \n\n\"Excuse me, why is everybody thanking me?\" I asked that question a dozen times and everybody gave me a different answer. When the hospital finally released me, I was met by the press as I left the building. They kept asking me how it felt to be a hero. \n\n*Do you have any plans to speak on a circuit about what you did? Did you plan this before hand? Did you know the girl? What's  your favorite color? How did you get dog to obey? Were you seriously hurt after the fall? There's conflicting accounts of what really happened. Was there three midgits and a clown or three clowns and a midgit? Do you feel guilty killing the Loch Ness Monster so shortly after proving her existence? Do you and Big Foot have a love child together?*\n\nIt was all a bit confusing. I went home to sleep on it. The next morning, I was all over the news. I saw the video footage from the scene. God as my witness, I can't explain how I got my car to the top of the St. Louis Arch, or why I would have wanted to. The lecture offers started pouring in three days later. They were really generous. I could live like a king, profitting off what I did, but I don't know what it was.\n\nWhat I do know is that beautiful women want to have sex with me on purpose and sober. I never got another parking ticket after that day, and cops pull me over to shake my hand. There are bobble heads of me in the check out lines at ever grocery store I enter and most of them either have me holding the Loch Ness Monster's head, standing with Big Foot in holy matrimony, or surrounded with dead clowns and midgits.\n\nIt's all very disconcerting.

{"body": "It was a cold Tuesday evening and it had recently snowed a good couple of inches. On these evenings I usually like to walk my German Shepard, Ivan, to the park and enjoy the snowy fields together. I get to the park and not a single person was there. The snow was fresh and untouched by anyone. When there is no one at the park, I take my dog off the leash so he can roam at his own desire, while I follow him keeping an eye out for a person walking so I could call my dog back to me and put his leash back on him. He does his usual rounds of sniffing various trees and lamp posts while I was in search of a stick to play fetch with. I find a fallen branch that must have came loose in the winds of the winter storm the night before and break it to a size that Ivan could manage. We come to a clearing and I started to toss the stick. Ivan would bring it back. Repeat. After a couple of minutes of doing this I hear a whistle blowing in the distance behind me, so I call my dog to me and I leash him and turn to inspect what the whistling was. Down the path I see a cop on a bicycle with lights flashing and whistle blowing coming my way. Like, this guy is hauling ass through a couple of inches of snow on his bike, blow his whistle like a mad man. He skids to a stop in front of me and asks if this was my dog. I told him that it was, and then I asked if there was a problem.      \n\nThe police officer asked whether or not I knew of the leash laws in this city and began describing how much of a danger it was for me to have him off the leash. I calmly tell the officer that I was sorry and that no one was in the park and my dog is well disciplined so I didn't think that I was causing any harm, but the officer wasn't having any of it. Then the officer starts to radio in for saying there was a man in the park with an aggressive dog and needed animal control. Here is where I start to panic, because is the least aggressive animal I know, my parrot is more aggressive than him. I try to plea with the officer saying that this wasn't necessary but the officer claimed I was resisting his enforcement and threatened to handcuff me. He started describing what animal control does to aggressive dogs and I started to not be able to hold myself back. I yelled at him. \"What do you want from me?!\" He goes, \"I need about tree fitty.\" It was at this time I noticed that this police officer was about 500 ft tall and from the palaeolithic era and I told that damn Loch Ness monster that I ain't gonna give him no god-damn tree fitty and turned around, grabbed the leash, and ran straight for home.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390722297", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute. A few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars is a lot of money for me, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok. So, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\" Now it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

It might not do as well as a original content gif of one of us doing a 540 noseblunt slide, but it has it's place on the sub. \n\n2. Modified gear: home-made decks, new deck art, spraypainted trucks, board chop/overhaul.\n\n3. basically OC. you made it/did it, you deserve submission points. \n\nVery strong suggestion for DGT posts include (with mod redirect help):\n\n1. Any new youtube/vimeo video that's *NOT* OC.\n\n2. Any screenshotted image of landy snapchat, or instantgramz. \n\n3. NEW GEAR! let's all be stoked on your new nessie ^(in the DGT)\n\n4.

I still want to be stoked for your new gear though. And it does create discussion. I think a redirect to DGT would keep things real.\n\npossible downsides to this method include:\n\n1. huge submission number in DGT makes it too saturated\n\n2. people who post later in the day get buried\n\n3. hard to refind a topic once buried (especially if on mobile)\n\nsolutions to downsides include:\n\n1. sort by new\n\n2. sort by new\n\n3. save comment before moving on if it's interesting (unsave it when it becomes uninteresting)\n\nthis is a discussion so let's hear your proposals, pros/cons, other solutions, etc. \n\nJust trying to make this sub the best ever.

{"body": "First if all in what world does everyone agree about some higher power existing? I certainly have never experienced anything supernatural. There are millions of people through all time who haven't. Most religious societies are not freedom loving \"just tell us honestly what you feel\" but rather places where people from a young age are taught god exists and that you should feel his presence. Some undoubtedly legitimately do for any number of reasons. But many people fake it or convince themselves they feel it just because of the pressure to conform. \n\nIn any event I do not believe that babies are injected with some ghost serum. But they are often raised in families that prop up these stories as real life. And humans are pretty gullible and will believe a lot of nonsense so long as it is told in a convincing way. But when there is not physical evidence to back it up there is no compelling reason to buy into it. Modern medicine stands on a wealth of observable and reproducible data. So does gravity and solution. Ghosts have no such formal proof. \n\nWhich is not to say they're impossible just that there is not reason to think they do exist. There is no proof that the Loch Ness monster doesn't exist but we have no real evidence that it does so believing in it is pretty pointless. \n\nBasically, you reject those parts of the bible that you know beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be true.

{"body": "**TL;DR: The internet is a very scary place for young girls and you should be insanely careful about what you post on reddit and anywhere else.**\n\nI have never posted nude pics online but I have an incredibly disturbing story to tell about a girl who posted to /r/gonewild that I recognized. I have been thinking hard lately about whether or not I ever want to share this story with reddit and this seems like a pretty good thread to share it in. For all of you /r/gonewild girls out there and those of you who have thought about posting nude photos of yourself, let this serve as a cautionary tale...\n\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\n\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\n\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was. \n\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to /r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was *insanely* open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about. \n\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her /r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\" \n\n\nNot only did I walk away without any extortion money, I didn't get any new nudes from her which is what I was holding out for more than anything else. The only good thing about the failed sextortion deal is that she never contacted the FBI which works out perfectly for me because if she did, I wouldn't have been able to share this cautionary tale with all of you wannabe /r/gonewild gals out there. I was seriously bummed about not getting any more exclusive jerk-off material from this bodacious babe but c'est la vie no smoking hot gonewild noodz 4 me :( Just remember this, girls: If you're gonna get your tits out for the lads, don't show your face. \n", "gilded": 5, "created_utc": "1390776456", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1916, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Thing is, many atheists are fully familiar with religious practice, even what it means to believe truly.\n\nI feel like this is probably one of the largest hurdles that a view like hers would have to overcome.  It seems clear that there are atheists who *have* been immersed in religious practice, who understood and have been fully committed to the truth of the claims made about God in the practice, and have even had equally powerful religious experiences as other religious believers (though I'm not sure that the number of atheists who fit all three qualifications is particularly high).  Many religious believers want to say here that, despite appearances, these atheists never *really* knew God, but this seems ad hoc.  \n\nIf I were Armstrong, I'd probably want to say that they had experiences of the same transcendent reality, but for some reason or another felt as if the religious practice they were engaged in as a whole had to go, and thus threw the baby out with the bathwater so to speak.  This would seem particularly reasonable in fundamentalist religion with an unshakable commitment to beliefs, either ethical or empirical, that are clearly unreasonable.  Religious belief here would have to be an all-or-nothing affair and so, in the process of ridding oneself of all the false beliefs and misguided practice one also rids themselves of the practices and the aspects of beliefs reflecting some real transcendent truth.\n\n&gt;Does the God only exist in this practice, or does it exist as an independent entity?\n\nThis is an important and difficult question, and I don't think the answer is going to be entirely straight-forward.  Armstrong does say, that God is \"not alien to human beings but inseparable from our humanity,\" but I certainly don't think that she wants to say that God is *identical* to a particular idea or practice.  She want's to say that these practices *really are* accessing *something* even if it would not make sense to look at this thing outside of these practices.\n\nSo that's certainly weird, especially when we consider other claims about the existence of things.  The claim that God exists seems on the face of it like many other claims about the existence of something that we might make or reject, and, in most of these cases, we don’t care about the practices surrounding a claim when we investigate whether it’s true.  If we want to know whether the Loch Ness Monster exists, for example, we shouldn’t worry about the practices that people who believe in the Loch Ness Monster engage in.  We shouldn’t get hung up on the details of all the Loch Ness Monster boat tours that excited tourists go on.  What we should do is look at whatever evidence there is, see what the most probable explanations for the photos and reported sightings are, and, if we can, simply check the lake to see if it exists.\n\nSo why is belief in God different?  My best answer (and this is more me than Armstrong right now, since she doesn't answer this question that straightforwardly) would be something like this:  With regard to the question of whether the Loch Ness Monster exists, the thing is going to exist or not regardless of whatever commitments we have towards it and practices we have surrounding it.  With religious belief, however, this commitment is *partly constitutive* of both the meaningfulness and the truth of the claim.  Though it may sound strange, this sort of status that a claim might have is not at all uncommon in everyday discourse apart from scientific claims about the world.  For example, any norm-enforcing claim has this sort of status.  If my neighbor is teaching me how to play chess for the first time and he tells me “The knight goes on the inside of the rook,” this is a true statement (that is in fact where the knight goes), but, outside of norm-enforcing practices like the one he just took part in, there is no normative structure in virtue of which this claim could be true.\n\nFor perhaps a closer analogy (since chess is a human invention, and presumably God is supposed to be something more than that), consider our commitment to the existence of persons, rational and moral agents who can be held epistemically and morally responsible for their claims and actions.  Without *any* treatment of each other as persons in this sense, without holding anyone responsible for anything at all, the notion of a person would make no sense.  And yet, a person’s status *as a person* is not *identical* to our treatment of them as a person.  We can imagine cases where we get it wrong, for example, if someone has locked-in syndrome and we believe that they are brain-dead, and thus we do not treat them as a person.  We’re missing an important and deep truth here, and yet this truth would make no sense outside of any of practices of treating each other as persons. \n\nThis analogy may still not be perfect, but I do think it gets at the important point that outside of any religious belief and practice, the claim “God exists” makes no sense.  This does not mean that the existence of God is identical to belief in God, but just that the existence of God could not have made sense if there were not, in the first instance, practices committed to the existence of God.  This, like the above examples, is not a sui generis phenomenon.  It would not make sense to say that the knight goes on the inside of the rook if there were not, in the first instances, practices committed to placing the knight on one side of the rook, and so on and so forth for the multitude of examples we could concoct.  Claiming to believe in God in a world without belief in God and practices surrounding this belief would be like making a knight chess-piece in a world where there is no chess, handing it to someone, and saying “It goes on the inside of the rook.”  Outside of a context in which these things have ritualized functions, they just make no sense.\n\nSorry if that was a bit long-winded, but I hope it gets at your point.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390801029", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This happened to me about 3 and a half years ago. For a bit of backstory, I was really into video games. I practically lived, breathed, and slept with them. They were my life. Now, I had just gotten a job, and a game I had wanted for a few weeks was on sale. I figured that since I actually had some money now, I'd go get the game. I had about 100$ in my wallet, give or take, and that was all the money I had. So, I went to the closest game store to get the game. Unfortunately, being me, I left my wallet at home on this particular day. I was already at the store, so this proved to be a bit of a dilemma. \n\nSo, naturally, I did what any self-respecting person would do; I begged people by the store for money. It was a 60 dollar game on sale for 40 dollars, so I couldn't just leave; it would go back up. So, the first person walked by. I asked for a few bucks, they told me to get a job. This happened pretty much for the next 10-20 people I asked, but I was determined. Then there was one good samaritan, who gave me 5 dollars. Another gave me 3. After 3 hours of standing outside, it was finally starting to pay off. \n\nFast forward 5 hours. The store was 5 minutes from closing, so I figured I'd see how much I made. I still needed a few bucks left, so I decided to just ask the store clerk. Now, I went inside, and he looked at me weird. My hair was a mess, and I hadn't showered in a while, given that I was waiting all day to get in there for the game. I walk up to the shelves, and grab the game. At this point, he's looking at me really weird, and for some reason, thinks something's up. So, I walk up to the register and ask if I can borrow a few bucks to pay for the game, and that I'll pay him back tomorrow. \"How much do you need?\" he asked. So I told him \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Now, it was around this time that he realized that I was a 50 foot tall crustacean from the protozoic era. He immediately replied \"God dammit, Loch Ness monster, I ain't given you no tree-fiddy!\"\n\nLong story short, some people get really offended when you ask for money.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390839227", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -8, "controversiality": 0}

My manager was pretty cool, but he didn’t have a spine. So he runs to the back and for the sake of conflict aversion he goes back and gets the money for the guy. \n\nHe comes back and hands it to the Indian, but this only frustrated him more.

{"body": "No didn't you hear, brown was sitting in his underground fortress below an active volcano watching Hertl clips. It was then and there he devised a plan to take out the youngster in an attempt to slow his momentum of being a future star. You see Brown just couldn't stand how much success young Hertl was having and so him and the legend of doom set in to motion the plan we saw on the ice that night.\n\nMake it look like an accident, they murmured speaking in demonic tongues. So after eating the ceremonial baby they set off to the staples center to set the plan in motion. They would use the Cartman chant to make the youngster Hertl annoyed at how unclassy the kings were. \"Is that Roseanne, or a dying seagull\" the descendant of Christ said to himself. It was then as he was remarking that the spawn of lucifer himself took aim at the Boy Wonders fragile knee!\n\nBrown with the help of Skynet used his T-1000 lock on to pinpoint the point of contact. Some excess embryo fluids drooled from his mouth as he skated with the fever of the 7 circles of hell. Just as he was to make contact the Czech Christ looked into BelzeBrowns eyes and almost for a second he hesitated at the sheer beauty and wonder in his soul piercing eyes. But it was for nothing, as we all know Brown sold his soul in 2012 to acquire the Stanley Cup. \n\nBoom they collided and brown used his particle thrusters to add just enough hesitation to make it look incidental. Without hesitation Captian and Penile enthusiast Jumbo Joe rushed to his side! \"Tomas, Tomas, are you okay? Answer me!\" He exclaimed. A soft whimper came from his delicate mouth and Joe leaned in closer. \"What is it Tomas I'm here now, what do you need?!\" Barely with enough strength to talk he muttered \"I need about tree fiddy\". Well it was about that time that Jumbo noticed that Tomas was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the palezoic era.

{"body": "Welcome to Reddit :).\n\nI'm writing in a relatively low magic world, with much more emphasis on the supernatural and spiritual than on magic as hard science. Like ASOIAF, only a couple of my protagonists are in any way specifically and actively magical, and magical effects tend to be few in number. However, that said, it's there and begins to cause havoc for some of the characters who otherwise have a relatively settled existence at the beginning of the series. It's a gaslamp fantasy series --- so in some respects society has worked around magic to create more sophisticated technology independent of it, probably because it's not an exact science. There's as much exploration of a world beginning to wield more and more advanced technology as there is of magic (I make a big deal of medicinal advances - science going hand in hand with a magical understanding of the body, probably necessary in a world where a man can, at a time of great stress, change into a bear and kill his daughter - and ordinary photography becoming simpler to use, for instance), although given that I was writing in a constructed world as opposed to the real world, I felt rather bound to include some magic within it, and the original premise allowed for far more than I ended up keeping in. My magical beasts are more cryptids like yeti, the roc and Nessie, or spirits like leshy or rusalki, rather than dragons, goblins, elves or unicorns.\n\nI enjoy series both with and without sophisticated/regularised magic systems. I don't feel fantasy has to have lots of magic in it, although it's a significant part of what distinguishes fantasy from, say, alternative history (like Joan Aiken's *Wolves of Willoughby Chase* series). Then again, Tolkien doesn't particularly rely on magic himself: magic-users are rare, albeit powerful.\n\nTo summarise: I don't feel fantasy has to feature great magicians wielding lightning bolts or magnificent dragons as being commonplace. I guess people will expect some magical occurrences, but if you can write a good book which uses magic sparingly, then I suspect people will accept a de-emphasising of magical developments in your book.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390873893", "subreddit": "Fantasy", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have a lot of opinions on Paleo because I'm an archaeology student. \n\nMy favorite article on the topic: [Archaeologists Officially Declare Collective Sigh at Paleo Diet](http://hells-ditch.com/2012/08/archaeologists-officially-declare-collective-sigh-over-paleo-diet/). I can't find the original place where it was published. It's been floating around the internet for a while now. I like it for several good points that it makes:\n\n* Natural selection only works if the organism in question has been prevented from reproducing, thus being removed from the gene pool. But people can live well past child bearing age while eating absolute crap. \n\n* The Paleo diet was much more varied than people seem to think it was. There have been Paleolithic cultures living in almost all parts of the world. These people had drastically different diets.\n\n* The foods available to us today are very different from Paleolithic foods. Even the foods approved by the Paleo diet look very different from foods from the Paleolithic era. All that fresh, genetically modified, selectively bred fruit we have available year-round? Yeah, that wouldn't have been a thing.\n\nSome other points that I want to add:\n\n* I think the Paleo diet focuses way too much on meat. Paleolithic humans didn't only eat large game animals. The reason a lot of people think this is that the remains of large game animals are more likely to last over thousands of years than plant remains or small animal or fish remains. You're not seeing that these people were probably eating a huge amount of plant-based foods, which would have been a lot easier to obtain than large game. \n\n* The Paleo diet also really ignores cultural influences. Paleolithic people had cultures. They were humans after all. They might have had all kinds of reasons for eating the foods that they ate, that had nothing to do with how healthy those foods actually were. For example, Southeastern Native Americans consumed a beverage known as [black drink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_drink) as part of ritual activities, which was made from the plant *Ilex Vomitoria*. The plant has the word \"vomit\" in its name. I bet you can guess what it does to you.\n\n* Paleolithic people changed their environments drastically. Plains Indians [used controlled burns](http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/biblio_indianfire.htm) to encourage the growth of grasses that attracted the animals they liked to hunt. There is evidence that people would encourage the growth of certain plants that they liked to gather, by removing competing plants growing nearby. The idea that people were living like any other animal, totally off instinct for what was good for them, is simply not true. People had certain foods they liked. They ate them.\n\nThat being said, there are [legitimate concerns](http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race#.Uucsi2Qo4Y0) attached to farming. People did not necessarily become healthier because of farming. Farming was adopted out of necessity as populations grew beyond the capacity of the land to support them. Farming places heavy preference for a few food sources, and if one of those food sources fails for some reason, it can lead to famine. Having fewer sources of food also means that people can be deficient on key nutrients. Farming forces people to be stationary, so if there is some sort of disaster they are less able to just pick up and leave. It also forces large populations to live close together, making it possible for diseases to spread. Living in close quarters with animals introduced diseases such as the flu to humans. Thankfully, we have developed technologies to combat this. We have modern medicine, and we have international trade which allows us to access a wide variety of foods. We have sanitation measures that keep epidemics from occurring.\n\nThe \"Paleo Diet\" is nothing more than an idealization of an imagined past.\n\nETA: Only slightly related, but I really like the book [Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human](http://www.amazon.com/Catching-Fire-Cooking-Made-Human-ebook/dp/B0097D71MQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390882692&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=catching+fire+how+cooking+made+us+human) because it gives a really good look at how eating cooked foods (especially meat) helped us get more calories from our food and thus develop larger brains. It's not really related to Paleo, but another food-myth that I see a lot is the raw-food movement, which is refuted beautifully in this book.

{"body": "Back when I was in Grade 10, I had a really weird teacher for PE. He was  a pretty big italian dude with a thick new jersey accent. always starring at us and he was just generally creepy. Even some of the other teachers thought he was weird.\n One day, I had to leave class early because I had a doctors appointment. My teacher would always sit in teachers office while we did whatever we wanted because he was lazy and would just watch us play. \nI went to give him my parents note so I could be dismissed early. When I knocked on the door, I noticed that he was talking to someone on the phone, the door was closed so the sound was really muffled but I heard one word pretty clearly. He said something about a gun and he sounded PISSED! I didnt think much of it because I thought I probably heard it wrong or something.\n Anyways, he hung up and opened the door and asked me what I wanted. I showed him the note and for some reason, he deliberitally took a long time and kept looking up at me as if he thought I forged the note or something. He told me to close the door and step into his office. At this point Im getting impatient and nervous because my mom told me to wait at the office at 2:00 and it was 2:10. The first thing he says is \"were you listening to the conversation that I was having while you were waiting outside?\". I tell him that I didnt hear anything and I ask him politely if I could just leave. He tells me to have a seat and I was getting a little bit scared and suspicious because I thought that I was in trouble for hearing something I wasnt supposed to. \nThe next thing he says made me really worried: \"if you promise not to say anything to anyone Ill give you $200\". He pulls out his wallet filled with bills and hands me exactly that much. He tells me to hide it and get out of his office. I quickly put it in my bag, nod and leave the office. Before closing the door behind me, he says \"wait! Theres something I need\". I was confused, so I turned around and asked him what he wanted. He replies \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was around this time that I realized that my fat italian gym teacher was actually 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! I started to  shout \"Damnit Monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" as he swam away. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390883381", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 129, "controversiality": 0}

According to that poll 52% of those with a high school education or less believed that \"God created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years,\" as opposed to only 25% of those with postgraduate degrees.

{"body": "Repost from yesterday to get some more discussion. (i'll stop posting on **friday**, we'll have adequate discussion by then)\n\n/u/QuitoPR \n&gt;I don't really have time to type up a reply to this right now but you should repost this in the dailies for a while if you want the discussion to gain any traction.\n\n\nto start, the DGT is great. it's a sub within  a sub. with that being said, content is continuously flowing throughout the day here. \n\n\n\nVery strong suggestion for main sub posts include: \n\n1. *Action* shot of any kind. even if it's you rolling around with buddies. It might not do as well as a original content gif of one of us doing a 540 noseblunt slide, but it has it's place on the sub. \n\n2. Modified gear: home-made decks, new deck art, spraypainted trucks, board chop/overhaul.\n\n3. basically OC. you made it/did it, you deserve submission points. \n\nVery strong suggestion for DGT posts include:\n\n1. Any new youtube/vimeo video that's *NOT* OC. \n\n2. Any screenshotted image of landy snapchat, or instantgramz. \n\n3. NEW GEAR! let's all be stoked on your new nessie ^(in the DGT)\n\n4. Obviously any questions regarding longboarding and general chillin. \n\nJust tired of seeing new even unmounted gear. Like anyone can buy longboard products and take pictures. I still want to be stoked for your new gear though. And it does create discussion. I think a redirect to DGT would keep things real.\n\npossible downsides to this method include:\n\n1. huge submission number in DGT makes it too saturated\n\n2. people who post later in the day get buried\n\n3. hard to refind a topic once buried (especially if on mobile)\n\nsolutions to downsides include:\n\n1. sort by new\n\n2. sort by new\n\n3. save comment before moving on if it's interesting (unsave it when it becomes uninteresting) - If you don't have redditRES, get it. and it is true that this is hard/impossible for some mobile users. \n\nThis is a discussion so let's hear your proposals, pros/cons, other solutions, etc. \n\nJust trying to make this sub the best ever. \n\n**After reading /u/Squidifier's comment from yesterday, it seems that mods don't have the manpower or desire to monitor content, which is understandable and not what this is all about. Many of us are jaded from the content being posted everyday. With that being said, maybe we can use some judgement before we make a submission.**\n\nPrevious ideas:\n\n* I think that not OC videos have a place as their own posts \n\n* Things like custom paintjobs and grip jobs should go in the DGT. It greatly detracts from actual content. \n\n* (*regarding nonOC video/instantgram/snapchat screenshot*) I'd contest that both of these are very valuable in creating discussion. Sure, neither are particularly high-effort submissions - but past experiences have shown that the behind-the-scenes looks given by these screenshots allow a wider pool of people to discuss them.\n\n* The fact is, there's no sure-fire way of keeping certain types of submission off the front page aside from constant human 24/7 monitoring. \n\n\n[to read all of the comments from yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1wal6y/rlongboardings_official_daily_general_thread/cf06b7x)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390936830", "subreddit": "longboarding", "score": -4, "controversiality": 1}

You should work for the things you want the most in life, not just ask for them to be handed to you. So this young boy grows up to be a well respected, hard working man. His father is so proud that he never reveals his earlier intentions.\n\nBut now the father is growing older and his body is starting to break down. He falls sick one wintry afternoon and after being rushed to the hospital the doctors announce he is not expected to last very long. \n\nThe boy and his mother are talking in the lobby while waiting for the results of his father's medical tests. She tells him of the story of a young boy and his father building a desk together. She goes on to describe a secret compartment that appears empty, but in reality is filled with much more than the eye can see. \n\nThe boy goes in to see his father one last time. Their eyes well up with tears and the boy asks \"Hey dad, can I borrow $10?\" The father's face fills with pride. Tears streaming down his cheek, he says \"Sure son. Check the top left drawer of my computer desk.\" \n\nThey embrace, say I love you, and the boy leaves to go home. \n\nHe checks the desk, pulls the drawer open and sees nothing. Then he remembers what his mother said. \"It's filled with much more than the eye can see.\"\n\nThe boy pulls out the desk drawer and affixed to the back is a folded $10 bill with 5 words scribbled on the back. \"I need about tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390942454", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I became perplexed, before I started indulging in mild amounts of subtle worry. \"What's happened?\" I thought to myself. \"Is reddit closing down? Are they out of money?

{"body": "No, I became a chlamydiacuntbucket when I was 19. You see, I had three good friends back then: George, Samuel, and Sarah. George was a great guy, one of those that you expect to be your best man. Samuel was a rough and tough kind of guy, he had basically no family growing up, and so George's family took him in. Sarah.. Sarah was a sexy lady. She was far out of all of our leagues, but for some reason she was a good friend throughout all of high school. At senior prom I was dancing with this random drunk girl, as my date had bailed on me. George had found her sitting alone and introduced her to me. Her name was Elizabeth. We clicked, and had a lot of fun that night. After afterprom I took her home ( I wasn't drinking, I was the designated driver) and helped her into bed, while her parents yelled at me for letting her drunk. Her mom seemed to be a real CUNT. So I left there, and as I walked out the door I stepped in a BUCKET filled with what looked like the poop of a monster. The next day, I remembered that I hadn't worn a condom when me and Elizabeth did the deed, and got tested for CHLAMYDIA. Turns out, she have it to me. I went to confront her, and when I walked in the door there was a strange smell. There also seemed to be goo all over he floors and furniture. When I walked into Elizabeth's room I took a good look and realized that she looked like a Loch Ness monster. I was very frightened, but wanted to have an answer to my question. So I asked her if she gave me chlamydia, and she said she probably did. I asked how many guys she slept with and she responded. \"About tree-fiddy\" I started squealing with joy because she gave me a reason to finally get a big post on reddit and be nominated to /r/bestof . But then she ruined my hopes and dreams by taking off her costume, apologized for giving me chlamydia, told me that her walls were being repainted by her dad, and he wasn't the cleanest painter ever, and said I was her second fuck, and that the first was a guy with chlamydia.

{"body": "Ohh Do I have a doozy for you! Here is the tale of my brother's friend's step brother. Let us call our hero errr ... Slagathor! Now the story begins... One day Slagathor took a trip to Colorado with his college friends after they had all got done with their Midterms. Slagathor was madly in love with this close friend of his. He had taken a liking to her the first day he met her. Sadly he was deep in the friendzone showing no signs of escaping. The trip was his idea of a scapegoat out of the dreaded friendzone. After all the Midterms were taken, Slagathor and his crew of friends loaded up into his van to make the trip from Texas to Colorado. They lived in the Amarillo area so it was that bad of a drive. Slagathor and his lover would ride in the front while the rest of the gang lounged in the backseats. Slagathor asked his crush if she needed a buddy for the skiing they were gonna do. Of course his crush thought nothing more of it and said yes. This meant the world to Slagathor. After about a dozen stops and multiple potty breaks the crew and Slagathor had made it to Colorado. The crush of Slagathor asked to room with him. Slagathor could barely accept her request since he was in a state of shock. When Slagathor and his crush got to their room he collapsed on his bed and slept for 8 hours. When he awoke, his crush was laying beside him. He was baffled by here appearance. Slagathor was about to ask what she was doing, but as soon as he opened his mouth his crush locked lips with him and gave him a very heart felt and passionate kiss. Slagathor was stunned then his crush said something along the lines of \"I've always loved you Slagathor but I thought you didn't feel the same.\" Slagathor then told her the feelings that he had always had for her and the times he would secretly leave orchads at her apartment door because he knew that was her favorite flower. SLagathor became so overwhelm with emotion that he started balling in front of her. His crush asked \"What is wrong Slagathor? Everything is perfect.\" Slagathor responded with \"I am crying with tears of joy for I found the woman of my dreams, the women I want to spend my last days with, the women I love.\" His crush started whimpering and then eventually crying with him. Both were crying for all the right reasons. His crush eventually stopped and had a serious expression on her face. Slagathor asked what was wrong. She replied with \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, he replied, \"What do you need? His crush smirked with an scaly expression and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time he realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten him again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" He yelled as she swam away into the distance. Slagathor was left in anger and heart ache for the rest of the trip. His friends tried to cheer him up but nothing would help. Slagathor was never the same after that trip. He eventually found a lovely wife that we know call Mrs. Slagathor. I always tell the story as if it was I that was left heart broken and eventually found love.

{"body": "I have an incredibly disturbing story to tell about a girl who posted to /r/gonewild that I recognized. I have been thinking hard lately about whether or not I ever want to share this story with reddit and this seems like a pretty good thread to share it in. (and get a game in the process perhaps) For all of you /r/gonewild girls out there and those of you who have thought about posting nude photos of yourself, let this serve as a cautionary tale...\n\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\n\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\n\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was. \n\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to /r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was *insanely* open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about. \n\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her /r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\" \n\nNot only did I walk away without any extortion money, I didn't get any new nudes from her which is what I was holding out for more than anything else. The only good thing about the failed sextortion deal is that she never contacted the FBI which works out perfectly for me because if she did, I wouldn't have been able to share this cautionary tale with you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390973610", "subreddit": "RandomActsOfGaming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It started with the alarm failing to go off on time.\n\nI mean, the alarm was supposed to go off at 6:00, but instead, it went off at 5:00, which you really wouldn't think would be a problem, but actually it was, because it meant that I turned it off and went back to sleep and slept late because it was no longer set for 6 because it went off at 5. Ya dig? No? Whatever, it's not really important anyway.\n\nThe point is that I overslept. Like, *waaaay* overslept. We're talking, 10, 11 o'clock is when I got up. Shit. My boss was gonna drag me over the coals. If he could, he would probably kill me, then resurrect, then kill me again just to prove his point. I wasn't usually late, but today was really damn important.\n\nYa see, I had this like meeting thing (I can't quite remember what it actually was) that I was supposed to go to at 8. I was going to catch the 7:30 bus, but then all that bullshit I already talked about happened with my alarm, and so I totally missed the meeting.\n\nEh, whatever. By the time I'd showered, it was already almost noon and I had 6 missed calls from my boss (I never should have given him my cell phone number) and one very angry text message. I decided to ignore it; the whole day was probably a wash anyway.\n\nMy hair still wet from the shower, I sat down and opened my laptop, ignoring the constant buzzing from my phone. The boss; who needs that guy, right?\n\nI opened up Firefox for my daily ritual. Reddit. That would let me forget everything.\n\nAnd of course, off to my favorite subreddit. Ah, /r/WritingPrompts. What a wonderful place, where I could go and share some bullshit stories I'd written and internet strangers thousands of miles away could acknowledge that my inane ramblings had provided them with a brief and fleeting moment of entermainment by clicking on a little orange number in order to increase my amount of arbitrary and useless points. Sorry, didn't mean to get all philosophical and shit there. Just thought it was kind of an interesting point.\n\nI wrote for a little bit there, some [stupid story about a train](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1vdfgo/wp_you_boarded_took_a_seat_and_are_on_your_way_to/cer6vh6) that I didn't think was very good. Okay, that's a lie. I actually thought it was decent. Maybe even passable.\n\nApparently some other people thought it was even better than passable, because a little later that day I got a message from someone who said they were a publisher. We traded contact info, and wouldn't you know it! Turned out we lived right around the corner! We arranged to meet at the local piano bar, which happened to overlook the river. A beautiful view, by the way, if you're ever there. Worth checking out. The piano player's pretty good too; can play just about anything you ask. The selection of beers is small, though, and the food's pretty shit. Would not recommend the fried bar appetizers. Let's just say that they and my intestines had a major disagreement.\n\nBut anyways, back to the point. So, I met up with this publisher guy at the piano bar. He was a tall, bearded man with glasses, the kind you pass in the street and think to yourself, \"Heh, that guy's probably on the way to the library or something.\" He certainly looked the part.\n\nWe ordered a couple of beers (he got some fancy local microbrew, I got Bud Light) and started to work out the finer details of the publishing deal. \"So,\" he said, sipping his $12 beer, \"I'm gonna need some money from you in order to get this published.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about? Hundreds? Thousands?\"\n\n\"Oh no, not even that much. I only need a little. A pittance, really.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare tell me...\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm gonna need about $3.50.\"\n\nNow normally, at this point, you'd probably expect the guy to be the Loch Ness Monster, but he wasn't, he was just a really awesome publisher who was willing to publish my shitty train story for dirt cheap. We exchanged some more info and agreed to meet again. He left, and I went to the bar to get myself one of their shitty appetizers.\n\nIt looked like they'd changed their menu. What had once been little crappy mini-cheeseburgers (I think they're called sliders or something?) and greasy chicken wings had been replaced by \"organic fuji apple slaw\" and \"ahi tuna tartar.\" Guess they were trying to fancy themselves up a bit.\n\nI ordered the ahi tartar, figuring I'd try something new. I'm not usually one for raw fish, but hey, you should always be adventurous, right? Of course I'm right.\n\nWhile I waited for my chopped up raw fish, I asked the piano player to play a very special song for me, one that held a dear place in my heart.\n\nNow, I would bet you're thinking of that Rick Astley song where he tells you all the things he's never gonna do, but no, I actually asked for Clair de Lune, because it's a goddamn fine piece of music, and also because what's better than classical music, Bud Light, and ahi tuna tartar while overlooking the river?\n\nNow, this is the part where the story gets *really* weird. Hold on tight. And don't forget, I did warn you.\n\nWhen the waiter got there with my plate of raw fish chunks, I could swear that it was... it sounded like it was singing to me. No, it wasn't a hallucination. I swear to God this is the truth, cross my heart and so on. My frigging tuna was singing to me. It was singing that stupid fucking Rick Astley song. It was nailing the lyrics, but it was dreadfully flat. Like, every note, the key got a half step lower or a whole step higher or just modulated wildly to another key signature all together. It was ridiculous. The fish had no intonation control whatsoever.\n\n\"Hey,\" I asked the piano player. He'd stopped playing by now, marveling at my ahi tartar. \"You ever seen anything like this before?\"\n\nHe scratched his head. \"Not really,\" he answered. \"I've been playing piano here for over 17 years, and man, let me tell you, I've seen some strange shit. I've seen a man so drunk that he ripped off all his clothes and jumped in the river naked. I've seen a woman swallow a wedding ring that some guy had asked to be put in her champagne. Hell, I've helped deliver not one, but *two* babies in my time here. But never have I *ever* seen a plate of ahi tartar sing.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"it's fucking weird. I mean, I don't think it would bother me if it were singing on-key, but it's just totally off.\" The plate of fish was now warbling in seventeen different keys about how it would never run around and hurt me. \"You reckon there's anything I can do about it?\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said the piano player. \"I guess it really is true what they say.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked, my voice full of furious curiosity, desperate for a solution. \"What do they say?\"\n\n\"You can tune a piano, kid,\" the piano player said, \"but you can't tuna fish!\" And with that, he began to play another song, one I found oddly fitting to the situation, that song by that band Heart: Barracuda.\n\nI always knew something about that bar was fishy.\n\n-028", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390977532", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Whereas his cronies had only sparks of intelligence, Vorten Nine seemed to have received the full charge.  \nWe kept floating there, adjusting our stances when free fall took us too far. Suddenly, the fire in his eyes darkened. I could see him preparing to make his first move. It was up to me to make it his last.  \nWordlessly, he surrounded himself in pulsing blue flames and began advancing toward where I stood. He was far away enough that I was able to adjust my stance one last time. It saved my life.  \nHe charged, wreathed in blue fire, a hundred-ton mesh of pitch-black steel. His eyes shone brighter now, their flames turning white with heat. And still I waited, praying I could block his attack.  \n\"You know,\" I remarked casually, as if there wasn't a building-sized flaming monster toaster trying to kill me, \"you guys are all the same. No imagination, no effort. It's always 'Flame Charge!' with you guys.\"  \nI pressed the blue button on my belt, and was instantly another thousand miles away. That had been the last of my charge. I was alone now, no tech, only my wits and the world around me. And still, he charged.  \n\"Aren't you going to give up?\" I called out.  No response.\nI sighed. Of course he couldn't hear me, we were in space. But I was talking more for my own benefit.  \n\"Like I was saying,\" I continued, \"while you bozos lack imagination, I...do *not*. At this point in time, I am fully prepared to take seventeen different courses of action that I can guarantee you would not expect. Yes, it's true: you're powerful. But your power has lead to your downfall.\"  \nHe was moving faster now, breaking the speed of sound and every law of thermodynamics. He was getting close.  \n\"You're so strong, you can't even imagine losing. The possibility no longer exists in your mind. And that makes you weak.\"  \n*A hundred miles away...ninety-five...*  \n\"Along your path to power, you destroyed all that you might have loved and lived for. It gave you the strength you needed, but it left you with nothing to protect.\"  \n*Forty...thirty-five...*  \n\"You loosed a stream of meteors on the space-time continuum in the hopes of landing one at exactly the right time.

Blinking furiously, I looked around me, scanning the area for Vorten Nine.  \n\"He's not here.\"  \nI whipped around, claws extending, tips ready with poison.  \n\"He's not here,\" the winged dinosaur repeated. She flapped her wings and they seemed to carry her through the void of space, toward me.  \n\"Stay back,\" I warned, my voice raspy. \"Who are you?\"  \n\"You know who I am,\" she said sadly, all the while moving toward me. \"You know, no_thanks_im_gucci.\"  \nAnd suddenly, I did.  \n\"No,\" I gasped in my harsh voice, and I realized then that it was all true.  \n\"It was me...who was screaming...wasn't it?\"  \n\"Yes,\" she said quietly.  \n\"So I...?\"  \n\"You were brave,\" was all she would say.  \n\"But if I lost-\" I began coughing violently, spitting up blood. \"If I lost, if I...if I died...then that makes you...\"  \n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I am Gabriellacerus.\"  \n\"Gabriella...cerus,\" I repeated numbly.  \n\"I am the Keeper of Saurian Souls, leader of the Soaring Angelsauri\" she said, her voice resonating impossibly. \"You have died honorably, protecting the galaxies from Vorten Nine.\" She looked away. \"But you still died. You were the last, and you failed your people. And for that, you must pay the price.\"  \nAnd before I could utter a word of defense, scales began erupting across her body, transforming her from a beautiful, winged Angelsaur into a wicked, green prehistoric beast.  \n\"Now,\" she growled, holding out her clawed hand, \"gimme tree fiddy.\"  \nI stared, uncomprehending, at the nightmare that stood before me. \"But I...I'm broke,\" I protested. \"I spent all my money on the Kinesis Belt.\"  \nThe ancient Loch Ness monster nodded grimly. Then, faster than the eye could see, she reared back and plunged her scaly arm through my abdomen.  \nAnd as the world was lost to pain, I heard a soft, angelic voice say, \"You should have become a writer.\"  \n\nEdit: spelling and crap", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391018144", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 54, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, this must have been and 7 or 8 years ago, I believe it was July, or August. Nearing the end of my shift, my rooms were finally filled with low acuity crap, but there was an entubated patient in a co-worker’s room getting ready to be admitted to the ICU.  He had an NG tube already, but no Foley catheter, so I offered to “snake him” before he went down, just to keep the ICU nurses happy with us.\n\nThe man was on the large size, and still had his sweat pants on, so I pulled one side down a little, enough to see that he didn’t have any underwear on, and to realize the odor was less than pleasant.  Went over to the other side and pulled the pants down to mid-thigh, and saw something that will haunt me for the rest of my days. The man’s entire groin was covered in a thick crop of genital warts, and the odor was coming from a red, moist, nasty yeast infection under his penis and between his legs.  Normally it is only a nice, thick lung butter that can trigger my gag reflex, but this crop of warts was doing me in.\n\nI gathered my Foley catheter equipment, set it up between his legs and got ready. Have you ever noticed that sterile kits designed for physicians have nice, elastic, sterile gloves in them, while nursing kits have crappy little stiff vinyl gloves? I ripped the palm out of one of them while putting them on, and there was no way I was touching that crop with any chance of having it touch my skin, so I figured this was a sign that I needed to go show the doctor this mound of warts.\n\nI went to the doctor’s station and said, “Hey doc, I promise I won’t say this to you very often, but you really need to come check out this guy’s penis.” There was a look of curiosity and excitement, mixed with a little bit of fear on his face.  We went into the room and the doctor had a slight smile as I pulled up the sheet that was covering the man’s junk.  The smile quickly vanished, followed by a brief look of confusion, then his skin turned pale, his face dropped, his hands went up into a defensive posture, and he quickly left the room, mumbling something about, “I hate you, I really didn’t need to see that, you’ll pay with enema duty for years to come as a punishment.” \n\nI laughed for a short time, but then I realized I still needed to stick a catheter into that mess. Got a new pair of sterile gloves, extra long, and went in.  Crabbed the wart-covered penis with disgust, as the other nurse was preparing the monitor to go with the patient to the ICU.  I could tell he was trying not to watch, but just like a bus crash, he couldn’t pull his eyes off as I lifted the penis up, revealing what used to be a scrotum, but now was nothing more than a collection of warts on top of warts.\n\nI held the penis up as I prepared to clean the tip with iodine swabs, and I couldn’t help but say, “textured for her pleasure.” This was all the other nurse could take and I was left alone to finish the Foley.  I cleaned the tip three times, and attempted to put the Foley between two warts on the tip.  It wouldn’t go in.  I started to look around a little to see what the problem was when I realized that the distal part of his penis was not the tip of his penis, but just a mass of warts that had grown up and over the shaft.  The tip of his penis was underneath my thumb, as if he had hypospadia.\n\nI hadn’t cleaned that area, so I got more iodine and fresh gloves, cleaned the warty ventral side of his penis, and stuck the Foley catheter in. Thankfully it went in without problems and I got good urine return.

The teacher for that class was strict, and she was sick the day before, so I figured why not smoke a few bowls before class. While I was smoking, I figured why not just get blazed, so I did; I smoked 8 bowls of BC bud and went to class. When class started, the teacher was still sick, but we had a different sub. The one the day before was kind and let us goof off. This sub was a mean snappy old lady. I was blazed off my ass, so I just played on my laptop, pretending to type. After that got boring, I closed my laptop and drank my sprite while the old bitch was talking about how disrespectful kids are these days. \n\nThen it happened. \n\nUnexpectedly, I let out a huge burp, except there was a CLOUD of smoke that just reeked like weed. Half the class burst out laughing, some were in pure shock, and a few didn't know what was going on. The teacher turned around from the board, and asked what was so funny; this little shit from the front of the room told her that smoke just came out of my mouth. Her face became filled with rage, and she came over to my desk and breathed down my fucking neck. She gave me the look of death, and asked, \"What. Happened.\" I told her it was a magic trick, and the class laughed again. Then, she grabbed my arm and said I was going to the principal's office. I flipped shit, because I got caught with weed at school earlier that year, and if I got in any more trouble, I would be expelled; the only other school in my area was an expensive Catholic school, and I wasn't Catholic. The class was watching us and I shook my arm away from her and asked, \"What do you want from me?\" She said it wasn't about what she wanted; it was about what she needed. She looked me straight in the eyes and responded, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" Well, it was about that time I realized this old substitute teacher was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

I can still almost feel the whir of excitement, the  release from worry and stress I craved every night.

Beer goggles are a bitch, in the heat of the moment I feel so smooth, and I guess there's some self esteem in there too. Just like my drinking, it only got worse and worse.

{"body": "**Ahem - ahem**\n\nYou should visit Scotland because we are an inherently friendly and welcoming people. We all love meeting new folk and we love a good chin-wag (chat, natter...conversation) with strangers. We'll make you feel at home here. We have a lot of pride as a nation and it is important to all of us that we make a good impression on you and that you feel comfortable here. As a nation of people we possess a wonderful sense of humour - a trait I admit we share with our English, Welsh and Northern Irish brothers and sisters - and we are realists. We like to make you feel good and we will do everything we can to help you get around and see this wonderful country and all it's best features.\n\n\n\nYou will meet a great many characters on your travel throughout our lands. The Scots are diverse and have a great grasp and love of life. Some may seem bitter and miserable and some may seem bright and cheerful but we will always strive to learn from you and to teach you about us. We will open doors for you and introduce you to our way of life with a big grin on our pasty faces and we will ask that you share some of your experiences with us.\n\n\nWe like a drink, sure, but we are measured and do this to varying degrees depending on where you are. Some folk will want you to join them on a traditional pub crawl or head into one of our many nightclubs or late-night pubs in our cities. Others will suggest a quiet meal and a slow afternoon somewhere quiet and relaxing. We'll want to show you everything. Rememeber, this is an old country - we have a lot of fantastic, traditional museums that will really give you an idea of how this country has developed over time.\n\n\nIt is a truly beautiful country; both ancient and modern at the same time and yet completely natural. You've heard songs and read poems about our great land and the reports of vast glens, big green hills and beautiful lochs are all true. Ask anybody who has spent time here and has travelled around and they will confirm that this is a lovely country with a real affinity for nature. It may seem a harsh land to travel at times but it is worth the effort. There is so much to see:-\n\n\nTake a drive around Loch Lomond. Stop and wander down the bank towards the water - breathe in the fresh air. You'll feel right as rain (although be wary, it might actually be raining at the time). Drive around the great embankments at Garelochead and take in the calming scenery where the river clyde flows. Follow that long, Western country road past the beautiful city of Dumbarton and up along the remote and lush West coast towards Fort William. Stop at Oban - try the whiskey, it's my favourite! Move onto the beautiful and remote town of Fort William and take a hike up Ben Nevis to the little waterfall at the half-way point. \n\n\nWhy not go East and stop in Edinburgh. See the castle and walk along Princes Street. Wander down to the grassmarket and listen to students and tourists chatting over drink and food. Take a train from Edinburgh to Aberdeen. Take in the beautiful coast along the way. Stop off and explore the old fishing towns as you go and wander around their harbours and shops. Take in the wonderful fresh air drifting across from the North Sea and have a relaxing day in the beautiful and very modern city of Aberdeen. Head further North. See Inverness and explore this vibrant, bustling and very traditional city - take the car and drive on to Loch Ness, take the boat and look for Nessie! \n\nHead further inland and explore the lush, vibrant forrests and hills in the trossachs. Climb Ben A'an and when you reach the peak take in the wonderful view of Loch Katrine below, that stretches out to the next hill and glen beyond. Head North and see the city of Perth, have a stopover. Come back to Glasgow and spend your final days exploring our streets there. Visit our parks, drop into the pubs and clubs around the city and always stop to chat to strangers. They might look rough but they'll be the nicest people you've ever met.\n\n\nCome oooooonnn...come tae Scotland.

I was frantic because I thought that I had seriously fucked things up between us. \n\nEventually I gave up calling and texting because I didn't want to seem needy and push her away just on the off chance that I didn't mess up and things between us were fine. \n\nFast forward a couple of days and I receive a text message saying. \"Sorry I haven't replied babe, I've been going through some real tough family issues and haven't had the time.\". Naturally I was ecstatic to hear from her and asked if there was anything I could do to help her feel any better. She asks me to come over to her house and keep her company. \n\nI quickly gathered everything that I'd need and scurried out of my house. \n\nEverything was fine, we watched a couple movies, laughed, cuddled, kissed... But then all of a sudde out of nowhere she started balling her eyes out. It was at this point I realized that I was being a selfish asshole. I had only cared about m y needs and not talking to her that I hadn't even asked what had happened. \n\nSo then I tried to calm her down and ask her what's wrong. She slightly regained her composure and told me that in three days she had to move to Spain because a member of her family had gotten very sick, and her father was the only one who could take care of them because to the rest of her family had either passed away or had broken off ties due to some sort of drama. \n\nI was shocked, and began to cry knowing that this would be the last time in a long while that I would be able to see her beautiful face for a long time. We had planned to Skype as much as possible but we both knew that there would always be something missing. \n\nHours passed, as we sat there watching movies enjoying eachothers company, but much to my dismay I had to head home soon. We made love for one final time, and I shit you not, to this day it was the best sex I have ever had. I then regrettably gather my things, kiss her goodbye and tell her I love her. \n\nJust as I was about to go she says to me \"wait!\". I replied with a simple \"Yes, dear?\". She then looked at me with tears in her eyes as she held the door open and said \"There's one last thing I need from you.\". \"What is it?\" I ask. All of a sudden she puts on the most stern look that I have ever seen and non chalantly says \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that moment I realized my beautiful girlfriend was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again! \"God dammit monster I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I exclaimed. Nessie had then swam out of eyesight, never to be seen again. I slammed who ever the fucks door it was and walked home enraged. \n\nTl; dr: Love sucks. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391071187", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "For specification: The Paleo diet is based on pre-agriculture hunter-gatherer societies, and supposedly the diet of humans in the Paleolithic era. It is meant to be an omnivorous diet, excluding highly processed foods, high carb foods, and certain other items such as legumes and potatoes. \n\nIt's essentially a 'real foods'/'whole foods' diet, with a few more restrictions such as the potatoes. The restrictions are helpful to those with insulin resistance, and focuses on intake of vegetables and fruits that are lower GI and packed with more vitamins-to-serving than some other ok but not as good vegetables/fruits. \n\nDairy is difficult for lots of people to process- it's a common intolerance. It certainly isn't a natural part of any adult animal's diet. Either reason is fine for avoiding it. \n\nAs with any diet- moderation and education about what you're eating is important. I see \"paleo\" recipes all over the place that are packed with bacon and other high salt cured meats. Obviously, someone who eats lean chicken/fish is going to be healthier than someone who eats tons of red meat. \nThe KIND of meat you're consuming is going to matter. A serving of red meat every single day increases heart attack potential by 18%. Daily serving of processed meats such as bacon/hot dogs/etc by 20%. Subbing fish for red meat decreases that percentage by 7%, and chicken decreases it by 14%. [Source: Harvard Study] (http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Mens_Health_Watch/2012/June/cutting-red-meat-for-a-longer-life).\n\nPaleo isn't meant to be meat only- it's supposed to be a balanced, natural diet that supports protein AND veggies, instead of forcing you to cut out animal sources of proteins like other whole food diets might do. It's approximately recommended that half of your food source be from meat- that may be higher than other diets, I'm honestly not sure.

{"body": "(Sorry for the excessive length of my reply, Gailosaurus.)\n\nThe bodily autonomy argument says that, even if the embryo or fetus is a person, morally on par with a newborn, it is still okay to kill them. So I was writing with the assumption that the embryo or fetus (or zygote) IS a person, which I would say is reasonable and not begging the question within the context of the given argument.\n\nScientifically, we know that a zygote is a new human organism, and that embryos and fetuses are also living human organisms. Whether or not they are people is beyond the scope of science, since personhood is a moral and philosophical question. Same goes for born humans. But, with all due respect, I don't think that raw ingredients are the most accurate analogy for a zygote or embryo, since either one of those is already a human set on the continuous path of development to fetus, infant, toddler, child, etc. Raw ingredients would be akin to sperm and egg, but sperm and egg cease to exist individually at conception. Maybe a better analogy would be a formed, raw cookie set on the baking sheet and stuck in the oven. It's still a cookie, it just hasn't yet developed all of the properties we typically associate with cookies. If you don't eat it (which I guess would be analogous to killing someone), it'll develop a lot in the oven, continue developing out of the oven (it'll come out still gooey and too hot), eventually \"mature\" into a semi-soft, cool cookie (an adult), and then a ways down the road it will get old and stale and \"die.\" But the capacity to be a \"mature\" cookie is a fundamental part of the unbaked cookie. If someone destroyed my unbaked cookie balls, I would be just as angry as if they destroyed my already baked cookies. (And yes, I realize this analogy is getting weirder with every sentence.)\n\nHere's another analogy: Say you win a trip to Scotland. You want to take lots of pictures, and since you're a hipster and digital cameras are too mainstream, you take your parents' old Polaroid camera. (Remember them?) While you're out on Loch Ness, suddenly the Loch Ness monster pops up out of the water, so you quick snap a picture, and and then she sinks back into the water. The picture comes out, and everything about Nessie is captured in it. It is a picture of the Loch Ness monster; it just hasn't visibly developed all those properties yet, right? If another tourist grabbed it from you and then threw it away in disappointment because it  was \"just brown smudges,\" , how would you feel? How would you feel if when you shouted \"That's how Polaroids work, you idiot!\" they said  it was \"only a potential picture.\" Isn't the picture still valuable, even if it's immature?\n\nWhat I'm getting at is, we are all people because we all share the same fundamental human nature as rational, moral agents. An embryo couldn't develop the ability for consciousness, rational thought, or morality, if those traits weren't already fundamentally a part of it, whether currently being expressed or not. (If you could only save one, wouldn't you save a zygote before an amoeba? The amoeba will only ever be an amoeba, but years of future experiences are inherently contained within the zygote.) Consider how you would feel if a friend were in a coma, but would probably wake up in a few month's time. They would lack any physical capability to be conscious, but would retain a capacity to hopefully be conscious some time in the future, because they still have a human nature. Would you say that they are a person, despite their current lack of person-traits? Or that it is okay to kill them, even though they will probably gain the ability to be conscious later on?\n\nAs far as viability goes, this is one of the common lines people draw. But what is the difference between a non-viable fetus and a viable one? One is a little bigger and a little stronger, that's all. Additionally, viability is a function of current and local medical technology. As medicine improves, the age of viability gets lower. Is the age at which a human organism becomes endowed with the right to life getting earlier as technology improves? Is a 23 week fetus in a 1st world country not a person, but a fetus in a 1st world country would be a person? If one travels from a 3rd world to a 1st world country, does one's fetus become a person due to the change in location?\n\n\n~TL;DR: Cookie ingredients are like sperm and eggs. An unbaked cookie on the sheet is a zygote, a baking cookie is a fetus, a gooey, still-not-quite done, too-hot cookie you just got out is a newborn, and the cooled, semi-soft cookie is an adult. However, all of those cookies are, well, cookies. An undeveloped Polaroid picture of, say, the Loch Ness monster is still a picture and is still valuable, because it has an inherent nature as a picture of the monster. Wouldn't you be angry if someone took that picture and threw it away? A pre-born human has an inherent nature as a rational, moral agent, even if she hasn't had enough time to fully develop those traits. Someone in a reversible coma is incapable of consciousness (which most people would say is a requirement for personhood), but is still a person because he retains a capacity for conscious (waking up later on) due to his human nature. It would therefore be unethical to kill him.\n\nThe only difference between viable and non-viable babies is that one is a little weaker, which I don't see as sufficient reason to deny the right to life. Viability is different at different points in history and in different countries. Is the age at which humans become people getting earlier as technology improves? Is a 23 week fetus not a person in the 3rd world, but could be a person in a 1st world country? \n\n(Edit: readability)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391105395", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

One Engine, Two Engines, Three Engines, Four Engines FUCK ME FREDDY.\n\nAt this point and time you wish Samuel L. were aboard the Train and some mother fucking snakes were lashing out from one of the carts in the back causing everyone to go into a 60mph train frenzy and hopefully abort ship upstream well past the sensor that will cause these demon spawn candy canes with flashing lights to move up like a stairway to heaven.\n\nBut that won't happen... You accept that.\n\nYou sit, By now more cars have piled up on either side of the train, it continues it's gradual pace of I Don't Give a Single Fuck, and truly, not a single fuck is ever given by these lochness monsters of the land. The only good thing? They never ask you for tree fitty, they just ask you for 5-100 minutes of your time depending on where you are and how fucked they want you to be.\n\nIt's 8:23am... your well on schedule... Not anymore, that thing you called a schedule doesn't exist. You are going to be late.\n\nWhat do you have, an appointment? Work? School? Is your Wife just pissed and needs you to get home? Nope. Nope &amp; Nope.\n\nDo you pick up the phone and call someone? Oh shit you need an excuse now, Trains again? You've used that 3 times this week already, they are tired of hearing that shit... \"*You Should Leave Earlier*\"\n\nSo you do, Doesn't Matter...\n\nThe train senses you like a Spider in a web of fuckery, and you're the helpless ant that wants to make the jump for no real reason other than you hope that's a cool nature trampoline on the other side...**SPOILER** It's not.\n\nSo now you're late, you wait. It's 8:30 you can see the end of the train. Thank you FSM.\n\nWAIT IT'S NOT OVER! Like a fucking Kanye West in the Grammys out of no where another train is coming... FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.\n\nOh Yeah?! You didn't even notice we had two sets of tracks here, buckle up bitches and turn on that radio it's going to be a long night.\n\nAfter The second train has passed in the same fashion, your day is ruined.\n\nYou get to where ever you need to be and get bitched at, a train is not an excuse...\n\nThen you call all your contacts in your phone who have the same problem as you because you live in the same town and you have the same conversation about how you hate trains and hope they go fuck themselves in the ass with a pineapple.\n\nBut that will never happen... The Trains will always win... They are the Elite Race. Trains&gt;Human\n\nSorry to break this to you guys...

{"body": "Okay, so one time I was in the office and everyone had just left to go to a \"work-lunch\". That's where they would go and get food and beers at lunch time while talking shop. I *really* would've liked to have gone, but I was broke at the time. As nice as it is to have a paid internship at an engineering firm, it didn't pay all that much and I had student loans to pay off. So there I was, alone in the office, no one around, with nothing to eat. Sure I could drive back to my apartment and grab a pack of ramen, but that's gas money. And like I said, I was broke. \n \nAnyway I start a pot of coffee to stave off hunger, and absent-mindedly wander around the office kitchen while it's brewing. I decide to look in the fridge just because. Sometimes people buy a big 30-pack of sodas for the office. Anything will do at this point, I'm hungry and I still have to finish up a day of work. So I look in there and it's pretty much bare. Some condiments, a bottle of water, and a container of what looks like day-old takeout sushi with no name on it. I did a cursory glance around the office, no one there. So...I take the sushi. No one is *really* gonna miss it right? They're all out at lunch getting slightly buzzed and eating chicken wings. \n \n \nThe sushi is clearly not fresh. You know when food is right on the cusp of going bad? Where it's like 12 hours older than its \"best by\" date. This sushi was at the point. But, fuck, I am starving. I open up the half-eaten day old sushi, and take a bite. Adequate. Then I hear someone say \"Are you fucking *serious?*\" I look over and it's the lead engineer for the simulation group, who happens to be my supervisor for the internship. \n \nI look to him and say \"Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I thought it was forgotten! There was no name on it. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. I'm *so* sorry.\" \n \nHe says \"That's okay, it won't take much to pay me back. I'm only gonna need about tree fiddy.\" \n \n\n \nIt was about that time I realized my lead was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the protozoic era! So I said \"goddammit I ain't gonna give you no tree-fiddy!\"\n \n \nThen I got fired, because I stole from another employee of the company and that's against the rules. \n \n \n**TL;DR: Was broke like a joke, and everyone else in the office was out to lunch. Still got caught and then fired.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391112589", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 28, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "About that EFI thingy I completely agree with you. I would also go straight for ford engine if I could find one. I can assure you that you have better chances to find a loch ness monster than finding a carbureted or any ford v8 engine in Slovenia. I dont have money to buy a new engine or even to travel to different country just to purcashe it. So that jeep engine is my only option if you consider cheap price. Is it possible to buy kits that would convert efi engines to carbureted? But then again mileage will suffer &gt;.&lt; I read about how this 318 aka 5.2l mopar small block is used in many differnet versions and it is based on same block. But still, its cheapest way to leave this engine as it is, original. What if I would take this engine and leave wiring and ecu's original, with all the same gauges and electronics, only that I would insert them on mustang dashboard? Or make custom dashboard which I mean is at least off a problem. So basically ECU will think that everything is normal. THen again I would probably have to focus on fitting the engine in car in that way, so there wouldnt have to be any changes to wiring and sensor positions. I think its the easiset way to leave engine, transmission and whole exhaust system identical to jeep's and focus on how the hell am I going to fit this in the car. I've never actually  done anything with cars, I am just using common sense and try to figure out how to make this work. So the biggest problem in engine fitment are probably engine mounts. My neighbours was part of a team who made Opel Astra Bimoto(car had two v6 engines, one in the front, on in the back :D) So I think he will be able to make me those mounts. Another question is rear end. Do you think this mustang with 2.3 engine has the same rear axle and driveshaft as GT? Will it hold the power? About the sound I also agree, I compared sound of a jeep to a mustang, and I prefer Mustang's note. But that doesnt mean jeep's V8 doesnt sound good. Ford just sounds better, that's it :D And if you consider that I drive 1.4liter diesel, the sound of a jeep's V8 is still gonna be heavenly :D", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391117221", "subreddit": "Mustang", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Every one was feeling so bad for him. I remember one of my friends even gave him an Xbox 360 because his broke. I also remember him losing his virginity. He finally got what he wanted. I was even starting to feel bad for him until he fucked up. \n\nMakes a post on Facebook saying that he had to travel somewhere but wouldn't tell anyone. He gets back from his trip so me and the guys start asking where he went and what he was up to. Turns out, he went to California for treatment of Huntington's. We asked how it went. He told us they cured him. \n\nThis is when the story starts to reek of bullshit. I am pretty sure there is no cure. We all kept going along with his bullshit miracle story while a friend (the one who gave him an Xbox) did some more digging. We searched online for days about curing an incurable disease. Nothing. We decided to just go right to the source: his mom. \n\nWe show up to his doorstep and knock on the door on a day we know he's with his overly sympathetic girlfriend. His mom answers. We start talking to her about her son, eventually bringing up Huntington's in passing. She lets us in. We sit down at the dining room table and she starts asking us what Huntington's is. We tell her, and she yells her sons name. Shit.\n\nHe's home. And with his girlfriend. Perfect. \n\nWe weren't ready to out him yet, but we had moms blessing. She starts talking to him and saying that if he had such a bad disease that he should have told her. \n\nI could practically see the sweat running down this lying fucker's face. He was twiddling his thumbs and fidgeting in his seat. I caught this lying fuck and he knew it. He started to cry. He said, \"Please. I need this.\"\n\nI smiled coyly at him, wanting to hear him say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\" \n\nHe looked at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my lying fuck of a friend was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed.

{"body": "Last week, my server got taken down, so the owner decided to go through a new hosting site. As I log in, I hear shots fired and bears grunting and zombies growling, so I instantly head for a rock to jump on and escape at least the melee damage. After all the animals are gone, I try to creep out in the opposite direction, only to be greeted by a naked man with and M4. So, I say \"Oh, uh, hey. How's it goin?\" To which he remains silent. He then types \"Follow me. Don't run away\" Feeling that this is sketchy as fuck, I follow him, trying to figure out where I am, using mountains and towns as markers to get to my preferred fort location. We arrive at a massive tower complex shortly thereafter, at which point my speakers explode with the sounds of electronic music and a gruff voice that tells me to get inside. So I do as I'm told hoping for some wood or something to help me on my way from a good samaritan. No such luck. He tells me that I now have to obey him, and tells me this is Rust fight club. he then abandons me in the first of what i think is at least 4 rooms that are sealed off from everything, including one another, judging by the sounds I hear as the man walks away. After a while of walking around naked in the first room, I hear more music. Then I hear \"Hey! The fuck d'you think you're doin?? Quit lookin' around and face east, toward the window, for 3 days. or at least until I tell you to move!\" I follow his orders, laughing the whole time, being wary not to broadcast my voice, because this is the funniest thing to happen to me in a while and I don't want to fuck it up. So, after about 20 minutes of me moving while he's gone, I'm let into a second room, this one with a furnace and workbench, and I'm told to smelt ore and craft items for this naked man in the tower. I agree, hoping I can take some of the materials to use for my own structures or weapons, and get started rather quickly, meeting the \"daily quota\" in about 10 minutes. He then leaves me alone in the small section of the compound, with access to the now confirmed 4 rooms. So, I decide to plan an escape. I continue to pump out resources hoping to skim some off the top and break a wall or something, but it's taking too long. So I ask him if we can go hunting. All I would need is a bow and a few arrows, I've gotten quite good over my Rust career, and he agrees to let me hunt. So we go out into the wilderness and after a half hour of hunting, he decides to set me free. So I build a small 2x1x2 house and proceed to live out my days in peace. Until, that is, I log in to find myself barred off in my own house. In what was my makeshift bedroom. Then, I hear heavy breathing in game. Turns out the guy had been raiding me as i logged on. He then locked me in my bedroom, and broadcasted through in game VoIP \"It puts the lotion... On it's skin.\" I then laugh at them and say \"No, no no. I'm fine thanks\" Shots are fired, sounds like shotgun shells. He then yells \"IT PUTS THE LOTION. ON. IT'S. SKIN!\" To which I laugh harder and say \"Fine, lotion's on. Happy now?\" And am let out of my room. He then kills me so I have no loot, and waits for me to spawn at my bag, in the other room, where he has looted and destroyed my crates. He then takes me outside where I fully expect to die, but instead, he yells \"Let the Hunger Games... BEGIN!\" and tells me to run before he traps me again. So here I am, naked, with a rock some bandages and a torch, running for my life from this crazy motherfucker with sadistic tendencies, to the tune of the Benny Hill theme. Laughing the entire way, and wondering how in the world my server got so weird. I then get far enough away that I can craft things safely, so I do so and later on confront him with the aforementioned bow. Before I shoot him, he says \"Wait, wait wait. Don't shoot, I let you live. Just take my shit and spare me.\" to which I reply \"I don't want your resources, I just need to borrow tree fiddy of your metal frags. I need a new door, and a P250.\" So he gives me what I need and I continue on my way. I haven't seen him since, but I know he's out there, avoiding me, keeping a watchful eye.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391150829", "subreddit": "playrust", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Although I don't agree, I can understand people feeling that the development of the nervous system is the standard by which we should judge the morality of abortion. After all, we typically consider more intelligent or aware animals to be more valuable, and personhood is often associated with higher mental capacities.\n\nBut consider a situation where you have an amoeba and a zygote, and you can only save one. Which do you choose? What's the difference between them? Myself, I would choose the zygote, because he/she has a fundamental human nature, and that means that he/she possesses a capacity for conscious thought that is simply not being expressed yet. By the same principle, I would say that self-awareness can be used as reasonable criteria for personhood, but that infants, who aren't self-aware, are people regardless because they possess an inherent capacity for self-awareness-it simply can't be expressed at the moment. That separates them from, say, a newborn calf, because a calf doesn't have a capacity for self-awareness. Another example would be a person in a temporary coma, who due to brain damage has no current ability to be conscious, but who remains just as valuable because or his or her human nature and capacity to be conscious in the future. \n\nA different sort of analogy would be an undeveloped Polaroid photograph. (Remember them? The instant pictures on white squares that came out looking all dark and smudgy?) Imagine you took an incredible, rare photograph. Say you're out in a boat on Loch Ness and manage to get a picture of the Loch Ness monster. But, before you could clearly see the image, another tourist in the boat with you excitedly grabbed the picture but threw it away in disappointment, because to them it was \"just brown smudges.\" How would you feel? And if you yelled \"That's how Polaroids work,  you idiot!\" and they responded \"Well it was only a potential photograph,\" what would you think? \n\nThe undeveloped picture is still a picture; it's simply in an immature state. Everything about the image was captured in it in an instant. You would, I imagine, be extremely pissed off in this situation, because the undeveloped photograph is clearly incredibly valuable and important, despite not yet developing all of its valuable properties. Like an embryo, it simply needs a little more time.\n\n~TL;DR: Humans all have a fundamental human nature, including extremely young humans (like embryos). That nature means that they have a capacity for consciousness, self-awareness, morality, rationality, etc., even if an individual is temporarily incapable of expressing those abilities. For instance, a newborn doesn't possess most of the traits we associate with people (self-awareness, etc), but they're people regardless because they have a human nature and therefore a capacity to be self-aware at another point in time. Same goes for an embryo; they share a human nature. Just like an undeveloped Polaroid photo of an incredible, rare image is valuable even before it is fully developed, an embryo is also valuable. Both inherently possess a capacity for valuable properties (consciousness, etc. for the embryo, a beautiful image for the photo), they just need a little more time to express them. You would be angry if someone destroyed your not yet developed photograph, because it inherently contains a not-yet-visible image that makes it valuable and important.\n\nEdit:clarity", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391154305", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The history of matriarchal societies: \nThere have been findings that suggest that there was feminine worship and consequently matriarchy in the Paleolithic era. The societies are likely too old and we have little evidence besides statues of presumed goddesses to conjecture their societal structures. \nThe binaries:\nAssuming that societies were dominated by women, firedrops claims that the characteristics of those in charge would not be much different. So, things we associate with men (who have been “in charge”) are only specifications that we associate with those in power. So, society has created the model of gender *yawn*. Firedrops thinks society would still create those models if women were in power. Things like strength, vitality, provider, protector, etc… would be assigned to the woman. \nIn contrast, niczar has brought up some circumstances that are inherently female such as breast feeding and vulnerability before and during child birth. Niczar uses these as examples of fundamental sexual dimorphism. \nTo challenge the examples use by Niczar, what if breast feeding and child rearing were not seen as something that creates vulnerability in women. Nowadays, pregnant women are coddled and treated like fragile beings. In contrast, it takes great strength to not only give birth to but carry a child for 9 months. I don’t say this to lift the veil and reveal female power, but argue that those acts should be viewed as strengths and not vulnerabilities. Sure, a predator could attack during child birth or near the end of a pregnancy term and the female would have little ability to protect herself. This is why women carrying and giving birth to children are rarely alone – it is seen as a social act. Groups of women, with wisdom and experience surround the child bearer before and after birth increasing her safety through greater numbers. Further, there are many acts that all humans do that put them in positions of vulnerability – meaning they could be susceptible to predacious attack. My point is being pregnant does not automatically mean that the female capability has been lowered to that of a young child, the elderly, or a crippled person. It only means that they require more biologically. Biological needs are often found, gathered, and manufactured by a society. So whether or not men have historically held power over these societies, they have been only holding power to serve those that advance their species. \nSo my point and questions to further the discussion is: Can societies be dominated by men, if the men have been servants the whole time? Perhaps sexual dimorphism has only grown more apparent because men and women have evolved with this developing binary. Men are physically stronger in some measurable areas because societal circumstances require them to be stronger when it comes to warfare, hunting, etc… whereas women are required to be physically stronger for child rearing. So, who is truly stronger and isn’t how we measure strength the root of that issue?\n(those were my interpretations of your thoughts, forgive me if I have misinterpreted) \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391191210", "subreddit": "AskAnthropology", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hoo, boy.\n\nI moved around a lot as a kid, due to my dad constantly being in and out of jobs. He took whatever he could get, and often that meant going from region to region. He was a specialist in his field, but the nature of his work was more or less seasonal or very geography-based and when we exhausted our time in one city, we would pick up and move to the next.\n\nI had moved four times by the time I entered the seventh grade. I was used to losing friends and making new ones, so I wasn't particularly shy when I had met the person who would later on become my best friend, Joe. We did everything together; sleepovers that would last days and days, inventing games to play against each other, growing up on video games that most bros did, like Super Smash Bros. We practically lived at each other's houses, our parents joked that each family should just adopt the other kid.\n\nJoe and I grew really close. One evening, we were out exploring the woods  near our houses (we lived two blocks away from each other) and decided to form a two man wolf pack cult thing. We built a campfire, had some s'mores and talked like we usually did. Then, as soon as our watches told us it was midnight, we took out a bottle of ketchup. We squeezed out a little ketchup on various appendages of our body, pretending it was blood, and took a sacred \"blood\" oath to be forever bros. Then we camped there overnight and continued on with our lives.\n\nWe remained tight bros up until graduation. We each got accepted into our dream colleges and went our separate ways. Social life took its own course and we started to contact each other less and less, but we never forgot the sacred pact we had made that one night.\n\nA few years back, we had our high school graduating class' \"20 years later\" reunion. Joe and I would rock this party, being the tight bros that we were. I showed up 30 minutes late (one of the traditions Joe and I made in high school) and poured myself a drink. I sipped it slowly as I eagerly waited for Joe to arrive. Not 10 minutes later he walks in with a gorgeous girl in his arms. She must have recognized me, because she walked over to me and took me aside with concerns about Joe. She said he had been acting really strange recently. She told me how he frequently asked to go visit the lake, muttering about how he wanted to be neck deep with his people, and his skin took on a strange ghostly green. As she was recounting Joe's illness to me, I tried to maintain eye contact with him, as if somehow telling him everything would be okay. I walked up to him and asked him if there was anything I could do to help him get through his strange sickness. He said, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was then I noticed that Joe was 5 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic era! That goddamned Loch Ness monster had tricked me again. I decided that I would stop associating myself with people completely since I was too trusting.
