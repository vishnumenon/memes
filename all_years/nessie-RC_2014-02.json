{"body": "Saw something very similar to this when I worked in an OR. Severely overweight fella, diabetic. Both legs had been amputated below the knee and he was blind to boot. Now I don't know if the penis was affected by the diabetes as well, but it looked like...like... any of youse ever burn your GI Joes? This rat bastard, Travis, got a hold of my figures, had Tomax and Xamot torture Flint with a lighter to the face. Goddammit, Flint was one of my favorites. Regardless, the head of Mr Diabetes' dick looked like poor Flint's melted plastic face. Only comparison I can make here. So the surgeon skins the guy from head to base, resulting in what appeared to be a cenobite's cock. Next he separates the urethra from the penis, kinda just slides the scalpel down to the hilt. Now you have the skinned dick and this floppy piece of linguine thing that looks like the tendon in chicken cutlets. Then the surgeon just lops off the penis. He cuts the damn thing off at the base and throws it over on a tray. To be honest, I don't recall there being much blood at all. I cringed a bit, but not as bad as I did when the urethra was being re-routed. This guy still has his balls remaining in tact, doc was polite enough to do that, but he jams the hemostat into the now cockless wound area and starts digging around, pushing further in. There's a slight bulge appearing in the patient's taintal area. It's the tip of the hemostat and they're being pressed hard against the skin from the inside. The skin is getting taut, turning pale (it was a black patient) from the pressure of the hemostat tip and with an audible 'pop', it came thru the skin. This hole was reamed out a bit and the urethra was shoved inside the dickless wound, the tip of it being sewn to the spot the hemostat had punctured. So now not only did this guy have no legs, was blind and had his willy cut off - he'd have to sit down to pee. Not that he probably didn't before due to no legs, but now he'd hafta wipe his balls off after peeing all over them. Afterwards in recovery, I had to find out how this poor fella faired. He was slightly out of it, although he went into the surgery knowing full well what was to happen. He was kind of teary eyed which was weird because I didn't think blind people could cry, so I asked him if he needed anything and he said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was the goddamn Loch Ness monster! And I said, \"Dammit, monster! Why you always coming up in here with the tree fiddy?! Go on your own way and get the hell out my life with the tree fiddy!\"\n\nEverything I have stated was true with exception re: Loch Ness monster.

{"body": "My predictions of 2014 for Nintendo: They run with the current release schedule up to E3. They tease \"huge announcement\". Everyone expects new Zelda/Mario/Metroid/Starfox. E3 comes. Reminds the audience of their hopes to license out their IPs to other developers. People getting excited. Start chanting all different IPs by Nintendo. Iwata goes on to say that they are indeed working on rebooting several of their IPs, but that isn't the huge announcement they teased earlier. They then show a slide on a huge screen, full of different major developers and publishers like SEGA, Capcom, Bandai Namco, Platinum Games, etc. Iwata goes on to tell the audience they dipped into their infamous \"war chest\" in the winter of last year when they realized that the Wii U would need a huge burst of games to help the console. Then the names of some huge IPs show up next to the developers names, Starfox, Metroid, Megaman, Earthbound, .Hack//, Gundam. Iwata then goes on to say that at first, they did consider giving out IPs for other developers to work on, but then decided that instead they should just bring the greatest developers to them. So they bought some of the biggest names in gaming to help them produce high quality games much faster to help permanently end the drought of games for the Wii U. Then dates show up beside all of the IPs, spanning from two weeks after E3 all the way to E3 next 2015. Promises truly innovative entries into their greatest series of all time, along with tons of new IPs for both the Wii U and 3DS. After that more footage is shown for \"Hyrule Warriors\". Shows off multiplayer \"war\" mode that looks really awesome and strategic. Announced to be released around December. Iwata then goes on to introduce the next announcement, a new trailer from monolithsoft. Fades in with huge robot fighting. Looks oddly different this time, yet glorious. Turns out to be multiplayer footage. Looks amazing. Date is announced as September of this year. Crowd goes wild once again. Iwata returns on stage. Announces account systems truly fixed and online network should perfected by \"X\" launch for optimal online multiplayer. Goes on to announce the 3DS can now be used as a tablet for the Wii U. Then goes on to say that most if not all local multiplayer and co-op games will be updated to have an online multiplayer and co op option. Crowd starts going absolutely nuts, starts throwing stuff in the air celebrating the second coming of Nintendo. Iwata then says there is one lst announcement, since the 3DS and Wii U work together now, they are going to launch a \"Mega-bundle\" which will include an all glossy black 3DS, Wii U console, Wii U Pro controller, and two black Wii remotes with nunchuck and classic controller pro for both. The crowd absolutely loses their shit, starts throwing money on the stage. Iwata then chuckles some, with a tear starting in his eye, and says, \"And all we will ask for this bundle is tree fiddy.\" It was at this time we noticed Iwata was actually 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. The crowd then screams \"God Damnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain’t gonna give you no tree fiddy!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391237827", "subreddit": "wiiu", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "An I.H.O.P. in north Houston.\n\nTL/DR; Terrible server, fucking old food, and live roaches in said food.  Manager still demanded we pay, we left after almost fighting him, GF defused situation.\n\nWe walked in (Group of 6, all under the age of 25), there was no host/hostess.  We waited for about 10 minutes, hadn't seen a server or host once.  A manager appears out of thin air, and takes us to a booth, with not a word said about our wait.  He brings us drinks and says the server will be with us shortly.\n\n35 minutes later (we timed it), the server shows up looking like a cross between [Drew Carey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004804/?ref_=nv_sr_2) and [DJ Qualls](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0702809/?ref_=tt_cl_t1).  His uniform was filthy, spotted with what I hope were grease marks and syrup stains.  And blood, I think.  His attitude left much to be desired, coming across as if we'd stabbed his unborn child or something.\n\nWe ordered, and another 45 minutes to an hour went by.  We were discussing the concert we'd been at previously, a Linkin Park show, when the server finally delivered our food.  It was old.  I don't mean it had been sitting there for the duration of our stay, I mean it had been cooked at least 2-3 days prior and refrigerated.    \n\nWe were drunk, stoned, and tired, so we were going to let it slide.  The dealbreaker was when a live cockroach crawled out of the caeser salad my now wife/then gf had ordered.  We booked it out of there.  On the way to the parking lot, the manager had the gall to come outside and tell us \"You'll pay for that food or i'll call the cops.\"  I looked him dead in the eye and spat at his feet, however my gf opened her wallet, and asked how much. He looked at her, thought a second, and said \"It's gonna be tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that was when I realized the manager was a huge plesiosaur from the Mesozoic era. I told him, I says \"You'll get no tree fiddy from me lock ness monstah.\" and we left.\n\n**FAKE EDIT**: In reality we almost got in a fistfight over the issue, when he accosted us in the parking lot I was pissed and so was my friend Matt (#2 on the wrestling team at school), and we were way ready to take this asshole out.  My gf, however, decided to defuse the situation by threatening to call her uncle, who worked with the health department for Texas.

{"body": "Bit of a long  story so hang in there with me. Might not be as creepy/disturbing in written form, but witnessing this is a whole different kind of thing...\n\nI used to have this friend named Sheridan in high school. In 10th grade we met but we didn't really talk that much, 11th was about the same but senior year we became really, really good friends.\n\nWe hung out everyday and used to tell each other all about our girlfriends and such. He was my most trusted friend at the time, which was kind of weird for me since I had some weird trust issues from always getting other friends using me and not really wanting to be my friends.. if that makes sense\n\nBut that's not important.\n\nAnyways, there's an amusement park called Lagoon a few miles from where we live, it's a pretty fun place and it's a good hang out spot in the summer for teens. We spent the entire year being friends and when the amusement park opened for the year in early June, we decided we'd both ask out a girl if they wanted to go to the amusement park with us and just hang out for the day.\n\nI ask out two girls before one says yes, he only needs to ask out one.\n\nThe day there was pretty fun, we went on rides, played the side games, at lunch and dinner there, and overall had a really fun time.\n\nTowards the end of the evening we decided to switch into our swimming suits (which we had brought with us) and go to the waterpark section of the amusement park.\n\nSo, we get our stuff and go into the water park. We haven't changed into our swim suits yet so the girls go into the girl locker room and me and Sheridan go into the boys locker room.\n\nFor some reason, Sheridan got really self conscious about his body all of the sudden. I asked him jokingly what was wrong and he got very offended, saying things like, \"Fuck off, dude.\" and \"Leave me the fuck alone.\"\n\nI'd be joking with him, but he sounded very serious, so I decided to lay off and get dressed. Instead of getting dressed with me he runs with his swimming suit into a bathroom stall. I get dressed and go out of the locker rooms to wait for him.\n\nAfter 5 minutes the girls come out but Sheridan still hasn't come out. Another 5 minutes goes by and me and the girls are starting to get worried. I tell them I'll go check on him.\n\nI walk into the locker room and can see his feet and clothes everywhere under one of the stalls. (The locker room and bathrooms were in the same room, by the way, this might be confusing)\n\nI thought he was masturbating so I get a genius plan to pop out under the stall and say \"boo\" or something.\n\nI creep up to the side and slide under the stall and shout \"STOP MASTURBATING\"\n\nHe was masturbating. But that's not the bad part, I expected that. The scary part was I discovered he was a hermaphrodite. I would have never known. I have nothing against hermaphrodites but I was absolutely shocked at finding this out. It explained why Sheridan was self conscious about taking his clothes off in front of me and everything.\n\nHe started freaking the fuck out when he saw my facial expression change so quickly.\n\n\"DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK? OH, GOD\" he kept saying over and over. I kept saying \"sorry\" as much as I could but he was absolutely furious.\n\nI felt absolutely awful, still do in a way. I get him to calm down and he starts yelling at me, \"I need you to never tell anyone.\"\n\nI say something like, \"Ok dude, I will never tell anyone, I promise. Is there anything else I can do?\" , he responds, \"No.\" but I keep insisting that I do something else for him. He keeps telling me no, so I suggest we go swimming now. As we're walking out he says, \"Wait, I need something else.\" \"What do you need?\" I ask. \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Sheridan was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit Nessie, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam off into the distance.\n\nI didn't get laid that night, neither did any of those girls. I'm sure they were confused when I tried to tell them the story and they probably didn't believe me.\n\n**TL;DR: Friend has a secret that I never would have expected, I find out the hard way.**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391275511", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Disturbing - When I first started work in the medical field, it was as a unit clerk in the critical care unit. One day, I'm sitting there doing my clerical thing and I hear yelling from the other end of the unit. There was a patient who had been put in four way restraints, big country boy fella from Dixie county. He had broken free and was yelling at the nurses, who in turn yelled at me to come over and help. It was like my third week there and I tried to pull the 'not in my job description' card, but they shut me down halfway thru that sentence. I was holding the guys legs down, there was a nurse at each arm and one at the head of the bed. This dude is just screaming, \"Get off me, woman! You're killing me! You're all killing me, get off me goddammit!\" over and over. And his face his going dark red, then to greyish blue/purple as his eyes are bugging out, it's Rodney Dangerfield-esque. He dies right then. Somebody is running to get the crash cart and I'm looking at this dead guy and realize my hands are still on his legs. Nope. Back to my paperwork. \n\nCreepy - My father was diagnosed with lung cancer at 52 and passed away about 9 months later. I was 18. It happened at the house, my parents had a hospital bed brought in and my father spent a lot of time in it, with his oxygen tanks off to the side. Not the little 'hold it in a bag' tanks, these were like 'hey that's the same size at the welding shop' huge ones. When he died, I performed CPR until the paramedics arrived. I had taken a short CPR class in high school, but it haunts me to this day; was I doing everything correctly, were the chest compressions deep enough, could I have done something better and saved him? I actually stopped for a moment after the first two breaths cause I thought my father had started breathing again. He had so much fluid in his lungs, the air that I blew in was making a bubbly/rattling noise as it was coming back out, making me think he was trying to breathe. Regardless, didn't work, paramedics used the paddles (i was numbly surprised that it was nothing like they show on tv), didn't work, my father was dead. The creepy part happened a week after. We had a computer in the den that my dad had purchased, Compaq with Windows 3.0, 750mb! He tried to keep up with the latest tech, wish he could see some of the stuff now. He had everything routed to a surge protector box with light up switches. A green one for 'Master' and orange ones for 'Monitor', 'Printer', 'Tower', 'Aux', etc. For whatever reason, my dad rarely shut the computer down, only the monitor. It's a week after his death, nobody has touched the computer. It's sitting there running, monitor off. The way the house was set up, if I was laying in bed in my bedroom and the door was open, I had a direct line of sight to the corner of the den where the computer was. I'm trying to go to sleep and a light goes across the wall. Round light, like someone playing a flashlight over the room, its color somewhere between white and green. I was about asleep at this point and I opened my eyes all the way. A few seconds later, the light goes across the wall again, from left to right, then back to the left - a simple swipe, if indeed it were a flashlight. I got up and went to my mother's (parents) room to see she was lying in bed reading and asked if she was screwing with me. She got a bit irate that I thought she would be playing flashlight games seven days after her husband's death, but I had no other explanation for it. I go back to bed and lay there wide awake, staring into the den, waiting for it to happen again. It didn't happen again. But I heard a loud click and the switch/light on the furthest right of the surge protector box goes off/out. Then the next switch, off. Next switch, off. I'm listening to these things snap off, watching the lights go out. Tower switch, off. Master green switch, off. I hear the tower finally powering down, that run-down whine. And I'm off, sprinting across the house. I was so scared, I slept in my parents bed. The more time passes and the older I get, the less possible that scenario seems, but that's how things played out. No Loch Ness monster ending here. Although I did have my junk squeezed by a ghost in Brooklyn several years ago, but I'll save that for next round.

Imagine the drinks you could make with both.\n\nLet's invest in this, you and me /u/PikaBlue. Whatya say? I'll run the bar half, you run the ice cream half. We'll start out as friends, of course, but then who should be supreme? The ice cream is integral to the idea, sure, but without the booze then it's just an ice cream store.\n\nAt first it'll be 50/50 with the business evenly divided. But then I'll start undercutting prices in order to get people more drunk, and you'll need to meet that demand. Soon you'll buy out the next building over as an extension to the ice cream shop. Maybe you'll even add special alcoholic milkshakes, or rum-and-coke floats.\n\nOf course by then there'll be nothing I can do. I can offer the old favorites, but by then you'll be working autonomously from me. And why not? Mixing the booze with the ice cream solves the problem just fine.\n\nThen I start dipping in to my own supply. I neglect my owners' duties and my half, now more of a quarter or even tenth, will fall into disrepair. It won't be long before we bring lawyers into this and a wall is put up dividing our two former halves.\n\nWith my investment lost and the bills piling up, I pawn everything not nailed down. I know a guy, Nick, from highschool who's gotten into a rough crowd. I ask if he knows a guy that can take care of my problem for me. Nearly bankrupt, I spend every last dime to put in an order of assassination. It's you I want now, whether I make it through or not.\n\nNaturally you're easily picked off with a clean shot to the head on your way to wherever it is you were going. With my partner dead, I'll have full control over both the bar and ice cream bar. Or so I thought. Little did I know you had an estranged son. One of those many girls you brought home must have gotten pregnant. I desperately ask the assassin to kill him as well, but he declines.\n\nKnowing I must have had some part in his father's death, the boy naturally confronts me. He finds me sitting drunk as ever in the dingiest corner of my empty bar. He raises a revolver to my head and screams \"Did you kill my papa?\". Barely able to form a sentence, I beg \"Please boy, have mercy on me. I have nothing left to me but this god forsaken excuse for a pub. Spare me and I will do anything I can to repay what I've taken from you. Please just name your price.\" Pulling back the hammer of his revolver, he slowly opens his mouth and whispers almost inaudibly \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNow it was about this time that I noticed this estranged young man was about 500ft tall and a creature from the Paleolithic era. I screamed \"Damn you lock ness monster, I aint givin' you no tree fiddy!\" \n\nRealizing he was beaten, he exits via the wall his \"father\" put between our shops. The creature was sent away for life for identity fraud, and I got my bar back. Business is good now. I'm happy again. I went to AA and talked about my problems, and I visit /u/PikaBlue's grave every day.

{"body": "My dad is autistic. He's also an accountant. I used to ask him for help on my math homework, but it would always turn into him having a meltdown while failing to explain it to me. Sometimes he would even become physically and/or verbally abusive. \n\nI'm not sure if it's true for all autistic people, but I can definitely say that for him most of the problem was how stubborn he is. Everything has to be done exactly his way, and it should have been done yesterday. If you make any plans, you might have to cancel them at the last moment because he may have a meltdown. \n\nYou can't avoid the meltdowns, because it's impossible to know what triggers them. As a kid you wouldn't be able to steer him anyways. Basically, being a kid under the supervision of an autistic person is pretty much dehumanizing. You have no control of yourself or actions, you have to do what your told pretty much all of the time. Most kids can go out and make friends, experiment a little bit and find out who they are. When the parent melts down anytime they break away from their set routine it is impossible for a kid to do those things. Looking back I think that was even worse for me than the more obvious abuse, but it was all bad.\n\nI mentioned \"help\" on my math homework. One time when I was about 11 he was doing his normal routine of helping me. I remember we were doing some multiplication problem concerning money. I couldn't get the answer right. He would write down how he does the problem on a piece of scrap paper to serve as an example, but he would do most of the problem in his head and then berate me if i showed things like carrying the ones and everything. It was impossible, and he was far too impatient to teach anything, so these homework sessions basically just turned into me being insulted for a couple hours usually. I remember this time got physical though, and he punched me in the head a couple times.  The problem was something about buying 22 suckers for 38 cents. I still remember the answer I got was $8.36. I knew I was right, and my dad was wrong here, which is rare. I remember crying and asking him to just tell me the answer when he was punching me. He told me it was about tree fiddy. That's when I knew that my life would never be the same. There was definitely a lot more to my dad than most people know.

{"body": "So me and my friend found this random dude walking along the side of a road and unlike most people in this game he actually came to say hello when we talked to him. Pretty chill dude. We told him we would give a prize if he sang a song and we like it, so he starts singing some song after a quick vote, we realized we couldn't agree on whether or not he was a decent singer. We had this dude play three more songs before we decided that we couldn't ever agree. I loved every note that this dude sang, but my friend wasn't having it. We agreed that we should try something else to test this dude's worthiness. We quickly devised that if we started shooting off some rounds and it attracted zombies, that he would have to fight the zombies. We would mend his wounds if he survived. So we empty like a clip or two into the air and l kid you not this dude single handedly kills 14 zombies with a baseball bat and was barely bleeding at all. We quickly tended to his wounds and agreed that he deserved whatever one item he wanted. Then this crazy dude starts chasing us, we high tail the heck out of there but the guy was really persistent. We look over our shoulders about a mile up the road and sure enough, he's still running at us like he wants to hug us really bad. But seeing as he has a baseball-bat equipped that he just used to kill like 14 zombies with, my friend and l were reasonably afraid, we run like 4 towns away and this guys is STILL following us. He was probably the most persistent person I have ever met in my life. He just simply and unequivocally would not give up. Finally, about an hour of solid running later, we talk to him. We agree to stop and give this dude his rightfully earned prize. We ask him what he would like or if needs anything. This dude went silent for awhile. He was quiet for about three, maybe four straight minutes. My friend and l talked and didn't want to disturb this crazy killing machine, but he earned a prize and a prize he should receive. We then asked him if he was still there and again want he wanted or if he needed any supplies. He said he was still there and that he was just having a really bad day. apparently this guy's dog just died three days after his girlfriend broke up with him because he couldn't move with her across the country to California. He really loved this dog and he had it for roughly 15 years. He proceeded to tell us a few stories about the dog and how much he loved it. He said he was really upset about his dog, and cared way more about it than his girlfriend. One time he took his dog to a park, and he started to.... uh... well, be VERY friendly towards a homeless man. This guy clearly loved his dog and had tons of stories to share with us. Afterwards, feeling rather sorry for the guy, we asked him one last time if there was anything, anything at all that he needed from us, it was his. At this point, he very wearily said \"I'm gonna need 'bout tree fiddy.\" it was at this moment that I realized this traveler was actually a hundred-fifty foot sea monster from the Paleozoic era. \"God damn lockness monstah!\" I said. \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" He ran way super quickly and l never saw him again.\n\nEven fixed the spelling (Most of it I think.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391328692", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

The first group, known as the, \"All Ogre Nows\" began to charge first, being the spearhead of our operation.\n\nOur Operation was simple. Get in, get out. Kill the naked Ogre before he maims and kills the last of human kind. Shrek, that bastard, every single night he goes out into the villages to plunder and rape the women and men of the village, shouting things like, \"It's all Ogre now!\" or, \"I'm going to SHREK you now, LADDEH!\".. For five years it was happening. The government decided to send in the largest team that we had, which was also a part of Apeture Science. \n\nIt was not a triumph. We didn't make a note this time quoting our huge success. \n\nThe spearhead was immediately destroyed by his rancid onion breath, melting their bodies into mere onions themselves. B Team decided to attack the left flank, Sabres in hand, while C Team, *my group, mind you,* attacked head on. We charged first, my best friend, a qt3.14 8/10 girl called femanon, our leader as well, was immediately killed. Four of the team got a single hit in before his massive ogre dick slung around and somehow managed to behead every last one of them, until I was left. By the time he was on me, B Team had charged, T-Boning him from the left side, knocking him over and everyone immediately starting to jab out his eyes. It appeared that we won. \n\nBut we didn't. Just before our eyes, Shrek transformed into a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era. \n\nWe dare not look. No one could, for fear of losing our money. I ran immediately. \n\nWe knew what was next. He needed about tree fiddy before he left us alone. We all shambled to get into our wallets, all of us so terribly poor, only containing pennies and dimes, if we didn't have enough, Shrek would come back out of this Paleolithic era monster. \n\nWe didn't have enough. Shrek came out of the monster's stomach, completely unscathed and now more erect than ever. My pants were already off, but my wallet was still full. I ripped out what I thought could be the last hope of humanity, and as I showed him, he disppeared, back into the night, afraid of the [only thing that could possibly kill him](http://i.eprci.net/dickbutt-mono]. A portal appeared, as our time was up trying to defend the villages. Back into the Labs. We couldn't call this a victory, he'd be back the next day, to kill even more. \n\nThe End.\n\nI'd like Portal, please!

{"body": "This happened when I was about 15 years old, and is the one thing in my life that has made me believe in the paranormal. \n\nMy great grandmother had been living with us for some time since my great grandfather had died the previous year. Well, she was old, and her health deteriorated more and more over the course of the year. Eventually, she was hospitalized, then put into a home where caregivers could keep a constant watch on her health. She eventually passed away a few months later due to heart related issues.\n\nA number of weeks pass, and the family has mostly finished mourning. I had never really known my great grandparents all that well, so I hadn't been too terribly broken up about her passing. It was around this time when my family began experiencing some strange things. It started off small, occasionally one of us would swear we heard the sound of someone shuffling down the hallway, or the floorboards creaking in the kitchen like someone was going to the fridge or the dishwasher. Of course, y'know, we sort of joked that it was her old soul coming to make sure the dishes were cleaned and put away and trying to decide what she would like for dinner. Of course, y'know, nobody ever just assumes, \"Fuckin' ghosts, man.\"\n\nThen it became a little weirder. This was about two months after she had passed away. Things had been pretty quiet , the other weird things had really died down in the past two or three weeks. Well, I was sitting in my basement watching television, it's late. My St. Bernard flopped himself on my lap, like the big lazy lump he was, so I'm sitting there watching TV and he's about falling asleep on my lap.\n\nWell, the lights kind of flicker a bit in the room, which wasn't anything odd, it was snowing like a son of a bitch outside and they did it all the time. Well, over about the next five minutes they did it another three times. I'm just like, \"Fucking power better not go out.\"  After the lights kinda flicker again, my St. Bernard, I'll call him Paulie, kinda rolled his head and craned his neck lying on my lap. I don't pay any mind to him, figure he's just sort of stretching. He stays in that position for a moment, but then suddenly sits bolt upright and almost fucking headbutted me in the face.\n\nSo I ask him, \"What, you need to go out?\" And I start getting up to go upstairs and let him outside to do the business, but he just stays sitting there on the couch, not even paying attention to me. I'm telling him to come on so I can let him out, and he just looks at me really quickly and then back at the wall. He suddenly whimpers and then barks like a puppy. Now, Paulie is a *big dog*, his barks sound like someone grinding sandpaper on a gravel road, but this was just a pathetic little whiny bark.\n\nI tell him, \"Paulie, shut up! There's nothing there, dumb-dumb, let's go outside.\" But he just continues to sit there and whine. So I'm starting to get a little nervous, and I'm not entirely sure why. I look at the wall where he's looking but there's just nothing there, I look back at him, and he suddenly jumps off the couch with his tail between his legs and comes over to cower behind my legs, still whining and looking at the couch. \n\nMy throat gets really dry and I'm having trouble breathing, I'm afraid to look back over at the couch now because my dog is having a fucking panic attack about whatever he's seeing. The lights flicker again and suddenly he bolts right the fuck upstairs like he was running from the most terrible thing you'd ever seen in your life. So I'm stricken stone-frozen in place because I'm beginning to panic now as well, it was one thing with Paulie downstairs with me, but now I was alone. It's about now I feel this very slight, almost unnoticeable puff of air on the back of my neck, and I could swear I heard something that sounded like, \"I need about tree-fiddy.\"\nIt was then I realized that hiding beneath my couch was actually a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"God dangit, monster!\" I yelled, \"I ain't givin' you no tree-fiddy!\" So, I ran upstairs and hid in my room the entire rest of the night, not daring to even peer out of my door. The next morning I tried to talk to my parents about it, but then and every time since they always treat me as if it's just too much to believe. But one thing is for sure, I know what happened to me and my dog in the basement that night. Paulie is dead now, because he was older than dirt, but he never liked being in the basement on his own after that.\n\nTL;DR Stay out of the basement.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391379322", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "In response to \"You win the lottery tonight; who do you tell to fuck off first?\"\n\nFirst, I would quietly make sure I'd won the money. After all, there's nothing worse than looking like an asshole in front of everyone you know. \n\nI'd quietly talk to an investment lawyer for a while. We'd discuss the best way to store the money, talk about diversifying my portfolio a little. Security would be high on my priority list for this conversation, so I'd be sure to pick a good accountant. Someone that really knew his stuff, knew where to put money, what to invest in - that kind of thing. I'd also make sure to befriend him. I'd chat him up, talk to him about his life. Learn about his kids, his wife, his hobbies. Understand something - this is not out of some creepy desire to know everything about everyone in my life. This is because it is much, much harder for someone to screw you over if they think of you as a friend. I'd be protecting my assets.\n\nI'd take a little more time after this before telling my family and friends to do one very important thing. I would give my girlfriend the perfect proposal. I've been hesitating for far too long now, because there's always something in the way - we're generally close to broke college students, stressed about schoolwork and real work and money. It's never felt quite right, and I've never been able to afford the time and money to go the whole nine yards. A romantic dinner, a walk through the park, a wandering violinist, watching the sunset - everything. I'd propose with a family ring, because I want it to be clear to her that that's what she's becoming, to me and to my family.\n\nAt no point during this would I tell her that I'd won the lottery. Before you say that this is selfish, hear me out. No matter what her response, I would clear her of her debts, clear her single working mother of her debts, and set up an account to put her through med school. This woman means more to me than anything in the world, and I wouldn't want to leash her with something as petty as money before I proposed. No matter what, I would pave her way to do what she wants in the world. She's a damn good person, and I'm not going to make what I do for her dependent on what she does.\n\nWhen the money was secure behind its walls of bank accounts and guardians of law an accountancy, I'd quietly talk to my friends and family. I would sit everyone down in a room and explain that I'd won the lottery, and it had been a big jackpot. I'd explain that I had no interest in being besieged by requests for money, and that, at the same time, I had no interest in holding on to all of my money. I'd go through my family and friends, and find out what they needed. Student loans? Gone. House payments? Gone. Car payments? Gone. \n\nI'd help people move if they wanted it - after all, a house payment doesn't help a lot in the grand scheme of things if you're going to turn around and sell it in two years. I'd also make it clear that this was, mostly, a one time thing. I'd pay for young relatives' schooling when they got there, of course, and I'd help out for emergencies, but I'd make it clear I wasn't a money tap, to be turned on and off at will.\n\nI'd settle down after this - buy a nice house wherever was most convenient, and explore my interests. I'd talk to my accountant a little more (his name is Mike, by the way) and see what it would take to start up a game store. I'd love to run one - gamers have one of the best communities I've ever seen. I'd run that shop like it was my livelihood. \n\nAll this time, I'd be sure to stay friends with Mike the accountant. Maybe we'd start golfing, or shooting pool. Who knows? The point is that he'd be my friend, and the money would be safer because of it.\n\nAs my fiance progressed through med school, I'd continue to explore my interests. I don't really know who I am as a person, what I enjoy - and I'd aim to find that. The money is just a means to an end. I'd move where I pleased - probably where my fiance's work and school took her. We'd grow old together, and have a family. Vacations would be nice and quiet, with all the fun of a normal family.\n\nI'd raise my children to be savvy about the money. They'd know when they were ready (around age 10 or so) that their parents were rich, and I'd be sure to educate them on how to handle that. I'd want to teach them how to be decent people, because that is the most important thing you can teach your child. Money can be a corrupting force, and the worst thing I can imagine is having my own child corrupted by that.\n\nI'd be sure to reach out to Mike once in a while - I've moved around, but he's still my accountant. I wouldn't want to betray someone I thought of as a friend, and he's done a damn good job of looking after the money. It turns out, though, that he's fallen on some hard times. His wife left him, and she got the kids, and the house. He has a crappy apartment now, and a drinking habit to boot. I feel sorry for the guy, but I can't just solve his problems for him by throwing money at them. I set him up with some rich buddies of mine, and he does well out of them - after all, he's damn good at his job, when he's sober.\n\nTime goes on, and all is well. Mike does okay for a few years, but then he drops off my radar in a big way. The money has diversified, and he's no longer really my accountant, through no doing of mine. It just sort of left his control. I decide I'll change that, though, and I call him.\n\n * \"....Hello?\" - Mike\n * \"Hey, Mike, good to hear your voice! Look, I wanted to talk over my accounts with you.\" - Me\n * \"Oh. RFLS. Good to hear from you. Look, this isn't a great time. Can you maybe drop by tomorrow?\" - Mike\n * \"Uh...sure, I can do that. See you then, Mike.\" - Me\n\nHe sounds drunk, and he seems to have forgotten that I live halfway across the country now. It's no big deal, though, and he needs my help. I'm his friend, so what else can I do?\n\nI book a plane and fly out there the next day. It's drizzling out when I reach his place and ring the doorbell. I stand there, my clothes dampening slowly, until he opens the door. Mike looks goddamn terrible. He's put on at least a hundred pounds, and his dank, greasy hair hangs about his face. He's in a rumpled suit, and his eyes are bloodshot and unfocused. I stare for a second at my old buddy, waiting for him to invite me in. He finally does so, and  I step inside.\n\n * \"So..how are things going, Mike?\" - Me\n * \"Not so great, RFLS. I uh...well, I sorta picked up a gambling habit. Shit's bad, but it makes me feel alive, you know?\" - Mike\n * \"Uh-huh....\" - Me\n * \"Thing is, I kinda got in over my head. I owe the mob nearly half a million. You gotta help me out, man.\" - Mike\n * \"Look, Mike, you know me - I don't hand out money like that.\" - Me\n * \"Man, just help me! It's three hundred and fifty grand. They're gonna kill me!\" - Mike\n * \"Okay, Mike, calm down. I'm sure I can work something out with them, but you've gotta get yourself together in the meantime.\" - Me\n * \"GET MYSELF TOGETHER? THEY'RE GOING TO KILL ME, AND I'M THE LAST OF MY KIND!\" - Mike\n * \"Last of your...?\" - Me\n\nAnd that was when I notice that my overweight, run-down friend and accountant, Mike, was actually nearly five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era. \n\n * \"Yes, the last of my kind! I just need about tree fiddy!\" - Mike\n\nAs I ran out the door, I yelled one last thing to the towering monster standing behind me in a booze-soaked suit.\n\n * \"Fuck off, Mike!\" - Me", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391393908", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So . . . basically what this article did was put together all of the fourth conditions any epistemologist has ever offered, and proposed the conjunction as an account of knowledge.  It ended up with, \"you know something iff\":\n\n1. P is true.\n2. You are sure that P.\n3. You are justified in being sure that P.\n4. P was not inferred from false belief.\n5. If P was untrue, you would have not believed it.\n6. Your beliefs in these matters are mostly accurate.\n7. You believe P by a reliable method.\n\nSure, it's going to be hard to come up with a counterexample (of the Gettier-style sort) that shows the proposed account is *too weak,* something which satisfies all the conditions but isn't knowledge.  But I don't think it will be too hard to show the account is *too strong,* and if that is the case it is just as defective as an account of knowledge than one which is too weak.\n\nFor starters, I (along with most epistemologists) endorse a fallibilist conception of knowledge, so I think that including (2) as a necessary condition will give you an account that is too strong.  I take myself to know that the Loch Ness monster does not exist.  Am I *entirely* sure?  No.  It's *possible* that the Loch Ness monster *does* exist, I just think it's extremely unlikely.  Including (2) as a necessary condition for knowledge will exclude this and almost all of our empirical knowledge in the same manner.\n\nI could go through a few other examples that might raise problems for a few other conditions, but the important point here is that by simply *adding on* all the conditions, one gets an account of knowledge that is neither intuitive nor elegant, and doesn't neatly *click* with our everyday conception of knowledge at all.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391406274", "subreddit": "philosophy", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

But the knowledge you gain, the people you talk to, or even the amused annoyance you get after reading a tree fiddy story, make it worth all the time you spend here. Reddit is a wonderful community, when used rightly. It makes you think, it makes you learn, it makes you feel. It provides a platform to connect with similar people, and interact with people from all over the world.  It has the potential to change you in a very positive manner.   \n \n\nSince I joined reddit during my formative years, much of who I am today is because of it. \n\n\nJokes in threads on /r/askreddit, even the circlejerk ones, never fail to brighten my day. /r/askhistorians, /r/answers, /r/science, /r/todayilearned, etc. provide a plethora of knowledge for me to learn from. /r/femalefashionadvice, /r/abrathatfits, /r/skincareaddiction, /r/makeupaddiction, /r/redditlaqueristas and /r/thegirlsurvivalguide  gave the the quintessential 'girly' knowledge which I wouldn't have learnt otherwise. /r/fitness, /r/xxfitness, /r/getmotivated, /r/c25k inspired me to care about my body and make an effort to get fit. /r/relationships, /r/raisedbynarcissists, etc. gave me communities to discuss problems in. /r/teenagers allows me to interact with people of my age from all over the world. Then there are fan communities like /r/Harrypotter, /r/doctorwho, /r/starwars, /r/cumberbitches. Oh and shoutout to /r/sex for making me a sex-positive person, unashamed of my sexuality. And all this is barely touching the surface. There are hundreds of subreddits out there, and each person can find communities with shared interests. It really is a wonderful website. And the people here are amazing. \n\n\nReddit has shaped my personality. It has moulded me into a worldly, aware, positive, empathetic person. And I could not be more grateful.

{"body": "Served approximately three years in the police force in the UK before I decided that I wanted to take a different career path in the Justice System, so I am now currently studying my Masters in Law at university.\n\nI first became a basic police officer in 2009 after first graduating from university with a bachelors in Criminology and Psychology joint honours. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my career path as I knew that the supply/demand for Criminology graduates is way out of proportion. So this one time at a family gathering my cousin suggested about the police force as his dad had been in the police force until his retirement.\n\nI got through all the training necessary and after finally receiving my badge I was excited as I finally had a career in something I could work my way up in. My mother didn't approve because of my cousins' dads history with violence within the police and the horror stories he would bring to family gatherings sometimes, but I was ecstatic to finally be somewhere I wanted to be in life after university.\n\nAnyway, the first one and a half years were pretty basic things and I never encountered anything out of the ordinary; speeding, minor drug possession, assault, theft and a couple of burglaries but I always had a police officer with me, so nothing ever amounted to violence or bribes just as yet.\n\nThis one time after I had been in the police for about a year and 8 months (maybe?) me and my partner pulled over this outstanding looking Audi R8 for doing 60 in a 30 zone. We knew as we put our sirens on that this was going to be some rich punk that could afford the best lawyers/solicters (however you say it where you're from) to get out of whatever we could charge him with. But we pulled him over anyway after we had our sirens on and he offered us £800 in CASH right there to walk away, £400 for me and £400 for my partner. However we declined and proceeded to give him a ticket for speeding.\n\nThe next encounter was literally a month later (round about) and this shitty Fiat Punto was doing literally about 70 MPH in a residential area. We were quite shocked so proceeded to pull him over, what was coming next was literally mindblowing.\n\nWe pulled the car over and these 3 asian guys were in the car and the car had powder literally all over the back seat, like a package had split all over the back (im guessing it was cocaine) and the guys hardly spoke any english. We ordered them out the car anyway...\n\nthis one guy who was the leader of the 3 i would assume as he could speak some english, he said 'i pay you to go' and i instantly knew that these guys would be packing tonnes of cash if they could afford that much cocaine, i dont really know street value prices but there was a shit tonne.\n\nmy partner was edging close back to the car to radio for some backup to give us a hand but i told him to stop. as soon as i did, the 'leader' leant into my ear and whispered 'i give you a lot of money', i whispered 'how much back' and he promptly answered 'tree fiddy'. I promptly accepted the offer, shared half with my partner and didn't say a word to anyone else. it made me a lot richer and made christmas very easy.\n\nTLDR; asian guys with drugs in back end bribe me, i accept. me and partner never say a word.

Hell no, we had one of those massive satellite dishes that my brother and I crawled on and messed up dad's NFL game all the time.  This was far darker than some movie.  I'm talking about the real life of your average three year old.\n\nI grew up on a farmhouse in Indiana.  Like, imagine Indiana (minus Gary and Indianapolis, that's cheating).  Now imagine an Indiana that is *somehow* 100 times more rural than your mental image, and we're approaching the house that i grew up in.   I think the road got paved a couple years after we moved.  Our \"neighborhood\" was a collection of three houses, each about three quarters of a mile apart from the others.  And yes, fields as far as the eye could see.  If you know a thing about crop rotation, some years the farmer planted milo, or soybeans.  But others... sometimes he'd plant corn.\n\nDespite the title of this thread, I wasn't terrified at all.  Cornstalks were just overgrown dandelions in my mind, and I sure as hell wasn't worried about something that was stuck in the ground.  I didn't have irresponsible parents, but they did let me play in the cornfield behind our house, so long as I didn't go *too* far.  It was the best!  My first dose of complete freedom, playing Transformers or Street Sharks.  Karate chopping this innocent farmer's fall investment into so many trampled stems!  Kevin Costner got it right:  Iowa isn't heaven.  He was close, but he neglected to say what exactly heaven was:  a three year old in an Indiana cornfield.  Until that day.\n\n\nI had to get the rest of the story from my mom, since I've long since repressed what happened in that field, so long ago.  She had been vacuuming the living room when she heard my inhuman banshee wail carry over the roar of our Oreck.  This is obviously the last thing any mother wants to hear, so she intercepted me just as I left the field.  And I was in hysterics.  I was a talkative little guy even then, but she couldn't get a word out of my mouth for a good 40 minutes.  I continued to blubber and trying to struggle out of her arms, always away from the cornfield.  And I never went back.\n\n\nSo what happened?  I can see you, sitting there.  Maybe at work.  Sneaking glances at your phone in class.  And trying to guess where this thread is going to go.  Was I hiding in the corn when the combine suddenly appeared behind me, eating up rows of corn like a big green Langolier?  Attacked by a wild animal?  Deathly case of allergies?  Is this a tree fiddy joke?  Relax, put those brain cells to rest, and let me finish.  Thank you.\n\nFinally, my tears dried up, and I sat in traumatized silence in my bedroom.  Mom eventually figured that I'd sat long enough to talk about it.  \"What happened, buddy?\"\n\nI looked up with watery eyes, and said:  [\"...

Unbeknownst to the young kid his dad wanted to pull a prank on the boy when he is older, so he builds a false drawer in the desk with intentions to tell him to check the top left drawer when the boy asks to borrow cash. But the boy never asks. \n\nYou see, building that desk by hand taught him a valuable lesson at a very young age. You should work for the things you want the most in life, not just ask for them to be handed to you. So this young boy grows up to be a well respected, hard working man. His father is so proud that he never reveals his earlier intentions.\n\nBut now the father is growing older and his body is starting to break down. He falls sick one wintry afternoon and after being rushed to the hospital the doctors announce he is not expected to last very long. \n\nThe boy and his mother are talking in the lobby while waiting for the results of his father's medical tests. She tells him of the story of a young boy and his father building a desk together. She goes on to describe a secret compartment that appears empty, but in reality is filled with much more than the eye can see. \n\nThe boy goes in to see his father one last time. Their eyes well up with tears and the boy asks \"Hey dad, can I borrow $10?\" The father's face fills with pride. Tears streaming down his cheek, he says \"Sure son. Check the top left drawer of my computer desk.\" \n\nThey embrace, say I love you, and the boy leaves to go home. \n\nHe checks the desk, pulls the drawer open and sees nothing. Then he remembers what his mother said. \"It's filled with much more than the eye can see.\"\n\nThe boy pulls out the desk drawer and affixed to the back is a folded $10 bill with 5 words scribbled on the back. \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391470837", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Once I dated a rather well off girl as well.  Not to brag or anything, but her father owned a Fortune 500 company.  Literally everything in her life revolved around money, and here was me, the middle-class boy who, by the sweat of his own parents brow, managed to get into a rich kid private high school.  Somehow I managed to get the courage to ask her out, and she said yes.  \n\nThings weren't so bad at first... always got to go to the best restaurants (she would buy no matter how much I insisted), great concerts, and she even got us into a world-premiere ow Twilight.. I didn't enjoy the movie that much, but I enjoyed the experience.  I got to go on vacation with her family to Europe, Japan, Australia... literally it was if all her money was my own, if I wanted something she would buy it for me.  I'd usually feel a bit guilty asking her for money, but we'll get to that later. \n\nAs we got deeper into our relationship, she began to reveal I was her first boyfriend... she was really very insecure, despite her popularity, as she never had a close relationship with her dad.  All he did was work and pay for anything his \"little princess\" wanted - he never showed her any traditional form of love.  She was really very attached to me and I was in a way a father figure in her life, as weird and creepy as it may sound.\n\nAs you can imagine, because of this after a year or two she began to get really attached.  Like, overly attached girlfriend attached.  She wanted to be near me 24/7, to the point where I almost never saw my own family.  I loved her, but I love my family too and it was getting to be too much.  On nights I didn't say at her house she would text me at 3am asking if I loved her and if I wanted to come sleep over... I'd say in my mind \"Hell no!  I won't want to drive to your place 20 minutes away and then get two hours of crappy sleep!\" but in my heart I felt like I had to.\n\nOne day, it went too far.  She essentially told me I had to live at her house, and her parents had already set up a room and a *freaking private servant* for me.  I knew for a fact this was too far and told her we had to be over.  She instantly broke into tears and began to hit me and run after me as I went to my car... the one she paid for.  I felt so guilty.  She screamed after me \"WHAT CAN I DO SO YOU'LL STAY WITH ME?\"  I turn around and I said, \"I'm gonna need you to back off for a while and Ill come back later today and we can talk it over.\"  She replied, \"...ok, can you come back around tree fiddy?\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she jumped into her pool and swam away into the distance.\n\ntldr; dated rich girl; she had some weird attachment issues.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391564155", "subreddit": "firstworldproblems", "score": 5, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I'm gonna copy over a story I posted on a previous thread titled, \"What is the farthest you've gone for the sake of a joke?\"\n\n**THIS IS NOT A NESSIE STORY**\n\nBack a couple of years ago, I had written 'Frontier(s)' on a piece of paper. (It was supposedly a good movie, but it ended up being horrible, and i wanted to remember it, so I wrote the name down) \n\nSo I had this piece of paper in my pocket. And one night after being drunk with friends at my house, everyone was asleep. Apparently I had put the paper on the fridge, via a magnet. It took about 2 weeks for anyone to notice it.\n\nThen it began.\n\nEveryone was asking everyone who wrote it, who put it there, what it meant. Even went as far as taking handwriting samples to compare to the original. Somehow, that didn't catch me. Probably cause my handwriting blows, and is different everytime. \n\nSo noticing that this was becoming a sort of big deal, I decided to push it further. We had a large concrete porch in the backyard, that we wrote on with sidewalk chalk quite often (Yes, we smoked trees). So I woke up early one day and wrote 'Frontier(s)' again, on the sidewalk this time. Someone noticed it that day. And everyone started freaking out about it. Since it was a few weeks from the original incident, and the talk was starting to die down. \n\nThis reignited it, in full force. And thus, I kept pushing harder. The next morning I littered the back porch in frontier(s). Written in at least 10 different places. I also changed all the names of a few different saved games, for games that I don't remember, to Frontier(s).\n\nI can't for the life of me remember what exposed me in the end. But they all did discover it was me leaving them everywhere. And it was so worth it. hands down the most fun I've ever had.\n\nI actually have another Frontier(s) story. If this post gets a good response.\n\nEDIT: Good enough response. STORYTIMEIEMEIMIME.\n\n\nSo the previous story happened when I was pretty young. 16 or so. This next one was when I was a Senior in Highschool. A little backstory on what the Frontier(s) movie was. It was basically a French version of SAW. To give a little insight on the end of this story.\n\nOne of my friends from the house, knew about the whole Frontier(s) prank, and we decided to do something similar at school. It started with small stuff, typical shitty teenager acts of vandalism. Writing Frontier(s) on things in Sharpie became a fun game. We'd write it in places all over school, and other people would find them, and it would be fun. \n\nBut like all fun 'pranks' shit got crazy.\n\nWe started getting ballsier with where we placed them. More obvious. Writing on windows, (With dry erase markers, as to not be COMPLETE assholes.) Community board notices for dances, that sort of thing. It got really big when I got someone on the morning news to put a 'Frontier(s)' crawler across the bottom of the screen for just a few seconds. Someone else got it in the year book. Part of the background on one of the pages was just words like, 'Inspiring', 'passionate', 'ambitious', and of course 'Frontier(s)'.\n\nWhat really put the nail in the coffin was when one of our friends who was in on it, got 100 pieces of paper and wrote Frontier(s) on all of them. Dropped them in the middle of the floor in the Rotunda. Which was a place you HAD to travel between classes on any given day.\n\nThis caught the principals attention. \n\nApparently that night he went home, and googled 'Frontiers(s)' and found out that it was a horror movie, where a group of people catch other people, and kill them in fucked up ways.\n\nAs you can imagine, this didn't bode well.\n\nAn all out search began, with the Authority people, including SRO looking around the school for more signs of Frontier(s), talking to kids to see if they knew anything. And eventually, they called me into the office.\n\nWhen I got there, there were 4 other of the people who did it the most there. How they knew it was us baffles us to this day. Dudes were good. So they talked to us at length about arresting us for what they thought was a terror attack. And how we were all going to go to jail, and all that junk.\n\nLuckily we all replied the same thing. \"I've never even heard of Frontier(s).\"\n\nStrangely enough, we all got off scott free. And that was the last time Frontier(s) was seen.\n\nSome say the word still lingers in the minds of those it tortured. Some say it was a myth, and never even happened in the first place.\n\nBut some of us have seen, and some of us know.\n\nWhat is lying, just beyond the Frontier(s).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391568452", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

All the world'a gasoline had been tapped out, as had its natural gas. Earth was bleak, and would long since have ceased to be had it not been for Wheat Thins. In April, in a strange and painstakingly documented experiment, scientist Avril Lavigne finally succeeded in breaking apart a Wheat Thin, in her lab, with a diamond pickaxe. It was a breakthrough unparalleled in modern science history. A few glances in the microscope confirmed her hopes. The particles that made up what once was a Wheat Thin were clearly radioactive. She quickly ran to the her lab table and gathered a small portion of the particle. She scurried over to her Hadron Collider and dropped them in, accelerating the particles to speeds that would get you a speed ticket in anywhere except Germany. The two particles collided, and a giant dust mote swirled up. She began coughing, and accidentally sung a few bars from \"Complicated\". The dust slowly dissipated, and a figure strode through. Covering her eyes, she attempted to see who it was, but whoever it was, he/she/it was very bright. \"Wha...what are you?\" She said, in shock. The man strode into the light. It was Nicolas Cage. \"Nicolas Cag-\" She began to exclaim, but he ripped his sunglasses off and his skull caught on fire. \"What are you doing?\" She yelled, still completely confused as to how two microscopic Wheat Thins had yielded this fabled prophet. \"Just come with me,\" he said, and out of nowhere, his bike skidded to a stop at his feet. \"Wait,\" he said, clearly hesitant, \"I'm going to need one thing.\" She just stared for a second, blinded by his rugged good looks and the flaming skull. He cleared his throat. \"Oh- what do you need?\" He looked her in the eyes and whispered, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was at that moment that she realized she was facing a Crustacean from the Paleozoic Era.

{"body": "It was 1996, I was 13. My uncle showed me this cool new thing he got called \"the internet\". I accidentally found porn within 3 hours. Like a boss. Looking back I literally cannot remember what I looked at before the porn happened. This was the early days when all that was easily found were paid sites so I just looked at the \"free\" pics on the homepages with starburst over the nips. I did this for like 4 hours and it was AWESOME.\n\nThat night, my uncle told my mom about it and I got in alot of trouble. He said he can literally see everything I'm doing. I was terrified and thought he was watching the monitor somehow. In reality he just looked at history but keep in mind this was in 96 before the concept of \"searching for answers\" was a thing and I've had less than 3 hours of non-porn internet experience. A few weeks later I was allowed to go back online with the promise of not looking at porn because it's wrong and my uncle is \"watching\".\n\nI went online, looked at some dragon ball stuff, some puppies, some cats... then the pussy links started to come up. I hovered my mouse over the link and did my best to resist. I can imagine my uncle just watching the monitor in a secret closet somewhere waiting for me to click...I stared at the link for what seemed like an hour and finally *click*. I KNEW MY UNCLE WAS WATCHING AND I FUCKING CLICKED IT ANYWAYS! Like a boss.\n\nThen...silence...dead silence. I'm waiting for the door to be kicked down, mom and uncle in anti-porn swat gear and god himself bringing down the wrath but...nothing happened... Have I evaded capture? Impossible, my uncle is in IT tech school. Then it dawned on me, he must be recording it and haven't seen it yet. O god I'm so fucked...but not yet...I will be, but not right now. Right now I have the keys to the pussy mobile and I WILL have my fill if I was getting in trouble for it anyways and boy did I have my fill. I probably infected his computer with every single virus known to mankind looking at pasty nips in the next 6 hours. Like a boss.\n\nThe sun started to set and I was getting tired of looking at pasties. That's when I noticed my mom's purse in the room. A light glistered in my eyes. \"30 days free trial with credit card\". I almost fainted at the mere thought of seeing past the black star bursts. I can't. How will I cancel? What if they charge me anyways? A million what ifs running through my head as my hands started to type in my mom's credit card info. Then, at the last minute, I came up with a plan... My mom has a unique first name separated by a space. What if I just typed it in without the space! Surely, they won't be able to find us without the space! Yes I was completely retarded but the card worked. I was in and I discovered what a vagina really looked like for the first time. Like a boss.\n\nThat night I got in more trouble and was banned from my uncle's computer for life but fuck it I knew what a vagina looks like and it was worth it. Curiously, no one asked about the credit card...must be my genius no space scheme. Fast forward a couple weeks I'm sitting at the dinner table eating some pop tarts while my mom is sorting through bills and out of the corner of my eye I see an envelope with the familiar BofA logo...moment of truth. She picked up the envelope, looked at it, picked up the letter opener, carefully opened the letter, took the paper out and unfolded them. I have beads of sweat rolling down my face as she reads the credit card bill. Her eyebrows tightened as she examines the bill and at this point I can barely breath...

{"body": "\"When I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\nOne day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\" I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies? I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy. The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free. So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence. I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\nNope.\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too. He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars. Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\nFast forward one year. I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\"What?\" I asked. He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again! I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\nSo yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst here. But I haven't eaten smarties since then, that's for sure.\"\n\nfrom [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wawni/whats_the_biggest_dick_move_youve_ever_done_to_a/c5bsqgv)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391610016", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Do you believe in Santa Claus? Unicorns (obviously not), Dragons? Leprechauns? Astrology? Homeopathy? Emails from relatives of Nigerian royalty? \n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause there's no evidence.\n\nBut you'll believe that there's a guy in the sky who can do magic?

Imagine what it would be like if you had been born into a different religion or into no religion at all.

Same symptoms, too... a couple tired arguments, unwillingness to see (or even respond to) legitimate criticisms of the argument.\n\nI do think I see what you're saying though.\n\n&gt; if bigfoot was widely accepted, amongst those who accept it what is there to debate? theyd take their conclusions and move on. \n\nBecause 1/3 the world agrees bigfoot exists, but not where he lives or what language he speaks.  Another 1/3 thinks bigfoot was eaten by the Loch Ness monster, most of those left believe in different beings... and a couple people think they're all nuts, but seem to be the squeakiest wheel.\n\n&gt; Though, as an atheist myself, I find it sad that there is a vocal group of us who also rather go \" aha u sux im right u stupidheads \" instead of honest conversation about beliefs and the lack there of\n\nAgreed.  I can honestly say that when I was on the fence with religion and atheism, it was the equal irrationality in atheist behavior that made \"go with what seems most reasonable\" land me in the theist side of the line.\n\n&gt; Though, to our credit, I understand why many seasoned atheists get tired of debates at some point simply because of how redundant it gets. religious debates are in no way fluid or dynamic and after a while gets strenuous.\n\nThree counterpoints.  \n\n1. If you are tired of debating, don't debate :)  That's what I did\n\n2. If you cannot agree on a baseline, you cannot debate.  In almost every debate I've seen NOT including atheism, there have been explicit or implied axioms that both sides would accept.  That includes scientific, ethical, legal, and even inter-religious debates.  Without some sort of common ground, you're boxing in different rings.\n\n3. The ever-increasing disrespect has led to the atheist side getting less diligent in checking themselves.  Some major atheist arguments have been completely logically proven unmaintainable, and yet continue to be baselines... Ironically, in cases like Russel's Teapot, they seem so out of their original context you have to feel bad for the way it villainizes their founder.\n\n&gt; as an atheist I can only hope I don't fall into such a bitter point in my life.\n\nAs long as you question that, you're probably fine ;)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391708346", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When Bill Nye says he would need evidence (to change his mind and believe in creationism) he was probably also thinking that there could never *be* any such evidence, that such evidence is *extremely* unlikely, or *impossible*. And if such evidence is impossible, then nothing would change his mind, just like Ken Ham.\n\n*What* evidence would Bill Nye need to change his mind?\n\nScientific theories, like natural selection and evolution, come from observations of the natural world. But nobody can observe the origin of the universe. The origin of the universe is not reproducible, yet [reproducibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) is one of the main principles of the scientific method. If it's not reproducible, how could any theory about the origin of the universe be scientific? How could one falsify any theory about the origin of the universe?\n\nThose who reject creationism accept abiogenesis, non-life becoming life on its own. But nobody can observe the [abiogenesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis) that supposedly occurred on Earth over 3.5 billion years ago. And that singular event is not reproducible either. The idea of reproducibility relies on [ceteris paribus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus), \"all other things being equal.\" And in scientific experiments, that happens when a scientist controls for every other independent variable, so the effect of a single independent variable on the dependent variable can be isolated. Can a scientist control for every other variable in the universe at a point 3.5 billion years ago? That event, I would dare to say, is unrepeatable. Humans could attempt to repeat it in labs, but that would only support the theory that conscious beings can engineer life -- intelligent design.\n\nThere are many different theories of abiogenesis. But what is the evidence it *did* happen? Someone might point to the [Miller-Urey experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment), but was *life* created in that experiment? (And if life *was* created in that experiment, then it was intelligently designed.) If a scientist can't say *how* abiogenesis happened, how can they accept that's how it *did* happen? What is the evidence that non-life *can* become life on its own, since nobody has ever observed non-life becoming life without prior actions by a living thing? Unless they believe that abiogenesis happens all the time (which is not unlike the idea of [spontaneous generation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_generation) -- of maggots arising from dead flesh. However, if abiogenesis is true, then those who suggested spontaneous generation simply erred on the *time* it takes for inanimate matter to become fleas.) Or maybe one thinks, like Martin Hanczyc, that there is no simple line between non-life and life, that there is a gradient between them (viruses have been called organisms on the edge of life). But accepting abiogenesis without ever observing it in the wild is like accepting the existence of Bigfoot without ever observing it in the wild (and Bigfoot would even fit into an evolutionary paradigm -- since new species and new lifeforms are \"discovered\" every year. And the idea that the Loch Ness monster is actually a [plesiosaur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiosauria) also fits into an evolutionary paradigm, since they supposedly went extinct 66 million years ago. But people have found [\"living fossils\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_fossil) like the coelacanth, thought to have gone extinct 65 million years ago, but found in 1938.) Someone might say there is more physical evidence for abiogenesis than Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster, but if that's true then *how* did abiogenesis happen? Can it ever be known? People are left with the speculation that abiogenesis *must* have happened.\n\nAs for the reproducibility of the origin of the universe, people have said that particle accelerators create \"mini Big Bangs\", but particle accelerators don't create universes (unless they believe in the [many-worlds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) interpretation of quantum mechanics. And if they do, the many-worlds theory implies *all possible alternative histories and futures are real*, each their own universe. Which suggests the possibility that there *is* a universe where the Genesis creation narrative is true. Someone might say no, that's not possible, implying that even in the many-worlds theory that there *cannot* be a universe where God exists and where God created mankind.) When it comes to the origin of the universe, since it can't be observed, what you're left with is astrologers in lab coats looking to the skies and trying to interpret the tea leaves of the [cosmic microwave background](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) and saying they know *how old time is*, which raises the paradoxical question of \"Did time start?\" It suggests a state of timelessness giving rise to time. Or the notion that there was nothing before time. But to speak of time is to suggest there was an *earlier* time, all the way back until there wasn't. (If time has no beginning then people are simply ritually labeling the present with greater numbers.) It could also be argued that from the origin of the universe to the emergence of the first observer, no time passed -- simply because there was no observer to observe the passage of time. And when did a being first observe the passage of time? I suppose theists might say God is an eternal observer. Whereas I think atheists would have to conclude that the emergence of observers in a godless universe was the result of random chance, an accident, a fluke, or *determined* like clockwork from the origin of the universe. (If the universe *must* give rise to observers, what does that mean?)\n\nIs anything eternal? I would propose that theists believe there is at least one thing that has always existed -- in their case, God. But for atheists like Bill Nye, do they think there is anything that has always existed? Energy perhaps? Constants? The quantum vacuum? I've read \"All quantum mechanical systems undergo fluctuations even in their ground state and have an associated zero-point energy, a consequence of their wave-like nature.\" In quantum field theory, the [vacuum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_state) is the quantum state with the lowest possible energy. The vacuum is supposedly not an empty void, but like the ground state of a [quantum harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator). In the vacuum, [virtual particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle) (or vacuum fluctuations of vacuum energy) temporarily pop in and out of existence. The quantum vacuum [zero-point energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy) is supposedly infinite. (It seems that atheists can accept quantum particles popping into existence, whereas they scoff at the idea that a divine being could pop into existence, or even the idea that they are one and the same.)\n\nStephen Hawking suggested that because gravity exists, a universe can create itself from nothing. (So did gravity exist before the universe?) Are the laws of physics eternal and did they lead to the emergence of the universe, or did the emergence of the universe lead to the laws of physics? Some people have suggested that time is an illusion. Other people have written about timeless physics. Or [multiple time dimensions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_time_dimensions). Or physics where a particle moves backwards in time. There are many variables in physics that do not change upon [time reversal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry). Others like Lee Smolin have suggested that time is real, and that laws of physics are emergent (or that the laws of physics evolve, like how life evolves).\n\nIf cause and effect exists, every cause has a cause, so there is either an infinite series of causes (which I think would be indistinguishable from eternity), or a first cause, a causeless cause, a cause that needs no cause. I suppose a theist might suggest time began, and that an eternal being created it. I suppose an atheist would also think time began, but then how did time begin? Can the beginning of time be explained without referencing a state before (and therefore an earlier time)? Is motion synonymous with time? Zeno of Elea [proposed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes) that motion is an illusion. And Zeno's race course paradox could also be applied to the beginning of time. From the present, we can measure halfway to the origin of the universe, and half of that, and half of that, and half of that, and so on, but then we never reach the beginning of the universe. I suppose one could invoke the notion of a \"smallest unit of time\", [Planck time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time), based on Planck length, based on the speed of light. But the [photon epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_epoch) didn't begin until supposedly 10 seconds after the Big Bang. And the the cosmic microwave background was supposedly produced 400,000 years after the Big Bang. Someone could argue that the time to the beginning of the universe is finite, and yet each tick of a clock supposedly moves the origin of the universe further away.\n\nSome physicists have proposed the [Big Bounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bounce) model of the formation of the universe. But that's basically Hindu creationism, the cyclic model of the universe in Hindu scriptures, with the creation and destruction of the universe repeating forever -- with the details filled in.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391716041", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Sometimes, he would bring his notebooks for coaching along for the drives. \n\nOne particular day, one of the, um, less skilled students was behind the wheel. We started off fine, but things went south when we got to a road near the school that always had a lot of traffic. The kid had bad control of the pedals, accelerating too fast/not enough and braking too hard. This particular day, when leaving the stop sign, he pressed the gas too hard, lost control of the direction of the car, shot across two lanes of traffic and into the divider in the middle of the road. The instructor had been looking down at his folder, didn't realize what was going on, therefore failed to react in time to slam on the brakes. We were very lucky to not be hit or suffer any injuries from the impact, but the front wheel well was damaged, so the wheel wouldn't turn.\n\nThe cops came, the instructor gave them all the required information and a tow truck was called. The car gets hooked up to the tow truck, so the instructor asked him how much a tow would cost. The driver said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" It was about that time I noticed that the \"tow truck driver\" was a 30 feet long Plesiosaur!

{"body": "Okay, I'll try.\nWhen I was younger, I was in Scouts. We were on the last day of a hiking trip in the woods and performing a flag ceremony on a hill overlooking a valley early in the morning. I can remember quite vividly the setting, the sun rising and little patches of mist lingering around the bushes. I should mention that I lived in the Pacific Northwest at that time.\n\nThat was when I saw whatever it is that I saw. As mentioned before, I saw it walking through a space in the trees down in the valley. The distance was probably no more than 150 meters away - not too far that I couldn't make out some details. It was clearly taller than an average man, at least 7 feet, with very long arms that swung in a way similar to how you can see in many of those Sasquatch films. It seemed to have a very thick body, a large head and was covered in what appeared to be quite thick, dark-colored fur (not black, more like a dark brown). I could not see it's feet because of the grass.\n\nI saw it walking for a period of about ten seconds. During that time it took about four or five strides and then kinda paused as it looked up the hill. I didn't see the face clearly, but I could tell that it's head turned towards where our group was standing. After just a very brief moment it took two very quick strides and hurried into the trees. \n\nI was, understandably, freaking out. However, our group was standing at attention, and there was nothing that I could say at that moment. I decided that there was no point in telling anyone afterwards, because there was no way they would believe me. However, while we were taking down the campsite before heading back home, I overheard one of the other members of our Scout troop describing to one of his friends exactly the same thing that I saw. I approached him like \"you saw that too?!\" and we discussed it in detail, confirming to myself what I had seen.\n\nI've gone over this incident countless times in my mind trying to disprove it, but I just can't. Multiple points have been brought up to me over the years, for example: what if it was someone playing a joke on us? Well, it couldn't have been somebody from our group, because we all had to be (and were) present at the flag ceremony. I find it very unlikely that it was someone from outside of our group that was fooling us either, because we were 20km from the nearest road. They would have had to hiked all that distance with some huge, elaborate costume, just to frighten a few kids and then never admit to it or say something like \"Gotcha!\". It just doesn't make sense. And no, it was obviously not a bear either. I've seen bears in the wild many times, and they just don't move that way, or have bodies and faces that shape.\n\nI guess that's the whole story. I don't know if I believe in aliens, or the Loch Ness Monster (or Ogopogo like we have in BC), but I know that at least one Sasquatch exists (or existed) somewhere.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391728894", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 34, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "This one time after a night of drinking, some buddies and I decided to get some food. There was this little hole in the wall Greek restaurant by the bar so we decided to go there. The second I stepped inside I wasn't to keen on staying but everyone else wanted to eat here.\n\nThis place was so grungy and pretty empty. The floor was covered in dirt and crumbs and there were some gnarly dust bunnies chilling in the corners. The table we sat at was sticky and the chairs were uncomfortable. The water definitely had a yellow/brown tint to it. So this big guy sweaty guy lumbers over to take our order. He was very terse and gruff, you could tell he didn't want us there. We just order some munchies and he walks away. You could see the kitchen area from where we were sitting and the buy guy is cooking our food. And I swear I could see him sweating onto some of the food.\n\nThe food comes out. I had just gotten some pita bread and hummus. I figured he couldn't have sweat into that so I take a couple of bites and oh god. The hummus just tasted wrong. Like a sour ball sack. One my buddies finds a nasty strand of hair in his gyro and that was it for me. I loudly called the guy over and started telling him that this food was not acceptable let alone edible and I ask to see the manager. The guy grumbles that the manager is in the back and doesn't want to talk to customers. Fine, whatever. I tell this guy we refuse to pay and that we're going to leave now. That was such a bad move. He grabbed my by the arm and pulled me out of the chair. He was yelling about how we couldn't steal from the restaurant and this is bullshit. So he pretty much drags me in to the back area. It was dark and there were some more burly guys sitting in the stock area playing poker or whatever. One guy stands up, I assume he's the manager.\n\nI'm absolutely terrified at this point, I don't think I'm going to make it out of here in one piece. The waiter dude starts screaming about how we were cheap hoodlum bastards who were refusing to pay after ordering a ton of food and making up shit. I could hardly speak at this point but I was able to talk about how this guy had been rude, the place is disgusting, and the food was just god awful. The man standing up is quiet for a moment and starts talking to me in this heavy accent that I could hardly understand. \"Look, I'm trying to run a business here, understand? We make food for people to eat. If they eat the food, they pay.\" By this point, I really just want to leave so I ask how much does he want. I figure I'll pay and leave with my life intact. He asks what we ordered and starts adding on his fingers. I'm fairly sure my friends have left by this point and I hope I have enough cash on me just leave.

How can I ever repay you!\". He then turns to me and says, \"You want to know how to repay me?\". \"Yes!\", I say. He says, \"Well, my boy...\", and then a long pause.

{"body": "I'm disgusted than this is such a common Ntrait. It hurts me that I'm not alone in this type of situation. \n\nSorry in advance for the super long post, everyone, but this is something I identify with greatly.\n\nPets, to my nmom, were things to own, not living and breathing creatures. She loved saying she had a cat, dog, etc. Especially if they were of a specific breed or pretty color. And to anyone that didn't know her, you'd think that she was genuinely distraught when one of them died. Hell, I thought she really cared about them, for the longest time. I was very, very mistaken.\n\n\n[Trigger Warning: Animal neglect and death].\nMy mother never took our pets to the vet. Even for rabies vacs, which would her her ass in major trouble if someone found out. She uses the excuses that vets are too expensive and that all they want is to take your money. As a result, I had a LOT of pets die preventable deaths, pretty much my whole life. We had three, THREE dogs die from heartworms, which was preventable.\n\n\nMy first pet, a bird named Paulie, died of some unknown ailment. I found him having a seizure on the floor of his cage. My mother simply told me he was dying and that I had to deal with it.\nNext preventable pets death was Cocoa. She started vomiting, urinating blood, and having seizures one night, and she refused to take the dog to the vet. I was holding her while she died. I will never forget that, or how it felt.\nNext on the list was my loving, special kitty, Nessie. She had soft, luxurious black fur, and loved everyone. She started urinating blood one night, and just didn't stop. She died three days later, scared and in pain.\nJasper: died of a stroke three hours after the stroke started.\nMouse the rabbit: Died of heatstroke. Over a days period.\nPolar: had multiple tumors, most likely died eaten up with cancer.\nThere were also dozens of baby puppies, tiny kittens, ducks, rabbits, and chickens that died of neglect or minor ailments that could've been taken care of at the vets.\n\n\nThey also NEVER spay or neuter any of the animals. They currently have 13 cats, three dogs, and two birds, INSIDE THEIR HOUSE, plus about 9 cats outside. It's insane. I have TRIED to get my mother to take them to a low cost clinic to get them fixed: she says she doesn't want to make the drive. I tell her to give some away: she says that she'd be too worried about them going to a bad home.\n\n\nI finally put my foot down about the wrongful deaths with my horse, Steele. I've had him for 6 years, since he was 5 months old, and we've been through a series of minor ailments since then. Three years ago, he had a horse kick him in the face and leave a knot on the side of his nose. It wasn't an issue until it hurt too much for him to let me put his halter on. I went inside and told her that I was making an appointment for him at the vets tomorrow. My dad agreed and said we had the money right now and that if I felt it was needed then it should be done. My mother said no. I told her that I would go out and strip or prostitute myself until I had the money to take him. I fucking called her bluff. She was stunned. And she relented, but has NEVER let me forget that she took him to the vet ONCE IN SIX YEARS.\n\n\nI will never, ever forgive her, or my enabling father, for letting my pets, my babies, die such horrible deaths.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391769385", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Roman geographers mention several tribes that lived in what is now called the Basque country, among which “Vascones”, whose ethnonyme is the direct ancestor of the modern “Basques”, but these are hardly more than passing references. It is also possible that the “Aquitains” that appear in Cæsar's *Commentarii…* also were basquophones. In this case, they would have occupied a much larger area than they do at the moment. The medieval evidence confirms that to a certain extent: Gascony (Vasconia), a sizeable part of southwestern France, is administered during the greater part of the Early Middle Ages by rulers with recognisably Basque names (Sancho, Aznar). Similarly, even if my knowledge of Spanish history is not good enough to elaborate on this, it seems to me that the founders of the kingdom of Navarre also were Vascons. Linguistic studies have also underlined the existence of several Basque toponyms in regions that are nowadays outside of the Basque country. If we put aside the bits of political history we have, the only serious thing we can say about the Basque is that (1) they were there before Romans, Celts and the arrival of Indo-European languages (regardless of your what your opinion is on the process of diffusion of this language) and that (2) Basque used to be spoken over a larger area (probably at least a good part of southwestern France).\n\nAs for the ultimate origins of the Basque people, no one really knows. Many people have invented fanciful links with almost every ethnic group in the world, mostly on the basis of linguistic evidence (Caucasians, Berbers, Tibetans…). In my opinion, there are only two convincing theories, which are actually not exclusive. The first one is that Basques (and the Basque language) directly came from the Paleolithic era. Southwestern France is a very active place at that time (actually, the periodisation of the Upper Paleolithic is almost exclusively derived from sites of this area: Magdalenian, Aurignacian, Châtelperronian…), because it was a convenient refuge during the glaciation. It is imaginable that after the end of the last glacial period, these surviving people would have expanded again in the area. The other theory is that Iberians (inhabitants of the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula, who were there before the first Celtic — and therefore IE — forays) and Basques are related, or that they speak the same language. This is not impossible, but our knowledge of Iberian language is, to say the least, quite patchy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391802837", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's true. When I was six years old, my family went on vacation to Orlando. We didn't have a lot of money, and my parents were raising 4 kids on a single income, so a 'fancy' vacation was a huge occasion. I remember the night before we left I could hardly sleep. My brothers and I stayed up all night talking about where we were gonna go first and how much fun we were gonna have. We were also excited to see our dad again, as he'd been working a lot to get in overtime to make sure the finances were in order. Unfortunatly as a cost cutting measure, we got a cheaper hotel. The 'unfortunate' part comes in a bit. We rented a minivan to drive down there, and about 30 miles out we got a flat tire. Dad changed it and we made it to our hotel, but it was a sunday evening and all the repair shops were closed. So we'd have to wait till tomorrow to get it fixed. He drove it out to the car shop when he finally got an appointment, around 5pm. While my mother took us (I was 6 at the time, the youngest, my brothers were 7, 9, and 11) out to walk around some nearby shops and wait for the van to be fixed. I, having way too much energy decide to run around like a maniac. Not too crazy, but I just wanted to explore. We were all walking into the next shop to get something to drink when I wandered around the corner of the store. I had only seen 'alleys' on TV (like Batman or Ninja Turtles), so I wanted to see a 'real' alley. I was in the alley for about 30 seconds before I hear my mom calling my name. She had left my brothers in the store to look for me. She saw me in the alley and I got the \"you're dead\" eyes from her. I knew I wasn't supposed to go off on my own, but I was just curious. She marched down the alley, took my hand, and started marching back. Thats when a group of two guys, very large (or at least to me at the time) came and started acting aggressive towards us. My mom quickly put me behind her and tried to be reasonable. I didn't see it happen, but after a few exchanges of words, one of them hit her so hard she fell to the ground. I stood there, speechless. I didn't know what to do, I wanted to do something, I knew I should do something, but I was just frozen. Was this real? What happens next? My mom got to her knees and pleaded \"What do you want!?\" Then it happened, something I'll never forget. One of the guys went to pull out a knife, but he couldn't, because he was 500 feet tall and from the cretaceous period. He said in his garbled reptilian voice, \"Imma need about tree fiddy\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391829223", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

It was a Celeron laptop, but I knew that it had a socket G2 CPU and a mobo that supported an easy i7 upgrade. We met at McDonalds, I opened the back panel of it to verify its internals. Cockroaches poured out of it as soon as I did, literally tens of them, at least 20-30 I'd say of all sizes. In the middle of a McDonalds. The black lady that was selling it didn't even blink, I swear, she was giving the Iron Lady a run for her name with that sort of behaviour. So I took a look at her and said 'I'll give ya tree fiddy'. But no, really, I said $30. She took it without a word as I pulled out the cash, hah. I went home and dug out many tens more of cockroaches.

Seriously, I don't think I've ever gotten a laptop from a guy under the age of 35 that didn't have porn or porn links. Surprising amount of gay porn too, from black guys that looked straight as they come, but secretly gay, because from what I hear, the black community still isn't as tolerant of gays (especially when they're in their own family) as the white community in the States. When it's a girl, there is a lot less porn, in fact, I've never noticed any porn, only occasional nude selfies for the bf. I don't look at those either, I do try to respect the privacy of my clients. What surprises me however is how 'out in the open' those things are, surely they know I will have to see that stuff when I recover their data, no?\n*** \nOne time I got a MacBook from a seemingly legit source, only to find that it was password-locked (not just the regular lock, but the supposedly unbreakable remote lock that you active when it is stolen).

Which I did, only to find it belonged to one of the more prominent doctors in the city. Well shit, I thought, but unfortunately in these situations there is no good way to give back the laptop, only thing you can do is try to buy from reputable sources to minimise this happening.

{"body": "Back in college, my friends and I had a house where you can go up to the roof. We brought some folding chairs and tables up there, and would hang out up there on nice nights. It became our go-to drinking spot.\n\nWell, there was one night we were up there, and after many shots of Admiral Nelson, my friend decided to go get his laser pointer and shine it onto the houses around. We were having fun pointing it through people's windows, until we saw a car drive by, and had an even better idea.\n\nYup. We were going to shine it at cars driving by.\n\nThe first few didn't go so well, as we were pretty drunk and couldn't keep the spot at one point for very long, let alone follow a moving vehicle.\n\nThat was until we saw a big pickup truck come around the corner, and he was cruising. Easily speeding. I picked up the laser pointer, took aim and hit the button.\n\nBullseye.\n\nI could see where the spot hit the windshield, and then the truck took a sharp swerve to the right. It shattered someone's front fence, before coming to rest halfway into a car in the driveway.\n\nFuck.\n\nThe driver managed to get out, and looked in our direction immediately. We had a bunch of lights on, and were being pretty loud. We turn off all the lights, hightail it downstairs, and hope to god he doesn't have a gun.\n\nWe heard him walk up the porch stairs, and he started pounding on the door. Then he slurred out \"Hey you fuckers, look what you made me do!\"\n\nHe was drunk! We might get out of this yet. All we have to do is dispose of the laser pointer, and no one will be the wiser. We went up to the door, and told him to remove his jacket and empty his pockets, so we knew he wouldn't grab anything dangerous, and that we wanted to talk to him.\n\nMy friend opened the door, and he was a mess. Bleeding from the head, bloodshot eyes, and swaying back and forth. I considered for a second calling an ambulance for the poor guy. He then said \"Boys, I need something from you.\" I was confused. \"What do you need?\" my friend asked. \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that the man was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam away into the distance.\n\nWhen we woke up in the morning, the truck was gone and the fence was fixed.

Even though I'm feeling as confident as one can be about my atheism, the religious mind still baffles and fascinates me.  I'd like to dig a little deeper than \"They're dumb, don't try to reason with them\"\n\nI've got a pet hypothesis of late that those who are firmly religious also tend to have difficulty reasoning by analogy.  For instance, it seems reasonable to assume that the Loch Ness Monster doesn't exist due to the absence of evidence, but can't extend that logic to god.  Or say in Ken Ham's definitions, historical science is bunk, but I'd suspect he'd have no problem with modern day forensic science to solve crimes (the point being they're exactly the same thing).\n\n*If* this is true, I have some questions.  Does this difficulty to reason by analogy only arise due a \"special pass\" to abandon deductive reason when it comes to god, or does it apply to other fields?  Would believe and non-deductive reasoning simply be correlated, or do you think the relation causal?\n\nIf it's not true in your own experience, how is the religious mind able to segregate a naturalistic worldview away from a theological one?\n\ntl;dr: How do reasonable people stay religious, even after they think about their religion?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391965753", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Having it prescribed by a knowledgeable doctor is cheaper than going to an anti-aging clinic, but the result is the same.\nThe amount of test and shots vary.

My dad hadn't seen his side of the family in about 5yrs since we moved across country for his job.\n\nThe reunion was great.  I got to see a lot of people I didn't really remember, but they sure seemed excited to see me. My dads brother who was kind of nuts gave me a wadded handful of some one's and change.  He thought he was being a cool uncle, and I thought I was rich, so it was a win/win. I even told my parents I could help pay for the trip, and of course they politely declined and told me I could spend my fortune on other things.\n\nThere was barbeque and soda and icecream and whatnot - the only things a 9yr old cares about. I remember seeing a pretty girl there my age, and I went and told my dad about it ,and I didn't understand at the time why he shushed me and told me to forget about it.\n\nWe said our goodbyes and packed up and left.  It was about a 800 mile trip so with 5 kids, there was no way we were gonna do it in one shot, so my parents had reserved a motel room along the way. It was about 11pm when we started getting off the exit, but it was raining and while we were going around the bend... we just kept going.\n\nI was told what happened was the car hydroplaned off the turn of the exit, flipped around 5 or 6 times and landed upside down in the shallow, muddy part of a river. The car was absolutely totaled. My sister and I were thrown out of the car. I only have mental snapshots after that, things I don't really like to think about... but most of it is a blur. One of the things I do remember is crawling to the car, seeing my mom hanging upside down only to realize that shes 250 feet tall and from the Cretaceous period. She rolled her 3rd set of eyelids back and hissed at me, \"Now we're gonna need that tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391990947", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": -6, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "In my 2nd year of University, I was accused of utilizing something like this. My professor sent me an e-mail asking me to see him during office hours, so I showed up. He had my paper on his desk and I was confused as I had just past it in and didn't expect it graded yet. He basically said to me that he knows I cheated and had someone else write the paper, but that if I admitted to it, he will grade the paper and give me the mark he felt the paper was worth, but if I didn't admit to it, he will fail me.\n\nI refused to admit anything as I put in a lot of effort into my paper; it was a term paper and after a previous course with him where I know he is hard to get an A from, I put in a lot of effort. What kind of effort?\n\nI went to my University's writing centre on an almost weekly basis for help to improve my writing. See, I had no problem doing the work and I could have great ideas but I just lacked the discipline to properly apply those ideas to paper.\n\nAfter refusing to admit it, he graded the paper right in front of me. I was trying to interrupt him to explain how I improved my writing from a previous course but he was dead set on me being a liar. He told me to keep quiet until he is done grading it or he will take the situation to the dean.\n\nHe finished the rubric and gave me equivalent of like 35% or something.  I needed that paper to pass the course as it was considered the final and the course required a pass on the final to pass the course. He told me to take my paper and leave or he will report the incident to the dean and I could probably be expelled for cheating/plagiarising, or whatever else he thought I did.\n\nCool head prevailed and I left his office after probably speaking 50 words in total over the last 10 minutes. I went straight to the writing centre, asked to speak to one of the people that had spent a lot of time with me on this paper, and explained the situation. He took my paper, went into his office and called the dean and explained the situation. He came out of his office and said to go have a seat and he will be back in a little while.\n\nHe took my paper and went directly to the dean, and the dean re-graded it then and there. I was then summoned to go to the deans office and as I walked up, I saw my professor come around the corner as well. I didn't know what was going on yet but found out once I got into the office. \n\nThe dean explained what the writing centre told him, and handed my paper to my professor and asked him to explain himself. The professor claimed he knew I cheated and that it wasn't possible I did the work.\n\nThe dean basically just said that he doesn't care what he thinks is or isn't possible, but I did the work. He asked me what I felt the paper was worth and that I could decide the final mark for the inconvenience. \n\nI wasn't too sure what I felt it deserved but I said, ah.. well, to pass I would need about tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392006367", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Some background: I worked in retail back in oh 2002 or so. It was a boring job honestly it was soul sucking. It was a store that had basically everything, kind of a general store but a chain and huge. \n\nAnyways it's about 2 in the afternoon and I'm working the floor, stocking shelves and helping people with what they need when I get a call over the intercom system: \"Would /u/TonedAndBoned please report to the cleaning supplies aisle to take care of a spill\" \n\n*sigh* Better grab the stupid mop and stupid bucket to clean up this stupid mess. When I arrive what do I see? It's a middle-aged man, he looked like a taller version if Danny DeVito - stained polo shirt, khakis and all. He was sort of watching over me as I began to mop up the spilled cleaning substance I could feel him watching over my shoulder.\n\"Can I help you sir\" I was being as nice as I could.\n\"Ya you can do your job and clean this up.\" \n\nI quietly and passive-aggressively kept on cleaning and put up the 'Wet Floor' sign to avoid fraudulent claims and what not. But before I even am able to walk all the way out if the aisle I hear a loud crash behind me and I see the man clutching his shoulder, no sign in sight. I just went off on the guy yelling at him and suddenly it came over me. I had to do it, too many annoying and irrational customers making my life harder. I could lose my job if this fraudulent claim went through. I ran over and punched him in the face, and I asked him his ultimate goal in all of this, how much money did he want? \n\nHe slowly got up, blood dripping off of his lip. \n\"All I wanted... Was tree fiddy.\"\nHe hit me with a round house kick to the face and suddenly there were thousands of ninjas, attacking us both. We fought each other while fighting of ninjas, then Bruce Willis jumped in and started eating corn flakes with Smaug and we all became best friends.\n\nNow I live in Somalia with my 17 model-wives with Bruce Willis and a Danny DeVito looking head on my mantel. \n\nEdit: Ok I know I'm getting downvoted because it's so unbelievable so I'll come clean...

{"body": "A sighting with 'legitimate' evidence or where the authorities who received the report decided the witness was not lying, be it arbitrarily decided or otherwise. Or in other words, whatever they want it to be.\n\nPersonally aquatic cryptids always leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. The problem is that they are significantly harder to investigate on any level than non-aquatic creatures because you never know how many crevices there may be under the water and it's hard enough to get equipment to take a quick look just below the surface without that issue. Nessie was one of the beasts that got me interested in cryptozoology but the more I learn the less confident I am that any conclusions can be made about it. People like to assume that there is only one creature and that thanks to nothing short of the grace of god alone it has just been there for thousands of years, but that just doesn't hold up to any degree of scrutiny. \n\nFor Nessie and creatures like it to exist we need a breeding population to exist and we need an ecosystem that can support it. Now thats all well and good, and in many cases we even have large water ecosystems that could do that, but in order to have an ecosystem large enough to support these creatures we need a huge underwater space for them, and often enough that means our search area is larger than we can reasonably study. Not to mention many lakes, and especially loch ness have underwater passages and tunnels that connect to other bodies of water including oceans, which only further complicates the problem. Consider that we know more about space than the deeper regions of our own oceans and it's plain to see that proving or disproving nessie becomes an incredibly monumental task most easily solved by simply having her walk up to your door step and ring the bell, and after a few thousand years of hanging around if she hasn't done that yet it probably isn't going to happen.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392051140", "subreddit": "wanttobelieve", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Well you see one does not just receive Legos without tearing open the packages and start building right away. So naturally there were some Legos on the floor. I  start to walk into the living room where we opened our presents, I had forgotten to bring my new keyboard up to my room with my computer. I'm walking down the stairs to the living room  and I wonder if my brothers had cleaned up all the Legos. \"Do I really need to turn on the light?\" I asked myself, \"I know exactly where the keyboard is I'll be fine\". So I'm in the living room and I walk over to where the keyboard is. I feel like I'm being watched so I turn around and see the Loch Ness monster looming over me. \"God Damnit what do you want?!\" I screamed. \"Treefiddy\". Nessie replies. \"I ain't given you no treefiddy Loch Ness monster!\" I proceeded to take my keyboard and step on some Legos on my way back up. Those Legos hurt but not as much as the disappoint in that monsters face when I denied it my money.

{"body": "I am being totally honest here, I don't care about upvotes, no goddamn Loch Ness monster, no copypasta, I just want to tell my story.  A physician with experience in this area may be able to verify.  I was born in Bangladesh, a country in southeast Asia.  I was born in a Bangladeshi hospital, but was not circumcised at birth (as is the custom in the U.S.).  At the age of 3, my mother and I came to live in America for a period of 5 years on temporary visa seeking medical care for my asthma.  When I was 7 and a half years old, I returned to Bangladesh for a brief interval, and during that time, at one point my parents took me to a hospital near Bashabo (a township near Dhaka) without telling me what was going to happen.  I was going to be circumsized that day.  \n\nMy 7-year-old self did not know and could not comprehend what circumcision even was.  I was taken to the operating table, stripped down, and they began the procedure, which ultimately may have lasted 20 - 30 minutes, but to me felt like an eternity.  They may or may not have used anesthetic, I do not remember.  Since I could not comprehend what that it was all about, I began to struggle shortly into it.  It took a combination of several doctors and nurses to hold me down until the procedure was completed, and I was screaming, panicking, and crying out for my parents to help me the whole time, in addition to begging (in vain) to the doctors to stop what they were doing.  My parents could hear me from the waiting room, the entire hospital could practically hear me during the ordeal.\n\n***GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS BE WARNED***\n********************************\nAfter returning home from the \"forced\" circumcision—and here is where a medical doctor could verify if I was telling the truth—my first post-surgery urination resulted in six distinct \"streams\" of urine being expelled from my urethra into the toilet receptacle, which was highly irregular.  This phenomenon later\\shortly fixed itself, but that image has been burned into my mind since childhood.\n\nIn addition, a few days after the procedure, what can only be described as a \"solid bulbous growth\" began to form on the left side of the head, similar to a plantar wart.  I have heard that this type of thing can occur as a side effect of backwater\\informal circumcisions carried out by untrained third world doctors in the Muslim world.  My parents eventually had me \"scrape off\" the growth with hot water and a towel after the final bandages were taken off.\n********************************\n\nNow in my adulthood, everything seems to be working \"down there\", but I would not wish circumcision to be forced upon anyone who is conscious\\cognizant enough to feel it, not even my worst enemy, and least of all to a young child who doesn't even know what that is.  At least in America there is the small mercy that the infants who undergo circumcision are not yet developed enough to feel\\remember the pain.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392093312", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay I've been waiting for this.. So I used to live on the east coast but recently moved to out to Utah and I moved in to this pretty cool house with my cousins. We're all around the same age and like two months ago it was one of their birthdays. So me and my other cousin josh wanted to throw him a big ass party with all the fixings. We didn't want to throw some little shindig with some beer. So we went big.\nI took alllll my money I had saved up and bought 3 cases of beer and an assortment of other drugs. Like everything that grows and made under the rainbow. All that. Zero fucks were given. Josh and I started early. Getting all sorts of fucked up before any of the 60 some people we invited started to show. \nSo around this time people started to come around in the droves. It seemed the house was blowing up an expanding every time someone came in. You know how it goes right? Someone tells someone who tells someone and next thing you know 60 turns into a hundred an then 150. Shit was crazy. Out of control. But worst of all we were running out of alcohol before the birthday boy even showed up. So I did the manliest thing I've ever done. I went for more booze. But this wasn't your normal trip...\nI'm like halfway to beer store to fill up two kegs and get a third when I get a call and it's josh, claiming were out of bud. Geeeez I was upset. I had to then stop at the sketchiest dudes house to get more after the booze run. That wasn't even the craziest part though. After I leave sketch balls house and am making my way back I'm on highway like 20 minutes away from the exit (because he lived so fucking far out), I was in no condition to drive. I'm still mad at myself, I get pulled over. \nNow this is where it gets interesting, the trooper comes to my window and I have everything ready to give him. He asks and goes back to his car and runs my shit. I come back clean and I see him coming back up to the car and he hands it all back and asked the most awful question, \"how much have you had to drink?\" My heart sank. The jig was up... Or was it? Yeah, it was.  He pulled me out and I failed my sobriety test miserably and he sits me in his car and comes back and claims he smells marijuana.. Then he says he going to search my ride.. I panicked. I see him go to the trunk where I know for a fact he's going to find the copious amount of pot I just purchased from sketchy dave. \nHe pops the trunk and moves some shit around and then closes it. He's slowly walking back to the car and hops in and turns around with a sinister look in his face. I kind of just drop my head because all I wanted to do was throw a big ass party for my cousin and have a fun night. Now I'm going to jail. Then I hear the comment that made it all worth it.. He asked me for tree fiddy, it was around this time I realized the trooper was a three hundred foot creature of the deep with a semi scottish accent most commonly known as the loche ness monster. I flipped my fucking lid. I kicked out the back window and ran for it. I doubled back to my car and hopped in and proceeded to drive 20 miles in the most intense car chase in the history of that shit. Got back to the parrty and tried to explain to everyone why it took me so long but know one understood. \n\nTL;DR ran from the cops in the most epic fashion.

{"body": "As a freshman riding the bus I dealt with this douche bag junior for about 3 months. He always sat behind me and always fucked with me and because he was the oldest kid on the bus everyone thought it was funny.\n\nOne day he started into his shit and when he said something that amounted to 'you won't do anything pussy' and I turned around and punched him right in the mouth. He teared up a little but didn't really cry and he shut the fuck up for the rest of the day. \n\nThe next couple of weeks he didn't ride the bus and I was feeling on top of the world now that this reign of terror was over. When I saw him around school he didn't make eye contact and avoided me. I felt alpha as fuck. Soon all the girls wanted to ride my ding-a-ling-dong and so I allowed that to happen. \n\nAfter becoming one of the more popular kids in school I joined the track team. I could run as fast as anyone and as a freshman I was making upperclassmen look like fat kids with a couch addiction.  This was due to my intense training schedule of running everywhere while doing pilates and deadlifting tires.\n\n One day I was running home when I saw the douche bag junior broken down on the side of the road. I walked up to him as I no longer saw him as a threat and asked him 'what the fuck is wrong with your car?' He told me his woes of how I embarrassed him that day I punched him in the mouth and, though he was saving up for a reliable mode of transportation, went ahead and purchased a piece of junk so that he could never have to deal with the embarrassment of being beta again. \n\nI kind of felt bad for him seeing how my life was going so great and I asked him if he needed a ride anywhere. I told him I'd run to the gas station and call someone for him but he had this grin in his eye balls that made me feel uneasy. The kind of eyeball grin where I could tell he felt entirely in control of the situation. After a few seconds of staring into the deep dark abyss that was his unbreakable stare he slowly raised his hand and said. \"Don't worry about it djpuffnstuff, I can buy my own gallon of gas.

This guy killed dozens of Japanese from the ground as well as aerial. The most vivid story he ever told me was about how he almost sparred one of the Japanese soldiers he had trapped. He said the dude begged for his life. The Japanese soldier said he would give the man anything he wanted. The old man whispered his request in the Japanese Soldier's ear. A look of disgust grew on the Soldiers face. The soldier was silent for what seemed like hours, and then he screamed  \"I wonot give you no TweeFiddy!\". At that moment in time I started to realize that the old war vet was indeed an 8 story tall, Crustacean, from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "Before anything else, get the quests. There's one quest for each boss, which is the real source of rewards. All of them are given by Lady Nessie in Hailol, and they refresh weekly at 4:00am PST.\n\nJoin the channel CrossEvents@Faeblight. People spam for raids (weeklies/DD weeklies/Dendrome raid bosses/etc). On NA shards, at least, they respawn on Wednesday mornings. I recommend getting online around 3:50am PST. Hundreds of people will typically be involved at once, so these bosses die fast.\n\nOnce you're in a raid, find out where the boss is up. You may have to ask repeatedly. Someone should tell you who to anchor from. (In case you don't know the term, \"anchor\" means using another player to switch shards. Right-click their name in the party and select \"Join Instance\" to move to their current shard.)\n\nImportant general information: **use your quest item.** You get a Mysterious Talisman with each quest that gives you a 15-min buff for +200 hit. The buff fades if you change shards for some reason, but you can just reapply it. This needs to be up. These bosses all require 500 hit, so unless you are already raid-geared, you need the buff.\n\nThere are three bosses:\n\n* Senbora (Greenscale's Crater): Big guy at the bottom level of the crater. You have to kill the eggs down there to make him spawn. Do not stand on the rocks that border his arena - there is a small chance that if he charges onto them, he will reset and/or despawn.\n* Akhane (Venific Locus): In a room at the top of a spiral staircase. Very straightforward.\n* Kaaz'ra (Hive Kaaz'Gfu): On the big platform in the middle of the hive. Run down past the glowing Chronicle portal and jump off the cliff; you'll die, but your body will be on the big platform. There are crystals and heralds that need to be destroyed to spawn him, but usually other people will take care of that on the way in. **DPS him very slowly**, and try to get others to do the same. There is a bug that permanently despawns the boss if he's taking too much damage. That bug is *not* fixed, whatever the misinformed/trolls say - it happened this morning on Deepwood.\n\nOn NA servers, the standard order is Senbora &gt; Akhane &gt; Kaaz'ra. Go to Achyati Village first and get into the crater.\n\nAgain, if you do these on Wednesday mornings, there will be hundreds of other players involved on any given shard. Your framerate will fall in the toilet, and there will be a lot of idiots and asshats, but the bosses will die in minutes.

Well, when we got there we didn't realize that the treehouses were actually all close together, meaning that the people from the other treehouses could basically see you inside your treehouse. We put up some blankets, cracked open some beer (we also had rum, vodka, whiskey etc.) and got to drinking. I don't normally drink a shit ton but that night, considering it would be impossible to actually drive around and our cars were parked about a mile away, I decided I would get really hammered. Well, the last thing I remember is singing, rather poorly, the lyrics to \"Build Me Up Buttercup\" with my friends and then there's a knock on the door. Three total hippy chicks are at the door, one is pretty attractive, the other two are just... unattractive, so naturally in our drunken stupor we're all hitting on the attractive girl. The literal *last* thing I remember is my friend making some really stupid joke and then I blacked out. I wake up, I'm not in the same treehouse anymore and I look to my right and see the two ugly hippy chicks. I'm naked, they're naked, they're covered in vomit, I'm covered in vomit. I look at my dick, my dick is covered in vomit. It smells so fucking awful in this treehouse. I try my hardest to sneak out of this treehouse, find a place to take a shower and dip out before my friends can find out what happened.

I say, \"I'm sorry I woke you up.\" One girl just smiles and says, \"it's okay -- last night was interesting.\" I say, \"yeah...\" even though I don't remember a thing.

Anyways, everything was going as usual, people coming and going like any other Saturday night. It was busy, but not so much so that I was letting anyone go by unchecked.\n\nWe tend to get a lot of kids coming by with fake IDs on busy nights like this. I tend to just laugh 'em off, take the ID, y'know, normal stuff. These kids think that they're clever with these IDs. It's actually pretty funny. Here's a tip: if you're going to a bar in Kentucky and you already look potentially underage, don't pull out an ID from Illinois. It's almost always a giveaway. The Illinois IDs are pretty easy to copy, so that's the biggest that we see.\n\nSo, back to the story. I was working on a Saturday night, and I see this really obnoxious person trying to get in. They looked extremely drunk already. They were loud, and I think they were even growling at some people. It was weird. This is the kind of person I probably wasn't going to let in anyway. When they got closer, it was apparent that they weren't old enough. Hell, they looked like they were 16. I started laughing, but before I could turn him away, he shoved his ID in my face. I looked at it, expecting a common state like Illinois or Florida. This was weird, it wasn't even a US one, but from Scotland. The weirder part was that it didn't just say he was 21, but that he was over 500 million years old. I thought it was a joke, so I cut it in half and handed it back to him, all while laughing to myself. He got really angry and told me that now he's going to have to go get a replacement ID, and I'm going to have to pay for him. I asked him how much it was going to be, and he said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was at that that I realized that it was not in fact a young teenager that I was talking to but in fact a 8 story tall crustacean from the Proterozoic era. I told him \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nSo, a lesson to all the high school students trying out their fake IDs, it won't work.

{"body": "So let me set the scene (no tree fiddy I promise)\n\nSo my daughter was around 2mths old,  me and my girlfriend hadn't been out since my daughter was born and we obviously hadn't had sex since she was born. \n\nSo my girlfriends mum says \"I'll look after the baby and give you guys a break...\". Who wouldnt jump at that offer!\n\nSo me and my girlfriend planned a date day. We'd been out for lunch,  shot some pool, few games of bowling and then we planned to go home,  and try to get it on - see how it feels for her. We'd then go pick up my daughter. \n\nSo there's lots of kissing and fondling/oral,  taking it slow and finally we're having sex.\nSo I'm on top and lasting a hell of a lot longer than I'd expected so far. My girlfriend is loving it, we're taking it slow and she's making yummy noises and squirming with enjoyment as I do my job. :-)\n\nI feel the pressure building, and when i say pressure to describe it, I reckon I could have hit the wall that was at least 8feet away easy...\n\nSo anyway I'm about to erupt, its different than normal since this was a special day and the build up (8 weeks!) yada yada...  so I tell her I'm about to finish,  she says she wants it on her stomach/titties so I pull out and hand crank for the last 5 seconds ready to explode all over her. \n\nJust as I cum I get an unbelievable pain right at the base of my skull. It was intense! A pain I'd never felt before and it Scared the shit out of me, So much so, that I clasped both of my hands to my head and collapsed backwards.\n\nNow obviously my little guy ran and hid. It was like a cartoon turtle shooting back inside its shell. The pain was extreme and I was still ejaculating all over the bedsheets/pillows wall etc. It was both heaven and hell!\n\nSo my girlfriend gets scared and asks whether she should call an ambulance. After about 5minutes  of intense pain,  which in reality was about 30 seconds, I now had a dull ache, semen all over the bed and also in my hair (where id grabbed my head in agony!)\n\nNot wanting to be a victim of an eneurisym, or some other horrible affliction that would make me drop down dead, I agreed to go to the A&amp;E. After a lot of waiting, poking/prodding, an awkward explanation about what we were doing prior to my pain and picking the now dried semen from both mine and the girlfriends hair, the doctor says it could only be [coital cephalalgia] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coital_cephalalgia).\n\nA little embarrassed and extremely late for picking up my daughter we left and made our way home. \n\nI was 100% convinced of a correct diagnosis when I had another major headache the next few times that I came.\n\nThere was major embarrassment with the docs, the gfs parents and even worse!!.. I was afraid to have sex even though we were both gagging for it!!\n\nThankfully it only lasted about 1 week after. I can laugh about it now and we still joke about my dried up guys being harder than concrete in my hair. \n\nTL;DR No sex for 2mths and then unbelievable pain when I finally get to have it....", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392353715", "subreddit": "AskRedditAfterDark", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is a lesson my grandfather taught me.\n\nHis routine was to wake up at 6:30, eat breakfast and take a shower, then go back to sleep for ~45 minutes. After he'd wake back up, he could start his day doing whatever he wanted/needed to do without having to worry about the formalities of the morning.\n\nA few things changed though after my grandmother passed away. At first he was at least acting like he was finding a way to cope. A few weeks go by and I don't hear from him, so I call.  No one answers.  I'm driving over to his house to check on him when he calls.  I was relieved to get his phone call, and he assure me everything is okay but he's not in a position to have company.  Sure, okay, maybe he's just wants to be alone.\n\nA week goes by and I don't hear from him or see him, which again is unusual, so I decide to grab some food and take it to him.  When I pull up to the house, I notice the grass hadn't been mowed which is very unlike him.  I walk into the garage and knock on the door.  No one answers.  I ring the doorbell... no one answers.\n\nNow I'm starting to panic again.  I know *something* is wrong, but I don't know *what* yet. I open the door and the first thing that hits me is the smell. Then I see that the place had been ransacked.  Trash everywhere, kitchen drawers dumped out on the floor, the oven door is open and the oven is turned on, but its not hot. The lights arent' coming on either... the electricity had been cut off.\n\nI'm start calling for him, and no one responds.  I'm walking down the hallway towards his room when I notice the carpet is soaking wet and its only getting worse.  There's a stack of bills on his nightstand, I see a few notices from the power company, the final notice for cut-off was over $300. There's a note on his bed which read as mostly gibberish, but the key points of it were how he simply didn't know how to exist without his wife.  It was signed and dated the last day I talked to him on the phone, a week ago.\n\nI hear water running in the bathroom that connects to the bedroom.  By this point the smell is really bad, and I should have called 911 earlier, but I wasn't thinking clearly at the time, I just wanted to find out what was going on.\n\nI open the bathroom door, and a small wave of water rushes out across my feet.  I start gagging right away from the source of the smell. There aren't any windows in the bathroom so I can't see right away. I pull out my lighter, flick it on, and survey what I'm sure would be my dead grandfather.  I pull back the shower curtain, but instead of my grandfather it was a 300ft tall creature from the cretaceous period who garbled \"Let me get about tree fiddy to turn my lights back on.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392380459", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 78, "controversiality": 1}

We had a picnic on the shore of the pond in oasis. It was nice.\n\nAfter we had finished eating. She she was ready, she wanted me to fuck her.

She tells him of the story of a young boy and his father building a desk together. She goes on to describe a secret compartment that appears empty, but in reality is filled with much more than the eye can see. \n\nThe boy goes in to see his father one last time. Their eyes well up with tears and the boy asks \"Hey dad, can I borrow $10?\" The father's face fills with pride. Tears streaming down his cheek, he says \"Sure son. Check the top left drawer of my computer desk.\" \n\nThey embrace, say I love you, and the boy leaves to go home. \n\nHe checks the desk, pulls the drawer open and sees nothing. Then he remembers what his mother said. \"It's filled with much more than the eye can see.\"\n\nThe boy pulls out the desk drawer and affixed to the back is a folded $10 bill with 5 words scribbled on the back. \"I need about tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392409928", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 70, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": " Proponents of the Paleo diet follow a nutritional plan based on the eating habits of our ancestors in the Paleolithic period, between 2.5 million and 10,000 years ago. Before agriculture and industry, humans presumably lived as hunter–gatherers: picking berry after berry off of bushes; digging up tumescent tubers; chasing mammals to the point of exhaustion; scavenging meat, fat and organs from animals that larger predators had killed; and eventually learning to fish with lines and hooks and hunt with spears, nets, bows and arrows. \n\nYou do nothing of this in 2014. You don't scavenge, you pay someone to murder someone else you don't have the balls to do. You fly trans-continental flights frolicking on your iPad and drinking mimosas. We aren't in the paleolithic era. We have microscopes and quantum physics. Did you get the memo?\n\nThe Paleo diet not only misunderstands how our own species, the organisms inside our bodies and the animals and plants we eat have evolved over the last 10,000 years, it also ignores much of the evidence about our ancestors' health during their—often brief—individual life spans (even if a minority of our Paleo ancestors made it into their 40s or beyond, many children likely died before age 15).\n\n Even if eating only foods available to hunter–gatherers in the Paleolithic made sense, it would be impossible. [As Christina Warinner of the University of Zurich emphasizes in her 2012 TED talk, just about every single species commonly consumed today—whether a fruit, vegetable or animal—is drastically different from its Paleolithic predecessor.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMOjVYgYaG8) In most cases, we have transformed the species we eat through artificial selection: we have bred cows, chickens and goats to provide as much meat, milk and eggs as possible and have sown seeds only from plants with the most desirable traits—with the biggest fruits, plumpest kernels, sweetest flesh and fewest natural toxins. Cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and kale are all different cultivars of a single species, Brassica oleracea; generation by generation, we reshaped this one plant's leaves, stems and flowers into wildly different arrangements, the same way we bred Welsh corgis, pugs, dachshunds, Saint Bernards and greyhounds out of a single wolf species. Corn was once a straggly grass known as teosinte and tomatoes were once much smaller berries. And the wild ancestors of bananas were rife with seeds.\n\nFurthermore, animal protein initiates cancer cell growth through IGF-1 production. We use microscopes nowadays (I don't think you had them in the paleolithic era) We know how animal protein contributes to cancer cell growth, and plant protein starves it by inhibiting IGF-1.  This is a fact. \n\nSaturated fats, cholesterol = Heart disease? Animal foods.\n\nThere is really no medical or scientific basis for eating animals and as for..\n\n&gt;First is the counterproductivity of discounting another's morals based off their diet. In order for veganism to be considered a credible lifestyle in the mainstream mentality, shouldn't a non-hostile environment be strived for? \n\n**I'll give you a fucking back rub if that's what you want,** but I'm not eating someone and clogging my arteries, causing cancer cells to grow in my body, destroying the environment, being unnecessarily cruel to animals, promoting/condoning/institutionalizing violence, **just because you don't want to rock the boat.**\n\nFuck that boat. It's morally inconsistent, scientifically uninformed, environmentally unconscious, incompassionate, unsustainable and cognitively dissonant. It reeks of death and blood and all your friends look away when they see slaughterhouse videos because, because.. paleo? \n\nGive me a break.

{"body": "I go to Wal-Mart often because it is convenient and cheap, I realize the store is less ethical than others, but I'm not really in a position to be picky. Anyway, whenever I go to Wal-Mart to shop, I usually need about three to six items total. Naturally, not being a lazy git, I would use the handheld baskets because I didn't want to be a nuisance to anyone, trying to navigate the narrow aisles with a big, bulky shopping cart and getting in their way. This system was working out perfectly, I would get in and out quickly and I would generally have a pleasant experience. Many people I know claim that they get anxious whenever they \"have\" to go to Wal-Mart, this has never been a problem for me, personally, and I don't really understand it, most of the cashiers I interact with are friendly (or at least non-confrontational) and polite and the customers are generally not a problem (unless you go there during peak shopping hours) and the store is pretty easy to navigate. Apologies, I digress. Anyway, one day I went inside and looked at the area where the basket would normally be and they were all gone. \"What a bother,\" I thought, \"whatever shall I do?\" I decided to just carry my items with my hands as I was only there for orange juice and gum. The next time I went, I ran into the same problem, no baskets. I decided to check the other entrance to see if they had all just been taken from the more heavily trafficked thoroughfare, this appeared not to be the case. As the items I needed required more room than I could manage with just my arms, I succumbed and got a cart from the cart stall. This trend continued and I would invariably get a cart with a broken or jammed wheel or with a balance issue of some sort. Each trip, each broken cart, each second of incessant \"*screeeeeeeeeeeee-*\" drove me closer and closer to a deep, unshakeable madness. I could feel the sanity leaving my soul, the will to live fleeing from my body. Then one day, I walked in, tired, defeated, and I forgot to get a cart, so I walked from the cheese section all the way back to the cart stall outside of the store. When I arrived, what to my lifeless eyes should appear, but a field of brand new *carts*. Needless to say, I was elated! No more squeaky wheels, no more veering to the left, no more dragging the cart behind me because literally every one of the wheels has locked up (how does that even happen?). Finally! So I approach the cart stall and reach out my hand to grab one when a voice reaches my ears:\n\n\"I'm sorry sir, but you can't use that.\" \n\n\"WHY?!\" I screamed\n\n\"Those carts are for Wal-Mart Diamond Club members.\"\n\n\"Bullshit!\" I yelled \"I've been coming here for years! What the hell do I have to do to become a Diamond Club member?\"\n\n\"It's really quite simple sir,\" he said \"all you need to do is fill out the \"Diamond Club\" membership form online and pay the monthly fee.\"\n\n\"Seriously?\" I asked \"How much is the fee?\"\n\nHe looked me dead in the eye for a moment, looked around anxiously and whispered \"About tree fiddy.\"\n\n\nEdit- wording", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392520854", "subreddit": "funny", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, I'm late to the party, but this is pretty horrible. Let me give a little background.\n\nI'm a math teacher for a high school in the southern US. Think central NC-area. I teach Algebra II, nonhonors. It's a required course to graduate, so there's quite the diverse crowd. I'm also a gay man that happens to use Grindr (for those of you that don't know, Grindr is an app used by gay men for... \"networking.\")\n\nI have this bad habit of \"networking\" with guys and not even getting to know their name first. I only network safely, though. So I got that going for me.\n\nAnyways, I \"networked\" with this one guy and while laying in bed, I laughed, realizing I didn't know his name. Actually, tbh, I don't remember his name. After laughing about it for a good minute, he told me. I thought his name sounded oddly familiar, but I shrugged it off.\n\nWe developed a \"networker with benefits\" sort of deal where we would meet every Tuesday for \"networking.\" I eventually learned his last name. Turns out his son was in my second period class. Ruh Roh.\n\nHis son was a shy guy, and pretty tall. And when I say tall, I mean tall. Like, taller than most of the other students. Well over 5'10'' (I don't know for sure, since I'm 5'5'' and can't really get a good view of him compared to other things.) The kid was a swimmer, too, so he was pretty athletic.\n\nI become hesitant on my weekly meetings with my fellow networker. When I first came to terms with my sexuality, I had this weird thing where In theory I was okay with sleeping with someone that was married or dating, as I wouldn't have forced said person to do it. At this point, I started feeling a little guilty for being a homewrecker.\n\nThe networking was great though, so I kept it up (it gets better) The kid was still in my class for the remainder of the semester, so I felt really guilty whenever I taught that class. I'd often ask him how he was doing, if his home life was okay. He seemed normal right up until I learned his dad's last name. That's when I started noticing things.\n\nHe'd spend so much time after school swimming, as if he felt at home in the pool. Whenever I'd ask him questions on the homework, he'd give me a blank stare from his three-story-tall view as if he didn't understand English. I considered calling my networking deal off because the guilt was becoming too hard to deal with--which is pretty bad considering I networked with his dad for the better half of a semester. But I didn't, because hey, a networker's gotta network.\n\nUntil one Friday.\n\nIt was second period, around 8:45am (yep. School starts reaaallly early) when I asked the class if they had any questions on the homework. The dead silence of the room gave away that most of them didn't even do it. Oh well, not my grade. I heard someone clear their throat. It was him. He looked at me, and I at him. I saw it in his dead gaze looking down at me--Why? Why Mr. Tamural? You've ruined my life. You've ruined my family...--but he didn't say those things. I could feel it, though. It's all I could hear in my head at the time. My voice cracked: \"Question?\" for about thirty seconds there was total silence. I asked again: \"What number?\" and he said \"Tree fiddy.\" I gasped--behind the tears generated by my networker's guilt, I realized that the networker's son was a 2.6 million year old sea monster from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392525606", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

I got a little closer, unzipped my pants, and let out my mating call.\n\nThe moose gave me the nod. I started eating the female moose out, her vagina glistening in the sunlight. It tasted of totinos pizza rolls. I see the female was really enjoying herself so I shoved my fist in her like a catchers mitt.\n\nShe got nervous and wanted to call her parents.

{"body": "Honestly, there really isn't.\n\nOne of the first things I did when I played was try to get to the top of a rocky plateau on the Redguard island (starting area). There was a path that looked like from afar that it would lead up but it kinda just spiraled around the back to ledge. there was no way to climb up even 1/2 way. It was kinda dissapointing. Also on this island was a beach on the backside of some cliffs. The only way to get to this beach would be to swim a good 5 minutes around the island. I got to this beach only to discover nothing but mudcrabs. Again I was kinda dissapointed.\n\nWhen I played WoW there was all sorts of interesting things you could discover. For instance, there was a dwarven airport above Ironforge which had a path so well hidden that most players believed you couldn't get up there. There was also an island in the middle of nowhere (not even marked on map) that contained a msg in a bottle that read \"what the hell are you doing here?\". Heck Wailing Caverns (first main horde dungeon) had a secret cave above the main cave opening that housed secret quest givers (related to that dungeon). If you you didn't bother to explore (or someone didn't show you) you would've never found these quests (or known there was a dungeon). Also, right outside the cave was a pond that was home to a rarespawn similar in appearance to to the Loch Ness monster. And my favorite, There was a hidden prison island off the coast of this swamp zone (that was really kinda a sidezone) that had an entire castle and underground cave system with a prison at the bottom that contained the missing prince of the Human's (a very important character in the lore). There was no story content or quests involving this place for a very long time. And it really was there for players to explore and have fun with. That's the thing...In WoW I actually wanted to explore, in ESO there really is no point and it's far more limiting in terms of vertical climbing and walls which really irks me. There really is no benefit to exploring beyond what your compass indicates (which isn't exploring).\n\nThe only exploration aspect I found in this game was Skyshards however once you realize they're all in static positions is pointless. You can just ask someone in general or lookup where the spawn position is. Also, they all have clues in the skyshard menu with most being blatanlty obvious. like \"in the nest of a harpy\"...in a zone with 1 small harpy area...that's off the road..right outside the main city.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392590939", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "score": -14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I got this one.\n\nSo my friends and I were \ngoing to go vist Ireland (we live in Canada) for a couple weeks because one of my friends had family there and grew up there for most of her life. After months of planning we were at the airport and while we were waiting we started talking to this guy. He was a caucasion, thin man about 6'4 at least with longer gray hair tied back into a pony tail and this odd, possibly Irish-Australian accent (I really don't know how to explain it) and everything he was wearing, EVERY thing was green. The exaclt same shade, sort of dark green, from head to toe. He was carrying an instrument case that he said contained an alto saxaphone, and he was traveling to France to perform with a small musical group that apperently formed online (he was a little vauge about it). \n\nBut anyways, one of my friends played in high school band and she made this casual joke about how horrible alto saxes sound. That was our first mistake. (not a personal insult or anything, I don't know very much about them but apparently alto saxaphones have a reputation for being hard to play right or something). But anyways, this guy, who had seemed really laid back untill this point became very offended and said that he could take it out and play it for us right then and there. We apologized but he just became more upset and then (thankfully) it was time for us to board the plane. \n\nThere were six of us and somehow I ended up being the only one sitting alone, which I didn't really mind until I saw that I was seated right next to green dude. He seemed really interesting at first but honestly he sort of scared me. But I brushed it off, it would just be a non-boring flight. Apperently he thought that I was the girl who told the joke because he glared at me for the first solid ten minutes (I'm serious, ten minutes, which seemed like a really long time). Anyways, eventually he seemed to cool down after I ignored him for a while and started talking again. He really loved talking. And talking. And talking. I politely asked if he had any family in France, which was my second mistake. Like seriously, this guy got affended so easily! Apparently he only had a few relitives he was close to and they all died. He then went on to say that everyone he used to love died and he travels around the world playing music to people who \"are more simpathetic than you are\". And apparently it's made him a millionare but someone stole all his money, \"someone insensitive like you.\"\nI felt sorry for the guy, but I was pretty sure he was lying and I really really really didn't want to spend the rest of the incredibly long flight next to him and I was slightly weirded/creeped out by how he kept glaring at me so I made the third mistake. I called a stewardess and, right in front of him, asked to be re-seated. \n\nSurprisingly, there was actually a spot for me but even several rows away, I knew that guy was seriously pissed off at me. At the end of the flight my friends were joking with me about it (I told them the story) and I never saw him again for the rest of my life.\n\n...untill a week and a half later when my friends and I were in Scotland. It was late at night and we were drinking by this lake my friend used to visit when she was younger. There were other people there and I was getting pretty drunk, so when I thought I saw the green guy from the plane and told my friends they laughed histerically and I laughed histerically and we forgot about it. An hour or so later one of my friends (a guy I was secretly really into) asked if I wanted to go walk along the shore with him to get some fresh air. Hell yes! We were walking and laughing when one of us stumbled (we were wasted) when suddenly there was a noise behind us and when we turned around I nearly shit myself- there was the green dude from the plane glaring at me. What. The. Fuck. By the randomest of chances he was at the same place in Europe at the same time and still wearing that weird-ass green outfit thing and FOLLOWED US when we sarted walking. \n\nI was totaly freaked out by now. He started yelling at me and that asshole I had a crush on (Not anymore) ran away. I probably should have ran away too but instead stupid, drunk me started yelling back and then he came up really close and I realized what an idiot I was, this guy was crazy and could seriously hurt me. I appologized to him, again and again, I said sorry, sorry for angering you and being insensitive and changing seats on the plane and is there anything I could do to make it up to you. Then, to my complete surprise, he calmed down. Just like that. He said:  \"well, there is one thing you could do for me\".\n\nI waited for him to continue talking but instead he started walking to the water, but when he got to the shore line he didn't stop. He just kept walking until the water covered the top of his grey hair. As the last ripple smoothed out I stood, gaping in disbelief until a giant crustacean from the paleozoic era burst from the water, it's dark green scales shimmering in the night and it's eyes staring directly into mine.

Well allow me to step out on a limb here and grant that the establishment has *earned* its credibility. Biologists would love to identify a living organism like Bigfoot. When [J.L.B. Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._L._B._Smith) wrote about the discovery of the Coelacanth, an organism that biologists were sure must be extinct, he was as surprised as though he had found \"a dinosaur walking the street.\" It was a revolutionary discovery for Biology. Far from wanting to cover such things up, Biologists would trample over each other for the opportunity to discover something like Bigfoot or Nessie if it was remotely plausible that either existed.\n\nThe skeptic must always be willing to turn the lens inward, evaluating his own biases and questioning whether his conclusions are reached on solid evidence, or whether those conclusions are reached because he *wants* them to be true.

{"body": "Sorry for the rather excessive length of my response.\n\nTL;DR version: Your statement, IMO, seems to assume that abortion prevents a child from existing (rather than ending one's life), but that's not a universally accepted conclusion, or there wouldn't be a debate over abortion going on in the first place. We know that the pre-born are biologically living members of the human species. The only differences between a pre-born human and a born human are their size, level of development, and degree of dependency. Since development is a continuum extending long past birth, born people differ in these ways also, but that doesn't mean that a toddler is more of a person than a newborn, or a 10 year old more so than a toddler. We don't gain more rights by getting older, or by developing more of our own characteristics. A young human is like a still developing Polaroid: if you took an amazing picture, wouldn't you be angry is someone destroyed it before it fully developed? After all, the photo is valuable as soon as it comes into existence, because it inherently contains a certain image, even if we can't see it yet. All of it's characteristics are captured in an instant, it simply needs more time to fully develop them. Throwing it away because it still looked like \"just brown smudges\" would be madness.\n\nNon TL;DR version:\n\nTo expand a little (or a lot) on what has been said below, the thing about this statements is that it begs the question: it assumes that abortion prevents a child, rather than destroying one. The fetus or embryo is, at any point in development, a full, unique, self-directed, living human organism. This is just a matter of objective science. So abortion at any point necessarily kills a living, albeit young, member of the human species.\n\nBut then we ask, what are the pre-born, morally and philosophically? Are they people? Are they babies? Clumps of cells? Only potential persons? If they are people, shouldn't we prohibit abortion? After all, we wouldn't allow the killing or abandonment of a newborn, even if the mother was experiencing financial hardship or decided that she didn't want it-and the reason is that the newborn is a person. Even if a woman believed that her newborn was not really a full person, we wouldn't allow her to kill or abandon it. After all, the value and rights of a human individual don't hinge on what anyone else thinks of them, or how attached someone else is to them emotionally, or whether their existence was planned. So the rights and personhood of the pre-born can't hinge on whether the mother believes they are a baby. The rights of the pre-born can only hinge on the nature and characteristics of the pre-born themselves. So if a fetus who is desperately wanted and planned for is a baby, so is a fetus killed in an abortion clinic.\n\nSo what arguments are there for denying rights to the pre-born? A brief way of summing up the differences between born and pre-born humans is that they only differ in their size, level of development, and degree of dependency. But born people also differ in these same ways, because human development is a continuum that starts at conception and continues long after birth. A 10 year old is FAR more mentally developed than a newborn, and is larger, and less dependent. Newborns aren't self-aware, they can't intentionally and meaningfully communicate, they're not capable of rational or abstract thought, they can't feed or care for themselves, etc. But is a 10 year old more of a person than a newborn, even a little? Is a 20 year old more of a person than a 10 year old or newborn, even a little? I would say no, definitely not, and that killing either is equally an act of murder. So why would a newborn be more of a person than a 30 week fetus, or a 30 week fetus more or a person than a 10 week one? A 10 week pre-born human is the exact same individual as she will be later on, simply at a younger age.\n\nThere's a pretty fitting analogy between pre-born humans-and arguably newborn and toddler humans also-and a still developing Polaroid photograph. (Remember them?) Say you win a trip to some amazing destination-say Scotland. You want to take a ton of photos, so you take your parents old Polaroid camera (because digital cameras are too mainstream). While you're there, you go out on Loch Ness in a boat of other tourists, and suddenly old Nessie pops up out of the water. You're shocked obviously, but you quickly snap a picture before she sinks back under the waves. Out it comes, not yet showing a clear image, and while you're shaking it around impatiently, another tourist, who doesn't understand how Polaroids work, gets over excited and snatches it from you. Upon seeing it, her face falls in disappointment, and she tosses it over the edge of the boat, where it sinks.\n\nAnd then she says, \"Shoot, marlalram....It was just brown smudges.\"\n\nWould you be angry? Why? And if so, what if she responded to your anger by saying \"Well it wasn't real or valuable yet; it was only a potential picture.\"\n\nHow would you respond? Why?\n\nEdit: Proofreading is hard.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392630330", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "TL:DR version at the bottom, because I respond with a novel, sorry.\n\nTrue, she doesn't. But development is a continuum, starting at conception and continuing long after birth. If a 30 week fetus is more valuable than a 10 week fetus, or if a newborn is more valuable than a 30 week fetus, due to being more developed....wouldn't it follow that a 10 year old is more of a person than a newborn, due to being more developed? Newborns may be conscious, but they're not self-aware, not capable of rational or abstract thought, not capable of communicating meaningfully and intentionally, etc. But I would say that they are equally valuable to a 10 year old, and that killing either is an act of murder.\n\nBut, that said, I can understand people feeling that the development of the nervous system is the standard by which we should judge the morality of abortion. After all, we typically consider more intelligent or aware animals to be more valuable, and personhood is often associated with higher mental capacities.\n\nConsider though, a situation where you have an amoeba and an embryo, and you can only save one. (Assume both are reasonably assured of going on to live a full life.) Neither can think. What's the difference between them? Which do you choose?\n\nWe need to ask, why can't an embryo think? Because, depending on what point we're at, she either does not have a brain, or has a brain that isn't capable of conscious thought. Why doesn't she have that? Because she hasn't developed one yet. Why? Because she hasn't had enough time. Why? Because she isn't old enough.\n\nNow ask, why can't an amoeba think? Again, because it doesn't have a brain. But why doesn't it have a brain? Because it is not in its nature to develop one. \n\nSo to sum it up, an amoeba cannot think because of what it is, but an embryo cannot think because of how old she is. And that is an essential difference. \n\nHere is why I would choose the embryo: She (or he) has a fundamental and intrinsic human nature, and that means that she possesses a capacity for conscious thought that is simply not being expressed yet. Everything about her was captured in the moment of conception, and is inherently a part of her, whether it is currently being expressed or not. By the same principle, I would say that self-awareness could be used as a reasonable requirement for personhood, but that infants, who are not self-aware, are people regardless because they possess a human nature, and because they have an inherent capacity for self-awareness which simply can't be expressed yet. That separates them from, say, a newborn calf, because a calf doesn't have a capacity to develop self-awareness. \n\nAnother example would be a person in a temporary coma, who due to brain damage has no current ability to be conscious, but who remains a person regardless. After all, while we sometimes “pull the plug” on those deemed to be permanently comatose or in a vegetative state, we would never dream of doing the same thing to someone who would gain the ability to be conscious in a few month’s time.\n\nA different sort of analogy would be an undeveloped Polaroid photograph. (Remember them?) Imagine you took an incredible, rare photograph. For example, say you're out in a boat on Loch Ness in Scotland, and suddenly the Loch Ness monster pops out of the water. Obviously you’re shocked, but you excitedly manage to snap a picture with your Polaroid camera before she sinks under the waves. Out comes the photo, not yet showing a clear image, and while you're shaking it around impatiently, another tourist, who doesn't understand how Polaroids work, gets over excited and snatches it from you. Upon seeing it, her face falls in disappointment, and she tosses it over the edge of the boat, where it sinks. And she says, “Shoot, it was just brown smudges.” Would you be angry? Why? What if she said “Why are you so upset, it’s not like it was truly valuable yet….It was only a potential picture.”\n\nObviously this would be ridiculous, because the undeveloped picture is still a picture; it's simply in an immature state. Everything about the image was captured in it in an instant. You would, I imagine, be extremely pissed off in this situation, because the undeveloped photograph is clearly incredibly valuable and important, despite not yet developing all of its valuable properties. Like an embryo, it simply needs a little more time.\n\n\nTL;DR version, cause I wrote a lot: Human development is a continuum starting at conception and continuing well after birth. But being more developed does not make one more valuable. True, a very young fetus or embryo can't think, but that is only because of how old she is; it is in her nature to think, unlike, say, an amoeba. She has an intrinsic nature as a thinking, rational being from the moment of conception, and inherently possess the capacity to develop those abilities when she's older. Similarly, we might say that something has to be self-aware to be a person, but newborns, which aren't self-aware, are still persons because of their inherent human nature. They already possess self-awareness in their genetic code; it just can't be expressed yet. If you took a rare and amazing Polaroid photo, wouldn't you be angry if someone destroyed it, even while it was still developing? Everything about it was captured in a moment, it only needs time to develop its own valuable properties. It would be madness to throw it away before the picture was clearly visible because it was \"just brown smudges.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392636627", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Nothing will stay the same. \n\nWhy does that make it illusory? If reality is illusion, then why do we even bother to have the terms 'reality' and 'illusion'? The whole point of the word 'illusion' is that we use it to signify 'stuff that is not reality'.\n\n&gt;I feel as though there is good reason to SEEK the idea of God.\n\nI do, if there is evidence. If there exists a box that we cannot see inside, and have no way of knowing what is in it - we may wish to 'seek' for the idea that the box contains an egg - but no amount of deep thinking will bring us any closer to the truth. We need evidence in order to determine what is in the box. Anything else is baseless speculation, and might be interesting - but is not remotely useful.\n\n&gt; But why should we not seek God when there could be a scientific possibility, when there are mysteries still unsolved.\n\n...because we have better leads on other mysteries. Other mysteries have avenues that can be investigated and tested. A hypothesis with no evidence and no good reason to investigate it is not something that we should waste our time on. Should we spend time looking for the frog that lives in the heart of the sun?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392660269", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Oil was a major motivation for the War in Iraq in 2003.\n\n\n\n\nMany people either deny that oil was a motivating factor or accuse George Bush of conquering the Middle East \"for their oil\" as if we were going to war to steal the oil.  Oil was a major motivating factor in that everyone (US, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait) was afraid that Saddam would go nuts (again) and invade neighboring nations (again) or start launching SCUD missiles or who knows what else into the Persian Gulf where everyone is mining and transporting oil. The fallout from Saddam doing something crazy like that would be major oil shortages and skyrocketing prices, which would have driven the world's economy to a stop. We didn't take anyone's oil, we removed the major threat in order to ensure that everyone was able to mine and transport oil safely to the global markets.\n\n\nEdit: Bonus ELI5:\n\nImagine a giant Dunkin Donuts that sells more donuts than any other donut shop in its city, including to the police. Now next door to the Dunkin Donuts, imagine a smaller shop, we'll call it a Waffle House, and they sell donuts too, but not nearly as many as the Dunkin Donuts. For decades now, the Waffle House has been owned by a group of gangsters who are always waving around their glocks and mac-10s at anyone who goes to the Dunkin Donuts, including the police. One day, Waffle House gangsters started firing randomly into the DD parking lot and took over a small corner of the Dunkin Donuts. The police went in and made the gangsters leave the Dunkin Donuts and wrote them a couple tickets, but didn't send anyone to jail. The gangsters then went back to the Waffle House and started to behave better for a little while since they didn't want to go to jail. Eventually, about ten years later, the shock of the tickets has worn off and the Waffle House crew is still pissed off at the police. They start acting up again and waving their glocks and Mac-10s at everyone who goes into the Dunkin Donuts and threaten to start shooting the police when they go to buy donuts. This time, when the Waffle House gangsters wave their guns, they start shouting \"Hey yo Po-lice! Wait till you see what we got in back!\" strongly implying that they have a more fearsome and internationally illegal weapon hidden in the back of their restaurant. The police like buying donuts at Dunkin Donuts and do not want a repeat of the Dunkin Donuts invasion from ten years prior and realize that a similar event with the addition of the new hidden weapon the gangsters keep talking about would be catastrophic for the entire city. The police send the city health inspector to check out the Waffle House and see what is hidden in the back room, but the gangsters turn them away and continue pointing guns and yelling at anyone who walks by. At this point, the police conduct a raid on the Waffle House and send all the gangsters to jail. They very carefully send a HAZMAT team to check out the back room, but there is nothing back there but flour and cockroaches. They wonder what happened to the secret weapon and scour the building. The police and the people of Anycity, USA continue to buy their donuts from the Dunkin Donuts without having to fear the gangsters who lived in the Waffle House, which has now been occupied by meth addicts and prostitutes. The meth-heads and hookers aren't really bothering anyone outside Waffle House, but the police can't really look the other way while they're wrapping up the investigation on the gangsters and so they start booking the junkies and the prostitutes with the goal of leaving a clean and safe Waffle House at the end of the investigation. They spend years trying to suppress the drug use and prostitution in the Waffle House to little avail. Eventually, the police decide that there will always be junkies and hookers in the Waffle House and it isn't worth their time to try to stop it anymore and close the investigation. The Waffle House is now a hotbed for petty crimes, but the hookers and junkies don't really bother anyone outside of Waffle House, so the police and citizens can continue to shop at Dunkin Donuts in peace. At the death sentencing trial for the OG of the Waffle House crew, he goes on a rant about his neighbors on *the other* side, IHOP. The IHOP is located on the other side of the Waffle House from the Dunkin Donuts and is occupied by another gang that Waffle House had constantly been at war with. The judge and jury realize that the Waffle House was making big threats about a secret weapon to deter their enemies at IHOP - *they were bluffing the whole time*, but at this point no one really cares enough about Waffle House to print another story and the new realization about the case goes largely unreported.  The OG is anti-climactically put to death by lethal injection at the state prison and when prompted for his last words, he asks if anyone could spare three dollars and fifty cents. The executioner is furious and, realizing that the gangster is actually a six hundred foot tall loch ness monster, exclaims, \"God damn it, loch ness monster, I ain't giving you no three dollars and fifty cents!\" and administers the injection. The local news stations mention the execution in between the sports score and a special on Christmas shopping deals. The donut shoppers wonder if there ever was anything in the back of the Waffle House. Some folks start to wonder if the police really just wanted to steal the donuts from the Waffle House and made up the secret weapon as an excuse. People start talking about this possibility and many people feel uneasy about the situation. While the new theory seems plausible, most people are not aware that the police never took any donuts when they raided the Waffle House but rather continued to buy their donuts from the Dunkin Donuts (or make their own).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392662609", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

No actual evidence of it was recorded. \n\nKillswitch is the most intriguing one imo, I detailed why in a [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1y8g0a/the_creepiest_urban_legends_in_the_history_of/cfimjsz?context=3) in this thread. The logical explanation would be that the new found gameplay footage is fan made art, and the guy is talking to/threatening himself on youtube/twitter for added effect, but unlike some hoaxes like Pokemon buried alive, or misfortune.gb I don't think there is an actual game where the characters were taken from, so no rom hack or the like. Would someone go through all this trouble (building a new game from scratch based on descriptions circulating around from several years ago) to perpetuate this myth on an obscure youtube account? Probably more likely than the alternative. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392795075", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

After making a clean escape, the next day you follow through with your plan of paying a taxi cab driver to take you to LA. And along the way you make several memorable stops across the country. All along you befriend the driver, and treat him to awesome dinners as if you were on a road trip together. After about 10 stops and you make it to Arizona, you tell the driver you gotta run to the bathroom...you leave the briefcase in the backseat so he doesn't think anything of it. An hour goes by and you don't come back, he gets worried.  He grabs the briefcase, so he can go  make sure you are okay. When he grabs the briefcase he realizes that it is empty.\nYou make it out of the state and believe you are free, and you got a free ride across the country with no strings attached. Three months later, in your suburb, you hear rustling in your backyard. You think to yourself that there is no way, is it...it couldn't be. You peek out the window and..it's the taxi cab driver. He has been searching for you for the past three months. You panic, and think how could he have found you. You remember, you got complacent and slipped up about where you would like to live once you got to LA. You flip the lights on to make him believe you are coming to the door. You sneak out the window and drop down into the bushes. He hears you...You are out of shape because of the lifestyle you chose to live. He begins the chase. You know you're not going to get away.

{"body": "***EDIT WALL OF TEXT INCOMING***    \nAlrighty then, our story starts us in the Runescape days of 2008, where the earliest incarnation of DigitalLion beings. In middle school at the time, Runescape *was the shit*. Everybody played it. I believe nearly every school went through a Runescape phase as one point or another, but that is strongly beside the point of this here story. I had 3 other friends that also really fucking loved Runescape at this point in time, we where almost like the 4 amigos of Lumbridge in a sense. For the sake of anonymity, we'll be referring to them as Ed, Jeff, and Ty. My family life was fairly normal, as was Ed and Ty's, but Jeff's mother was a fucking nutcase to put it bluntly. This woman was literally Hitler if Hitler was housewife in California. Being edgy middle schoolers, we had lots of names for Jeff's mother, including Control Freak, Helicopter Parent, Bitchy Mom, Jeff's Bane, Cunt, and even **Erin**^just^kidding.    \n     \nFor some reason or another, either Mom-Hitler-McBitch, or Jeff just being retarded, he was grounded for a month, which of course meant every middle schoolers worst nightmare, **no Runescape for a month.** We where appalled. We where frustrated. We swore loudly in an empty playground since we where badass. But most of all, we where devastated, since like heroin addicts, we needed out fix of leveling up out runecrafting level. Since of course since Jeff couldn't play, we couldn't. Four Amigos stick together right? We had to think of a solution, so we had a sleepover at Jeff's house the following night, provided that we followed CuntNugget/Jeff's Mom's rules of the house. No computer at all, and minimal TV after it got dark, since she didn't want us to be *too* bored I guess. Ed proceeds to break out his oldschool, somewhat ghetto, knockoff, chinese, game-boy thing. And he only has one goddamn game for it too. Ty and I exchange puzzled looks as Ed beams with joy like a homeless man with a fresh can of Pabst Blue Ribbon. To this day, the name escapes me(Ed says it was called *El Dorado*, but he's always high so I don't believe him.), but the objective of this game was to run away from a bull in a 2d Mario-ish level, and avoid said bull as long as you could. The longer you avoided the bull, the more points you got. With the points you could buy power ups, like faster speed, higher jump, and different bull and character avatars. The different avatars for the bull included animals such as aardvarks, **lions**, tigers, bears^oh^my, elephants, and ostriches.    \n     \nHaving not played any video games in 2 days, Jeff goes first. The night basically continues with Jeff hogging the game, but also unlocking almost every avatar. We play around with them and notice that Jeff has  used every enemy avatar except the lion. Ty and I take notice of this, and when Jeff goes to the bathroom, we quickly switch the avatar to the lion, to see if Jeff will notice.  \n  \nAnd Jeff did notice. He didn't just notice, he flipped his shit, right then and there. Running, sobbing, screaming, the whole nine yards. When Jeff's Mom came in, the look on her face when she saw the Ghetto Gameboy was priceless. It was like a conservative finding out his son was gay. Many shoutings and phone calls where made, and we all went home early, learning that Jeff has a fear of lions to the extreme, and that His mom leveled up in bitchiness at least 5 times.    \n     \nNow being good friends we where, we gave Jeff enough shit about lions to clog a toilet. We even went as far as to use proxies to make fake emails and (*gasp*) MySpace accounts to send Jeff pictures of Lions, which of course all had names relating to lions. A particularly funny prank had the email DigitalLionLovesJeff@yahoo.com constantly harass Jeff, and the email account almost faded into obscurity when I happened to get a random email password reset notification for it. I proceeded to revive the email account to use on a daily basis, which was then shortened down to DigitalLion and used over the years as a username for various videogame accounts such as Steam. I believe that Ty even went as far as to put a Lions Head on a picture of Jeff's crush as school. It was terrible. While Ty, Ed and I still stayed close friends over the years, despite all 4 of us going to different high schools, Jeff drifted apart from us three, and we didn't hear from him again, 2 years later, when we where freshmen in high school.    \n   \nFreshman year is in full swing, and all 3 of us get a message from Jeff, asking if we want to reunite to just talk over some cheeseburgers and virgin Piña Coladas^Jeff's^idea at our local mall, since we had all gone our separate ways. Of course we all agreed on it, but not before Ty, Ed, and I decided to show up to the meet point in ghetto, homemade lion suits.   \n    \nThe day of reckoning was upon us. Heading for our neighborhood mall dressed in hot, sweaty, bright orange, homemade lions suits, we prepared to meet Jeff, and hoped that Jeff was prepared ***for us***. As we enter the mall, we see Jeff, digging in his backpack, oblivious to the fact that 3 bipedal lions are prepared to sit down next to him to eat cheeseburgers and talk about annoying teachers. We took our seats, and all shouted, **\"RAWR JEFF HAVEN'T SEEN YA IN YEARS MATE\"**, all while trying to contain our laughter. As Jeff looks up, the color drains from his face, as you can see he is trying to not lose his composure in the middle of the crowded mall. He stammers out a hello, and talks in one word answers for the rest of the meal. The meal was as exciting as talking to a corpse, as Jeff was trying to not start crying, and we finally leave the mall. Immediately after exiting, Jeff proceeds to run down the sidewalk screaming, leaving us in the dust, laughing on the ground in oversize lion costumes. I wish I could continue on with the story, but it has been 3 years since that encounter with Jeff, and the 3 of us haven't talked to him since, with the lone encounter being a happy birthday wish to Ed two months ago. And that is the story on how I got the username DigitalLion. Love you Jeff.  \n*I really, really wanted to make this a tree fiddy/Bel Air joke. :(*  \n**TL;DR Lions, Phobias, Piña Coladas, Proxies, and broken friendships.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392854596", "subreddit": "TagPro", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt; I am an agnostic(so I've been told) and I believe that there is a God\n\nAgnosticism addresses knowledge. An agnostic does not claim to know there is a God, or not. If you're an agnostic theist, you believe there is a God, but you don't know there is a God. Is this accurate? \n\n&gt; who cares if I don't pick a team?\n\nThe Christian God certainly does. It's the first and second commandment (depending on your Bible version).\n\nLike many, the part of your view that I want to dispute is that there is one god. My views aside, I just want you to be aware that this is an unsupported claim. You can assume there is a god for the sake of an argument, but your CMV doesn't do that. Your CMV makes a set of claims, all of which have to be true for your view to be accepted. Arguing that atheists want to dispute the basis of your claims is a bit like making claims that because we live on a flat earth, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are friends, and then getting mad at people attacking the flat earth claim instead of the friendship claim. \n\n\n\n&gt; Not a single point was made that actually would even pique my interest to change any part of my view\n\nThis is common when the claims being made are not what the claimer thinks they are ;)\n\n&gt; If you disagree because you don't even think God exists, why would it bother you what kind, shape or form of God I have chosen to follow? \n\nIt doesn't. But your CMV makes a claim that there is Gods, and the rules of CMV say I can dispute any and all claims. You should rephrase your CMV so that the existence of God is assumed.\n\n&gt; How your belief is superior to mine, I do not understand. Science doesn't have 100 % evidence that God doesn't exist. \n\nAtheists don't have a belief. That's sort of the whole point. So the belief of an atheist is not superior or inferior. It just... isn't. And of course, science doesn't have to prove God. Theists claim there is a God, and so it is up to them to prove that claim. It is the choice of each person to accept that claim or not. \n\nIn short, your CMV consists of a series of claims, the first few of which are \"there is a God\" and \"there is only one God\". Neither of these claims are supported by evidence, and thus your view as stated is refuted. If you didn't want these claims refuted, they should be listed as assumptions, not claims.

And I doubt if Birdgang can play properly on Perfect World server or SEA server.*\n\n**[Na`Vi] vs rox.KIS - Best of 3**\n\n**Risk Level: MEDIUM**\n\n-**Why place bet on Na`Vi**?\n\n* This series will be a Captain's Draft mode\n\n* Na`Vi is one of the most versatile team, Same with Goblak as a drafter.\n\n* Na`Vi might not take this seriously because the tournament itself is chaos.\n\n* Na`Vi's play will not be affected though, because they almost use any hero while goblak loves to pick his favorite heroes to draft like treant, veno, dazzle, and elder titan.\n\n-**Conclusion**\n\n*I will favor Na`Vi on this match, if any teams that will have a problem on Captain's draft mode, It will be rox.KIS, because their style is almost 1 sided. (picking 4 wombo combo heroes and 1 heavy snowball hero)*\n\n**ADDED MATCH**\n\n**[Zero Respect!] vs rox.KIS - Best of 1**\n\n**Risk Level: HIGH**\n\n-**Why place bet on Zero Respect**?\n\n* rox.KIS didn't do any good yesterday.\n\n* Zero respect will be the underdog on this match, but they didn't deserve the current odds IMO.\n\n-**Conclusion**\n\n*Taking the risk on Zero Respect because rox.KIS are unstable, this match is best of one and Zero Respect have the skills to take down the unstable rox.*\n\n**[4FC] vs Relax - Best of 3**\n\n**Risk Level: HIGH**\n\n-**Why place bet on 4FC**?\n\n* Relax won't have Dendi as a Stand-in.\n\n* Relax tend to throw sometimes, I just don't trust them when they are favorites.\n\n* 4FC on the have not lost since they have return from being inactive. They only have a draw on Team HOG. (fuck that meepo pick)\n\n-**Conclusion**\n\n*Again, I'm trying to get the value on betting 4FC because they are more stable, but this match will depend on Relax's stand-in. Skipping the match are highly recommended if you don't want to be disapponted.*\n\n**[Dignitoss] vs Pool Sorcery Some Tangoes - Best of 1**\n\n**Risk Level: MEDIUM**\n\n-**Why place bet on Dignitoss**?\n\n* Dignitoss is the former About Tree Fiddy\n\n* About Tree Fiddy's previous match vs PSST is 2-1 in favor of ATF.\n\n* PSST is still not doing good, they are just getting stomped everytime they face tier 1 and 2 teams.\n\n* Odds are very good on Dignitoss\n\n-**Conclusion**\n\n*Dignitoss will most likely take this match because they've beat PSST before, but I'm not counting out PSST because this match are only best of 1, they can take Dignitoss on a best of 1.*\n\n**[Wild Witch Doctors] vs Union Gaming - Best of 1**\n\n**Risk Level: MEDIUM**\n\n-**Why place bet on Wild Witch Doctors**?\n\n* WWD is high Tier 2 team in my opinion, while Union gaming is lower Tier 2\n\n* Union Gaming lost to WWD 3 times before\n\n-**Conclusion**\n\n*Wild Witch Doctors should get this game easily. Yes, they can't win vs Tier 1 teams but they always take a good fight, on the other hand, Union Gaming is strong but their skill is just not enough to beat WWD. I'll grab the 4:2 odds .*\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392860890", "subreddit": "dota2loungebets", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

In order to get in, you'd have to scale the catwalks on the outside of it and then climb in through a window. My friend Tom and I were regulars and we brought some new people but they couldn't make the climb so just Tom and I went in.\n\nWe got to the main foyer area which was lit (random parts of the building still had functioning lights despite being condemned for the better part of 15 years) and we heard knocking on the walls so we call our friends still outside and tell them to cut the bullshit because we aren't buying it. They said they walked back to the car to wait. We looked out the window and sure enough, they were at my car.\n\n*Knock Knock Knock Knock*\n\nTom and I decide that it's probably best to get the fudge out of there, but in our haste to leave we got lost and wound up in the basement. Now is a good time for my phone battery to die because now we're in the basement with no light other than his phone screen which isn't doing shit.\n\nWe saw a light flickering off in the distance and against our better judgement, we go towards it. It led to stairs, we go up about seven flights and end up at a bell tower.\n\n*Knock Knock Knock*\n\nFuck. We run down the stairs and decide to just kick down a door and hope it leads to a window. It lead to a catwalk. Fuck yeah. The catwalk lead to nothing. Fuck no. I noticed that there was a fire hose in the other room so we tied it around the railing and rappelled down two stories.\n\nAs far as we know, there was nobody else in there. Our friends didn't see anyone outside. There were no trees near the window where we first heard the knocking, nor any trees anywhere near the bell tower. I don't necessarily believe in ghosts or spirits but I don't have a better explanation.\n\nThe catwalks have since been torn down and the windows boarded up.\n\nEdit: **TL;DR:** Heard random knocking while exploring an abandoned building with no reasonable explanation.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392907055", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

To this date, I know very little about evolution, except that apparently it is \"only a theory\" (I'm planning on changing this).\n\nWe even had to read books, not the kinds of historic literature like Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, but books that were written by Christians.  These included explicitly Christian novels and \"autobiographies\" of Christian missionaries and famous evangelists.\n\nAnd the part about teachers really being present in the classroom?  That is a flat-out lie.  My supervisor (this is the actual term) often could not help me on advanced math subjects, like trigonometry.  Instead, the only option was to learn by the book.  I guess it is easy to see why I was the only student in the entire school who liked math (I am now a math major).  All learning was rote learning, where you just had to regurgitate facts.\n\nAnyway, if there was any positive benefit to be had at ACE, I would say it is pretty good at teaching you how to learn on your own.  This has helped me through college, I admit.\n\nEither way, it is a (mostly) terrible education system.

She had called our office and informed them I had forgot paperwork so she needed to know where to mail it then drove all night to get there.\n\n\nOh and then the kicker, after dating for about 6 months(yes Im an idiot) I find out that what I thought was her ex was not really her ex, that she had been going on conjugal visits to see him every other weekend. Thats right, he was locked up in prison on meth production charges and was due to get out in a few months after being there for 5 years but it wasnt a problem since she was going to divorce him before he got out. The conjugal visits arent an issue since that was just sex and I should understand since men need a release......\n\n\nRiiiiiiiiiight, well I broke it off right then and let her rant scream and throw shit at me in the middle of a restaurant I took her to break the news. Cops show up she calms down and leaves, or so I thought. She waits, follows me back to our hotel then jumps on me in the room saying \"she knows I cant give up her pussy\", like its gold or something. Call the cops back throw her out, change hotels, and leave the area, all done right?\n\n\nNo, one night back in Georgia I get a phone call from a strange out of state number, then someone knocking on my door.......have the guy living there with me answer it and its some guy she had hired locally to find me. End up calling the cops and get him to tell the story with the entire back story, luckily relatives are in law enforcement so I get all this on record. Then, I come home the next day and see a strange car on the road, walk inside and see beer sitting on my table with the note \"I will always deliver\" go up stairs and this crazy bitch is in one of the beds half naked with roses. I just shake my head, tell her to get the fuck out and go home before I call the cops, she grabs my crotch and tells me she knows I really want her.....\n\n\nFreaked out I just call my uncle while I sit outside in the car and see her staring at me from the window, he gets there, I tell him whats going on so he comes inside with me. He tells her that she does not have permission to be in the house and must leave now or be arrested. She starts crying and I start to walk over to her, and she sobs, fine I'll leave, but can I get tree-fitty.

{"body": "When I was in fifth grade I had a near death experience. I was crossing the street and a car nearly ran me over. I only avoided death because just as it was about to hit me I felt this incredible strong shove from behind that pushed me out of the way. I didn't know what to attribute it to, but I really felt like God was with me that day. For years after that moment I spent so much time trying to find a way to be closer to God and to serve his plan. I don't come from a religious family, so it was difficult to really figure out what I was meant to do.\n\nI bounced around to so many churches and religions, practically all the Christian denominations, but they never seemed to get me any closer to God. When I was 26 I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I had a terrible time trying to understand this. Why had God saved me just to kill me years later with a disease? Had I done something wrong in my searching? Maybe I missed a religion, or left the correct one too quickly. I spent so much time in prayer, suffering mentally and physically.\n\nIt wasn't until I truly felt like I was on my death bed that I felt his presence. It was like a calm, glowing, peaceful radiance filling my body and washing over me. I felt like I had at last found the one who had saved me years ago. My eyes were squeezed tightly shut, tears streaming down my face as I thanked God for this moment. I asked again and again what my purpose was, why he would save me, what I can possibly do to spread his glory. And I heard his voice, like some calm reassuring parent soothing his child. He spoke to me. And he said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that's when I opened my eyes and saw not god, but a 5 story tall monster from the late triassic period standing before me. \"God damnit loch ness monster, I ain't giving you tree fiddy!\" ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392925695", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is my response in the same topic as the one in /r/atheism.\n\n&gt; It is as bad as they say. I know this because I went to an ACE school nearly my entire school life (unfortunately, they are in the United States too). We were taught that evolution is absolutely false (they presented a hilarious example of a monkey on a typewriter as an analogy), that the Loch Ness monster was real and proved creationism, dancing is a sin (at least in the older material), and so on. To this date, I know very little about evolution, except that apparently it is \"only a theory\" (I'm planning on changing this). \n\n&gt;We even had to read books, not the kinds of historic literature like Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, but books that were written by Christians. These included explicitly Christian novels and \"autobiographies\" of Christian missionaries and famous evangelists.\n\n&gt;And the part about teachers really being present in the classroom? That is a flat-out lie. My supervisor (this is the actual term) often could not help me on advanced math subjects, like trigonometry. Instead, the only option was to learn by the book. I guess it is easy to see why I was the only student in the entire school who liked math (I am now a math major). All learning was rote learning, where you just had to regurgitate facts.\n\n&gt;Anyway, if there was any positive benefit to be had at ACE, I would say it is pretty good at teaching you how to learn on your own. This has helped me through college, I admit.\n\n&gt;Either way, it is a (mostly) terrible education system. If you want to know more about it, feel free to ask me.  \nPS: I once had to write 1000 sentences, lost my breaks for about a month, and got lots of detention for what? Playing poker and gambling.

That's just absurd considering how many believers are not literalists.

{"body": "&gt; What I believe is that God is the most sensible answer to a lot of the most important questions\n\nWhy is god the most sensible? In nearly all other aspects of life, we have found that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. For example, the Earth is a planet just like the others that we can observe, but set in it's own unique orbit around our Sun. It is not a flat disc resting on the backs of 9 elephants who are standing on the backs of turtles (if you don't get the reference, Google \"turtles all the way down\").\n\nImagining an ultra-complex supernatural being is the exact opposite of what is most sensible. For example, if a leaf print is found in 30-year-old concrete, the simplest explanation would be that a lead fell into the wet concrete and left the imprint as the concrete dried. We would not jump to the conclusion that some complex artistic being painstakingly designed the leaf imprint by hand into the concrete. While the latter is not impossible, it is also not likely.\n\n&gt; Cain's wife is probably either his sister or the daughter of his sister. \n\nIf that's a true interpretation, which I do not think it is since it is not the view of the Jews, who have long studied these texts, it is messed up on multiple accounts. First and foremost: incest. Second, according to the Bible, Seth wasn't born until after Cain was cast out, which means that Cain would be anywhere from 30 to 100+ years older than his wife. Since we know people didn't live to be 100 in ancient times, we can immediately throw out the high end numbers. \n\nRegardless, Genesis 4:15 says \"Behold, You have driven me this day from the face of the ground; and from Your face I will be hidden, and I will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.\" Obviously from this text, you can see there are others outside of Adam and his family. his is evidence that the Bible was written for a particular group of tribal people as their origin story, not as literal truth of the origin of man.\n\nThe Bible even specifies some of the other gods, such as Baal, El, and Chemosh to name a few. Even Beth-El, an important city in Israel at the time of David and Solomon, means \"House of El.\" El was the chief god of the Canaanites. The Bible recognizes the diversity of the people in the region and all of their gods. Why? Because it is the written version of oral traditions of the peoples of the region.\n\n&gt; just because we did not find their bones does not mean they are myth\n\nThat's true. However, we have no valid evidence of any kind for the existence of angels, giants, bigfoot, the loch ness monster, unicorns, etc., so we can assert that these things likely do not exist but are the creations of fantasy.\n\n&gt; something to do with the Neanderthals\n\nNot if you think the Earth is only 6,000 years old (which I am not projecting onto you specifically, but many Christians these days are YECs). Neanderthals lived in Northern and Eastern Europe around 32,000 years ago.\n\n&gt; Are you talking about Exodus 4?\n\nYes, 4:24-26 specifically\n\n&gt; These are the Canaanites\n\nI didn't realize that \"Thou shalt not kill\" didn't apply to the Canaanites.\n\n&gt;They weren't children. \n\nI'll give you that. The text should more accurately be read as \"young men.\" Still... killing people because they tease a bald man?\n\n&gt; If you go to the original Hebrew\n\nI have. I studied the OT under [Dr. Mark Elliot](http://www.bibleinterp.com) who is a Hebrew scholar.

The only problem was a kind of rush that we see on a Friday night around dinner time. Tons of bills started coming u, so many in fact that it covered and entire lines worth of orders at one time. So i scrambled working with only one fryer and half of the grill. I had already turned the flattop off so i had to use the oven for any cheese toast or garlic toast that came in. I was swamp but it was almost over. The manager offered help but never came back, I was alone. It started to slow down, I was getting all the orders out in a timely manner(as timely as you can be when your by yourself) until a order came up with FOUR Dublin salads. I checked the time and look at my messy line and just whispered to myself \"fuck me\". So i got to it, trying to manage all the orders coming in and these goddamn Dublin salads. I had to run across the hotel to get the cottage cheese from the other restaurant(which was closed already) and run all the way back. That's when the manager came in after i put up the last order, seeing the line a complete mess and he says \"can i asked to do one more favor for me?\" and i said \"yea what?\". \"Well, I need about tree fiddy\". It was about that time that i notice something strange about my manager. I noticed he was a 8 foot tall, giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. I said \"Goddammit Monsta I ain't giving you no tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392998529", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I worked at a \"large campus book store.\"  Think national chain.  Minimum wage.\n\nThere's about an hour left on my shift when the phone rings.  I answer and it's a woman wanting directions to the store.  I gave her directions, and politely said good-bye.  It was about 30 seconds later I realized that I gave her the wrong directions (Broad Street is not the same as Broadway Avenue.  She would be going several miles out of the way).  \"Oops,\" I thought, then \"Oh well.\"\n\nAbout 45 minutes later a woman barges in.  She had this scrunched, angry face that could turn Medusa to stone.  I can basically see the steam shooting out her ears as she walks aggressively through the lobby and up to the counter, cutting in front of several people.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" she says in a shrill voice.  \"Are you the one I spoke to on the phone earlier?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\"  I say.\n\n\"I asked for *directions*?\", she stresses that last words as if I she were teaching vocabulary to a first grader.\n\n\"Oh, yes.  That was me.\"\n\n\"You owe me gas money.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\"\n\n\"You gave me the wrong directions, and made me drive sixteen miles out of my way.  You owe me gas money.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry but I didn't make you drive anywhere.  I made a mistake.  Again, I apologize.\"\n\n\"*No!*\" she slams her palm on the counter.  \"I don't *want* your apology, I *want* my gas money!\"\n\n\"Ma'am, I'm sorry, I'm not doing that.  Would you like to speak to a manager?\"\n\n\"*Fine*\" she huffs.\n\nSo I go to the back, then up the escalator, and make my way back to the manager's office.  I tell him what's happening and that I don't know what to do.  He says he'll take care of it, and I clock out for the day, being right near the end.\n\nWe walk down together, and I point her out, and make for the door as smooth as I can.\n\n\"*No!*\" she screams again.  \"You're not going anywhere until you pay for my gas!\"\n\nThe manager tries to assuage her and I try to escape.  I'm almost to the door, but she ran after me.  I'm *so* close to freedom, I have my hand on the door, but of course she meets me there.  It's go time.\n\nShe goes into her purse and pulls out her mace, and starts spraying it wildly.  I close my eyes and turn.\n\n\"I'm not leaving until I get my *god damn tree fiddy!*\"\n\nWhen the cloud of pepper spray settles, I turn back around, and she's tearing of her skin to reveal who else but Cthulu beneath.  He expands to the size of the entire god damn store, then starts tearing down walls and throwing books around everywhere, a tempest of literature.\n\nAs I'm jumping through a broken window from hell, and into freedom, all I could think was \"I don't get paid enough for this shit.\"\n\nEdit: spelling", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393001098", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -11, "controversiality": 1}

That was pretty much it.\n\nSo I'm just sitting there, trying to figure out what the heck is going on, when the door slowly opens. My brain kicks into hyper-paranoia mode and I panic for a second, thinking that the cops found me with magical cop powers or something. Fortunately, it was just my roommate, but he had blood *all over* his left hand. He was panting pretty hard when he opened the door, so he probably sprinted from wherever he was.\n\n\"Dude, I need- I need...\" in retrospect, the look on his face was probably pain, but at that time, it looked like he had just eaten the sourest lemon ever. I almost burst out laughing right then, but I still was able to hear him finish saying his thing. Once he caught his breath a little, he continued, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  \nWell, it was about that time I noticed my roommate was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. In a sudden moment of clarity, I jumped from my seat and shouted \"God damn it, loch ness monsta!

{"body": "From History Channel's website:\n\n**What does “cryptid” mean?**\n\n*A “cryptid” is an unidentified creature whose existence has not been scientifically substantiated–i.e. Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, Chupacabra, etc. There are cryptid legends all over the world with sightings on every continent. Many cultures have Bigfoot-style myths as well as shape shifter myths which are featured in this series.*\n\n\n**Is the series real?**\n\n*The plot of Cryptid: The Swamp Beast is fiction based on real sightings and weird events, but it’s a story nonetheless. Some of the people are actors, others are local people who help carry the narrative. But the show also features actual eyewitness interviews and experts weighing in throughout the dramatization that give the series real-world context.*\n\n\n**What is the program’s intent?**\n\n*This program is a legend brought to life. Down in Louisana, there are a lot of strange legends. One concerns the Rougarou, a kind of shape shifter and boogieman. While not widespread, there are certain regions where the belief in this creature is strong. This series brings that legend to life and tells a horror story by weaving in reported sightings, Bigfoot legends and folklore. It’s an entertaining fictional story, however, it is filled with real history, information, and fascinating context.*\n\n**How can I tell what’s real and what isn’t?** \n\n*That’s part of the fun! A legend itself is murky. You don’t know where truth ends and superstition begins. Part of the fun is figuring out what’s pure story and what’s strangely true (or based on true things). The show will hopefully spawn a lot of curiosity that leads to a real appreciation for American folklore.*\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393031542", "subreddit": "bigfoot", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;It's not as black and white as some of you make it out to be. \n\nYes, it really is.\n\n&gt; There isn't any concrete evidence of burn-in, sure.\n\nWhich is where this conversation should end.  Unless real evidence to the contrary can prove otherwise it's not even worth wasting time on and has in fact driven people to stick with headphones they have a strong distaste for.\n\n&gt; many people have experienced burn-in on their own equipment\n\nAnd people claim to have seen:\n\n* big foot\n* loch ness monster\n* UFO/aliens\n* ghosts\n\netc.\n\n&gt;and some manufacturers themselves have recommended it.\n\nThe longer the product is in a person's possession the higher chance they keep it.  It's in the manufacturer's interest to reduce the chance of a return.\n\nTell me, which manufacture that advocates burn-in has provided evidence of it - since they say it exists it should be easily measurable on their devices right?\n\n&gt; It's not a phenomenon that should be ignored\n\nSo you treat every supernatural anecdote with a high level of credence as well?  I mean a lot of people have claimed to see ghosts, so surely you must pay the same degree of plausibility to that right?\n\n&gt; especially when given to people new to the hobby who may not know something like this exists.\n\nFalse premise, you're now arguing it exists without evidence.\n\n&gt; Here is a video of Tyll from InnerFidelity doing an experiment regarding audible differences from burn-in, as an example. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jxdOEpiCTs[1] \n\nRead the article as it's infinitely more informative, and also gives you a better idea of where likely differences actually occur (such as earpad wear).\n\nThis is from the article:\n\n\"Summary Did I show break-in exists? No. There are too many variables still. Was it simply movement? I don't know. If I did it again to another brand new pair would I get the same results? I don't know. If I did it to an already broken in pair would I get the same results? I don't know.\"\n\n\nYou can keep working on burn-in as a hypothesis, but to instruct or suggest people \"break-in\" exists based on no more evidence than UFOs is at best naive and at worst disingenuous/dishonest.  \"Have you tried breaking/burning in your headphones\" is a phrase I seen thrown around on occasion and it inherently implies it exists.  It would be one thing to discuss the hypothesis and research of whether it is real or not, but that's not the case here.\n\nEDIT:\n\nFunny how those that whine, bitch, and moan about downvoting due to such \"knowledgeable advice\" they offer turn around and do the same thing.

{"body": "This happened a long, long time ago (7 months ago). My wife and I had fairly large house in a decent neighbourhood. We were good friends with the family that lived a few doors down from us, until the wife/mother died of cancer. The father/husband was sent into a massive depression, he couldn't even look after the kids because they reminded him too much of his wife, so the kids were staying with their grandparents for a while. \n\nHe started to get better after 3 or 4 months, he started coming over more often, and my wife and I became very close with him. He'd come over every other day for a quick chat and a coffee. I kinda started to notice my wife getting a little bit more friendly than I would have liked (hugging him for a bit too long when she answered the door, even some subtle flirting, that sort of stuff), but I told myself I was being stupid. This guy was almost like family to us, and I trusted him. I was sure nothing would happen.\n\nOk, now here's where it gets interesting. I work for a large security company that's about a 20 minute drive from our house. Because of this, I usually spent my lunch break at a restaurant with a couple friends from work as opposed to having lunch at home. On our fifth anniversary, I decided to surprise her by coming home early from work with flowers, chocolates, a teddy bear, and this sappy letter I wrote. I asked my boss if I could leave 20 minutes early so my wife and I could have lunch together. My boss is a pretty cool guy, so he agreed after I explained it was our anniversary. \n\nI left early and picked up the flowers and teddy bear (I'd already bought the chocolates that morning, I decided on buying the other stuff later) and drove to our place. I bought this cheap basket to put everything in, so I piled everything in the basket with the letter on top and went inside. \n\nI immediately knew something was up. \n\nMy wife usually calls out to me when I come through the door (Big, heavy door. When it's opened or closed you can hear it through the whole house). I saw her car in the driveway, so I knew she had to be home. When I looked down to take my shoes off, I noticed a large pair of boots. I never specifically noticed my neighbour's shoes before, but seeing the boots triggered a faint memory of it. I tried to listen out, so see if I could hear them chatting. I couldn't hear any voices, but that's when I noticed the *bump bump bump* coming from upstairs. I knew the sound of that fucking bedframe hitting the wall anywhere. I put 2 and 2 together and just stood there. I hadn't even moved since I walked in the door. I didn't cry, I didn't scream, I didn't even blink. I don't know why, but I guess when I'm just overloaded with sadness or shock, I just shut down. \n\nI couldn't even attempt to try to put to words how shitty it felt. In the space of 5 seconds, the entire 16 years I spent with this woman, our plans to start a family, all the plans and changes I made for her, everything. Gone. Just gone.\n\nBut I'm the last guy to ever go down without a fight. If she was going to tear my heart out of my chest, then she was going to suffer with me. I put the basket on the table and got a couple rubbish bags from the kitchen. I went through the entire house, dumping all of her things, her decorations, her pictures, everything into this bag. We had a small bedroom, so we kept a lot of our clothes in this downstairs room. I went in and poured all her clothes into a separate bag. I got a marker from the study and sat down on the couch ans started writing and drawing on all the pictures. \"Slut\", \"fucking whore\", \"imagine what we could have had\", stuff like that. I tossed the pictures into the bag and quietly dragged them to the outside of our bedroom. \n\nI wish I had put earbuds in or blocked my ears or something. This woman that I had been with since university, that lost her virginity to me, that I was going to spend the rest of my life with... was talking shit about me. In between her moans and sharp breaths, she told our neighbour how much bigger his dick was, how he could last so much longer, how she wished they could do this everyday... \n\nI quickly grabbed the marker off the couch and a sheet of paper and wrote \"Happy anniversary, whore\" on it, grabbed a small piece of tape from the kitchen, and taped the sign to one of the bags. While I was there, I grabbed her car keys from the top of the fridge. It was once my old car, so it was technically mine. No way I was letting her have it.\n\nI walked back to to the bedroom door and got ready to run through and bring her world crashing down... when I had a thought. I could just forget everything. I could pretend I never saw or heard anything, and just go back to work and we could live like normal. I'd pretend I didn't know anything, and maybe we could make it work... but fuck that. She had already broken my heart, so I wasn't going to let her get away with it.\n\nI casually walked through the door. The foot of the bed is closest to the door, and my wife was getting fucked by this chubby piece of shit, pushing her against the wall. I walked to the chair on the corner and sat down. I took my wedding ring off and threw it at this fucker's head. If there's anything I wish I had a picture of, it would be my neighbour's face as he realised I was watching him fuck my wife. It almost made me laugh. He quickly got off the bed and tried to find his pants. My wife said \"Wha..?\" and turned around to see why her lover had stopped, when we made eye contact. I gave her the most shit-eating grin I could muster as she screamed. She started babbling about how she thought my neighbour was me, and she just mistook him or something? I couldn't even tell. I'm fairly sure she didn't even form a single proper word as she cried and tried to make up excuses at the same time. All I said was \"Happy anniversary, baby. You've got 5 minutes to get your cheating ass out of my house\". She realised she couldn't win, so she put her shirt and shorts on and walked out the door. When she saw the bags of her shit, complete with the sign I made, she started crying even harder. At this point, my fat ass neighbour still couldn't find his pants, and was wearing nothing expect his XXXL wife beater. \n\nMy wife walked back through into the room, and looked up into my eyes and said \"But... /u/Baydude98... how am I going to get to my parents' house?\" She must have figured out I wouldn't let her take the car. I shrugged and said \"Not my problem\". She sobbed a little more before asking \"Could you please give me a little bit of money for the bus fare..?\" I sighed and said \"Fine. How much is it?\" She took a deep breath and said \"About tree fiddy\". It was at this point that I realised my wife was in fact a 500 foot tall Loch Ness monster from the Paleolithic era. \"You ain't getting no tree fiddy!\" I yelled at her. I launched my harpoon at her and she roared in pain. I called to my pants-less neighbour \"Help me to conquer this beast!\" He quickly grabbed his own harpoon gun and launched the harpoon into her slimy, disgusting head. As she fell to the ground with a large thud, me and my neighbour high-fived and celebrated. It was at this point that we decided to become a duo, and for the past 7 months, my pants-less partner and I have travelled the world, in search of monsters to conquer.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393044274", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I know I'm late to the party, but I'm sure amazon's partnered carrier is UPS. If you have prime, it doesn't guarantee you the option of prime's free two day shipping. The product has to be \"fulfilled by Amazon\" to be eligible for prime users to get free two day shipping.  \n\nIf it is fulfilled by amazon, it isn't guaranteed to be sold by Amazon. Overall, third party sellers get the majority of orders on Amazon.  These third party sellers, who could be as small as a kid selling old baseball cards or as big as a company selling 10,000+ different products, can send their products into Amazon's warehouse to be \"fulfilled by amazon\". Of course they pay an agreed upon fee to Amazon for each and every product they sell that is shipped through amazon's warehouse.  \n\nThird party sellers can fulfill the orders themselves, but then have to pay a carrier of their choice to ship their packages.  In this regard, the kid selling old baseball cards is more flexible, allowing you to most likely come to an agreement on the carrier used.   The company selling 10,000 things is less flexible, as they probably have a contract with a carrier to lock in low shipping rates in return for their high volume, but they may be using the carrier you prefer and possibly free shipping.\n\nWhat should be taken from all this, is that you should always view all of your options when viewing a product on Amazon.  You can do this by clicking on the link below the product details that says, for example, \"14 new from $0.99\".  This means there are 14 different people attempting to sell you that product--the $0.99 part isn't guaranteed to be true as it does not take into account shipping charges (if there are any). By clicking the aforementioned link, you are able to see each seller along with their fulfillment method and various other stats like location and shipping times.  It will be clearly stated if the seller is eligible for prime shipping; not to mention you can contact them before placing an order.  You can even search specifically for orders that are about tree fiddy.\n\nPut simply, don't use the buy box on Amazon.

{"body": "A few years ago, I was moving to New York from Atlanta for my job. All my stuff had already been moved to New York to my new apartment, and I was flying out the day after so everything would already be set up. My friend had driven me to the MARTA station, because I never had a car and I needed to get to the airport somehow. \n\nAfter getting in the airport, I walked through everything in Hartsfield Jackson (like the food areas, etc.) without getting anything. I was very tempted to stop in a restaurant to grab some food, but I didn't have that much cash so I skipped it and decided I would wait for a couple bags of pretzels on the plane.\n\nI was very early to the airport because, well, I didn't want to be late. The flight was at 3:50, and it was about 2:00 at that point. I decided I would go back to the food area and mill around and just chat with people for a few minutes.\n\nI met some interesting people, and soon 10 minutes turned into 30. I checked my watch, saw that it was 2:30, and ran towards the security stop, barely saying goodbye to my new friends. At the security checkpoint, there was hardly a line. It was really strange. Anyways, as i went through it, a security agent stopped me. I thought I was going to miss my flight. The agent asked me what I was doing, where I was going, etc. Then she asked me if I could loan her some cash.I asked her why, then said I didn't have much cash. She said, \"I only need about tree fiddy.\" That was when i realized she wasn't a security guard at all, but a 7 story tall monster from prehistoric times! I said \"God damnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't about to give you no tree fiddy.\" Then Iran from the airport, never to see Nessie again.\n\nI also missed my flight, so that sucked.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393091459", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -9, "controversiality": 0}

I have a few stories that are similar to ones already posted, so I'll skip those and get to the most aggravating of my short career so far.\n\nCall comes in, I ask what the emergency is, and all the caller can say is \"I need help.\" I ask what kind of help - fire department? Police? Ambulance? \"Please, help\" is all I get. The caller sounds distressed so I get ready to dispatch even though I don't have any details. \"OK, I'm sending help,\" I say, as calmly as possible, \"Can you tell me more about what you need help with?\" No luck. \"Please, just help me\" the caller says. At this point I decide I can't take the risk, even if it turns out to be a prank call, so I dispatch EMTs and police. As per procedure, I try to keep the caller on the line. I ask if the address I have on my screen is correct. \"Please, help\" is all I get. I ask the caller's name. \"Please, help.\" I've pretty much decided this is either a prank or someone in serious distress, so I just try to use soothing tones while I attempt make conversation. \"Please, help me\" the caller keeps saying. Now, I'm not proud of this, but I feel myself starting to get impatient. I have no idea what this caller is going through, but it is very frustrating trying to help someone and not getting any information. I try one more time, and like I said, I'm not proud of this, but the impatience might have come through in my voice. \"What exactly do you need?\" Finally I get a more detailed answer: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" That's when I realize this isn't a person in an emergency situation, it's the god damn Loch Ness monster.\n\nI hung up.

{"body": "I was the one calling in, but here we go.\n\nIt was after my first relationship had ended spectacularly badly, and I just wanted to overwrite my memories of my ex with the dirty talk of someone I knew from the start didn't care about me. So I called up and this young woman-sounding voice answered, seductively going 'Hi there'. She asks what I like, and I tell her I like a little bit of wrestling for control. She says that's perfect, she loves that too. She can probably sense that I haven't done this before, or she's just used to guiding the conversation. She teases me, and she drags it out a bit. I almost feel like I recognize her voice, but I ignore it. I'm obviously just imagining it, since everybody in Eastern Scotland have similar accents.\n\nShe tells me she needs this, it's been so long. She is assertive. And she's in charge of the conversation. After a while I just go along with her. I can't shake the feeling that her voice is familiar to me, so I just go along, imagining it's someone I know from my classes. Maybe that blonde girl, or that tall brunette. Imagining them pinning me down, in charge. And I'm enjoying myself.\n\nBut she keeps bringing up how much she needs this, and it's breaking immersion for me. I ask her what *she* likes. She falters for a second, then says she is loving what we're doing right now, likes fighting for dominance. So what else do you like, I ask. A few seconds of silence. Then she tells me she wants to do it in water. Like maybe the sea, or a nice lake. Alright I think, I can go along with this. So she tells me how she would like to wrestle me out of my clothes, and how she'll carry me in the water. Bit strange, I thought, but ok. Maybe she's a big girl. Nothing wrong with that. It's not the tall brunette's voice, but I'm imagining her face anyway.\n\nAnd so it goes on. She tells me she really needs this. I feel myself coming out of it again, annoyed. What is it you need, I ask. It's like she's said this every damn minute of the conversation.\n\n'I need my tree fiddy', she says. And that's when I realize. She *has* been saying it once a minute.

From there to Japan and then Hong Kong, Thailand. \n\nI won't go to Cornwall in winter again. Loved Scotland so much. We drove into the highlands and I just gasped and said 'Im home.' And then wondered what that was about never been there b4. Urqart and Stirling castle were fascinating. \n\nSpain was just a 3 day stay - but 10 mins out of the airport a 10 year old was trying to pick pocket me. Luckily for me it was all packed in so tight I could feel him tugging so lost nothing. My friend just wanted to check out the art gallery (not my cup of tea) but didn't want to check out the ruins as she was sick that day. I have heard Barcelona is a nicer place to visit but we were in Madrid. Everyone was smoking everywhere. That was a bit of culture shock. \n\nThe US was fun. Loved Broadway. Chicago was freezing. I never knew you could get itchy from the cold - and that nostrils and eyeballs freeze until then. The natural history museum was awesome though. But Seattle was my love. The science fiction museum right near the space needle. I could have spent hours in there. LA was great. Had friends who worked at Disneyland and Universal. Hello free tickets!\n\nI've lived in Japan and loved it. I always tell people to go to Nikko and check out Edomura (Edo wonderland). A ninja village. The shows they put on are amazing. There's also an abandoned theme park near there too. \n\nHong Kong I let my friend book the accommodation. She put us in Kowloon - wouldn't recommend it as there seems to be a lot of pollution. She got so sick from 2 nights there it took her a week to recover. But Pizza Hut being a 5 star restaurant surprised me. (After our first hole in the wall attempted I wanted to go western). \n\nThailand was the wrap up where we were meant to sit on the beach. We were about 400meters from it. Never got there. Instead we pretty much stayed in the hotel room while she coughed her guts up. Never got to ride an elephant either. \n\nBut I did love the night markets in both Hong  Kong and Thailand. \n\nI'd do it all again. Next year I'm meeting up with a Brit, a Dane and an American. Sounds like the start of a joke. We're doing England, Wales, Scotland and then Denmark, Norway, Sweden. \n\nOverall though I think my favourite place was standing in the ruins of a castle looking out at the loch looking for Nessie. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393119267", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "If you've been talking on Skype, odds are you're going to know as much as you possibly can without actually being there. \n\nThat said, you have to be pretty self-aware, and pay attention to your little alarm bells. I'm not saying alarm bells like the kind that signal there's a fire, I'm saying alarm bells like the kind that signal that maybe there really *is* something wrong with the way she talks about her ex boyfriend, because no failing relationship is entirely one-sided, which might maybe indicate she's a bit blind to her own flaws, but it's not a deal breaker... \n\nYou probably know them. That slightly, \"Wait, what?\" feeling that you suppress or ignore or forget about because she did that cute thing with her eyebrows and you're smitten. \n\nBut those things happen in every relationship. Maybe it's not the way she talks about her ex. Maybe it's a slight indication that her attitude towards doing the dishes is a lot more lax than yours, or that she spends money without thinking of the consequences, while you're more careful... Or vice versa. \n\nGenerally, if you're not noticing *any* disparity, odds are you're still infatuated in the honeymoon stage. Which is great, enjoy it, by all means, but know that most healthy relationships are going to have some *slight* conflict here and there. \n\nI say this after having had a... discussion... with my S.O. yesterday about his tendency to suppress his needs and wants and my tendency to be utterly oblivious to what's going on when I'm focused on something, like writing an excellent post on reddit. \n\n*Cough*\n\nNow, looking back, I can see where I missed some of those signals back when we got together, not that it's anything other than some slight personality quirks that were gotten from our respective kinda shitty childhoods (he learned not to make waves, I learned to ignore the world to save my sanity) but they do cause some clashes, and we do have to put some effort into adapting and changing our habits (and the way we deal with it when the other is displaying those habits)... And it's really not a big deal, because we love each other, and we want to make it work, and we're actually pretty functional adults in that way. \n\nHonestly, the only thing that concerns me here is your stating that your girlfriend is basically perfect and then proceeding to detail that  you and she collectively have a depressive and paranoid outlook, which, to *me*, would indicate that maybe, just maybe, your unconscious descriptors of both of you would indicate that *not only* is she *not* in fact, *perfect*.... That is probably where most of the true tensions and stressors that you will face as a couple will originate. \n\nSo, you want to know what kind of problems you might have in person? Well, you're both depressive and paranoid, sounds like self-esteem and all the problems that can arise for people and relationships without having it could be something to watch out for.  \n\nBut. If you're talking on Skype, you like each other, and you like each other's personalities, odds are you're going to be okay. Maybe the relationship will last and you'll get married and move to each other (I might be biased in the practical order of these things) and have kids... Or maybe you'll date for a while, and ultimately decide that you're not as compatible as you thought, and it's not worth it.. Or maybe it'll turn out she's the Loch Ness Monster, and she needs about three fifty. \n\nSometimes, the power of Satan compels me.

{"body": "I think it's 2014 this year. That's what my bus ticket says and computers are apparently pretty reliable these days. I don't remember what year it was when they got to me, or where I was, but I know that I was 28 at the time. I guess I have vampire Alzheimer's. Things have changed a lot since then, but I'm too old to notice most of it. \n\nOnly being able to come out at night really makes it difficult to get things done these days. It's the worst in the summer when the damn Sun decides to hang around all day long. Really puts a damper on your ability to make friends and have a family. Not very many people are night owls. Oh well. \n\nFeeling a bit nervous right now. The bus was a bit late. It was supposed to leave at 10PM and arrive at 4AM but there was a delay. Flat tire or something. It's 6:12 now and my weather app is telling me that the sun will rise at 7:18. We're almost there but if the bus decides to stall or somethin', I'm probably going to die. We're in the middle of nowhere. No shelter. Well, maybe I could hide in the little bathroom stall in the back of the bus but I'd probably get dragged out after a few hours by the driver. See, the movies lie to you about being a vampire. I don't get superpowers or any of that shit. I live for a long time, and get burned bad by sunlight. That's about it. I can't transform into a swarm of bats and I definitely don't have super strength; disappointing, I know. Oh! And no, we don't need to prey on people to survive. The logistics of that don't even make sense, think about it. If we sucked people's blood to survive, and in the process, turned them into vampires, the human population would have been exterminated in a matter of decades. No, I got bit by a dog, and once in a while I need to go to a blood bank because I don't produce enough hemoglobin. Not very exciting, I know. Sorry.  \n\nWhy am I on this bus in the first place? Made a friend online. Met her on a gaming forum. Messaged each other for a bit and then started Skyping and calling. She's a night owl too. I haven't told her I'm a vampire yet but I have suspicions that she's holding back the same secret. She's a bit pale, she seems to be old fashioned, it just kind of makes sense. What time is it? \n\nIt's 6:41. Time really flies when I'm thinking. Or maybe my ancient brain has just slowed down. We're in the city. Any moment now. I told her that I'm sensitive to sunlight and she told me she'd cover the windows with construction paper. I hope she didn't forget. Timing seems crucial now. \n\nThe bus just stopped. 6:48. Almost out of time. \"Excuse me! I'm in a hurry!\" I yell to the driver. I grab my backpack and get off first, thanking the driver as I walk by. Is she standing in the parking lot? No. Is she in one of the cars? No. 7:02. Where the fuck is she? \n\nI walk into the station. She's sleeping in a chair. Thank god. I wake her up, say hello, and apologize. We have to get going. It's 7:10 now. She seemed scared too. She dozed off and we ran to the car. Paper covering the windows. Good. She remembered. We drive. My skin begins to tingle. \"We're almost there!\" She yells. Skin is starting to burn. 7:19. She seems to panic as well. She definitely is a vampire. \n\nWe run inside. Her windows are covered with cardboard. We both apologize. I tell her I'm a vampire too. She doesn't seem surprised. Told me she figured it out when she saw my windows in the Skype window. Well, she understands. That's a relief. I ask her how old she is, she tells me she's around 240. She used to keep a journal as a child and used it to estimate. \n\nTurns out she got bit by a dog too. Her dad heard her screaming and bashed its head in with a rock. I wonder if it was the same dog. She doesn't remember much from back then, either. I guess the brain has limited memory after all. We kept talking. She seems to be a nice person. \n\n10:39 PM. Wow, time really flies. It's dark outside again. She wants to show me around town. We tear the construction paper off the windows of her car and start going. Something strikes me as oddly familiar about the place as I look out the window, but I can't quite put my finger on it. \n\n\"This is our Wal-Mart, and here is the bank.

This one is somehow still standing after a hurricane, half a dozen typhoons, and a small earthquake.\" \n\n\"Amazing.\" I said. The feeling was irresistible now. Why did this feel so familiar? She interrupted me. \"I need something from you.\" \n\n\"What?\" I replied, still mesmerized by the building. \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393192219", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My family doesn't enforce this rule because they feel like it makes people feel awkward, but my friends family does. The one time I went over to his house, we were about 16 so we just sat downstairs playing video games, smoking pot and drinking his dads beer (remember his families rule). I was staying the night on his hidabed and he was crashing on his couch. \n\nWe were hanging out getting fucked up and playing video games, a general good time for a couple of 16 year olds I guess. Then I got a text from my other friend who was in town and asked us if we wanted to hang out. It was around 11:00pm past legal curfew for us but we didn't care. My friend was worried about his parents noticing us leaving I said just to sneak out the window. He said as long as we're back in a couple of hours they won't notice we were gone. So we grabbed our pot, beer and climbed out the window.\n\nHe lived in a nice suburb and our friend was hanging out downtown so it was a 20 minute walk away. The 2 hour interval was a gap and I can't remember what happened, but by the time we realised where we were it was 1:00am and we had been loaded into a police car for being past curfew, underage intoxication, and possession of pot, he drove us back to my friends house and his parents were shocked.\n\nThe cop sat us down and talked to his parents in the next room. We were hungry since we missed dinner, and we could smell the food his mom had made, it smelled like a seafood buffet. I liked fish and such so I was starving. It was all on a table in the same room as his parents and the policeman. I looked at my friend and said I was going to get food, he said go for it but don't get caught. I tip toed across the room into the next. And I saw it, a vast sea of marine food, my mouth was watering and as I reached for a calm when I froze. I stopped and knew the cop was right behind me. Then I heard something I'll never forget. He leaned over and whispered into my ear \"I need about Tree Fiddy\".

{"body": "It's quite simple really. I had a similar purchase a few years ago. I was a complete novice at the time and really hadn't found this subreddit or any of the websites I now read compulsively. But I went to my bank and laid out all the information I had.  The banker was really helpful because it was a slow day, so he had pretty much an empty bank and almost no customers except the occasional old woman. \n\nAnyway, I showed my credit reports, the floorplan / layout, and all the non-appraisal website shits which I later learned were meaningless and not at all valid (thanks a lot, zillow). He said he needed one more thing from me, and so I showed him my paystubs, cashflow, and proof of minimal debt.  (4k a month post-tax, just a car loan)  We worked a little more on the numbers, and he seemed a bit dubious that I could pull off the payments. He suggested I downsize a bit, but I really wasn't into it. \n\nHe said he was gonna need one more thing from me, so I showed him my brokerage accounts ($80k), thinking that would gain me some credibility. He suggested if I put a larger downpayment, considering the large pool of assets I had, they'd feel more comfortable, but I really didn't want to go that route. I really didn't wanna put down more than the value of my brokerage account...  so I tried to show him my grandmother was on life support and I'd most likely get a sizeable inheritance within a year or so. But this didn't really help at all either. He said I could try once she died. (Ok, he didn't *say* it, but he implied it as tactfully as possible)\n\nHe said he was going to need one more thing from me, and that was when I decided to really look around the bank. It seemed normal enough, a few customers coming in and getting withdrawals, someone refinancing just one more time over at the other desk, and a teller asking an old woman for one more signature. And then I looked at my banker, who was really just asking for me to leave him my number and he'd get back to me as soon as he could with the suggested downpayment and interest rate I could expect. \n\nI didn't want to leave, so I asked him just one more question. \"There's something I need from YOU,\" I said. \"The house is 500k... I think... I think if I put $150k down, you'll find that the payments make sense. That's 30%.\"\n\nHe stopped for a minute.  \"It could work...\" he said. \"So what do you need from me?\" he asked. \n\n\"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\" I said. \n\nIt was about this time that the banker realized I was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

I'm not lesbian\" and she said \"it's fine, just two roommates taking a shower, whats the worst that can happen?\"\n\nI jump in and continue to wash my face as she takes a shower. Her body was amazing! I kept staring and she obviously saw me staring once or twice because she says, \"can you help me wash my back?\" I say, \"Sure! Turn around.\" As I'm washing her back, she says \"wow, your hands feel amazing.. you should give me a massage.\" So I gladly start massaging her shoulders and she moans a little and puts her hands on mine.\n\nI'm starting to get a little turned on at that point so I stop and say \"this seems to be going a little far..\" She says, \"no! don't it feels so good.\" She then proceeds to turn around and give me the most amazing stare I've ever seen. Her green eyes hypnotizing me to keep touching her. She takes my hands in hers and puts them on her shoulders, still facing me, then starts sliding my hands down to her perky breasts. I can feel my face get flustered and she noticed as well, because she said, \"don't worry. I could tell you've been staring at me for a while.. Just relax.\"\n\nI start massaging her breasts as she puts her hands on mine. Her hand begins to go down towards my pussy, and I'm not going to lie, I could've stopped her, but I wanted to see where this was going.\n\nShe then slowly pushed one of her fingers into my tight pussy as I gasped slightly and said \"wow.. your hands are so warm...\" she says, \"mhm..\" and puts another in, slowly, and mechanically as she goes deeper and deeper. I could barely contain myself, so I figure, I'm not going to be the only one who suffers.\n\nI slide my hand down and start fingering her, slowly at first, then faster and faster. The faster I go, the faster she goes. I'm trying to make her cum before I do, but it doesn't work. Her hands are just too amazing. I freeze up and she continues at her speed as I start rocking back and forth, having my moans get louder and become almost deafening. She bites my neck and whispers in my ear, \"I want you to cum for me..\" I completely lost all control then and there and with a shaky \"o-o-h-h g-g-g-od-d-d!!\" I came harder than I have ever cum before. My legs buckled under the immense pleasure I was in and I fell into her as she kept fingering me and making me cum all over her hand..\n\nShe then stood me up and licked all of my juices off her fingers, then said, \"my turn\" and gave me a cute, yet sexy wink. I got on my knees and started eating her out. Her pussy tasted like heaven. Since she was already very turned on by then, it didn't take long for her to cum.\n\nShe started bucking into my face and moaning louder and louder as she gripped my hair and shoved my face into her and said \"oh god don't stop, don't stop, don't stop! I'm cumming!!\"\n\nafter she had finished, I stood up and kissed her and said, \"well, that was fun.\" Her out-of-breath reply will be something I'll never forget.\n\n\"Yes, getoutofme.

{"body": "Former pizza delivery guy here.\n\nDelivered a pizza to a residence slightly outside our delivery area.\n\nKnocked on the door. I heard \"dahr's open, c'moun eiin\" /southern\n\nLet myself in. Man is sitting on the couch. Buck ass naked. Pounding his dick with his hands. Dude had a horsecock.\n\nLady comes out from the kitchen area. Also buck ass naked. Delightfully formed assed. Gorgeous tits hanging out. Massive strapon dildo attached. \n\nBoth of them stopped dead in their tracks as they locked eyes with me. It was a small thing. The sudden awareness of something being wrong in the force.\n\nThe lady chuckled and turned a little red.\n\n\"You aren't our usual pizza guy.\"\n\nHe chuckled and covered himself up with a towel.\n\n\"Naw, this is a might embarassin'.\"\n\nAnother couple of seconds passed by as I fought to take a breath in the realization of why the other guy always took so long on this particular run. \n\n\"Uh... Pizza will be uh.. $26.72.\"\n\nThey laughed.\n\nI began to laugh after a few more seconds as the tension released. The lady started walking towards me with her huge dong just swaying back and forth. I couldn't help it. My eyes were absolutely locked on her tits the entire time. She knew it, and she smiled as she reached into her purse and pulled out her girl-wallet (whatever those things are called).\n\nShe handed me $40. Said \"The tip there is for your embarrassment.\"\n\nShe handed me another $50. Said \"This is an apology for your embarrassment.\"\n\nShe pulled out ten $100 bills and said, \"This is if you let us into that tight body of yours.\"\n\nI was a stuttering little bitch. It was anywhere between \"but but but\" to \"i dont... what... I don't know.\"\n\nShe took the pizza and put it down. She bent down and gave me full view of all of her goods in the process. She turned back around and opened her tiny-purse thing back up and pulled out more hundreds. \n\nShe walked right up to me, opened my pants, and dropped several hundreds in. She looked down and smiled. I was harder than stone. And she noticed my underwear. I was wearing a thong. She shared her findings with her husband (I assume that to be the case) and he just smiled. \n\n\"E'll be back t'naht.\"\n\n\"I'm broke. Double.\" I said. My heart was pounding with adrenaline. I had no idea why the fuck that came out of my mouth. My dick had at least three hundred dollars next to it already. I'd made $360 from this one run thus far.\n\nShe looked at me and smirked. \"I'll give you the thousand now, and double again later if you get naked and suck my husbands cock right now. Triple if you swallow.\"\n\nI did. I forced that thing down my throat so hard I cried. I left with $1360 in my pocket twenty minutes later. I went back after work and did it again. I let them both fuck me. I let them spit roast me. And I made an arrangement with them to quit my job entirely, keep my uniform, and come \"deliver pizza\" once a week. The price would be $2000/week. Double if they had friends over. \n\nThese two were high society or perhaps lotto winners. Their house was in a neighborhood with $1.2-2.5mil homes.\n\nOne delivery. $4360. \n\nIt delivered so hard that I never had to deliver pizzas again. Except for one a week. This went on for a little over eight months. I made a little under $100k in that time. \n\nApparently word got out that they had a new Pizza Slut. I wore a mask so my identity would be protected. I fucked/was fucked by people that I knew, including several people who \"hated gays.\"\n\nThing is. I'm straight. I just took an opportunity to pull myself out of poverty. It helped that back in those days I had a deliciously well constructed body. Sometimes I still wish I had that body. I loved the attention, and the pleasure was blissful.\n\nMarried with two kids now.\n\nShe doesn't know. Nor will she ever. I still have a large chunk of that cash sitting in a safe, because I was smart about it and didn't walk out and spend it all in huge chunks.\n\nThere were multiple times over the next few years that they called me back for 'old times sake' and had their way with me and paid me handsomely. \n\nSorry, no videos or pics for proof that I am aware of. This was in a time before reliable smartphone camera technology. If memory serves, 8mm camcorders were the high tech back then.\n\n\nedit:\n\nReason for thong: I don't like my balls touching my legs. I like the feel of soft cloth between the cheeks.\n\nFor the sake of Karma, I should have made this on my main account. Good lord. Oh well. Better than telling the world who I am while I'm at it. :D\n\nNo $3.50 here. Sorry nessie.\n\nSorry, not taking a picture of my open safe. This is Reddit.

{"body": "I would like Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag, here's why...\nwhen Black Flag first came out I was in 8th grade and my cousin was a senior in High School.\nDuring a family reunion I went into his room and he was playing the Playstation 3, he was a bit of a loner, even in the family so I knew he wouldn't talk to me. I looked over to see what game he was playing. It was a game I'd never really seen before.. was it in the call of duty series? Medal of honor? Maybe a new series? He never said a word to me, but he played the game for 5 hours,all with me watching him play it.\n\n\nI finally got the nerve to speak up, \"What game are you playing\" I asked, as he was ejecting the disk from the PS3. He said nothing. He simply put the game in its case and handed me the case.\nAssassins Creed 4. \n\n\nAs I was looking at the game my parents called to say that we were going home, as I was exiting his room he said, \"I play that game all day, it's a pretty new game, if you want to come over and watch me play again you can.\"\nAnd so began our tradition of me going to his house to watch him play Black Flag\nThis continued for months. Me and him because sort of the best of friends even though our age difference, every family get-together we'd rush to his room and play Assassins Creed for endless hours. We beat the game several times in those months.\n\n\nOne day I went to his house and knocked on his door. His mom answered the door crying her eyes out, I was shocked because I'd never ever seen her so sad, I'd never even seen her cry.\nI asked what was wrong and she said that my cousin couldn't play today. Disappointed I walked home, wondering what would have made her cry.\nLater that evening I found out. My cousin had been with a group of friends who had been drinking. They had tried to drive home and ended up driving into a ditch. The driver was killed, my cousin was in the passenger seat and he was in the hospital, the girl in the back was paralyzed and also in the hospital.\n\n\nThe next day I went to the hospital, crying my eyes out because I genuinely cared for my cousin now, and not just for Assassins Creed. That game really made us connect though. The doctors said that my cousin was not expected to live, internal damage had been far too bad.\nAs my cousin lay dying on the hospital bed, he motioned me to come over. He said, \"I need you to promise me something if I die.\" Tears streaming down my eyes I said, \"I will promise anything.\" he told me, \"I want you to go down to the store and buy yourself a copy of Black Flag, beat that game multiple times over for me, just like we did back at my house.\" I nodded and promised him I would. I started to walk out of the room when he said, \"Wait, I need something else.\" \"What do you need?\" I asked. \"I need about Tree Fiddy\" It was around this time I realized that my cousin was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned loch ness monster had gotten me again! I said, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy\"\n\n\nBut in the end, I never did get around to buying that Assassins Creed game. I would really appreciate if you bought it for me.\nThis is why I would like Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag\n\ntl;dr: Eh... you'll just have to read it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393347163", "subreddit": "RandomActsOfGaming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Can you give me a TL;Dr on this article? I skimmed it and it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that at one point hypnosis was considered paranormal and now fits within our understanding of how the brain works. I'm not sure what you think I'm claiming about hypnosis, all I said was now we consider it real now and we didn't before. You don't even have to go back very far to find people claiming hypnosis is either supernatural or not real at all. \n\n&gt;Paranormal is, by definition, things that are inconsistent with our world as seen through empirical observation and the scientific method. \n\nSo when you say \"It's[the paranormal] been shown to be entirely not real\" you are claiming to have a complete understanding of the universe? \n\n&gt;We now know that paranoid schizophrenia is not due to mythological creatures. It's suddenly science when we have disproved possession by evil creatures and instead figured out the genetic and environmental basis of that behavior. \n\nRight. All we did was change the words to describe a single phenomena, but the phenomena itself is the same. The only thing that changed was our perception of it- which is really my whole point. Calling something \"paranormal\" is poison to real scientific inquiry. Especially when people make blanket statements claiming that all of 'it' has been proven to be false and think that is the end of the conversation. Not to mention that when you say \"the paranormal\" you talking about everything from the Loch Ness monster to psychedelic drug research, ESP, meditation, advertising theory(sorcery), the Fatima apparition, products you can buy a Whole Foods, UFO phenomenon, the most advanced science of 1000 BCE Mesopotamia(astrology), repressed memories, divination, the work of Edgar Cayce, sleep paralysis, the prophecies of Nostradamus, childhood sexuality, theories about how the pyramids were constructed, necromancy, animal communication, near death experiences, Yoga and countless other wide ranging topics depending on what time frame you are talking about. \n\nIn other words the fact that we can't prove the Loch Ness monster is real isn't proof that we shouldn't be doing research on near death experiences. The fact that people speak about them like they are in the same category is fucking insane anti-scientific metaphysical jaberwocky. \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393392672", "subreddit": "intj", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not a hotspot worker but :\n\nI was a groomsman for my friend’s wedding years ago. I had only come back into town the night before after a business trip, so I had not met anyone else in the party. My partner for the wedding, let's call her Stephanie, a curly-haired, light brunette. At the practice dinner we were seated together and we started up conversation. Through conversation, I found out she went to high school with me and was a year younger. She was in choir and acting club and she told me that those activities helped her to come out of her shell in college. She told me about how she was in West Side Story my senior year.\n“Hey,” I remarked, “I played piano for that!”\n“I know,” she stated, smiling and winking at me.\n“You do?” I asked quizzically.\n“Of course! Everyone knew who you were at the school!” She stated, smiling and sipping on her straw.\nI was stunned. I didn’t know who she was. I only played piano to get gas money. I was far more interested in my girlfriend at the time to notice anyone else. (We were having sex all the time.) I had played some football (and was still in good shape, 5'10\" 180lbs with muscular calves, thighs and butt) but I was really known more for my brains that anything. Still, I was surprised she knew who I was.\n“Really, I was and still am a geek!” I laughed back at her.\n“Geek, shmeek! You were hella cute!” She winked back.\nAs we talked more, I could tell we were clicking. She didn’t look hot at all at the dinner. She wore baggy clothes, her hair put up. But she was cute, if not attractive, but not smokin in any sense. But her personality was…well, electric. Usually, I am the one to start up conversation and make others smile and laugh but this woman was funny, smart, etc. The best thing was, she sincerely that way, not fake, in a Hollywood sense. We ended up flirting and talking all night. But then the party ended and it was late and we had to both be up early.\nAt the wedding, we got lined up side by side, and I was in for a shock. The bridesmaids were all in silver dresses of the same material. Each one could decide her style. The MOH choose a long strapless, but Stephanie chose a backless fitting cocktail dress. She lined up next to me and a turned to say hello. All I got out was “Oh My GOD!”\nShe giggled and slapped me on the shoulder. “That was the effect I wanted!” She chuckled.\nI turned back facing forward, my eyes wide open and just shook my head. I think my mouth was still open. The makeup really accented her great brown eyes, her hair was up is a sexy, messy bob, and the dress on her was incredible. It showed off her figure. Her body was a perfect hourglass, probably close to 36-24-36. She had B/C sized breasts and a formed butt which the dress covered by about 4-6 inches. The heels made her about 5’8”, a few inches shorter than me in dress shoes. She had tan lines on her naked back, which I noticed after leaning back to check it out, which made her giggle some more and slap me again.\nAnyways, after the wedding was the photos and reception. The photos sucked because it was hot as hell outside and the groomsmen were dressed in navy blue tuxes. The reception started poorly. I was seated next to Steph and Elise, a common friend of the bride and Steph. The two girls were chatting across me and I did not really have a chance to talk to Steph more. After the toasts and cake, the dancing started, and I asked Steph to dance.\nShe answered “Not right now. I have to dance with the girls. But don’t worry, I want to dance with you. I will come get you when I hear a song I want to dance with you to.”\nAbout 15 minutes passed when the music changed to some sultry, sexy, salsa. I was sitting at the table drinking coffee when Steph grabbed my hand, pulled me to the dance floor and said, “Come on, this is more our speed.”\nOn the floor, she turned her back to me and started grinding against me. She leaned back; her eyes closed, threw her arms back and around my neck, and smiled. She was seducing me, and I enjoyed every second of it. She dipped low and when she came up she intentionally pushed her ass back into my crotch. I was stunned, and immediately started to get a hard-on. She turned around and continued to dance close, letting her thigh hit my cock. She stopped dancing, looked up at me, slightly biting her lip, smiled, giggled, put her hands above her head and started dancing again. I was at her mercy, but I knew what she wanted was to seduce me. I pulled her ear to my lips and I whispered, “I don’t know how much I can handle.” What I said drove her crazy. Her eyes lit up, her mouth opened and smiled.\n“I want to find out how much you CAN handle, and how much of YOU, I can handle.” She took my hand and led me off the dance floor.\nThe place where this wedding reception was held, was a hotel with banquet rooms at opposite ends. The far banquet room was not being used, and therefore no one was using the bathrooms that far away. We got to the far women’s bathroom and Steph opened the door, bent over to check the stalls and yanked me in.\n“You have no idea, how bad…” she pulled me in and immediately kissed me passionately. She began to suck on my tongue and grabbed my ass. I was about to pull off her dress then she pushed me against the bathroom door, spun me around, pulled my jacket down by my elbows, spun me back to face her, and then pinned me against the door again, kissing me passionately, my hands bound by my jacket behind my back.\nShe ripped open my shirt, pressed her lips against my chest and ran her face down my abs, her hands on my shoulders and then trailing down. She got to me crotch and grabbed my cock through my pants. She looked up at me, smiled and pressed her cheeks against my clothed cock. I moaned in delight for her.\nShe moaned an “oh” and immediately undid my belt and pants. She yanked off my pants and boxers in one motion. She stared at my cock, and moaned “oh, yes.” She pressed my cock against her face and moaned something I couldn't understand. I asked what she just said and then she repeated it \"there's one thing I need right now more than ever...\" I was ready to get going when she said \"...it's about three fiddy\", that's when I noticed she was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393403246", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 21, "controversiality": 1}

Since I was new to this workplace I really didn't have many friends there and didn't speak unless I had too, so I was not very familiar with these voices and couldn't recognise who was talking, but suddenly the conversation changed and they began to talk about me, at first these were just friendly remarks like \"who's the new coworker?\" And \" Reckon he seems like a nice guy?\". So, it seemed pretty innocent at first, but I was scared and didn't want to leave the cubicle in fear of them getting upset that I was eavesdropping on them, so after they talked for a bit longer about me. One of the guys said \"I reckon he's kinda cute\", so after a bit of teasing from the other coworkers he blurted out \" I wanna fuck him in the ass\". (Take note that this coworker is gay) As I am just sitting in this cubicle feeling more and more scared they all end up agreeing to let this one co worker fuck me in the ass, and I'm just putting it out there, I'm not gay, I have a girlfriend who is living with me. After a while of listening, I can't take it anymore so I try to leave the cubicle. I pull my pants up and walk out of the door, as I am washing my hands someone grabs me by the shoulders and slams me down on the toilet. Fearing for my life, I look up at my fellow coworkers and squeak meekly. The first one says \"I need someon thing from you mate, and you're not gonna like it\". So I reply back \"please don't fuck me in the ass\" very sacred. He then bursts out in laughter and says \"No! I'm just gonna need about tree fiddy\".

I has survived on fish and coconuts for as long as I could remember. It was nearly 5 months since I isolated myself from what was left of my family, there were new ways to make money and I couldn't sit back home and let them go to waste. The things I missed the most were my mothers cooking and surfing the internet.\n\nAn hour into the journey, I stopped at a water well to fill my camelbak. I heard distant scream, breaking the silence of the early morning. I turned on my LED hand-cranked torch and began to investigate. The scream originated from a temple whose bells were ringing violently. I saw a man a on the steps of the temple clutching his neck, shaking violently and repeatedly muttering \"Forgive me\" in tamil. I checked his pulse which was fading by the second. A minute later he lay motionless.  I wasn't fazed by the novelty of seeing someone die, I was used to it by now. I stole his wallet and pocketed his cigarettes. I'm an opportunist after all.\n\nI followed the trail of blood which led me inside the temple. A broken coconut lay at on the elevated platform. Strangely there was no idol inside, just an empty foot rock. I circled the temple whilst eating the coconut, trying to make sense of what just happened. I noticed a few light footprints on the sand, which most likely belonged to a dog. Ten minutes later, I gave up. Puzzled, I went back to the well, packed the camelbak on the side of my trek bag, buckled it to my shoulders and went on my way. \n\nThe moonlit roads were peaceful and I enjoyed the fresh coastal winds. My worries faded, the smell of fish and wet sand always lightened my mood. I did yearn the company of some good music to accompany my journey though. Maybe Singh uncle would lend me his spare iPod ?\n\nEven though I was enjoying my ride, something disturbed me. Something I could not quite place. Things felt different after departing from the Watering well. Something was odd. A shiver ran at the back of my neck and down my spine when I realised what was wrong ... it struck me. The trekking bag which I wore on my back was heavy, in spite of being almost empty !\n\nI stopped at the side of the road and swiftly emptied my belongings on the sand. Out fell a weird creature with a leathery pale white skin. Was this the dog ? It looked mouselike.\n\n I turned on my torch and noticed it had two red arthopodic eyes and something that looked like a tail. It was like a fusion of a mouse and the robot maid from the cartoon jetsons.My heart started beating faster, I frozen in fear. Clearly I was hallucinating. For some reason the creature looked oddly ... familiar. \n\nThe creature was dazed at the light of the torch and then stared at me. It then looked at its body and suddenly made a sound like it was trying to clear its throat.\n\n\"Well, this is a first.\" it spoke, in a piercing british accent.\n\n\"YOU, YOU TALK ?, WHAT ARE YOU ?\" I screamed. How could this even be possible ?\n\nIt stared at me and then gently spoke \n\n\"You seem like a commoner, nothing of value ... again\".\n\nI was lost and confused, the creature just stared at me. A second shiver ran down my body.\n\n\"DID YOU KILL THAT MAN ?\" I howled. I was frightened.\n\n\"STOP SCREAMING. Yes I killed him and I'll have to kill you too.\" it replied, sat on the sand, looking at its surroundings.\n\n\"WHY, WHAT DID I DO ? WHAT ARE YOU ? WHO ARE YOU ?\" I panicked. Adrenaline flowed through my veins, my intestines wanted to empty itself. \n\n\"Fine, I'm feeling generous today. Be quite and I'll let you play three questions before putting you out of your misery.\" it spoke in an almost bored voice, examining my belongings.\n\nMy mind raced, I kept thinking of ways to get out of this situation. After 5 minutes I realised I was at the mercy of this creature who just killed a man. \n\n\"Are you going to ask me anything ? There is no way out of this you know ?\" said the creature whilst picking things on the ground. It played with my knife after finding it ... my only real weapon.\n\nI had no choice. Might as well die doing what I did best. Taking opportunities. \n\n\"Did you send those politicians and countrymen to mars ?\" I questioned, trying to compose myself. Was this creature responsible ?\n\n\"Who told you the shuttle was going to mars ? WE, as in my brother and sisters sent our parents and some family back home. We killed your leaders and countrymen - Sorry about that. But don't worry other counties will follow soon.\" the creature said, taking a bite of my dried fish after poking it with my knife.\n\nI was shocked. There was more than one of its kind around the world and they killed everyone of importance in our country. I was almost helpless in this situation. I had to follow up with the only question that could get me out of this.\n\n\"Why are you invading earth ?\" Perhaps if I helped it with its mission I would be spared.\n\n\"We never invaded earth, we were here before you and we shall be here after you. We think of earth as our incubator and a playpen of sorts. By the way nice try, but there is no way you are getting out of this.\" the creature smiled, making it look even more familiar.\n\nI stared at the creature and made peace with myself. I was done for, there was no other way. I reflected back on my life for a bit and then asked the last question that would satisfy my curiosity. \n\n\"You look familiar, who are you ?\"\n\nThe creature smiled, its red eyes glowed. \"We don't have a form or a figure. My body adapts, clones, creates and blends. Sometimes to have fun but more importantly to get things done. I was the goddess Kali when I killed the man back at the temple. My father was the Loch Ness monster when he attacked the irish. My mother was Ravan when she was pregnant with my brothers and sisters. My sister was Hitler when she convinced people to kill others. My aunt the seductress was a super model when she killed your politicians with love.\"\n\nThe creature paused and stood up.\n\n\"We made ourselves gods and demons, Terrorists and Priests, Kings and Commoners ... We fight, we grow and while we are at it, we have fun. It seems my body decided to take the form of your addiction before killing you.\"\n\nThe creature put its hands behind its back, smiled at me with those piercing red eyes and raised its antenna.

Flowers is bitch shit for kids with oversized suits and shitty mustaches on their way to senior prom. Puppies are cool. \n\nAnyways I was brainstorming creative things to do when I came up with the perfect plan. It had to be executed with no mistakes for me to win this, to finally reach the pinnacle of my life; the king of KKG. \n\nI planned a party of astronomic proportions. I'm talking if Gatsby meets Charlie Sheen, meets Jordan Belfort, meets Helen Keller. You get the picture. This party ended up on the front page of TFM.\n\nNow see, this was around the time when Carly Rae Jepsen was still popular. And guess who I got to come to the party and perform? Carly goddamned Rae Jepsen.\n\nSo the party is happening and it's nuts. It's like when a 6th grader first discovers porn, it's an all out orgy. Then it's time for Carly Rae to come out. Her song starts playing and people see she's actually performing live and in person and everyone just goes ballistic. I haven't seen so many girls cry/gasp for air/break into a fit since the time they first lost their virginity. \n\nSo the party finishes and the next day, KKG is crowning their king.\n\nThe president comes out and is about to announce it and everyone knows it's gonna be me who wins. \n\nSo she slowly opens the envelope and says my name.

{"body": "**TL;DR: /r/gonewild sextortion.**\n\nI have told this story once before and was hesitant to do so. For those of you that have read my story before I'll ask that you refrain from replying to this comment so that others can give their opinion of me and my actions. Let my tale of lust serve as a cautionary tale to anyone who has ever thought about giving in to their primal urges...\n\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\n\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\n\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was. \n\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to /r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was *insanely* open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about. \n\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her /r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Protoerozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\" \n\n\nI understand how truly horrific this failed plot was and it is truly the worst thing I have never done. Not only did I walk away without any extortion money, I didn't get any new nudes from her which is what I was holding out for more than anything else. The only good thing about the failed sextortion deal is that she never contacted the FBI which works out perfectly for me because if she did, I wouldn't have been able to share this cautionary tale with all of you wannabe /r/gonewild gals out there. I was seriously bummed about not getting any more exclusive jerk-off material from this bodacious babe but c'est la vie no smoking hot gonewild noodz 4 me :( \n\nJust remember this, girls: If you're gonna get your tits out for the lads, don't show your face. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393472757", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1507, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A few years ago I went on a vacation to Disneyland in Anaheim, California with my family. I was 18 years old and a High School Senior and being a high school senior I was horny as fuck. 24/7/365. But I was on vacation for 4 days in California, so I didn't really think about sex as much as I did back at home, I was more focused on the rides and such.\n\nOn our 2nd day there I rode Splash Mountain and I got off the ride and saw the character Belle saying hello to little girls and whatnot, taking pictures, posing, et cetera.\n\nI usually wouldn't have noticed but the girl in the belle costume was hot as hell, a definite 10/10, I don't think I've ever seen a girl so beautiful in my life. All of the sudden all of my teenage hornyness came back to me, I got a raging boner, and being the meatheaded teenager I was, I decided to go over to her and try to flirt with her.\n\nI got over there and she looked me in the eyes, I have never once in my life seen eyes as beautiful as her's, they were a deep blue color, with a hint of green, and they enveloped me, absolutely enveloped me.\n\nI could barely talk, \"H-Hi\" I stammered to her as she broke eye contact, she said hi back awkwardly, in the kind of voice that translated roughly to \"Shit, another one, please go away\"\n\nI kind of recovered though and we had a great conversation, at the end of the conversation I could tell she was kind of digging me as, not to brag, I have a way with the ladies when it comes to words. I gathered up the courage to ask for her number, and much to my surprise she gave it to me.\n\nI said goodbye to me, and I looked at my watch.\n\nShit. I talked to her for two hours, those were definitely the fastest two hours of my life. So I went about my day lusting on her and going on the rides. (Which were awesome as fuck by the way)\n\n3rd day in Disneyland, I looked everywhere for her but couldn't find her. After the park closed, much to my dismay, I decided to call her number to see if maybe she was off work.\n\nNo answer.\n\nDamn it, I was convinced at this point she had given me a phony number.\n\nI woke up on the 4th day in my hotel, my last day in California. My family got up and we started to go to disneyland again for our final day, I didn't even want to bother looking for \"Belle\" (She never told me her real name). As we were walking out of the hotel I checked my phone for new text messages from friends or something.\n\nOne missed call. From her.\n\nNo words can describe how overjoyed and happy I felt at the moment when I realized that she had called back, I wasn't given a phony number, I called back.\n\nOne ring.\n\nTwo rings.\n\nThree.\n\nI almost hung up, figuring she was already at work when someone picked up .\n\n\"Hello?\" She said in her sweet voice. I talked to her and told her I was sorry I missed her call, I was asleep, she said that she had to work extra yesterday and she said she didn't get back until late.\nI asked her why I didn't see her at the park the previous day, she got shocked and said she thought I was a local, just there for the day, I told her I was in fact on vacation and that today was my last day.\n\n\"Oh.\" she said, she was obviously disappointed. Then she told me she had to go, and to come talk to her at the park that day.\n\nRight when I entered disneyland, I went straight over to the area I had seen her before, and sure enough she was there, taking pictures with little girls. I kind of stood a few feet away while she was taking pictures, when she was done she started to walk away and I said \"Hey\"\n\nShe turned around and saw me. She had the biggest smile on her face when she saw me. We again talked for around an hour, she brushed off any little girl who wanted to get their picture taken with her.\n\nRandomly, she told me to follow her.\nOk, that's cool with me. I thought.\n\nWe go to her staff room, she begins kissing me and whispers in my ear \"Fuck me, please\"\n\nWowowowow. That was the only thing going through my head at this point. We had amazing sex, she had the best body ever, prettiest face, and the tightest vagina I'd ever felt.\n\nWhen we were done she brushed my cheek with her hand and I asked her \"So... are you going to go back to work now?\"\n\n\"In a little bit,\" she replied, \"I need one more thing though.\"\n\n\"What do you need?\" I asked. She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was about this time that I realized Belle was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That goddamn Loch Ness Monster had got me again.\n\nI stood there screaming at her as she swam away into the distance.\n\nEver since then I've REALLY hated belle and disneyland in general.\n\ntl;dr: I fucking hate Disneyland now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393507165", "subreddit": "jerktalkdiamond", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Okay warning: **I'm a noob, sorry.**\n\n\nWe forgive you. :-)\n\n\n&gt;My overwhelming fear is that I'm going to blow money on something that won't cater to the style/niche I end up fitting into. So after searching for days and talking to some friends I figured that a cruiser would be best overall for campus but freeride really caught my attention. So basically what I want is a board that I can cruise on, do light freeriding (short slides, speed checks, maybe 180's), very light bombing (honestly DH isn't that important), and light freestyle (for navigating, commuting, getting past obstacles, and some ground tricks).\n\n\nSo many options. I mentioned some below.\n\n\n&gt;After doing a bunch of research, honestly what is the point in ever buying a cruiser if that is all you will ever be able to do with it? It seems like you can cruise with almost any other board (freeride, freestyle, DH) that isn't made specifically for cruising.\n\n\nYes get a freeride deck and setup with mild concave so you can cruise comfortably and stil dh/freeride.\n\n\n&gt;**So the question is, should I just get a freeride board that I will still be able to cruise on, maybe some light DH, and a little freestyle? Does such a board exist for an amateur?** I looked at the Rayne Fortune and thought that fit my description but probably a bit out of price range and honestly I probably don't need a bamboo/fiberglass core build that's going to cost 300+ for a complete (because I really don't know how to assemble a board and wouldn't know what width trucks to get, wheels, etc.).\n\n\nYes get a board that will work for everything. The fortune may not be a great pick because of its aggressive concave which makes pushing uncomfortable. Things to look for in an all around deck would be: mild concave, 1 or 2 kicktails, and a wheelbase between 23 and 26. A good deck to look at would be an omen sugar, madrid nessie, comet manifest, comet ethos, and the bustin bgdk, but there are many more options.\n\n\n&gt;Also, is it worth getting a more freeride based board if I've never done it and just want to learn?\n\n\nYes\n\n\n&gt;How much dedication does it take to learn and would I be required to invest in a good helmet, gloves, pads even if I was just doing light toe slides/180?\n\n\nDepends on how much you actually commit. If you go out and practice everyday you will know how to slide soon enough. It takes allot of falling on your ass, but in the end it is worth every scar.\n\n\n&gt;How important is it to get a symmetrical board for very light freeride?\n\n\nIts not a necessity but it definitely helps when riding switch. All of the boards I mentioned have a symetrical standing platform so they will feel the same if you were to ride the board backwards. \n\n\n&gt;Is it better to get multiple boards for each activity/style? Do people actually just have a board specifically for each? That seems really expensive...\n\n\nStart with just one complete. Gear adds up quickly. \n\n\n&gt;Do people change out their wheels from square or curved when they switch from freeride to cruising or freestyle?\n\n\nSometimes but its not necessary unless you are doing fast dh or freeride. For a great all around learning wheel that will be good for learning freeride would be any wheel with a round lip at about 70 mm\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393512962", "subreddit": "longboarding", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's not really getting stuck, but I once worked as an intern at the headquarters of a really big security/defense firm. One day around lunch time the main elevator was taking a long time to reach my floor so I took the elevator in an obscure side hall instead. I pushed the button for the lobby, but instead of going down 5 floors like normal the car continued to go down for a really long time. I think like a solid 5 minutes of just descending. When the doors finally opened there was a long, white, brightly-lit hallway with a single door at the very end of it. I could see small black security cameras all along the hallway. Against my better judgement I walked down the hallway and to the door. There was a keycard reader so I swiped my card and unsurprisingly it turned red to show that my access was denied.\n\nAs I turned around the door suddenly opened and I heard a female voice say \"Oh good you're here. This way please.\" I looked over my shoulder and saw a tall, blonde-haired woman dressed in deep necked, maroon blouse, black pencil skirt, high heels, and a lab coat. I followed her through the doors which led to another long hallway with numerous doors this time. Before I could explain anything she interrupted me saying something along the lines of \"The levels of communication traffic we've been having in the East Coast have been unusually high the last few weeks. We need you to filter out the normal traffic from the higher priority ones.\"\n\nAfter winding through a maze of corridors, we eventually we went into her office where I sat across from her as she leaned against her desk in front of me. \n\n\"By the way my name is Krista,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm bk7, but I don't th--\"\n\n\"You look pretty young for an analyst,\" she interrupted. \"How old are you?\"\n\n\"I'm 21,\" I answered.\n\n\"Good. I like young guys,\" she said with a devious smile. She stood up from her desk and walked towards me.\n\nI stood up in response as she got very close and began to break my personal bubble.\n\n\"W-What are you d-doing?\" I stammered.\n\n\"What does it look like?\" She whispered.\n\n\"Before you go any further I just want to let you know that I am an intern and I think I took the wrong elevator! I just wanted to go to lunch!\" I yelled out.\n\n\"What?\" she asked. \"Let me see your badge.\"\n\nShe pulled my badge that was attached to my hip and looked at it closely. I saw a sudden change in her demeanor as she realized her mistake.\n\n\"I'm going to need you to turn in your badge and never mention this,\" she told me strictly as she picked up her phone to dial what I could only assume was security.\n\n\"Sure...yeah...sorry about that,\" I muttered.\n\n\"I'm also going to need something else,\" she said as she put the phone back down perhaps in a change of heart.\n\n\"What's that?\" I asked her.\n\n\"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy,\" she said.\n\nIt was then that I realized that Krista was not some hot scientist, but in fact a 17 foot Loch Ness monster from the Paleolithic era that was trying to eat me.\n\nTl;dr Took the wrong elevator and stumbled into a secret underground facility.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393526724", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

As the cocoon is spun, the aerodynamic resistance of the shark-silk helps the shark descend slowly, where its spore pod matures until the Loch Ness monster deposits approximately three dollars and fifty cents into the spore pod, causing it to open and scatter shark spores on the wind, where they can be carried to the ocean.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393534131", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

If there truly was a flood and god cleaned up there would be no evidence of a flood...sure. But there would NOT be evidence against a flood unless it was put there by god, thus being deceptive.

I use quotes there because it isn't like he studied Japanese culture, he just watched a lot of anime, and read a lot of comic books.  Freshman year, for the first time away from his parents, and he decides to get tattooed like a Yakuza.  Really stupid, we tried to talk him out of it, but he wasn't the kind of person who changed his mind.  Fast forward five years, and because he barely scraped by in college, he is still living with his parents, and getting increasingly depressed.\n\nThe full arm tattoos and his bad transcripts have pretty much made him unemployable, the only job he could get was working with special ed kids in a rural school about 1.5 hr drive from his parent's place.  One day he calls me up and says he has the answer to his problems, he has been accepted to the JET program, and he is going to go teach English in Japan.  I met up with him before he went overseas, he had cleaned up a lot, and taken to wearing long sleeves, and seemed genuinely happy for the first time since I've known him.\n\nHe flies over, his job is up in Osaka, and he is having the time of his life.  We get emails daily about how much he loves it over there, how great the food is, and how much he likes the people.  He is even planning a holiday in Tokyo in November.\n\nThat was the last any of us heard from him.  The police found him dead in a district of Tokyo called Kichi-joji.  Evidently the area he was in was known for prostitution and drugs.  He was found with his shirt off, and the tattoos on his arms flayed off.  The cops believe it was done while he was alive.  The belief is he must have thought he was showing off, and really offended the local mobsters, who evidently took care of the offense old school.\n\nI guess you could say he regretted his tattoos.  I still remember his funeral back in the states.  The thing that struck me most when looking in his casket was how much we, his friends had failed him in college.  We could have tried to stop him from getting those dumb tattoos.  Obviously he needed something in his life, and he was looking for it in the wrong places.  I asked his body, laying there, looking nothing like the friend I knew and said \"What did you need?\" And as if from the grave I heard him say \"About tree fiddy.\"  It was about this time I noticed my friend's body was 500 foot long and from the Paleolithic era, and I said \"God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain’t gonna give you no tree fiddy.\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393553472", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 1}

Now, I wasn't AWFUL looking, but I was one awkward little fuck. I would, without thinking, do anything that the 'popular' guys told me so that I could be friends with them.

Of course, they wanted me to ask out Emma so they could laugh when I got utterly rejected. They followed me around until I found her, and then hung back waiting for me to do it. I walked up to her and just fucking froze. I couldn't think of ANYTHING to say. Just stared at her for a solid 10 seconds, when I remembered a pick-up line I saw on a meme earlier. I stared her straight in the eyes and said: \"Are your legs tired? Because you've been back-marching through my head all day.\" I could hear those assholes laughing in the background, when something happened that made my heart jump up into the fucking ceiling... She looked at me and just kissed me. The laughter stopped, and there was complete silence. We just sat there in the middle of the hallway, making out like fucking crazy.

{"body": "Oh, there's no doubt about my answer!\n\nI used to contemplate this question all the time as a kid... and even, if I'm honest, occasionally in my adult life. There are so many possibilities, and so many ways that each could either benefit or hinder my everyday life.\n\nFor example, being a dragon would be neat, but then you'd have to worry about maintaining a very specific diet so as not upset your internal balance. (The chemicals that dragons use to breath fire are, perhaps predictably, incredibly volatile.) One wrong cream puff, and suddenly there's a dragon-sized stain on the pavement.\n\nThen again, why would you choose to be a dragon when you could be a deity? I used to think to myself, \"I'd love to have the powers of a god, but not the perspective. That way, I'd be able to enjoy my superhuman abilities.\" I mean, really, once you become aware of the whole of time and space, what's the point in messing with people? Unfortunately, a lot of those powers are essentially useless without the omniscience, so I'd probably wind up getting bored pretty fast.\n\nIt took me a lot of thought, but as I said earlier, I eventually came to the conclusion that there's only one right answer. I'd be a creature that needs no introduction, but was still able to slip unnoticed into any situation. I'd be a myth, a legend, and the source of many a story. I'd go about my daily life, unrecognized by my intended victims... until, at the last possible moment, I'd end the illusion and say to them: \"I... I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\n**TL;DR: The one creature that could be anywhere, or anyone, at any time.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393616884", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 37, "controversiality": 0}

I have been told people were abducted by aliens, I have been told bigfoot exists, I have been told the Loch Ness monster exists.\n\nDo you consider these people deceptive due to withholding/hiding evidence for their claim? Surely they go to great lengths to gather and present their evidence. This comparison is only valid if you think God is presenting evidence to support a false claim. \n\n&gt; The CLAIMS are baseless without evidence. Just because I am told something may not mean I have a claim to evidence. But the person making the claim also has no claim to be believed without evidence. And they especially have no claim to be believed when their claim goes against evidence.\n\nI never said it was believable or well-supported. I'm telling you that IF the flood happened you cannot accuse God of deception because he flatly told you about the miracle in the bible. \n\nIf I murder someone and clean up the crime scene it is deception. If after cleaning up the crime scene I confess to the police, it is not deception. This is because the people I would have been deceiving (police) were informed about my action and no longer require the evidence to find the murderer.\n\n&gt; As a Christian\n\nNot a Christian...\n\n&gt; I am sure you dismiss or disbelieve the claims of miracles made by other religions.\n\nI certainly do\n\n&gt; Thus I dismiss yours, until evidence is provided for them or at the very least evidence against them is explained.\n\nI'm just pointing out that it is a pointless endeavor to try and disprove supernatural miracles because natural evidence only applies to natural things.
