{"body": "Physicist/Astronomer here. From the sounds of it, the professor you're talking to is not a specialist in any of the relevant disciplines. One thing that many people, including scientists, often forget is that science is highly specialized. Just as I probably couldn't comment authoritatively on his area of expertise, it sounds like he isn't familiar with my field (cosmology). \n\nThe truth is that most physicists, and scientists in general, receive only basic training in the fields outside their specialization. It's troubling to me that he is trying to make claims outside his area of expertise, not only within his subfield, but also making philosophical claims that he likely has even less exposure to. Philosophers, especially philosophers of science are among the least likely groups of people to believe in god, which suggests at the very least that his arguments for the existence of god on epistemological grounds are not universally accepted. \n\n&gt;The fact that the universe has Physical and Natural laws is proof of a intelligent creator.\n\nWell, no. Physical and natural laws do have a creator, and I don't think anyone disagrees with this. These laws are created by human beings to describe natural phenomenon. That the universe behaves regularly is interesting, but that does not tell us anything other than that the universe behaves regularly. This is entirely a restatement of god of the gaps, and by bringing this point up he has not addressed any of the counter-arguments that you raised or that could be raised against a \"god of the gaps\". \n\n&gt; The current physical laws do not contradict a creator.\n\nSure, but as many people have started to argue in the popular sphere, the understanding of physical law that we have now is pointing and gesturing towards the conclusion that the origin of the universe is naturalistic. Saying that the laws of physics don't contradict a bastardized version of a specific religion is a bit like saying that they don't preclude dragons, unicorns, the Loch Ness Monster or an Invisible Pink Unicorn. Religious claims are unfalsifiable, so of course physical law doesn't contradict them. \n\n&gt;We can see the creation, and the creation is proof of a creator (similar to the whirlwind through junkyard creates airplane argument)\n\nThe teleological argument has well known rebuttals, and isn't taken particularly seriously even in religious circles. Creation is only proof that the conditions necessary to produce things as they are, are met, and there is no reason to suspect that god is a necessary condition for the universe to be the way it is. Natural explanations are entirely sufficient. Again, this is merely god of the gaps. \n\nEach of his arguments are not physical ones, and require no knowledge of physics to counter. They're merely various restatements of \"god of the gaps\" arguments, and largely arguments rebutted by philosophers on all sides of this issue hundreds of years ago. He's not only arguing beyond what he knows of physics, but he's arguing from philosophical claims which he doesn't know the history of. I wouldn't waste my time engaging with someone like this.

{"body": "It doesn't matter if there's more. At their foundation, all religions depend on a belief in the supernatural without a shred of evidence to support it.\n\nAnd yes, that is *exactly* like unicorns.\n\nFunny thing about scientists, as a group, they are far more atheistic than the regular public at large. There must be something about a profession that demands evidence and logical thinking that weeds out religion. Sure, some scientists are believers, but that's just good old fashioned cognitive dissonance and compartmentalization. \"In every facet of my life, I will demand proof, evidence, logical thinking, and be skeptical of claims of magic. Except for religion, there I will accept bullshit unquestioningly.\"\n\nAlso you should reexamine your numbers of scientists and atheism.\n\nhttp://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-4-scientists-politics-and-religion/\n\nLess than 40% believe in \"god.\" Less than 50% believe in \"god\" plus whatever the fuck they consider a \"higher power\". So it's pretty clear that despite religion's spectacularly strong hold on our society, a scientific approach and lifestyle tends to make one less religious. Probably because when your answer for the mysteries in nature is \"sky fairy did it\" you tend not to get very far in science.\n\n&gt;And when you point out that most scientists are NOT in fact atheists, the /atheism people are like, no, then they're not real scientists....\n\nThis doesn't happen. As I said above, it merely speaks to the cognitive dissonance within that person. No one disputes that the scientists of centuries ago or even people like Georges Lemaitre were both scientists *and* religious. But they certainly aren't using their scientific lens to critically view religion. Anyone that does so can only reach one conclusion. Just like anyone that views creationism v evolution through a critical and thoughtful lens can only reach one conclusion. \n\nYou've created this idea of /r/atheism in your mind and attack it, even if it doesn't exist anywhere but in your mind. It just makes you sad strawmanner. I see you've compared the sub to the Tea Party. An analogy that might make sense if the Tea Party were a logical position backed by scientific evidence I suppose. \n\nThink about this. Throughout the entirety of human history, there has not been a single instance of evidence for the supernatural. That's hundreds of thousands of years that have passed wherein not a single supernatural thing has ever happened that we've known about. In fact, so far, every time we think something supernatural has been at work, closer looks reveal it to be completely natural and predictable and understandable. Lightning doesn't come from the gods, earthquakes are not god's wrath, tornadoes are not sent because of the gays, prayer does not work against the Bubonic plague because it's not caused by demons. Study after study shows the completely non-existent impact of prayer on the sick. \n\nSo why, after countless victories for naturalism and science and none for supernaturalism and religion, why would you ever presume to think that religion is not complete bullshit? Sure, I'm open to the possibility it might be real, just like we might find Bigfoot tomorrow or the Loch Ness monster. But until you show me just the tiniest bit of evidence, the logical default state is to go with the weight of human history which shows religion is nonsense. \n\nIf a guy gets it wrong 10000000000000000000 times in a row and has never been right before, the next time he says something, it's only logical to assume he'll be wrong again. If he shows you his work, walks you through his logic, maybe gives you some evidence, then yeah, sure, he might be right for the first time ever! But until that happens, only a fucking idiot would think \"he's right this time!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393689826", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

It is claimed to be a [sauropod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda) by some [cryptozoologists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptozoology). \n\n&gt;Expeditions mounted in the hope of finding evidence of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé have failed, and the subject has been covered in a number of books and by a number of television documentaries. According to skeptic [Robert T. Carroll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_T._Carroll), \"Reports of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé have been circulating for the past two hundred years, yet no one has photographed the creature or produced any physical evidence of its existence.\"  The Mokèlé-mbèmbé and its associated folklore also appear in several works of fiction and popular culture. \n\n&gt;A film titled Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend, based on reports of the cryptid, starring [William Katt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Katt) was released in 1985.

The flight attendants wore the same uniform, but this one had her skirt hitched up a little higher than the rest, the blouse a little bit tighter than usual. She actually looked a little flushed now that I think about it. \n\nShe came over and asked me if I wanted anything to drink, a coffee please. She's sorry but if it were alright, would I accompany her into the back to pick out what to put in my coffee? She gives me this little smile and the *fuck me* look already. I oblige, squeezing past the row of seats. I ask if the coffee is hot, and she replies \"*Yes, very.*\" \n\nShe shuts the curtain and clips it into it's frame. She gets up onto the counter and pull me in close for a deep kiss. She's not even wearing any panties and the hem of her skirt is up around her waist already, her tight little pussy just dripping with precum. I kneel down and give it a quick 15-minute kiss. There were entire minutes I didn't come back up for air, and her legs were wrapped around my neck keeping me in a pussy-eating headlock. \n\nShe quietly moans and writhes and pulls her blouse open, fondling her nipples which were hard in the cool cabin air. Take off your pants, she says. I do so and take out my cock, hard from the minute I got up from my chair. She pushes me onto one of the seats there and gets on top of me. I enter her with a quick slide, and I don't know how but she got even more wet. \n\nShe puts her tongue down my throat while bouncing up and down on my cock. She bites playfully hard while ramming that pussy down. It wasn't *that* hard, but I wondered why I tasted a little blood. I didn't care though, her cunt was so tight it felt as if my dick had some sort of fleshlight noose around it that was cutting off bloodflow, but that just made it more sensitive and more erect. \n\nI push her face off mine, and immediately see something's wrong. She's reaching back, and putting her hair down, but she doesn't have hands. She's got claws. I don't even know how, but I never noticed that she was a 500-foot monster from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "When I first moved to the big city, I was kind of a naive guy.  I liked the thought of getting to meet new people, but sometimes I must have looked like an easy mark.  One day a middle aged man asked me for a gas can (knowing I wasn't likely to have one) then asked me for $10 so he could get a can and a gallon of gas to get his family home, after which he could get to his own wallet and swing by to repay me.  It was an extremely cold day, I could spare the money, and I thought I saw a woman and kids waiting inside the car he gestured to.  When I gave him $10, he quickly dashed away.  I went inside to store the groceries I was carrying home, then went back out to await repayment.  The grift would have worked as well on me if there was no offer of repayment.  However, standing out in the cold like that made me brood on what a dope I was.  The lesson was actually worth more than $10.\n\nI did not become completely hard-hearted after that.  I might still hand a single to a beggar who looked to be in real need.  I had a proper office job.  I wasn't rich yet, but I had enough to get by in a small pad right at the edge of one of the planet's finest concentrations of drinking establishments.  I was happy to give up a buck or leftovers from a fine meal with the idea that it gave someone else a positive moment in what may be a harsh day.  However, I was no longer kind to people with elaborate sob stories, merchandise of questionable origin, etc.  Even if some of my petty kindnesses went to grifters, I was still fine having that positive moment; and I did not trust anyone who sought more than a petty kindness.\n\nThen one morning something was different.  I was out roaming the bars until 4am, and I was in no mood for rest despite the hour.  I grabbed a donut from a bakery that strategically made a fresh batch at that 4am closing time, then I went for a late night stroll along the shore of Lake Michigan.  There I had the most magical encounter.  Though the lighting was poor, I could tell he had dark skin.  Just like the man who suckered me into waiting in the cold, I was dealing with someone who claimed to need a little help to get his family out of a jam.  He said his son got a limb caught in a bicycle rental station, and the only way to free the young one would be to rent a specific bike.  Somehow, I just new this guy was the real deal, and one look at the rental station confirmed it.  I was happy to do a good thing for a whole family of crustaceans from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "I got married to a very abusive man when I was 16.  At about 18 the dreams began.  The first dream I was jogging through Golden Gate Park and saw a guy standing by a tree playing with a yo-yo.  I saw the same man as I reached a nearby crosswalk.  He introduced himself to me as Phil and as the light turned green he walked and talked with me asking me out on a date.  I saw my husband walking towards us down the street, thanked him politely, and explained that I'm married.  He said \"I don't give up that easily.\"  to which I answered \"Well, you should, because I'm married.\"\n\nThe next night he came back.  He blind folded me and lead me to a small room with orange shag carpeting, furnished with a standing closet, twin sized bed, and a wooden chair and populated with all my friends from back home.  At the time I was on the other side of the country and missed them terribly.  Everyone was so happy to see everyone and I asked my friend \"Is this a dream?\"  To which he answered \"Does it matter?\"  I remember taking Phil aside to thank him for giving me this time with my friends.  We had a talk about how isolated I was and how I should go home.\n\nThe next night he came back again.  This time we were back in Golden Gate Park walking around Stow Lake.  He brought a bottle of wine, we fed the ducks, we talked about all kinds of things.  When I brought up my husband he quickly shut it down and told me \"He doesn't exist here.  It is only me and you.\"\n\nThe dreams continued nightly like this for weeks before he tried to kiss me.  I stopped him.  I was a married woman after all.  He told me that we were soul mates.  \"Do you know how hard it is for me to come here every night?!\"  he would insist.  It began to feel so real I felt guilty.  Eventually I told my husband which resulted in a violent beating and a trip to the ER.  It was awful.\n\nThe next night when he returned I told him what happened to me and he was furious.  He told me I had to leave him this instant, but I didn't know how.  I couldn't continue on like this but cheating on him - even in my dreams - would only make things worse.  Phil told me not to travel with him.\n\nIt was the next night we got in the car accident.  A drunk driver hit us going 80mph.  Our car was totalled, we were lucky to get out alive.  My husband sprained both his wrists severely and we both had concussions.  Of this Phil told me he had tried to kill him.  He had told me not to travel with him and was angry with me for not listening to him.  It was getting harder and harder every night to distinguish reality from my dream life.  It was too real.\n\nMy husband nearly lost his job as a waiter because of the sprained wrists and was out of work so long we were more broke than ever.  This was causing more strain on the relationship, but at least now he couldn't hit me.  I was almost ready to call it quits but not quite.  I needed the right moment.\n\nThen, one night, Phil organized a whole lavish party for us at an ornate gala in New York.  I'd never been to New York but I clearly remember the skyline from the balcony.  He told me \"If nothing else will get your attention may be this will.\"\n\nNow night after night he began taking me to more and more exotic places.  We went to jazz bars in Paris, arcades in Tokyo, aurora borealis in Iceland, hot springs in Finland, hot chocolate in the Alps, took a stroll across London Bridge, Stonehenge, Machu Pichu, South Africa, Ysrael, etc...  Night after night we traveled, sometimes flying in jet liners, other times we would just appear somewhere.  If I wanted something he would bring it to me.  There was flowers, champagne, ball gowns, elaborate dinners at 5 star restaurants that frankly there's simply no way I'd ever been able to fabricate the menus so accurately.\n\nBut, I wasn't ready to leave my husband.  I had no money and no where to go and when I awoke I was always in the same horrible place...\n\nThen one night I came to his pent house suite, which was at the top of a largely empty brick building.  The day was foggy and the sky was grey but he seemed in great spirits.  The apartment itself was furnished in white, pink, blue, and gold.  Ornate furniture, paintings, and china everywhere.  He poured me some tea and told me that he had thrown a very special party for me and that all my friends would be there, shortly.\n\nThat's when I dropped the bomb on him.  I knew what he was going to do.  He was going to ask me to marry him.  He had done it in other dreams several times, but this time, I knew.  It was going to be a huge scene and I had to tell him now.  I didn't want him to be humiliated.  Even if I could leave my husband how could I marry someone in my dreams?\n\nWhen I told him I couldn't see him anymore the look on his face was soul crushing.  He threw his tea cup against the wall smashing it into a thousand pieces.  He yelled at me, why can't I see that we belong together, what does he have to do to convince me?!  And then finally said \"Alright.  But, this is it.  If you tell me to leave now I'm NEVER coming back.\"\n\nI began to cry.  I didn't want him to go, but I couldn't leave my husband with this kind of pressure.  I didn't want to let anyone down.  I choked a little but told him \"If that's the way it has to be, then I guess you should leave.\"\n\nThen he disappeared out the door and down the stairs into the fog, never to be seen again.\n\nI've described these dreams to a few people before.  It is a long story rife with detail and lost context, but everyone I've told it to has told me that it's creepy.\n\nEdit:Since so many people are asking what happened and if I left my husband \"I did. What ended up happening was on 9/11 he had gotten up early to go to work. I guess he was better by then, hard to remember. In any case he wasn't there. My father, though, was visiting and woke me up telling me that a plane had hit the twin towers. I'm not going to go into my whole \"where were you on 9/11 story\", but I ended up calling my mother and telling her everything.\n\nShe told me if I didn't get him out of the house that very night she would tell my father. I was more concerned that my father wouldn't do anything and it would make me feel worse so I packed him a bag and when he got home I told him he had to go stay with a friend. That I'd told my mother and that he had to leave immediately.\nWe didn't actually \"break up\" there, though. He went to stay with a work buddy and ended up moving in permanently. I continued to see him for a while - not sure why. But, within a few months things reached a head when he tried to drive us off a bridge. Or, rather he threatened to. After that he joined the military and was promptly sent to Afghanistan.\n\nHe left me everything and paid off all the remaining medical bills. We remain on civil terms.\"\n\nEdit II: What's with the Loch Ness tree fiddy stuff?

{"body": "*I was very young when this happened, so my memory of this is a bit hazy, and my parents never told me all of the details.\n\n\nWhen I was a small child, my parents took me and my younger brothers out to a local Italian place called Piccolo's (needless to say, we constantly made Dragonball Z jokes while there).\nThe place was dimly lit, and the food was vastly overpriced and took an hour to cook. When we finally got our meals, it was pretty mediocre. The spaghetti tasted like it came out of a can of Chef Boyardee, and my parents didn't even touch their plates. They had us stop eating, and complained to the waiters that they didn't like the food. They felt that it wasn't worth paying for, although they did offer to pay for the drinks. The waiters, for some reason, decided to tell the chef.\n\nA few minutes later, a short mustachioed man came out of the back and started yelling at us, claiming \"You don't appreciate real Italian food. If you want that fake American bullshit, then go eat at Johnny Carino's!\".\nMy mother did not appreciate being yelled at, and got into a full-on screaming match with the guy, while me, my brothers, and my father just watched awkwardly, my dad occasionally stepping in to either support my mother or to try to find some sort of compromise.\n\n\"Do you know what you need to give me if you want to get out of here without having the cops called on you for not paying?\", the chef yelled.\n\"What?\" My parents asked.\n\n\"About tree-fiddy\".\nIt was at this moment that we noticed that the chef was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \n\"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!\" My parents yelled as the monster shuffled back into the kitchen, \"Get your own goddamn money!\".\n\nI really don't recall what happened after that. Apparently, sometime during the argument, the chef hit my mother with a towel, and that prompted her to call the police while we were leaving. I don't really know if anything came out of it.

{"body": "Basically someone tells a long drawn out story that ends with a loch ness monster appearing and asking for $3.50, which indicates to the reader that the writer of the story made it all up to trick you.  It's a bait and switch and it makes me more angry than anything else because you took the time to read and get invested in the story.  Sometimes there is a subtle joke in making fun of the audience's willingness to accept an obviously outlandish story.  That can be kind of funny.  It also led people for a while on reddit to check the very last line of a long story post to make sure it wasn't a tree fiddy joke.  Also certain users were known for making tree fiddy jokes and that became and indicator too.

{"body": "This is such an interesting question for an Extended Project. I wish had thought of doing something like this when I had to do one.\n\nI wonder if it would be a good idea to focus on one particular cryptid, say Bigfoot, because there are various levels of evidence for all of the ones you have listed so it would be hard to come to a good conclusion about all of them - easier to talk about one. I also think you would be able to get deeper into your research with a clearer focus which might make the subject sound more serious to your teachers who might think it is all pseudoscience unless they are personally interested.\n\nI would go with a title like 'What is the likelihood of cryptids truly existing?' though maybe you could substitute a better word for likelihood.\n\nI wonder if it would be interesting to talk about animals previously thought to be cryptids like the okapi and giant squids (to some extent) to illustrate that it is still possible to discover new creatures. You would, however, have to be careful to balance this out with the facts that suggest it is unlikely various cryptids are legit eg. how shitty some of the photos of the loch ness monster are and how bigfoots are seen in pretty well explored/populated areas.\n\nI'm not much help on sources but I would try to use as many printed resources as you can - books, journals etc. - not becuase they are necessariy any less credible but your teachers probably won't be into you citing tinfoilhat.com/bullshituncitedarticle or whatever.\n\nI'm super interested in where you will take this so if you need any help with read throughs, referencing or getting hold of articles with permissions (I've got uni library access) feel free to PM me.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393800581", "subreddit": "Cryptozoology", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I ended up going into the seedy part of town and entering what looked like an abandoned basement under a Wendy's. But the massage was already paid for so I thought I should make the best of it. When I entered the \"clinic\" it was completely empty except for an unmanned welcome desk. No chairs. No clients. The lights were very dim. I called out, \"Hello?\" and a woman in her mid 40s stumbled out from the back. I told her I had an appointment and gave her my coupon. She told me to go in the back and make myself comfortable. \n\nI go in to her \"massage room\" which is more or less a table with sheets surrounded by some candles, scented oils, and an old boom box. I take off my clothes (leaving my underwear on) and climb into the sheets, which were surprisingly comfortable. She comes in and lights an incense stick that smells vaguely of patchouli. Then she turns the boom box on to what I can only guess was whale noises accompanied by ocean sounds. It wasn't the most soothing thing, but it was good enough.\n\nShe squeezes oil on to her hands and starts rubbing my back. The oil is minty, and mixed with the patchouli the room was smelling like my menthol-smoking grandma. But the massage is good. Great, in fact. Each time a whale moans she digs her claws into my back. And it was about this time that I realized this masseuse was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nSo I jumped up from the massage bed, grabbed my clothes, and ran out the door without looking back.

This is the \"*Lancer's Long Arm*\", a old-fashioned jousting lance.\n\n* (+) Gain critical hits at any time during a charge\n* (+) +15% damage bonus while charging\n* (–) -25% damage penalty when not charging\n* (–) -25% slower charge recharge rate (*12 → 15 second recharge time*)\n\nSecond on today's list, a new sword... yay. But this one has a bit of a twist. Based on everyone's favorite sword from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, up next we've got the \"*Kris-O'-Grim*\" (*bonus points if you guess which SotN sword it's based off of by the name alone*).\n\n* (+) On a successful hit, deals damage five times in the span of a half-second\n* (+) Extended melee range (*like the Eyelander, see below*)\n* (–) -85% damage penalty per hit (*~10 damage per hit; 50 total*)\n* (±) *Cosmetic: Appears to be a short dagger with a slightly wavy blade but, when boosted with crits or mini-crits, shows a full-length sword blade.*\n\nFinally, another slightly charge-oriented weapon, this one is... a broom? Yes. I said it. Instead of a sword, I'm giving the Demoman a straw-bristle broom. Prepare to sweep the competition with... the \"*Li'l Loch Broom*\" (*yeah, another homeland pun... I'm chock full of 'em*).\n\n* (+) While charging, creates a shockwave in front of the wearer that reflects projectiles (*functions identically to the Pyro's compression blast, but lasts the full two-second charge duration*)\n* (+) When damaged by fire, the weapon ignites and the next melee attack causes afterburn\n* (–) +3 degrees random projectile deviation on reflected projectiles\n* (–) -40% damage penalty\n\nThat's all I've got for new Demoman weapons...\n\n* * *\n\n...now let's see what I can do for the old weapons. Since we're altering reskins, fuck specialized formatting.\n\n**Scottish Handshake:**\n\n* (±) Damage identical to stock Bottle, except...\n* (+) On taunt, heals the Demoman a small amount (*15~25 HP*) but gives the Demoman's a 'drunkenness' meter (*every taunt increases this meter by 20%, depletes at 1% per second; warps the first-person view slightly and may cause double vision*)\n* (+) While drunk, the Demoman gains a chance to dodge hitscan and melee damage proportionate to his drunkenness (*50% bullet/melee dodge chance at total drunkenness*)\n* (–) Damage and attack speed decreases proportionate to drunkenness (*-50% damage penalty and slower attack speed maximum at full drunkenness*)\n* (–) Walking speed fluctuates when drunk (fluctuates up to ±15% at random intervals at full drunkenness)\n* (±) Cosmetic: The 'drunkenness' meter changes titles for every 20% the meter fills (*0% [sober] → 1-20% [buzzed] → 21-40% [tipsy] → 41-60% [drunk] → 61-80% [sloshed] → 81-100% [wasted]*)\n\nAs for Nessie's Nine-Iron... I just don't like it as a weapon. I think it should be scrapped all together. The only change I could think of for it to distinguish it from its reskinned cousins is a cosmetic change at most, a golf-themed taunt—he turns to the right, wiggles his rump and winds up for a golf swing... and if there's one of your stickybombs at the Demoman's feet as he taunts, he can launch the stickybomb away with the club.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393813621", "subreddit": "tf2", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This was back in 2006 while I was just finishing up with school. I had just split up from my long term girlfriend and had not had any luck with meeting other girls so I decided to try my hand at online dating.\n\nI sent a few messages here and there but did come across one girl who I had a lot in common with and who looked absolutely gorgeous so I put a bit more time into sending her a message I thought would definitely get a response. Amazingly she responded within minutes of me sending the message. I wrote back and we exchanged email addresses so we could talk on MSN Messenger.\n\nWe stayed up and spoke until it was no longer late; but early, and i'll always remember watching the sun rise that morning and feeling like i'd happened upon someone really really special.\n\nAnyway; here's where the weirdness starts. We spoke every single night and continued to get on really well until eventually I suggested we speak on the phone. She made up numerous excuses (her phone line was disconnected, her phone was broken etc.) which in retrospect was a huge red flag but at the time I believed her. I asked if she'd go on webcam for me but again - excuses. \n\nAs time went on we still got on really well but i'd resigned myself to the fact that she wasn't who she said she was until one morning she said she wanted to tell me something. She said her phone wasn't really broken at all and she wanted to talk to me - she was just shy and very *very* self conscious of her speaking voice. I sort of laughed this off and said i'd love to talk no matter what. From her pictures she was a stone cold babe so I didn't, in all honesty, care about her voice. Anyway, I called - slightly nervous - and she answered breathily and almost croakily speaking to me.\n\nShe sounded like she had a chest infection or a bad cold and although I was a bit bemused by the whole thing I was glad to be speaking to her. I had noticed it sounded like she was in the bathroom and, angling for a kinky conversation, asked if she was in the bath while talking to me. She giggled and said I should go over and see - she only lived in the next town which is a short train ride away. I, being a red blooded male, told her i'd be there as quickly as I possibly could - she just needed to text me the address. She said she'd do it straight away but had one other thing to tell me. I asked what it was and she said that since taking the pictures on her profile she'd put on a bit of weight. I'm a traditional guy and to be honest prefer a woman with a bit of meat on her bones so I was honestly unfazed. She seemed happy with this and texted me the address - I hopped on the train and arrived at her house within the hour.\n\nI knocked on the door and heard her voice \"it's open!\" so I pushed the door and went inside. \"I'm upstairs\" she groaned... feeling weirder and weirder I headed up the stairs and could hear her laboured breathing along with some splashing in the tub. \"Second door on the left\" she garbled... I pushed it open and saw her... not a bit bigger but *huge* laying in the bathtub, skin flaking off and her flab literally hanging over the sides of the tub. \n\nI was absolutely disgusted and practically screamed at her \"What the hell is this? Why would you ask me here!?\" and she responded with words I will honestly never forget. \"MiG_Eater\" - she paused - \"I asked you here because I need something from you... imma need about a tree fitty\"... and that's when it all clicked into place. The scottish accent, the peeling skin, the laboured speaking... God damn loch ness monster.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393849192", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Yes, newborn babies have somewhat distinct personalities (certainly not nearly as much as they will when they’re older), but they do NOT have many important higher mental functions. \n\nIf an animal with the mental capacities of a newborn baby is not a person, why is a newborn baby a person? Why can’t we allow infanticide and abandonment of newborns? After all, I wouldn’t say that my dog is a person, although she knows more words and understand my emotions better than a newborn.\n\nThe only thing separating them is that the newborn has a nature as a self-aware, highly rational, moral entity. Literally everything about her is contained in her DNA, in the single celled zygote, and is therefore a part of her intrinsic identity, even if she cannot yet express those traits. \n\nThe same goes for an unborn human. That an unborn human isn’t conscious (at least not until later in pregnancy) and a born one is, is not a relevant distinction if consciousness itself isn’t sufficient for personhood. Which I think we can agree it’s not.\n\nThe distinction between Polaroid photos and young humans, which the analogy doesn’t cover, is that humans are intrinsically valuable, whereas photos are merely functionally valuable. That is, humans are valuable by merit of their own nature, but photos are only valuable insofar as humans place value on them. A human doesn’t have any less right to life or inherent dignity simply because other people don’t care about him or her, or recognize said dignity.\n\nI would argue that all developed humans have intrinsically valuable properties, dignity, and rights, regardless of who they are or what their situation is.\n\nSo for the sake of the analogy, just assume that you know the photo is functionally valuable, and that anyone in their right mind would agree. It could be a picture of a corrupt dictator doing something that, when it went public, would lead to their ruin. It could be a picture of the Loch Ness monster (if she were real), which would earn you tons of money and contribute to science. It could be a poignant picture of injustice that sways people to get off their couches and do something.

Are we also to assume that if the photo is allowed to develop then the photographer's family may disown her? Are we also to assume that if the photographer allows the photo to develop, that from that point forward it will dominate her life, either by being the most important thing in it, or by causing others to judge her because of what she chooses to do with it?\n\nIf we were to assume those possibilities as well, we might not judge her for ripping up a photo of the Loch Ness monster before it develops.\n\nWhen you use a photograph to create an analogy, it's not a very good analogy if it omits facets of the argument that run counter to the point you're trying to make.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393873555", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You know you should always haggle with the Gamestop employees. Little known fact, corporate doesn't encourage it, but they are allowed to haggle. I went with a friend who went in to sell a stack of games. I told him he was dumb and that I bet he could get more selling on ebay or a pawnshop but he was lazy and wouldn't hear it. They weren't the newest of the new, but it was something like the end of the PS2's golden age. You know a year or so after the PS3 was out so the PS2's new releases were starting to dwindle. Anyway he had some quality, but common games. Stuff like Jak 2, Prince of Persia:Sands of Time, Kingdom Hearts, Soul Calibur 2. You know, games that you could dump a ton of time into, but they were big on release, so even at gamestop you see them on the shelf for $5-$8. So of course the guy at the counter is ringing them through. Most games come up for pocket change. $1, 50 cents, $1.50, I think I saw one go through for a penny, probably something like Madden '07 that really they should just not bother buying at all because nobody buys any farther than a year or two back and this was 2010. I did see a copy of Disgaea go through as well, but it only rang up at $2. My friend stopped the clerk at that one. Disgaea is kind of a rare game, certainly worth more than $2. The guy at the counter actually knew what he was talking about though. He said they used to buy copies for $20+, but since it was rereleased on DS and PSP, the value went down. My friend understood but still $2 was pretty cheap for a rareish game he said he needed more for it. The guy at the counter asked him how much he needed for it because his boss gives him a little wiggle room and he kind of agreed with him. So my friend says, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy. It was about at this point, I noticed that not only was my friend a Loch Ness Monster, but he was actually trying to sell a copy of South Park: Chef's Luv Shack for N64, not Disgaea.

{"body": "Necitor here (aka Nessie), late to the party but I'll give my thoughts on the topic since it's my role in high tier tpvp. Some of it will just emphasize what I've seen already said but it'd be too tedious to address each thing individually. Essentially yea, don't plan on killing anything unless they like to burst you when you have your retal up or just afk so you can smack them dead (after a minute of auto attacking). \n\nWith that said, definitely head to mid at the start to hopefully win that node fight but you will absolutely NOT sit it for the game. You will be the rotating support to team fights so you will constantly find yourself looking at the minimap enemy icons. Since this is solo arena not team, you need to designate a node babysitter so you can rotate out - generally whoever watches home will cover both and call the incoming so another member of your team can watch the empty node unless you are in a 4v4 fight at far. \n\nWhile some say bunker guard is \"OP\" or \"easy\" they haven't spent enough time on it vs high caliber players. Sure you can bunker hot joins 3v1 as an OP bunker, but 2v1 vs smart players (heck, 1v1 vs some) who know their class will melt you unless you know the ins and outs of your class to survive long enough got help to arrive. So while it may seem boring to play, eventually you will face players that will test your bunker skill and push you to be better. \n\nAs a general note, you are a rez/stomp/condi clearing bot for team. Your support allows your glass/dps members to do their job while nothing down themselves. As such, you need to keep an eye on positioning of you and your team, condi bars of your teammates, as well as call targets (not sure if this is even useful in soloQ as many won't swap to it but this is part of my role for my team). Building off of this, clearing key conditions from your team will save their lives so timing and vigilant watching over them helps define you as a good vs great bunker. \n\nThink I've covered everything I wanted but if you have questions about build, tactics, w/e shoot me a PM or comment on this and I'll get back to ya. I'm on my phone atm so I hope everything typed out right haha. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393953028", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Throughout the next few days we start talking from when we wake up to when we fall asleep, non stop. It was all going great. We eventually went on a few dates and having a lot of fun. One day I headed over to her house to hangout. This was the first time id been there. I arrived and I thought I had the wrong house. It was beaten down, all the yard was dead, hardly painted, overall it just looked shitty. This was not what I had thought her house would look like, as she's a bright, well-to-do person going to an expensive private school with an expensive car. It was  a bit odd but I diddnt think too much on it. I went inside and it was horribly messy. After hanging out for a bit I decided to try and get her to go hangout with me somewhere else, without really showing I diddnt want to be In her house. It worked and we moved on. Over the next few weeks I hadn't gone back there. And I started noticing strange things about T. The occasional bruise, or burn. I just shrugged it off as her being a little clumsy. But I connected all the dots the next time I visited her house. I went to go pick her up to go out. She texted me that she was still getting ready and to come inside. I did. As I waited on the couch for her to finish doing her makeup a car pulls up outside. \"Oh fuck\" I hear her day from behind me. I ask her what's wrong. \"Where did you park?!\" She asked in a panic. \"Uh outside?\" I replied, honestly confused and a little frightened at this point. She looks out the window and is visually nervous. I head a pounding at the door. A very scary sounding man was yelling and demanding to be let in. She tells me to stay here and goes to the door. As soon as she goes to open it a rather large man comes barging in holding a fucking spear! He's bearded and in what appears to be fishing clothes. \"You're not gunna get away this time!\" He screams and brings his harpoon up ready to strike. T runs to me and grabs me, pulling me into the bathroom and locking the door. \"WHO THE FUCK IS THAT\" I scream as he comes pounding on the door. \"He's been after me for a long time, he's some creep who's obsessed with me!\" She tries to explain. I ask her how the fuck we're gunna get out of this situation and she thinks for a moment and says she has an idea but she's gunna need a favor from me. Anything I said. Then she grabs my arm and gives me a solemn look and says \"Ima need about tree fiddy\" and it was about this time I realized that T was about 8 stories tall and a giant crustisian from the deep. I quickly made a run for the window behind us and got the fuck outta there. \n\nTL;DR find out that and why a girl I'm dating turns out to have a psycho stalker fishermen after her.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394078222", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My mother did the same thing. Even if I had money, she wouldn't let us take them in. She never took our pets to the vet when I was growing up,  which is an ongoing thing. Even for rabies shots, which would get her in major trouble if someone found out. She uses the excuses that vets are too expensive and that all they want is to take your money and kill your pet. As a result, I had a LOT of pets die preventable deaths, pretty much my whole life. We had three, THREE dogs die from heart worms, which was preventable.\n\nMy first pet, a bird named Paulie, died of some unknown ailment. I found him having a seizure on the floor of his cage. My mother simply told me he was dying and that I had to deal with it.\n\nNext preventable pets death was Cocoa. She started vomiting, urinating blood, and having seizures one night, and she refused to take the dog to the vet. I was holding her while she died. I will never forget that, or how it felt.\n\nNext on the list was my loving, special kitty, Nessie. She had soft, luxurious black fur, and loved everyone. She started urinating blood one night, and just didn't stop. She died three days later, scared and in pain.\n\nJasper: died of a stroke three hours after the stroke started.\n\nMouse the rabbit: Died of heatstroke. Over a days period.\n\nPolar: had multiple tumors, most likely died eaten up with cancer.\n\nThere were also dozens of baby puppies, tiny kittens, ducks, rabbits, and chickens that died of neglect or minor ailments that could've been taken care of at the vets.\n\nThey also NEVER spay or neuter any of the animals. They currently have 13 cats, three dogs, and two birds, INSIDE THEIR HOUSE. It's insane. I have TRIED to get my mother to take them to a low cost clinic to get them fixed: she says she doesn't want to make the drive. I tell her to give some away: she says that she'd be too worried about them going to a bad home.\n\n\nShe also likes to 'drop off' animals that she doesn't like. Annoying or ugly dogs, puppies she didn't think we could find homes for, and the dogs of the neighbors she hated. Once, we had this cat, Star. We gave her to my aunt as a kitten and due to my aunts...ineptitude, this cat was neglected severely. We got her back at age 2 and she had the mentality of a six month old kitten, or younger. She was mentally a baby still. A few weeks after we got her back, she got pregnant. She gave birth to two stillborn kittens one day. She showed no interest in them. A day later, another lifeless baby was born. Yet another day (yes, this cat was in active labor for three days and my mother didn't think that was abnormal) she had three; one was born dead, and the other two died that night because her milk hadn't come in, and my mother wouldn't let me go buy KMR to feed them with. Yes, my mother effectively starved two newborn kittens. The next day, I walked into the kitchen and found Star on the floor, covered in her blood, with a dead kitten next to her. It had bite marks on its neck and back, so I surmised that she had possibly killed it trying to get it out. (NOTE-I saw the births of all the other kittens. Her birth canal was DRY when she was giving birth. She screamed worse than any human I've ever heard) My nmom forced me to let her 'take the cat for a ride' to an unknown place, saying that she wouldn't feed 'a killer'. I cried for that poor cat for years. She actually managed to convince me that it was *my* fault. \n\n\nI finally put my foot down about the wrongful deaths with my horse, Steel. I've had him for 7 years, since he was 7 months old, and we've been through a series of minor ailments since then. Three years ago, he had a horse kick him in the face and leave a knot on the side of his nose. It wasn't an issue until it hurt too much for him to let me put his halter on. I went inside and told her that I was making an appointment for him at the vets tomorrow. My dad agreed and said we had the money right now and that if I felt it was needed then it should be done. My mother said no. I told her that I would go out and strip or prostitute myself until I had the money to take him. For the first time, I called her bluff. She was stunned. And she relented, but has never let me forget that she took him to the vet that one time. \n\nSince I have left home, my brothers dog had accumulated several visible tumors, one cat has a horrible skin condition, another cat lost her entire litter of babies because she was too young, and another dog has hip dysplasia and needs to be put out of his misery. I'm angry and crying inside knowing that I could have taken them to the vets after all.

Charged swing releases itself after 5 seconds\n\n(-)-30% base damage \n\n(-)-15% attack speed\n\n(-) No random critical hits\n\n(+)On fully charged hit: enemy is knocked back slightly, distance depends on hp after swing (Lower the Hp, farther they go)\n\nTaunt: Fore!\n\nThe Demoman take a golf ball from behind his back* lobs it in the air, rears up a shot, and hits it as soon as it hits the ground.

I added the pre-determined release time, because without that people would just spawn, hold left click and run into whatever fight they want, releasing a (for most classes) half damage melee swing whenever they want, and that's not even counting the possibility of Crit boosted with Splendid screen and such. I added the attack speed decrease to avoid someone being completely destroyed by a Demo holding this weapon. If you get hit by the -78 and then get followed up by -45.5 in quick succession, that's -123.5 in .8 seconds (probably bad math somewhere here) and I added in that little pushback feature, not to make it OP for the demoman, but to give Scouts and other classes a retreat. A scout hit by the fully charged hit would be left with 47 health. That's just another swing (and some change) away from death. If the scout gets pushed away, the Demoman can't just spam melee after the charge hit and kill the scout.\n\n*^(The animation could be lined up so that it works with the Gaelic Golf bag as well)\n\n**^(Much like the Bonk!

{"body": "From Wikipedia: The Great Ohio Auto Crash of 1895\n\nIn 1895, the first two automobiles in the state of Ohio were involved in an accident with each other.  Both vehicles, known as “horseless carriages” in the vernacular of the day, were two-cylinder gasoline powered automobiles manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.  One was bought in 1894 by the wealthy politician Henry Loadswerth and brought to his estate in Ohio.  Loadswerth was popular around town for giving rides to kids in town in his automobile.  The other automobile was owned by John William James, who was travelling through Ohio on his way from Boston, MA to California to visit relatives.  \n\nAt the time of the accident, Loadwerth was returning from the market, on his way home after a day of buying fresh vegetables.  James was coincidentally travelling on the same road, in the opposite direction.  Both drivers were distracted by an usual sight coming from the nearby Punderson Lake and their vehicles collided in the first recorded automobile crash in the state of Ohio.  \n\nPolice and volunteer firefighters were on scene within 25 minutes of the collision.  Both drivers were relatively unharmed, though James was suspected of having a concussion that went untreated.  Loadswerth died of dysentery two months later.  \n\nThis incident also marked the first time that a towing service was utilized in the state of Ohio.  Approximately 45 minutes after the initial impact, a tow truck driver drove up from the direction of Punderson Lake and offered to fix both vehicles for “tree fiddy.”\n\nSource: [www.wikipedia.com/GreatOhioCrashof1895](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/3456821504/h7D591110/)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394227116", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 69, "controversiality": 0}

I put him in a container I had in my backpack and brought it back to my hotel, where I kept him alive and reasonably happy until I flew home. I got him back to the states (I hope you'll forgive me if I omit the details) and gave his herparium a privileged spot in my reptile room. I hadn't yet done any research to determine his species, or even if he were a *currently known* species.\n\nThe next day I noticed that his colors had dulled, his skin was beginning to flake away (not normal shedding), and his eyes had turned from blue to a rusty red. I guessed that he was probably carrying some nasty bug that might well spread to my other reptiles, and immediately took him several blocks away and dumped him in the sewer. I know that sounds like a horrible thing to do, but I was distraught about losing him and couldn't bring myself to destroy him. And again, I had still not researched his identity.\n\nOver a month later, around mid-July, I walked out of my front door and noticed something colorful in the grass directly in front of me. There in the tall blades lurked my Southeast Asian friend, so carelessly discarded a month before. His color was back, but he looked surprisingly gaunt. Whatever his regular diet consisted of, it was certain he wasn't getting it here.\n\nI happily went over to him and picked him up, looked at his upturned face and said, \"What is it you need, little fella?\"\n\nHe looked up at me and said, \"I need about tree-fitty.\"\n\nAt that moment I saw what any decent herp collector should have realized immediately: My little friend was actually a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. I said, \"I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!

{"body": "Actually, you sort of *can* choose to be happy all the time.  There is a lot of research that suggests that just getting in the habit of smiling improves your mood and mental health.  \n\nBelief is a tricky area; we're absolutely capable of holding two mutually exclusive ideas in our heads at once; one of the smartest colleagues I've ever met, a genius at client-side architecture, is also a devout young-earth creationist.  It blows my mind, but he clearly is choosing to believe something despite the awareness of and better-than-average intellect to know it is false.  He does this because it provides emotional value to him - he *feels* better by choosing to believe something he'd rationally reject.  \n\nI think that's the point people miss about belief - rationalists tend to tackle it rationally, and believers are not engaged in a rational analysis of it.  That's why you so often hear things like 'accepting [diety] in your heart' or 'the spirit moves you.'  They are drawing emotional value from belief and so they exempt it from conditions that would undermine it.\n\nI believe [hah!] that this is a choice.  Otherwise you would not have conversions.  Conversions occur because the emotional reward of one belief versus another changes.  Notions like the sky being red or Nessie being real only seem relatively absurd because large groups of people don't choose to believe them, so they carry little emotional value.  If either of these notions were associated with millions of people providing a sense of belonging and an emotional support group, they wouldn't seem any more absurd (at least to believers) than, say, turning water into wine or getting your own planet when you die.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394303685", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": " This story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago.\n\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty. Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "My best friend growing up lived in an old ass house - like built in the 1700's old. He would always tell stories about how spooky crap would happen, like hearing footsteps and seeing things out of the corner of his eye. He claimed that someone long ago hung themselves in the (now) living room, but all our friends thought he was full of shit, myself included. \n\nSo one weekend night I'm over his house playing video games. His mom was away on business and his older sister was away on a trip and would be returning the next day. As we're playing video games, we hear the front door open and close, and footsteps going up the stairs. My friend says something like, \"Oh, looks like Jess came back a day early.\" \n\nA half hour or so later the phone rings. My friend answers and I see him turn ghost-white. He says something like, \"Wait... you're not at the house?\" It was his sister. She was calling to see if her work called or something. She was still planning on coming home tomorrow. \n\nWe start to freak out. Who or what opened the door and climbed up the stairs? Did we both imagine hearing things? My friend immediately says that its the ghost that's been making noises and has been haunting the house. My crazed, pre-teen mind begins to think the same. \n\nWe eventually calm down a bit, and agree to go upstairs to check it out so we know that there's no such thing as ghosts and it was just the wind making the old house creak. We grab a baseball bat and a knife (as if you could bludgeon and stab a ghost) and head upstairs to make a sweep of the rooms.\n\nWe go to his room first, sweating bullets. We open the door...nothing. We head to his mom's room, then his sister's room... again nothing. There was one room left, a little makeshift study. We open the door, peek around the corner and we see a faint white glow shaped like a person. My friend fucking SCREAMS. Whatever this was heard my friend, and the ghost shape turns around and says, \"Uh, I need about tree-fiddy.\" It was then that I realized that this was no ghost at all, but a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "my friend once told me this story of his heartbreak\n\n&gt;A few years ago I went on a vacation to Disneyland in Anaheim, California with my family. I was 18 years old and a High School Senior and being a high school senior I was horny as fuck. 24/7/365. But I was on vacation for 4 days in California, so I didn't really think about sex as much as I did back at home, I was more focused on the rides and such.\n\n&gt;On our 2nd day there I rode Splash Mountain and I got off the ride and saw the character Belle saying hello to little girls and whatnot, taking pictures, posing, et cetera.\n\n&gt; I usually wouldn't have noticed but the girl in the belle costume was hot as hell, a definite 10/10, I don't think I've ever seen a girl so beautiful in my life. All of the sudden all of my teenage hornyness came back to me, I got a raging boner, and being the meatheaded teenager I was, I decided to go over to her and try to flirt with her.\nI got over there and she looked me in the eyes, I have never once in my life seen eyes as beautiful as her's, they were a deep blue color, with a hint of green, and they enveloped me, absolutely enveloped me.\nI could barely talk, \"H-Hi\" I stammered to her as she broke eye contact, she said hi back awkwardly, in the kind of voice that translated roughly to \"Shit, another one, please go away\"\n\n&gt; I kind of recovered though and we had a great conversation, at the end of the conversation I could tell she was kind of digging me as, not to brag, I have a way with the ladies when it comes to words. I gathered up the courage to ask for her number, and much to my surprise she gave it to me.\n\n&gt; I said goodbye to me, and I looked at my watch.\n\n&gt; Shit. I talked to her for two hours, those were definitely the fastest two hours of my life. So I went about my day lusting on her and going on the rides. (Which were awesome as fuck by the way)\n3rd day in Disneyland, I looked everywhere for her but couldn't find her. After the park closed, much to my dismay, I decided to call her number to see if maybe she was off work.\n\n&gt;No answer.\n\n&gt;Damn it, I was convinced at this point she had given me a phony number.\n\n&gt; I woke up on the 4th day in my hotel, my last day in California. My family got up and we started to go to disneyland again for our final day, I didn't even want to bother looking for \"Belle\" (She never told me her real name). As we were walking out of the hotel I checked my phone for new text messages from friends or something.\n\n&gt;One missed call. From her.\n\n&gt; No words can describe how overjoyed and happy I felt at the moment when I realized that she had called back, I wasn't given a phony number, I called back.\n\n&gt;One ring.\n\n&gt;Two rings.\n\n&gt; Three.\n\n&gt;I almost hung up, figuring she was already at work when someone picked up .\n\n&gt; \"Hello?\" She said in her sweet voice. I talked to her and told her I was sorry I missed her call, I was asleep, she said that she had to work extra yesterday and she said she didn't get back until late.\nI asked her why I didn't see her at the park the previous day, she got shocked and said she thought I was a local, just there for the day, I told her I was in fact on vacation and that today was my last day.\n\n&gt;\"Oh.\" she said, she was obviously disappointed. Then she told me she had to go, and to come talk to her at the park that day.\nRight when I entered disneyland, I went straight over to the area I had seen her before, and sure enough she was there, taking pictures with little girls. I kind of stood a few feet away while she was taking pictures, when she was done she started to walk away and I said \"Hey\"\nShe turned around and saw me. She had the biggest smile on her face when she saw me. We again talked for around an hour, she brushed off any little girl who wanted to get their picture taken with her.\nRandomly, she told me to follow her.\n\n&gt;Ok, that's cool with me. I thought.\n\n&gt;We go to her staff room, she begins kissing me and whispers in my ear \"Fuck me, please\"\n\n&gt;Wowowowow. That was the only thing going through my head at this point. We had amazing sex, she had the best body ever, prettiest face, and the tightest vagina I'd ever felt.\n\n&gt;When we were done she brushed my cheek with her hand and I asked her \"So... are you going to go back to work now?\"\n\"In a little bit,\" she replied, \"I need one more thing though.\"\n\n&gt;\"What do you need?\" I asked. She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\nNow it was about this time that I realized Belle was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That goddamn Loch Ness Monster had got me again.\n\n&gt;I stood there screaming at her as she swam away into the distance.\nEver since then I've REALLY hated belle and disneyland in general.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394414926", "subreddit": "teenagers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I said *similar* not the *same*. Nothing I said is contradicted by anything you said, so the whole \"this is wrong\" bit is ... wrong.\n\nYou can make a lot of valid points about the availability of carbohydrates in the paleolithic era, but to suggest that we ate the same percentage of carbohydrates or even close to it is pure lunacy. I don't think any of the authors of your sources would say that either.\n\non 3: Even wild game which is very lean does actually have a good amount of fat. The fat just isn't marbled into the muscle like our corn fed cattle, but it is near the skin. Nomadic hunter/gatherers will eat everything edible on the animal.\n\non 4. I'm on the fence about the whole legume thing. Mark of mark's daily apple actually has mentioned legumes should be avoided because they're bad, not because of whether or not early humans ate them. (maybe he's said otherwise somewhere else, but his primal blueprint justifies it this way). Again, I'm on the fence and I eat a lot of peanut butter.\n\non 5. All the carb sources you mentioned above is *not* enough carbohydrates to keep a person who walks all day out of ketosis. I am still thoroughly convinced that early man was usually in ketosis.  To get less exercise and remainly (often) in ketosis, we have to eat fewer carbs.  I don't think people need to be in keto 100% of the time, and I don't take anyone's blueprint for keto or paleo as gospel, however, I wholeheartedly disagree that carbohydrates should be 60% of our calories.  \n\nLook at Sweden:\nhttp://healthimpactnews.com/2013/sweden-becomes-first-western-nation-to-reject-low-fat-diet-dogma-in-favor-of-low-carb-high-fat-nutrition/\n\nYou like citations. That committee cited 16000 studies.  I mean maybe they're wrong, but don't act like this whole low-carb thing is some kind of fringe group of crazies who mislead people.\n\nI think you've made a lot of (largely incorrect) assumptions about what I think.

{"body": "I guess I owe you an explanation since I think it was my comment that triggered this question.\n\nWriting can be purely for fun, yes. Things like jokes, limericks, and certain kinds of nonsense poetry have no message, but people still enjoy them. But notice that these are all very short pieces. I believe that the longer a piece gets, the more necessary a message becomes.\n\nMy first point: it boils down to expenditure of time. If I'm going to invest time into reading something, I want to feel like I got something out of it. Think about the Loch Ness Monster jokes on South Park as well as their message board counterparts. Why are they funny? The joke is self-referential. We laugh because the author spent a great deal of time writing something captivating and then blew it all on something essentially meaningless, and in the end there was no resolution and no real message beyond, \"Look how much time you just wasted on nothing, har har.\"\n\nI liked your story but was disappointed that it ended with something so pointless. Other people enjoyed it, so I guess that's worth something. But I'm sure I'm not alone in being a reader that enters into every piece of writing expecting to be changed afterwards.\n\nAnd my second point. **A story can have a message and be entertaining.** Read some Aesop's Fables. They all have messages---hell, they even explain the message at the end of each story. But they're also entertaining, and were written that way on purpose to hold the attention of children. And many are funny, too, and written in a way that ridicules the 'bad' characters. (How could you not laugh at the fox saying, *they're probably sour anyway* after spending an hour trying to reach the bunch of graps? And the story about the donkey who saw how much the master loved his lap dog, and decided to burst into the house so he could sit on his master's lap, too?)\n\nSo what I mean to say is this: every story should have a message, and not because a story is terrible without one---because there's absolutely no reason for it not to. It adds depth to the story, and if it's a good message, it will give the piece a timeless quality.

{"body": "I formerly worked in a college town grocery store and supervised a department of the store. Being a college town most of the employees were younger and many of the girls were pretty good looking. It also seemed the prettier they were the lazier. Anyways, there was this smoking hot blonde who worked in the bakery that I had always had my eye on since I had hired her. She had a boyfriend so I never made a move, it would have been risky enough being her superior. She was pretty good at her job(mostly baking cookies and simple birthday cake decorations) but she never went above and beyond on anything. One day I was sitting in my office going over the week's payroll and she knocked on my door, peeked her head in and asked to talk. She came in and sat down and started making small talk, I instantly noticed something was a little strange only because we usually didn't carry on long conversations and it definitely had a flirtatious feel to it. Eventually the conversation turned back to work and she came out with it. She wanted a raise. I kindly explained to her that I was pleased with how she did her job but that it wasn't a highly skilled position and she never really went out of her way to impress anyone. While I was talking she got up out of her chair and moved around my desk towards me. I was trying to stay calm but in my head I was thinking \"holy shit, is this really happening?\" Once I finished talking she immediately leaned forward over my chair and put her hands on my shoulders, intentionally letting me look down her shirt(she had some amazing, firm breasts) and asked \"surely, there is something I can do to impress you.\" Before I could even reply she stood up and began to take her shirt off. As she was undressing, trying to be as smooth as possible, I asked, \"So what kind of raise are we talking about?\" As she pulled off her shirt she replied, \"I'm gonna need about 3.50.\" That's when I noticed that her work uniform was hiding the body of a green sea creature from the paleolithic era.\n\n\nTL/DR: Offered sex for a raise. got more than I bargained for.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394459635", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Briefly stated, theists say that there's a god, possibly several. You have no need to prove that gods do not or cannot exist; the so-called burden of proof is on them. If someone told you that a meteorite came down on their house last night, you'd ask to see their house, the meteorite and so on. Someone is claiming that this extraordinary phenomenon exists, and you're totally justified in asking \"how do you know?\" And if they can't give you a satisfying answer, you're completely justified in not believing.  You're justified not to believe in leprechauns, in the Loch Ness monster and in trolls living under your bed; all these are just little fantasies that people have thought up that are completely unsubstantiated. The \"trick\" to atheism is that god-belief is no different from leprechaun-belief.\n\n## Arguments for gods\n\n1. **My pastor / neighbors / parents say so.**\n\n    Cool... how do *they* know? Also, the folks in Bombay say something completely different. How can we know who's right?\n\n2. **Billions of people believe in gods!**\n\n    Billions of people believed (long ago) that the Earth is flat. More recently, they believed that the Sun goes around the Earth. Still more recently, they believed that infectious diseases are caused by demons. Billions of people have been proven wrong about lots of things, and I once again point out that they disagree about the nature (and number) of gods, which means most of them are certainly wrong.\n\n3. (channeling Ken Ham:) **\"There's this book...\"**\n\n    The Sumerians wrote books of myths 5000 years ago - and part of those myths later found their way into the Bible. The ancient Greeks wrote books about a pantheon of gods on Mt. Olympus. The Aztecs had books about the sun-god. Books are magical: they can communicate across time any concept that humans can press into language. That includes both factual and fictitious concepts. A book proves nothing.\n\n4. **\"Jesus, he talks to me!\"**\n\n    When it's not a popular god-fantasy, hearing voices in your head is usually a reason to see a shrink. Other than that it's socially acceptable, there's no difference between a god talking to you and any other hallucination.\n\n    Things *could* be radically different: if people really were in communication with some higher being, they could be telling us about things we don't know. They could tell us where Montezuma buried his treasure, where to find a kidnapped child, or (a few centuries ago) to boil our drinking water to prevent disease. Disappointingly, all we ever hear from these folks are things we can't verify, like the width of the gold-paved streets in heaven.\n\n5. **\"We don't know how the universe started!**\n\n    That's true. But we can imagine many possible causes or origin stories. What reason do we have to favor the stories our ignorant ancestors of 2000 (and more) years ago thought up?\n\n6. **\"Proof\" by Philosophy**\n\n    Many philosophical arguments are brought forward to try to substantiate god-belief. The problem is, other than in abstract realms like logic and mathematics, philosophy cannot create knowledge out of thin air. Philosophy needs starting premises, things we already know, to build on. Every philosophical god-argument ever is an exercise in cleverly finding premises that people agree with but are actually unsubstantiated, and extrapolating from those.\n\n    For your reading pleasure, [here is a big list of such arguments, with refutations](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheistgems/comments/egr7o/why_there_is_no_god_quick_responses_to_some/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary: There's no good reason to be convinced by any of these arguments. Their sheer number doesn't make them more credible, that's just a testament to how long how many people have been scrabbling for arguments why we should believe in gods.\n\n**If none of these reasons, carefully considered, convince us, then we're justified in not believing.** It's that simple.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394525070", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Jacob found out about it eight of days ago, when he passed out during a game of hockey with me and my friends. We though he might have just taken one too many hits and had a concussion.

Now with food, not so much with the intense flavor of bourbon.  He tried in sauces, as a base, everything.

I can't just give it to you for free.\"  Anne looked at him strangely and asked, \"Fine...How many coppers would you like for it?\"  And Bourbon replied, \"I need about tree fiddy\" and that's when Anne realized Bourbon was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era and replied, \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy you goddamn Lochness monster.\"\n\n\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394585747", "subreddit": "FoodPorn", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

My God delusion book was neatly stacked on top of my medical textbooks reminding me that science was the answer to everything and that faith was for people who I slowly began to realise, intellectually challenged.\n\n One night I was just lying in bed looking out of the window and seeing the stars in the sky. Passages in the God delusion kept assaulting my conscious mind and I knew I had reached a breaking point. I got up, grabbed the book and approached my roommate. \"How much did you pay for this book?\" I asked him. \"About tree fiddy\" he replied. At this moment, I realised my roommate was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "&gt; Does anyone know of a comprehensive list of evidence that supports that God does not exist?\n\nIt's probably more the absolute absence of any evidence that gods *do* exist. There's nothing but the Bible (and Quran, Torah, whatever) and people who say that \"this is so,\" which isn't the evidence but the claim. Religion flies in the face of everything he sees and experiences every day of his life, in nature, generation upon generation of scientific evidence, and then he's expected to believe in something he can't see the slightest proof of just because people want him to believe it. There isn't really such a thing as a comprehensive list of evidence that supports that God doesn't exist, for the exact same reason that there's no such list of evidence against unicorns or the Loch Ness monster. There's innumerable pieces of scientific evidence that completely and utterly disprove almost every single aspect of every religion, but it's not really in a tidy list form that you can skim and quickly digest.\n\n&gt; My son expresses intense hate toward anything religious.\n\nHe's starting to become conscious of the fact that a great many of the wrongs of the world are caused by religion, in the name of religion, or by people who use religion as an excuse for their wrongdoings. He's a teenager so he doesn't quite have the most rational of worldviews, which is probably why he's still coming to terms with his own parents' religion. He's old enough to start to become aware of just how much evil has been inflicted upon humanity as a result of religion, but still too young to quite figure out where his own family's beliefs fit into this spectrum. In all likelihood, it's just the way that teenage rebellion and contrariness has happened to manifest for him, and it'll pass (probably not the atheism, but the hostility towards everything religious) the same way teenage rebellion always does. You shouldn't take it too personally, it's human nature.\n\n&gt; I monitor his electronic communications as part of ensuring his online activity does not violate borders we have put up\n\nThis is very alarming and an extreme violation of a teenager's rights. I hope you'll reconsider this. It's very much the same as insisting on, say, reading his diary and going through his drawers every week to make sure he doesn't \"have something we don't want him to have.\" He has a need for privacy and it's very, very uncomfortable for me to read about you monitoring his electronic communications. They are every bit as private as his phone calls, his personal conversations with friends, his letters and so on. In my opinion, this almost approaches the point of abuse. Would you demand to read all his mail in order to make sure his communication is within your own comfort zone? That would be just as wrong, but is an example that might better resonate with your generation.\n\nTeach him what not to do, don't impose on his privacy. Your \"borders\" are not as important as his right to privacy, and while you may not have grown up with electronic communication, it is to him as much a part of his human interaction as conversations in the school cafeteria. You wouldn't plant a microphone in his clothes (hopefully), so don't impose on his online conversations. He's not a small child, trust his judgment. It might even contribute to his hostility towards religion if he perceives your monitoring of his online habits as a violation that he suffers because his parents are religious, whether or not that actually happens to be the case.\n\n&gt; Lastly, how do I counsel him in things that I think go beyond whether you believe in God or not? Things like \"don't do drugs,\" \"abortion is wrong,'\" and \"don't have sex before marriage\"\n\nWell, he's of an age now where you should simply tell him how you feel about things, and inform him of the consequences of any given action. First inform yourself, of course, so that you're actually teaching him correctly and not filling him with bogus. Watch documentaries (with or without him) and tell him how things like drugs can ruin a person's life, for instance. As for your other examples, I can't really say that I think it would be right to teach a person not to have sex before marriage in the year 2014, because it's just not a tenet that belongs in today's society, and your views on abortion are neither terribly pertinent to him as a boy nor something I think you should press upon him as it is a religious view that is in no way beneficial to him in life -- quite the contrary, it could absolutely destroy his life if he does happen to get someone pregnant at too young an age and you were to insist that he become a father at fifteen or whatever.

{"body": "[The Loch Ness Monster (Scottish Gaelic: Niseag) is a cryptid that is reputed to inhabit Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next. Popular interest and belief in the animal has varied since it was brought to the world's attention in 1933. Evidence of its existence is anecdotal, with minimal and much-disputed photographic material and sonar readings.\\nThe most common speculation among believers is that the creature represents a line of long-surviving plesiosaurs. The scientific community regards the Loch Ness Monster as a modern-day myth, and explains sightings as a mix of hoaxes and wishful thinking. Despite this, it remains one of the most famous examples of cryptozoology. The legendary monster has been affectionately referred to by the nickname Nessie (Scottish Gaelic: Niseag) since the 1950s.\\nThe term \\\"monster\\\" was reportedly applied for the first time to the creature on 2 May 1933 by Alex Campbell, the water bailiff for Loch Ness and a part-time journalist, in a report in the Inverness Courier.

{"body": "&gt; /u/FaerieStories , even in your dictionary link there are more definitions of the word as used to simply mean \"expressing something false\" than there are references to knowingly doing so. Do we need to go farther on this?\n\nIt puzzles me that these definitions are there. Are they outdated? I honestly have never encountered the term before now to mean anything other than telling a falsehood with intent. If we say that 'lie' can be both with and without intent - the word becomes not quite an antonym, but certainly an incredibly strangely contradictory one.\n\n&gt;A choice, as an action, involves doing something that will change a belief. Yes? Then that choice is what changes the belief. You can actually sit there and work over ideas in your head and change your beliefs. Your assertion that people think someone can actively change their brain chemistry with a thought that isn't a choice but it supposed to act like one seems like a straw man\n\nIf it's a straw man, then your issue should not be with my logic - it should be with whether you think my thread is or is not relevant. You're right: I'm asserting that it is impossible to 'choose our beliefs', we can only choose to do or think other things which may affect our beliefs. \n\n&gt;Do you have an example? For instance, in your example of people making tea to changing beliefs, it seems obvious to me that someone is saying \"make tea\" as in \"choose to make tea, get up, get the tea, etc\" in the same way they'd say \"choose to change your belief\" to mean \"consider this information, make memories about it, evaluate it, etc.\"\n\nThere are two, slightly separate points I have to this\n\n1) \"Choosing to change my belief\" is a strawman of *my* argument, because it is not the topic of conversation here. I can \"choose to change my belief\" insofar as I can choose to alter my stimuli which may affect my belief, yes. I've said as much right from my very first post:\n\n*\"I may not believe in the existence of the loch ness monster (and as a result I cannot choose to believe in the loch ness monster) - but I can choose to read a book about the loch ness monster, which might convince me that it exists.\"*\n\nI am saying I cannot *choose my belief*. The only thing I can do is indirectly change it by choosing to do something that may or may not change it. I can choose to pick up a book about penguins and therefore believe things about penguins. I cannot choose to believe those things about penguins directly.  \n\n2) This is nonetheless an over-simplification, because even though *in theory*, one could 'choose to change their belief' like they could 'choose to go and make tea', I am arguing that the outcome is not certain. There's no guarantee that there'll be any tea there. It's a 'choice' that cannot be based on any sort of certainty, because if I believe that I am *going to believe* something before I hear it - that means that I already essentially believe it, and so there is no process of 'believing' actually needed. I could though, of course, only believe in it mildly, and believe this new stimuli will allow me to believe it more fully. \n\n&gt;Also, I am not complicating this. Any theory you have is going to have a lot of ways to look at it, and I was happy to help you look at it logically, neurologically, or any way that helps show how your idea really functions.\n\nApologies, I didn't mean to be snappy.

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. \n\nCTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed.\n\nWait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism.

{"body": "A neighbor from the block of 6 flats I was living in had a very loud argument with herself late one night. The neighbors above her (beside my flatmate and I) eventually got sick of it and went out to tell her to shut up. This turned into a drawn-out screaming match, which I recorded the audio of, in case she got threatening again (it was far from the first time she'd had one of these episodes). \n\nWell, turned out, she was in the mood for kicking up shit tonight. \"You want me to get my brick? Come up there and *get you*!\" she said. And that's what she did. She took the carving knife (long, triangular, in damn near every kitchen) and a brick upstairs, smashed her way into the neighbors place and tried to get satisfaction. The noped the fuck out of there, jumping from their rear balcony to the ground below before fucking the hell off down the street calling for someone to get the cops there. \n\nMoments after I watched them run past below me from on the balcony which connects the upper row of three, crazy bitch comes out and sees me. Target acquired. I noped back inside and locked the door in one fluid and fruitless motion, and grabbed the closest approximation of a weapon; a nearby staff (from a cosplay... shut up) in an attempt to be intimidating should she come in anyhow. Well, she let herself in in the now twice practiced way (she'd let herself into the neighbors below where I lived about a fortnight before, because she couldn't find her cell phone or milk powder, therefore the neighbor had taken them) and made some comment before attempting to stab me. \n\nHaving a knife actually thrust in my direction was indication it was time to be elsewhere. I leapt gracefully and nimbly (damn near teleported) to behind a door at the next defensible position. Unfortunately for me, the door opened outward to where I was. Worse, it was a knob, not a handle. Worse still, it was covered in fake gold Mr T chains (shut up, shut up, my life was interesting in college). I held on as best I could while she tried to pull the door open. Fear of a crazy person with a knife, as it turns out, lets you hold on quite well, in spite of other things going on. \n\nMy flatmate joined me (having been quietly hunkering down in his room) and we both hid in a bedroom, with a bed against the door as we tried to get cops there ourselves (about 20-something minutes since the drama first escalated). We could hear her saying something about how she was so angry that her mother sent her to live with her Auntie and Uncle half a world aware after they got into one little fight. How was she supposed to be fresh under such difficult circumstances? It was about that time that I realized she was a giant monster from the paleolithic era when she asked if we had...\n\nNot really. After my flatmate and I barricaded ourselves in a room, we listened to her throwing our TV on the ground, our standing cabinet (which was covered in CDs) thrown on the TV, computers thrown from our desks, our table of Magic cards flipped, and even our laundry on the back balcony torn down and thrown at the neighbors. We didn't get to see any of this until after the drama had calmed down. \n\nThe cops eventually showed up, along with an ambulance. As it turned out, I ninja'd out of a stabbing by the nearest of margins (there was an outline of the knife, done in her blood, on my shirt), but the only injuries ultimately suffered were by her. She was (finally) evicted after this incident and we spent the next long while putting everything back together.

{"body": "Pertha sat in the seat facing the temple door. He looked at Stacy. Where was her man? It was he who he wanted. It was he who carried the stone of power. He tightened his grip on Stacy's arm. She squeaked and pleaded him to let go.\n\n\"Quiet human! I will not let go, your pleas land upon hard ears.\" He chuckled to himself. \"Oh shit... Get it? Hard ears... I'm made of stone...\"\n\nStacy looked up at him, and Pertha offered her a rocky smile. Stacy returned the smile.\n\n\"Did you mean to say that?\"\n\n\"No, haha... it just sort of came out.\"\n\n\"That's actually pretty funny.\"\n\n\"Heh, thanks.\" They held each other's gaze a tad longer than Pertha was comfortable with.\n\n\"Uhm, ahermm, where is Tobias, human woman? Did he not hear of my challenge to him?\"\n\n\"You smashed open our home and yelled it to his face, Pertha. I'm sure he got the message.\"\n\n\"But what if he didn't?\"\n\n\"I'm sure he did. Tobias may be stupid, but he's not deaf.\"\n\n\"Hmm... Do you think my skeleton guards got him?\"\n\n\"I dunno, they seemed pretty flimsy to me. I bet Tobias got through them just fine.\"\n\n\"The mountain, though, perhaps it swallowed him up, perhaps wolves attacked him, perhaps he got lost on the way here... Oh, what if he comes here and doesn't even have the stone of power with him? What a waste of time this will have all been. What a stupid, stupid plan I have made... Stupid, stupid stupid...\" Pertha let go of Stacy and held his head in his arms as tears of sand streamed down his rocky cheeks. \"Why am I even doing this? I never asked to be a rock monster! I don't wanna be a monster... Not anymore, I'm sick of it!\"\n\nPerth felt a sensation on his arm. He looked up and realized it was Stacy's hand rubbing him.\n\n\"I think it was a very good plan, Pertha. Honestly, I couldn't have pulled it off any better myself.\"\n\nPertha looked at Stacy, his eyes blue (stone monster's eyes turn blue when they cry). \"You really mean that?\"\n\nStacy said. \"I do.\"\n\nPertha grabbed his legs and rocked back and forth slightly. \"I don't want to be a monster.\"\n\n\"You don't have to be.\"\n\n\"But I am.\"\n\n\"I don't think you are.\"\n\nThey gazed into each other's eyes a moment longer, before Stacy jumped on top of him, embracing his surprised, rocky lips with her own.\n\nTobias burst through the temple door, his sword in hand, and his yell of triumph and adrenaline changed pitch into one of bewilderment and disappointment. Stacy hopped off Pertha as quick as she could, but he had seen, they both knew, and they both had sheepishly guilty looks on their faces.\n\n\"YEEEEEEAAHHHHaaaawwhat the hell. Again Stacy? Really? Again?\"\n\n\"Tobias wait...\"\n\n\"First Nessie, then the Minitar, now Pertha the rock monster?\"\n\n\"Toby...\"\n\nPertha looked at Stacy. \"I thought you said I was your first monster...\"\n\nStacy looked at both of them. \"I can explain...\"\n\nPertha wrinkled his nose. \"The minitar? Really? He's... He's disgusting! He uses his own feces for body wash, you know. That's no legend.\"\n\nStacy got a fair, far-away look on her face. \"Yeah...\" She sighed.\n\nPertha grunted in disgust. \"You vile woman!\" \n\nTobias raised his sword in agreement. \"Here, here! Stacy, we are through. I'm sick of it! No more wearing masks in bed for your pleasure! No more strap-on tails and horns, we are soooo over!\"\n\nStacy started crying. \"I don't need you anyway, boo! I got Pertha now!\"\n\n\"Oh no you don't\", Pertha said as he sidestepped her advance. \"I'm out of here. You's a bitch and you know it. TOBIAS! I think I owe you a drink sir. Would you care to accompany me to a bar?\"\n\n\"You owe me a wall too, you son of a bitch.\"\n\n\"Hahah! That I do sir, that I do!\" \n\nPertha put his rocky arm around Tobias' shoulder as they made their way through the temple door down to the village pub.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394685063", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Anyway one day she wears these really short shorts, like against school code short, I could not stop looking. Anyway, I was talking in class and I got in a little trouble, so what happened next was she told me to stay after class. After class she paced back and forth to the board, I kept staring and she caught me, she gasped \"AW HAH!\" at this point she knew I looked at her rear end. She asked me if I liked her butt and I told her I did, as she began to slowly take off her short shorts, she seductively whispers, \"I want something from you, I need it bad\". \"Anything\" I respond, she then says \"I need about tree fiddy\" it was about this point in time that I noticed that she was not my teacher but in fact she was a five hundred foot tall monster from the paleolithic era.

I get about 4,500 feet when the engine splutters. The entire cockpit starts getting quieter and everything is telling me \"HOLY SHIT BALLS WE IS GONNA DIE\".\n\nNow this instructor, who in hindsight was an amazing teacher, just turned to me and said \"well?\".

He MIGHT want his species to be restored, provided they're in their pre-Time War state. Cirno would just see it as proof that she's the STRONGEST. Nepeta and the Demoman would be the most motivated by the prize (Nepeta wants Karkat for her matesprit. The Demoman wants his missing eye back.)\n\nSonic stands absolutely no chance here. Yes, I am aware of how powerful he is, but, and this is the important thing, Sonic will never kill if he can avoid it.\n\nThe Doctor has killed before (ESPECIALLY the War Doctor), so... It depends on how motivated he is.\n\nCirno, as mentioned, is just trying to prove she's the STRONGEST. She has flight and bullet hell. If she can stay outside of grenade range and rain down her spellcards, she might win this... Provided she doesn't use Icicle Fall easy, of course.\n\nNepeta is a powerful melee combatant with those claws. After all, her DAILY ROUTINE is hunting animals, and she's only her species' equivalent of 13 years old (Her species does not use years. But by our standards, she'd be 13 years old). No ranged attacks, though, so...\n\nThe Demoman has a grenade launcher, and the eyelander. If he can land killing blows with it he'll become faster and more durable. The grenades do have a limited range, however...\n\nI guess if they see Cirno trying to fly out of their reach they'll team up on her. Maybe Sonic would just keep her low, while not going for the kill. The Demoman isn't morally bound and would seek direct hits with grenades. Any misses that hit hte others would help to. If Cirno is unable to escape and is defeated, then it comes down to the melee combatants.\n\nIf The Doctor isn't that motivated, he'd try to find a way to get everyone out. And probably be killed by Nepeta and the Demoman, as would Sonic.\n\nSo it comes down to the troll vs the black drunk Scottish cyclops (The Demoman's own words. Watch Meet The Demoman.)\n\nThe Demoman has the range advantage (the Eyelander has an increased melee range compared to all other melee weapons in TF2 except the Horseless Headless Horsemann's Headtaker and Nessie's Nine Iron, which are basically reskins of the Eyelander anyway, and he has the nade launcher, assuming that he didn't run out of them trying to shoot down Cirno), but Nepeta is more evasive.\n\nI'd say chances of success are;\n\nSonic: 0/10\n\nThe Doctor: 4/10 if sufficiently motivated, otherwise 0/10\n\nCirno: 10/10 if she can get out of range of everyone else, otherwise 0/10\n\nNepeta: 5/10 if she and the Demoman are last ones standing\n\nDemoman: 5/10 if he and Nepeta are last ones standing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394792010", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

When we access a memory, we're essentially reconstructing it in our brains, and every time we do this, we alter the memory slightly without evening knowing it. Because beliefs come first and reasons come after, memories can change dramatically in our brains and we're completley oblivious to it.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that this is necessarily the case for you. But it is part of the reason why personal accounts of UFOs simply don't mean much.

{"body": "I'm swimming in a lagoon inlet of a giant ocean. The whole ocean has these spires of land jutting out of it that are uninhabited, except for the one i'm in. The lagoon is shallow enough to stand in, but i'm swimming in it just under the water. Coral of every color surround me and the whole feel is like [Besaid](http://www.electricblueskies.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Final-Fantasy-X-10-Wallpaper-set-2-Besaid-02-LANDSCAPE.jpg) from FFX. I pop up out of the water and there's 2 girls standing on a balcony that over looks the lagoon. One is a little younger than I am while the other is maybe 8 years old. I exit the lagoon and join them on the balcony. We are talking but I can't make out anything until a door opens loudly. Out comes their father holding a rifle like [This](http://image1.shopserve.jp/airgun-web.com/pic-labo/GF85-GS.jpg?t=20110721225855). The girls tell me to run as he starts shooting at me. I dive off the lagoon and hit my shoulder really badly on the bottom. I make it out to sea and start swimming towards one spire. I'm pretty fucked up, but I make it to the land and start climbing to the top of it. At the top of the spire is this large clockwerk like structure with swinging brass pendulums and machinery. It's unfathomably huge, but I begin to make my way up it. Timing jumps and moving from cog to pendulum to moving bar and whatnot. As I get higher the options become less and less until i'm right at the top where I  have a series of very well timed moves to make it to the top. I pull them off pretty well, but slip on the last one because I'm still wet. I give the bar a bear hug and get my chest on it with my legs dangling off. I get myself up on it, and my last challenge is to walk across this thin strip to my prize at the end. I complete that very slowly to find these scuba flippers. I put them on my feet and stand at the edge, looking into the ocean below. With no second thought I jump and splash into the water after a huge descent. I then swim around at fucking max speed with dolphins and whales and I'm jumping out of the water like a dolphin. I'm doing flips and somersaults and spinning around in the air. I dive to great depths and see all the coral and fauna of the ocean and I'm ecstatic. I proceed to give the loch ness monster his tree fiddy. Just kidding, I wake up.

{"body": "Don't worry brother, they will see your rationality some day just as I have. It's precisely posts like this that slowly started to eat away at my diminishing faith. I was born in a typical evangelical Christian family and faithfully attended church every Sunday. We used to have prayers at home all those kinda thing and I was never really taught to question Scripture nor had I ever the intention of doing so.\nFast forward to a few years ago, I got accepted into medical school. I realised once I came out of the bubble that was my small home town, faith started to present more and more questions. My peers were largely uninterested in religion and frankly speaking those that were were a little weird. Nevertheless I put a lot of time and effort in and started a home Bible study group for students, basically a \"model christian student\" so to say. I think you guys know what I mean.\n\nTime went by and I started having a lot of doubts. I used to lurk around subreddits like this and found that atheists raised many interesting questions. Questions that I have never even thought about. I began to ponder questions. What is God's own purpose and meaning? Was the earth really created in 7 days? Are our human bodies really a result of intelligent design. I remember looking through pathology slides of animal and human tissue and as far as I could see, the differences were miniscule. Christian responses on these questions also seemed lame at best.\n\nThe christian god at times seemed vindictive even violent. I could not understand why people would worship him let alone believe that he was the source of all objective morality. I was struggling daily with my intellectual reasoning.\n\nI began to read books like Richard Dawkins's The God Delusion and Sam Harris's The end of faith. My roommate who was an ardent atheist sat down with me for many civil debates. In fact the books were his and he had no hesitation lending them to me. Surprisingly enough I found myself nodding every two or three pages in. The logic was cold as it was convincing. I was pretty convinced I had finally found the nails to nail shut the coffin of faith in my heart once and for all. I even brought these books to my youth pastor and watched sadly as he tried to explain some of the dilemmas away that the books posed. His answers mostly revolved around the fact that Gods will is good and every thing was for the best. \"Try telling that to the children who were dashed on the rocks\" I thought.\n\nBare in mind this was a very difficult time for me. I was raised in the faith and had no where to go. To totally shut out something that had been such an integral part of my life for so long felt essentially the same as donating one of my kidneys away. What would my parents think as well? Would they diswon me for joining the other side so to say. I became disillusioned with church and stop attending altogether. When church members came around to visit me, I raised questions from books that I knew they had no idea how to answer. My God delusion book was neatly stacked on top of my medical textbooks reminding me that science was the answer to everything and that faith was for people who I slowly began to realise, intellectually challenged.\n\nOne night I was just lying in bed looking out of the window and seeing the stars in the sky. Passages in the God delusion kept assaulting my conscious mind and I knew I had reached a breaking point. I got up, grabbed the book and approached my roommate. \"How much did you pay for this book?\" I asked him. \"About tree fiddy\" he replied. At this moment, I realised my roommate was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. Looking in the mirror, i tipped my fedora and realised it was time to shave my neckbeard.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394842127", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "All these years of chasing mythical beasts around the world and never catching anything on film but shadows and muffled static were taking their toll on my faith. Sure, I could tell you about the time I chased Bigfoot through the mountains of Colorado, or the days I spent frantically hiding from a hungry Chupacabra in the Mexican jungle, but why would you believe me? There's no evidence but my ramblings, which were starting to sound crazy even to myself. But this is what I was made for, to fearlessly catalogue the evolutionary outliers that twisted the reports of men into legend and hyperbole. So I found myself floating along through Loch Ness on this crisp fall day, trying to catch Nessie on film. \n\nIt had been a dull outing. While the scenery was majestic, the air cool and the sightseeing tremendous, there were no creatures outside of the usual that I had been able to photograph. I was getting ready to call it a day until I heard the screaming.\n\nLooking at the shore, there were two children frantically waving for me to come closer. I fought through the calcium deposits on my old joints to row over to the shore, disembarking as the soft ground squished beneath my feet. What on Earth do we have here?\n\n\"Mister, mister! What is this?\"\n\nMy God. It was her.\n\nNessie had been ripped to pieces, her entrails spilling out from a gory wound from her gut. Her head and neck were gone, burns around where they used to be. But it was her. The flippers were there, the hard scales worn down from thousands of years of existence. Nothing else could look like this, could be this size. \n\nI started taking pictures, ignoring the demonic howling coming from the hills.\n\n\"You kids need to get out of here. You know what this is, don't you?\"\n\nThe two boys nodded, fear in their eyes.\n\n\"Of course. The Loch Ness Monster. My parents give tours here for the outsiders. But I...I never thought she was real.\"\n\n\"As real as the sky above you, kids. Get out of here. Whatever did this must be...\"\n\nThere it was again, the howling coming closer. I looked at the trees, and the entire woodlands around us started collapsing. Massive, ancient trees falling down like they were but stalks of wheat in a field being pushed aside by a farmer's hand. The kids were gone, panicking and sprinting away. I couldn't move; my mind wouldn't let my fearful body take one step away from the corpse of Nessie. Snapping as many pictures as I could, Nessie's killer emerged from the woods.\n\n\"The Worm of Linton. Magnificent.\" \n\nWingless unlike many dragons, the Worm looked at me with the contempt of a beast that knew it's superiority to the supposed master species of this planet. Like a snake, it coiled up as it's head adorned with three horns rose up into the air. It roared as it dove down to devour me in a storm of fire and teeth.\n\nGood thing this camera is nearly indestructible. Whoever finds this is going to be in for quite the surprise.

{"body": "It smelled like goddamn rotten eggs and the shithouse his da had refused to tear down despite his ma's orders. Despite the chill of the morning the putrid scent seemed to ooze through every crack and hole in his doors and windows, and finally at ten o'clock on that March morning he left his broken down shack to find out just what the hell was going on and who he could yell at to make it stop.\n\nThe first thing he noticed upon going outside was that it was quiet. It would almost be a relief, some quiet when normally the town was hustling and bustling with them damn tourists, but combined with the awful stench all he could think was that something was seriously wrong. No cars puttered back and forth on the winding road in front of his bungalow, and that cow next door didn't even greet him like she normally did. She did make great pear and blueberry pie though, so he never complained about her too loud.\n\nGrabbing his cane from the nail on the wall he'd hammered in just for the purpose, loudly of course for the benefit of his neighbors, he headed off on the short and muddy path to town, and ultimately the loch. He hated living in this town, by the Loch Ness, especially now, but he had no money and without Jeannie he had no desire. He just wanted to die in this hellhole, preferably eaten by Nessie just to screw with the tourists. His lady love had seen the old bitch once, but that was all. He'd thought it was just an old crow seeing things, and told Jeannie so. Sleeping on the couch for a week had been worth the look on her face. The monster was all just a tourist trap and anyone who believed otherwise was a goddamn fool and deserved to be told so. Jeannie had loved the mystique though, and had died believing in what she'd seen. Goddamn fool.\n\nToday, though, it was different. It seemed like all of the tourists who normally littered the hole were gone, and even the shopkeepers had closed their doors and flipped their signs to 'closed'. Looking for another soul was useless, so instead he followed his nose. It was big and bulbous, and Jeannie had been fond of pointing out. \"All the better to smell you with, my dear,\" had always been his reply, to her everlasting delight. Today the scent he picked up wasn't strawberries, like Jeannie had always smelled like, but rot. Flesh and blood and mucus. \n\nThey were all standing on the beach, every last one of the goddamn fools, blocking him from seeing what was on the beach. A vague, gray outline and pink? Squinting his eyes didn't help, they'd never been good and his glasses had a big crack in them now. Good for nothing, just like everything else. But as he got closer, and the people stepped away from the crazy mumbler from just down the road, he got an eyeful.\n\nBlack, yes, and pink of flesh. It was huge, like the whales he'd seen with Jeannie on the Alaskan cruise almost thirty years prior. Oh how she had loved those whales. She would love this, now. Nessie, the old gal, had finally decided to grace them with her presence. Or most of her presence. She wasn't quite fully 'there', now. Jeannie would have loved to see her, finally. Damned old crow wasn't so blind and batshit insane in the end. He'd never admit it.\n\nThe tourists were chirping, becoming anxious. Something about closing the beaches, scouring the loch and saving the children. Bah, goddamned fools. They'd never find the monster. It was all just a tourist trap anyways. The only thing left in the loch was his old crow and lady love, Jeannie herself.\n\n \"Sorry Jeannie girl, I guess I might've been wrong.\" Maybe he was the goddamn fool this time.\n\nEdit: This sent before I could finish it, excuse any errors I was on my phone!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394896590", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

I guess the rumors about the Loch Ness Monster were true after all.\" \n\n\nI looked at the bloated grey corpse with its belly torn open, leaking putrid blood and chunks of tissue and organs onto the sand. The long neck attached to the decimated torso led to the dragon like head of the infamous creature. It's mouth opened, tongue sticking out over razor sharp teeth. Its mouth curled down in what my younger mind personified as an expression of torment. \n\n\nWhat happened to it, daddy?\" My dad was the smartest person in the world.

{"body": "*\"Do you belief in the Loch Ness Monster?\"*  \n \n*No, of course not, or at least I didn't use to. And yet I always started my tours around the lake with this simple question. I still like to see the tourists reactions.* \n*In general it's the older people who do. Those who come here to find her. To be the one who caught her on tape. \nSchool classes or students on a tour through the country come here as well. Mainly because the lake is one of the most well know places in Scotland. They never believe, or when they do they don't tell.* \n \n*Let me tell you what convinced me that Nessie used to be real, but is no longer with us.* \n \nIt is a sunny afternoon at the end of may. I welcome a group of college students on my little tour boat. As always I start my tour by asking them if they belief in the Monster and as usual all of them decline. \nI start the motor and start driving towards the middle of the lake in complete silence. I know what's bound to happen, on of the girls will ask if I belief in it. It is always the girls who get curious and they will always giggle when I assure them that I've seen it with my very own eyes. \nPeople are so predictable. \nI go ahead and tell them a tale of that rainy day when I was a little boy and went for a swim even though my parents forbade me and where I saw it and I thought it was going to eat me but nobody believed me afterwards. \nThe story is all made up, but I'm not getting paid to tell the truth. I'm here to entertain people. \n \n*Little did I know that this day wasn't going to end as usual. I really would have expected something like would happen on a stormy day where your mind plays tricks on you and your eyes see shadows in the waves* \n \nAs I drive my boat around the lake I tell stories about the monster, about nature and the great history of Scotland. I mention the great distillery in the next village, I actually get paid to do so, it's an agreement I made years ago and it is nice to get a little extra on the side. \n \nI steer the boat to a secluded bay at the west side near the mouth of the river Enrick where I usually stop for a small brake for the tourists to take pictures. But today the beach wasn't empty as usual. \nA huge gray-ish lump was laying at the waters edge, thinking nothing of it I turn around and drive to a different bay. Nothing ruins tips like missing an opportunity to take pictures. \nWhen I land I tell the students that they have 15 minutes to walk around while I'll go refuel. I won't refuel, obviously. I have to see what's lying on my beach. \n \nI start the engine and in close to no time I reach the other bay again. I draw closer and I'm hit by a stench that's worse than anything I've ever smelled. The air was buzzing with flies and when I finally reach the lump I can only make out tons and tons of insects crawling and flying around it. \n \nWhatever this thing is, it is dead. And it has probably been lying here for a couple of hours. \n \nI get some gloves out of my tool box I always have under deck and wipe through the insects. underneath is a scale, like a fish scale, or a lizard scale. Just way bigger. Each scale has about the size of my palm. Whatever this thing was, it had to be huge. Way bigger than this lump of insects. \n \n*I thought about what to do with it, call the police to check it out or maybe get a sample to have it analyzed in a laboratory.* \n \n*But then again, did I really want to know what it was? What if it was Nessie and I found her dead? What if destiny decided that I'm the one to find her, dead, on the beach.* \n \n*Well I hesitated and decided that it was Nessie and that I don't want to know otherwise* \n \nAfter a silent moment I head back to my boat, promising that I will give Nessie a proper burial as soon as I brought the tourists back to their hotel. \n \nI drive them back up and return to the beach where I find the big grey heap next to an other boat. It's one of the other tour boats and my friend scot stands in front of the carcass that smells even worse than before. When I land my boat and walk to him he turns and looks me dead in the eye. \n \n\"It's her, isn't it?\" \n \nI only nod in response and stand next to him. This is really it.

I gave him his three fifty, because a bet is a bet, even if you were betting against a monster. I looked him square in the eye and the last thing I said to Nessie were \"well played Monster, well played\" \n \n^(I'm so sorry but I just had to)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394920530", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I live and work in London, so I do NOT like to go to Scotland at very short notice.  The reasons for this are threefold: firstly, it takes hours and when I need to be there quickly they stick me in a military helicopter which is fast but desperately uncomfortable; as a Civil Servant from London I'm generally not all that welcome; I never pack the right clothes.\n\nConsequently, I'm stuck in the back of a fast car, deafened by sirens and driven at breakneck speed to RAF Benson, stuck in the back of a Puma and flown to Scotland by the route most likely to resemble a rollercoaster and then jammed into the passenger seat of a Landrover Defender for a boneshaking run to the Loch.  It turns out the Defender really does have a bench seat and no suspension, but this is possibly because it's ex-Forestry Commission vehicle pool stock.\n\nDuring all this I'm supposed to read the briefing material on BLUE SURGEON.\n\nPeople have been spotting Nessie, on and off, since the 1930s.  The regular appearances have drawn people to the black mirror surface of Loch Ness for decades, each one of them secretly hoping for a face to face with the monster, although the constant presence of sonar-wielding monster hunters was thought to have driven Nessie away, or into the depths of the Loch because he/she/it hadn't made an appearance in a while.\n\nFrankly, this was a source of relief to my department.  There are only so many hoax exposes one can dream up.\n\nHaving the corpse of Nessie turn up, having quite clearly been turned into lunch by something else, is not what anyone wanted or needed.\n\nHaving been sent here at no notice, and having been dragged out of a meeting wearing a Brooks Brothers suit, it is - of course - raining when I reach the Loch.  A member of the local constabulary takes pity on me after only a few minutes and equips me with a waterproof high-vis jacket and I thank him before making my way to the corpse.\n\nThe lads from Inverness have erected a tent to keep prying eyes away from the gore, which is just as well.  I make my way to the Bronze commander, a desperately unhappy looking Detective Inspector Wallace, and announce my presence.  He brightens considerably.\n\n\"I take it this means you're now Gold command?\" He looks hopeful.  It's not easy to keep a lid on things like this, and apparently the Inverness Police were told to secure the area and wait for the experts, so someone in London decided to short circuit the usual chain of authority and now we have three dozen coppers who could be better employed elsewhere soaking up rain and overtime with no one in overall charge to tell them what to do next.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I say \"Gold is still officially in London.  I'm here to make an assessment and recommendations.  You're still Bronze commander until someone says otherwise.\"\n\n\"Wonderful\" says Wallace.  I feel his pain.\n\n\"Can I see the body?\"\n\n\"Of course.  We weren't sure whether to give SOCO a chance to play with the thing...\"\n\nThat's not a surprising comment.  Do you look for forensic evidence?  Isn't this just a tussle between animals?\n\n\"Maybe after I've had a quick look?\" I say and step over the tape marking a perimeter around the body.\n\nClose up it's pretty much as grim as you might imagine.  It smells of meat and Loch water, which isn't too bad, but that's not what makes me immediately unhappy.\n\nI'd been hoping that the wound pattern would indicate either teeth or propellers or even a harpoon.  A big critter means Nessie fell foul of something we know about, or at least something we can deal with conventionally.  An accidental killing because Nessie got too close to a boat is something the BLUE Committee can sort out later.  But this is just worrying.\n\nSomething had taken a metre wide section out of Nessie's torso.  The section sides are smooth and, to my dismay, cauterised.  You could do this with a laser if Nessie were to sit still for it, and if you could drag a laser and accompanying power source to the Loch, and then get Nessie to come up out of the water and pose for you.   The fact that this is the only wound, that it was immediately fatal and that there are no defensive wounds anywhere on the corpse mean that this was over really quickly.  I don't know too many things that can do this sort of damage.\n\nI walk back to D.I. Wallace, a man who is about to hear me announce the end of his career but doesn't know it yet. He's sipping tea from a silver thermal mug.\n\n\"Detective Inspector, I think we need to treat this as an act of terror.  I'm relieving you as Bronze Commander but I would appreciate your co-operation and continued presence on scene.\"\n\n\"An act of terror?  Are you kidding me?  Are you suggesting that Al Quaeda assassinated the Loch Ness Monster?\"\n\nI nod, which about puts the cap on his day, but his issues are fairly low down on my worry list.\n\n\"I'll explain later, Detective Inspector.  For now, I need you to pull together a team of large animal veterinary surgeons, a marine biologist and a paleontologist who has a focus on marine fossils.  We need to get this corpse looking like a Plesiosaur before the press get here.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394922965", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Daniel clicked the Upload button on YouTube, sent his NerdCubed video on its long voyage through the internet, then turned back towards Emma.\n\n\"Well that's over and done with!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"You don't think they'll suspect we're actually...\" Emma began to ask before Dan moved his finger softly towards her mouth to hush her voice.\n\n\"Shhhhh, don't worry.\" Dan replied. \"They won't suspect a thing.\" He grabbed Emma, pulled her into his embrace and the two began to share a long, passionate and deep kiss. Dan placed one of his hands across Emma's wide hip and moved the other behind her back, gently and subtly gliding his finger along her spine all the way down to the small of her back. Shortly afterwards, he momentarily broke the kiss, only to move downwards and gently plant kisses along the side of Emma's neck.\n\nWhat he was doing to her body only aroused her even more. Thirty seconds later, Emma couldn't take it anymore.\"Oh Dan, make love to me. Now!\" she shrieked, desperately longing for his thick, meaty rod.\n\nHeeding her words, he gently pushed her down onto his bed and sensually moved his hands up her body at such a slow pace that it teased her even more. Once he fiinally moved to her chest, he took his sweet time in loosening every button on her checkered shirt. Almost a minute later, every button was undone and he slowly pulled her shirt off to reveal what was hiding beneath. Dan gasped at the sight which lay before him; a gigantic 500 foot tall crustacean from the palaeolithic era, which bent down and leered at Dan with its big, menacing red eyes before saying to him. \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395197333", "subreddit": "nerdcubed", "score": 108, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's a measure of attachment to the sub and the empowerment of anonymity. If I were in a Skype call with one of the people on this sub, I'd be absolutely appalled and ashamed if I were to act in the same way that I do over text. I've lived a life blessed, there's nothing that I think is more deplorable than pointless aggression. However, at the same time, I have the shield of a screen, so I don't honestly care about what is said over the internet, and I don't think that it's a reflection of who I am. I'm not spending time coming up with insults, I'm typing whatever I think sends my message, then press \"Save\" without editing. It's not hatred, it's annoyance.\n\nThe whole reason that I'm so annoyed is because I have zero outlet. It's something that I personally love, and even though I can no longer play competitively due to time, it gives me something that I can focus on. It's either this or soccer, and I've chosen this. I work two jobs, I barely have any free time, so I can only focus on so much. In real life, I don't talk about games. Maybe you have friends that you can talk about CoD with, but personally I think that it's somewhat cringeworthy. Hell, I don't even mention that I've ever played (not too hard to do, considering I have less than 18 hours on Ghosts and less than two days on BO2). In a party chat is one thing, face to face is another. \n\nSo, really, where do I have to go if I want to talk about things? It's this subreddit. A subreddit where people have absolutely no clue what they're talking about, and a place where even I, someone who barely watches (let alone plays) Ghosts know to be absolutely ridiculous. It's frustrating. It's the same thing with me for history, I have a passion for it but nowhere I can take it other than speaking with my AP Euro teacher. It's frustrating to feel as though there's nowhere for me to talk, because on this sub there is so little actual content. The good users (kkambos, slopnessie, P1NGU, fatc when he's not trolling, etc) are not only incredibly small in their numbers, but also their posts are few and far between. I'll never claim to know Ghosts well, but I know CoD at a level that at least 80% of the people on this sub simply cannot wrap their head around, and it's aggravating to sit there and be downvoted, even for eloquent and non-confrontational posts, simply because I'm offering an opinion that is, IMO, worthy of discussion at the very least.\n\nHonestly have no clue what the point of typing all that out was, sorry for flooding you with BS. 2 AM is apparently an emotional time of night.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395209414", "subreddit": "CoDCompetitive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

That is what it's definition is.\n\nNow is it possible that someday the scientific view, in which the existence of god is not proven or disproven but just irrelevant, becomes the predominant view, and people with religious faith are viewed with the same incredulity as, say, adults who believe in Santa Claus or the loch ness monster or the zombie apocalypse.  When this happens, and it might be fairly soon in terms of human history, you will essentially be proven right.  But still semantically wrong.  Can god exist if no one believes it?  The question becomes irrelevant, but not disproven.  \n\nReligions may well disappear under the weight of scientific proof in time, if that's what you mean then I agree with you, but faith and belief in god is not currently addressed by science.  This is why despite overwhelming evidence about the age of earth and evolution, some people still believe in deterministic creationism and young earth, despite direct confrontational evidence.  And the people you and I would deem reasonable, who believe in evolution and geology, but still completely believe in god.  In fact their faith is probably more solid than young earth creationists because it's not directly opposed to science, in any way.\n\nScience cannot disprove god because, simply, science doesn't care whether god exists, it only cares about how the universe works.  \n\nEdit:  just to make sure I'm addressing your question directly: I can say that because science does not ever directly address the question of whether god exists or not, you'll find no creditable scientific paper other thanks possible anthropological or psychological papers addressing faith questions directly that even considers the existence of God, this is not because scientists do not believe in god, many highly respected scientists are in fact quite religious.

Guess we'll have to tune in to find out. \n\nMore than anything, I'd appreciate some romantic closure in the final episode.

We all know the \"begins to exist\" gives the god you believe in an out.\n\n&gt; The Universe has a cause.\n\nDo you mean the universe in its current form, or including everything possibly preceding the form it currently takes?\n\n&gt; If the Universe perpetually regressed in time (in an infinite sense), we would not exist because we would not have arrived here.\n\nAn appeal to Zeno's paradox, and it's logically invalid.  Even an infinite line can have measurable segments within it, we can just be a point or segment on an infinite line.  What evidence do you have to support your conclusion?\n\n&gt; If the Big Bang was what began the universe or is the universe expanding, then the big bang would have necessitated a sequence of events in order to \"Bang\".\n\nPossibly, but since measurable time as we experience it \"began\" at the big bang, our ability to know things \"before\" the big bang is not possible at this time.\n\n&gt; Therefore, something must have caused the big bang.\n\nBased on our causal universe I can tentatively agree, but we wouldn't know the qualities or attributes of this cause.\n\n&gt; Deists say a \"god\" exists but is indifferent. Theists say The Universe must have been intelligently designed in some fashion. Atheists say science can explain it.\n\nWrong.  Atheists say they don't believe in any gods, so they just reject the idea that a god created or caused anything, that doesn't mean they automatically believe or accept the big bang or what science says.\n\n&gt; Science has not explained it because the Big Bang is a Theory.\n\nWe all know science hasn't explained everything.  The big bang is a theory, true.  So is evolution.  Gravity.  Germ theory.  A theory is the highest something in science can go.\n\n&gt; If a God existed that could create the universe, it is possible that we cannot comprehend this type of existence since we are limited by our 3-D thinking capabilities.\n\nThen it's not AT ALL logical to believe in this being, because if it's completely incomprehensible then there's nothing we can know about it in order to say we believe it.  Everything I believe I know and understand to some extent, and the things I don't know or understand  at all are not part of the things I believe.\n\n&gt; Therefore, it is possible that God exists.\n\nWhich god?\n\n&gt; a) If God existed he is inaccessible and therefore mine as well not exist\n\nIf the being is inaccessible and unknowable, with no evidence to support it, it is the exact same as a being that doesn't exist at all.\n\n&gt; b) Atheism would be wrong to say \"God does not exist\" as a fact. However, it would not be wrong for them to say \"I do not believe God exists\". \n\nThat vast majority of atheists are the \"agnostic atheist\" type, which means they don't believe in gods and they don't claim to know none exist.  An atheist can believe none exist, but that's beyond the minimum.\n\n&gt;  c) God is as ridiculous of an idea as any fairy tale.\n\nI see the claims of gods this way until there's evidence to support them.  I do the same with leprechauns, fairies, unicorns, the loch ness monster, bigfoot, etc.\n\n&gt; If you identify with A) and B) camps, I think it can perhaps make a case. If you identify with the C) camp, then you are not objective.\n\nAtheism and theism are subjective in nature, it's a personal thing so I don't see how atheism (or even theism) can really be objective.\n\n&gt; Some argue that there is evidence for God. I don't think I have to name the evidence. I am certain you have heard it all.\n\nPretty much, and if we've heard it and are still atheists that means we've also rejected them all.\n\n&gt; If there is evidence for God, then the evidence ought to be examined fairly. For instance, if a Christian says that Scripture is evidence for God's existence, An Atheist ought to be familiar with why the Christian thinks so. If the atheist dismisses Scripture on the same basis that Dawkins does, then he is demonstrating he has not examined the evidence fairly.\n\nIt's because using the bible is circular reasoning, it's a logical fallacy.  It's using the bible, the only book where God is said to exist, to prove that the bible is a reliable source for such information, since God is the writer/influence of it.\n\n&gt; If a Theist claims he has had a personal encounter with God, this cannot be dismissed either at face value. If the Atheist claims the Theist is hallucinating on the basis that the Theist encountered something that is apparently paradoxical or unprecedented, this would also not be objective.\n\nIt can be dismissed at face value when it comes to the claimed cause for their experience, not the experience itself, but the idea that they claim is what God that caused it.  Arguing with personal experience is too tough, because revelation is strictly first-person, and without that experience it can't be used as evidence.  It's hearsay in a court case, it's dismissed due to the subjective and strictly personal nature of it, it's no good for ANYONE else.\n\n&gt; In conclusion, I would argue that it is possible or probable for God to exist because I believe all things that began to exist have a cause and the Big Bang doesn't seem to be as viable of an answer as an Intelligent, all-powerful, all knowing, all-loving, all-present God. However, if someone can show me a good argument, I would be happy to hear it and respond.\n\nHow have you determined the probability?  Have you compared this universe with another?  Have you compared it with one that doesn't have a creator?  What variables, control groups, and other such statistical factors have you used to determine any sort of probability?  You haven't argued against the big bang in any sense, you've skimmed right over and are just saying you don't personally see any reason to believe it since you already believe in a creator.

{"body": "When I was in 10th grade, I tried out for the football team. As a 5' 8\", unathletic guy, I failed miserably. No big deal, I was still an A student.\n\nThe QB for our team was a guy who I will name John (that's not his name). He was not a great student, and sort of had the whole million dollar arm, 5 cent head going for him.\n\nAnyways, after I left the locker room, I saw John in the hallway. \"Good try, sterninator39,\" he said, and stuck out his hand for a high-five. I went to high-five him, but he moved his last and laughed. \"Too slow,\" he said.\n\nI got angry. I'm not the strongest guy normally, but I can become a new person when I'm rushed with adrenaline.\n\n\"Man, I've seen fish tackle better than you. Why would you even try out?\" he said, in a self-righteous, anger-induced, tone.\n\n\"Well, I wanted to try something new out,\" I replied, \"so I did football. It didn't work out, so I'll try something else.\"\n\n\"But dude, why would you even try?\"\n\nI get angry, and I come up and land a punch in his face. Despite the fact he is 6-2 and ripped, he falls to the ground, clutching his nose. \"Don't ever say that about me!\" I responded.\n\nAnyways, next day, a few people had heard I beat him up, and I suddenly became somewhat popular. He came to school with a slightly black eye and people almost seemed to dislike him now.\n\nSo, I'm walking to math class, and I feel a tap on my shoulder. I look back, and it's John's girlfriend. I'll name her Tessa. Tessa's short, has blonde hair which she wears down, and grey/green eyes. I was nervous because I thought she'd disdain me for beating up John.\n\n\"Hey,\" she said. The tone of her voice was surprisingly unangry. \"Hi,\" I replied awkwardly. \"I heard you beat up Johnny,\" she said. \"Yes...\" I said, but I was nervous as to what she'd reply.\n\n\"You know,\" she starts, \"I dig strong boys, and, you beat up the strongest boy I know. What'd you say about coming to my house Thursday?\"\n\n\"But aren't you dating?\" I ask. \"No, I broke up,\" Tessa replies, with a mischevious grin on her face.\n\nSo skip to Thursday, I walk up to her house. It's large and glamorous, and there are photos of her, her parents, and mountains and stuff everywhere. \"Hello?\" She calls. \"Yes, I'm here,\" I reply. \"Good, come up.\"\n\nI start talking to her in her room. It's painting yellow, but not much was on the wall. \"You know,\" she says, and pulls out a condom, \"we should do it.\" Her blank face transforms into a mischievous grin. I grin, too, and start taking my stuff off. She's finally naked, I get under, and we do it.\n\nIt was a good 30-40 minutes, and then we stopped and took a sigh of relief. I was afraid to admit it, but it was my first time. We start cuddling, and she opens her mouth.\n\n\"I need one more thing...\" she says.\n\n\"What?\" I ask.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized Tessa was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \n\nGoddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\n\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395387969", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, so one time I was out camping with a few of my buddies in Georgia not too far from the city I live in. I know Georgia isn't typical for Bigfoot sightings but if you ask me that's what makes this encounter even more bizarre.\n\n We built a fire and rolled some logs up to it in true campfire fashion to sit around and talk about girls and life and stuff. As it got later a few of my friends started turning in until gradually only me and one of my friends was left chatting by the fire. \n\nI'm not sure what time it was when this happened, but I'd guess it might have been around 2 or 3 in the morning. We heard a rustling in the bushes maybe 10 or 20 yards from the clearing we were in. And this large shadowy figure kind of darted out from behind them and into a patch of trees not too far away. We had initially had our backs to the tent so we thought maybe one of our friends had snuck out of the tent and was pulling a prank on us, trying to freak us out. We laughed and were like \"Nice try, you can't fool us.\" Then we heard stirring in the tent and one of our friends grumbled for us to shut up because they were trying to sleep. We went over and they were all in there, sound asleep. So my friend and I looked at each other and then at the trees where we saw the figure last. We didn't see it at first. But then it kind of lumbered over to another clump of bushes. \n\nThis whole time it was kind of working it's way towards us. The clump of trees was closer than the initial clump of bushes we had seen it in and this new clump of bushes was even closer. So we're getting reasonably freaked out. My friend yelled and picked up a pan we had used for dinner and started banging it on a rock to try to scare it. He said later he thought it might have been a bear or something. Then the strangest thing happened. It stood up from the bushes and just stood there for a second. It was clearly looking at us. And what little shape we could make out in the dark was clearly not bearish in any way. But it wasn't really human either. Then it started slowly moving towards us. We backed up, my friend had the frying pan in hand as if that would suffice in a fight with whatever this was. We were so scared we didn't even think to wake up our other friends. Then for some stupid reason, when this thing was maybe only like 10 or 15 feet away from us, I yell at it \"What...what do you want?!\" like it was actually going to respond. But then the damndest thing happened. It stopped where it was and then it actually freaking spoke. We just heard this really low voice go \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time I noticed that this \"bigfoot\" was actually 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. I said, \"Get outta here Loch Ness Monster! I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395446792", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It was a bit cold out but with a nice fire roaring and with the fuckton of people I figured to be at this party (\"Steve\" we'll call him, always threw huge parties) we'd be plenty warm.\n\nSo that night I head over to the party with a bag of chips like the pathetic loser I am, but figured if anyone was pissed I didn't bring alcohol then they could bite the wax tadpole. The party didn't really kick up till about eleven, and a bit after then (eleven thirty? Midnight?) I started talking to this smoking hot chick named Sharon. She had black hair to her shoulders, huge D tits, and a round, plump ass.\n\nShe asked why I hadn't been drinking and I told her I just wasn't into it. She poked fun at me for a while, and eventually it lead to flirting. She asked if I had ever been with a girl before, and being the awkward 19 year old I was, I admitted I had not. I don't know what was up with this chick, but she told me that would the night that would change. She leaned in, kissed me, worked her way down my neck then pulled away and took her shirt off.

{"body": "A shutdown of optimism? Since when is being optimistic a good reason for believing in false magics? Should I also believe that Santa is real just because it makes me optimistic that all good little boys and girls will get their just rewards on Christmas? You should base belief on facts, not your desires.\n\nNow as to the element of proof, I assert that you live in a stupid way. You fail to understand the impossibility of disproving a negative. I can't disprove unicorns. Do you believe in those? I can't disprove leprechauns, do you believe in those? I can't disprove any god ever created by mankind, do you believe in Hera? Zeus? Shiva? Vishnu? Quetzalcoatl?\n\nOf course you don't. Because other than your current religion, you demand evidence for magical things before you believe in them. It's just for this one god where logic and rationality go right out the window and you flip the script. You should be more consistent in your life.\n\nMoreover, how much evidence do you need? We haven't \"disproven\" the loch ness monster either, but it is very likely it doesn't exist. And the evidence of that is that we've searched for the bastard for decades and found not a trace. All the supposed photos are too blurry or turn out to be hoaxes. Same for god expect for him it's been even longer. We've searched for god for millennia. We have found nothing. Actually, the entirety of human history is showing that he doesn't exist where we thought he did. He used to be much more present. He used to control thunder, lightning, plagues, disease. Now we know all of that shit is natural and not god at all. We know that in study after study, prayer is shown to have no effect on patients outcomes.\n\nAbsence of evidence can be evidence of absence in certain conditions. We thought Iraq had WMDs. We looked for a decade, scoured the country, spent billions. We found nothing. That highly suggests they don't exist. Same with god.\n\n**Thought experiment**: prove to me there's no teapot floating in space between Earth and Mars. Go ahead. Prove it. And until you prove it, I believe there is such a teapot.\n\nWould you consider my belief in said teapot to be pretty stupid? I hope you would. Same applies to god.

{"body": "**TL;DR: /r/gonewild sextortion.**\n\nI'm a bit hesitant to tell this story because so many will hate me and I'm not sure if I'm prepared for that. Let my tale of lust serve as a cautionary tale to anyone who has ever thought about giving in to their primal urges...\n\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\n\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\n\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was. \n\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to /r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was *insanely* open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about. \n\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her /r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Protoerozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\" \n\n\nI understand how truly horrific this failed plot was and it is truly the worst thing I have never done. Not only did I walk away without any extortion money, I didn't get any new nudes from her which is what I was holding out for more than anything else. The only good thing about the failed sextortion deal is that she never contacted the FBI which works out perfectly for me because if she did, I wouldn't have been able to share this cautionary tale with all of you wannabe /r/gonewild gals out there. I was seriously bummed about not getting any more exclusive jerk-off material from this bodacious babe but c'est la vie no smoking hot gonewild noodz 4 me :( \n\nJust remember this, girls: If you're gonna get your tits out for the lads, don't show your face. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395493119", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 653, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "One time I was with a friend going to buy pot, ALOT of pot. 10 ounces of it, all for recreation. We were 16 and smoked a lot but never this much so we were excited. We heard the guy was a major drug dealer, like breaking bad shit so we didn't know what to expect. We heard of him through a guy at school we knew, and he said he would take us to meet him. On Saturday my friend came over and the guy we got info from came to my house and picked us up and took us to Toronto. We were so stoked to buy 10 ounces of it, we had both saved up 2k from working our part time jobs and were ready to blow it on weed. When we got to Toronto we pulled into a sketchy looking neighbourhood, our excitement soon turned into worry. I asked the guy how far and he said 3 more minutes. 3 minutes later we pull up to what looked like a run down abandoned house, but with people in front. They had ski jackets on in summer(that was weird?) and had their hands in their pockets. We got of the car and were grabbed from behind by two guys. They told not to scream and lead behind the house. They then did a combination lock opening the house back door. As soon we walked in it *STUNK* of pot and we were excited again, but also scared. We were lead into a room where a guy in a white fur coat was sitting on a couch smoking ganja. He looked at us and asked us to sit on the couch with him. We did as he asked and he asked if we wanted to buy 10 ounces. We said yes and he suddenly got really mad, I mean one second he had the attitude of a stone Mr Rogers then turned into a psychopath. He got up off the couch and punched my friend in the face and knocked him out. I started freaking out and wanted to scream but remembered what the guy said about that. The guy in the fur coat looked at me and demanded to know why 2 16 year olds want 10 ounces. I said for recreation but he had got madder saying there's no way we want 10 whole ounces just to smoke and asked what our angle was. I started crying out of fear and said that was the truth and that I changed my mind. He then picked up a garbage bag of weed and threw it at me then screamed to get out. I then shot up and ran completely forgetting my friend. But before I got out the door the dealer grabbed me by the shoulder and said not so fast. Then stuttering with tears in my eyes and I asked what. He then said said he was gunna need about Tree Fiddy. I then realized this drug dealer was 50 stories tall and from the Palaeolithic era. I then yelled \"Damn it Monsta I ain't givin you no Tree Fiddy!\" \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395552157", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "One day, a few years back, I was sitting down in a park with a few friends. We just sat there talking, and as it got later they all started progressively head home.\n\nAfter a while it was just myself and a rather close friend of mine at the time, who I'll call Jim for the sake of simplicity. He was rather muscular, but with a thin build.\n\nNow, Jim REALLY liked food. I don't mean he liked food, I mean he would eat anything at the drop of a hat. So Jim and I went off to Sizzler, as we were both very hungry having only eaten a single donut in the last 16 hours.\n\nWe got there and the place was rather busy, so we had to wait in line for about half an hour. As we finally paid for the salad bar and were escorted to our table, we noticed an oddly-dressed elderly couple sitting at a table near ours. Now Jim, who would be more interested in a good meal than winning a million dollars, noticed that they hadn’t eaten a single morsel of food off their plates.\n\nI left Jim at the table, and walked off to grab some pasta and other assorted foodstuffs, as well as a glass of Coke. I filled my plate to the top with the finest looking pasta you could imagine and topped it off with the smoothest tomato sauce you could ever imagine, their chef had done an incredible job that night. I contemplated whether or not I should've grabbed some watermelon, but decided I'd have that as a second course.\n\nUpon returning to the table, I saw Jim being held down by 3 Sizzler employees in front of the food holocaust that he had devastatingly provoked. Plates of food were strewn across all of the tables and visible floor in the vicinity. I let out a deep sigh, I knew what was about to happen. We were kicked out of the restaurant, with no refund and a fine of $50. It would be safe to say that I was absolutely furious at Jim.\n\nAfterwards, Jim and I sat on a nearby bench to talk about what had happened. I wasn’t about to let him off easy, he cost me a meal that I was really looking forward to. He apologized to me, and told me he'd reimburse me for the cost of the meal and pay the fine, but on one condition.

{"body": "Don't worry brother, they will see your rationality some day just as I have. It's precisely posts like this that slowly started to eat away at my diminishing faith. I was born in a typical evangelical Christian family and faithfully attended church every Sunday. We used to have prayers at home all those kinda thing and I was never really taught to question Scripture nor had I ever the intention of doing so.\n\n Fast forward to a few years ago, I got accepted into medical school. I realised once I came out of the bubble that was my small home town, faith started to present more and more questions. My peers were largely uninterested in religion and frankly speaking those that were were a little weird. Nevertheless I put a lot of time and effort in and started a home Bible study group for students, basically a \"model christian student\" so to say. I think you guys know what I mean.\n\nTime went by and I started having a lot of doubts. I used to lurk around subreddits like this and found that atheists raised many interesting questions. Questions that I have never even thought about. I began to ponder questions. What is God's own purpose and meaning? Was the earth really created in 7 days? Are our human bodies really a result of intelligent design. I remember looking through pathology slides of animal and human tissue and as far as I could see, the differences were miniscule. Christian responses on these questions also seemed lame at best.\n\nThe christian god at times seemed vindictive even violent. I could not understand why people would worship him let alone believe that he was the source of all objective morality. I was struggling daily with my intellectual reasoning.\n\nI began to read books like Richard Dawkins's The God Delusion and Sam Harris's The end of faith. My roommate who was an ardent atheist sat down with me for many civil debates. In fact the books were his and he had no hesitation lending them to me. Surprisingly enough I found myself nodding every two or three pages in. The logic was cold as it was convincing. I was pretty convinced I had finally found the nails to nail shut the coffin of faith in my heart once and for all. I even brought these books to my youth pastor and watched sadly as he tried to explain some of the dilemmas away that the books posed. His answers mostly revolved around the fact that Gods will is good and every thing was for the best. \"Try telling that to the children who were dashed on the rocks\" I thought.\n\nBare in mind this was a very difficult time for me. I was raised in the faith and had no where to go. To totally shut out something that had been such an integral part of my life for so long felt essentially the same as donating one of my kidneys away. What would my parents think as well? Would they diswon me for joining the other side so to say. I became disillusioned with church and stop attending altogether. When church members came around to visit me, I raised questions from books that I knew they had no idea how to answer. My God delusion book was neatly stacked on top of my medical textbooks reminding me that science was the answer to everything and that faith was for people who I slowly began to realise, intellectually challenged.\n\nOne night I was just lying in bed looking out of the window and seeing the stars in the sky. Passages in the God delusion kept assaulting my conscious mind and I knew I had reached a breaking point. I got up, grabbed the book and approached my roommate. \"How much did you pay for this book?\" I asked him. \"About tree fiddy\" he replied. At this moment, I realised my roommate was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. Looking in the mirror, i tipped my fedora and realised it was time to shave my neckbeard.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395668427", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;He even explains why he sees a distinct difference between the two at 2:18 and on:\n\nBut that's not the difference between agnostics and atheists. He's describing differences in behavior. Atheism and agnosticism is not about behavior, it is about knowledge and belief.\n\nYou don't need to be an \"in your face\" guy to be an atheist, you don't need to have debates, you don't need to want to change policies. All you need to do is *not believe in any gods.*\n\nThat's it.\n\nSo he can talk about all the things he doesn't like about the behavior of some atheists, but that's **completely irrelevant** as to whether he is an atheist or not. You're using a weird morphed No True Scotsman argument. \"He claims atheists act a certain way and he doesn't want to act that way or be associated with that behavior, therefore he is not an atheist.\"\n\nBut that's not what defines an atheist. Just like what defines a Christian is not their behavior but their beliefs. So you can't just say \"Christians act like dicks and are all in your face about their religion. I don't want to be associated with that, so even though I believe in god, and the divinity of Jesus, and the Christian bible, I will not call myself a Christian.\"\n\nSorry, but you a Christian.\n\nAll that is necessary to know about whether he's an atheist or not is the answer to one simple question. \"Do you believe in any gods?\" And the answer to that, based on everything he has ever said, is no. That makes him an atheist, even if he rationally doesn't want to own up to it because he knows it's poison for his career. \n\nAnd I guess I'll just cut off the inevitable \"what about 'I don't know?!'\" That's not an answer to the question of belief. I don't *know* whether the Loch Ness monster is real or not, but I don't believe it exists. I don't *know* whether the Tooth Fairy is real or not, but I don't believe it exists.

You all have said it before, and I'll gladly repeat it: Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is a testament to the fact that quality of execution is far more important than the \"uniqueness\" of the content in a series. This show was funny, adorable, tense, and everything in between, and it's made from some of the most tired tropes in all of storytelling. But none of that mattered. It's not about the pieces you use; it's *how you put them together* that's really important.\n\n**Review Score:** 1287 UMAs/2,578,406 Nessies - \"would sign petition to make all SOL rom-coms this good\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395897194", "subreddit": "anime", "score": 154, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "There's actually very interesting story to this! It's a pretty rare find!\n  Back in the 1940's these small doors were referred to as goblin homes! During hitler's dictatorship young children in concentration camps would carve small doors into walls after being told the stories of the \"Happy Goblins\" by their parents. No one knows the true identity of the original story teller, but I like to refer to it as a fun mystery. Basically, if you make a door in the walls of your home small goblins that live in your walls will come out and protect you during the night. Whether it was hopes of defeating the germans or just simple protection and safety during the cold hard nights, many young jewish and minority children would make these doors. After passing through generation and generation the tradition was changed many, many times. Eventually becoming one of these hand painted doors you see before you. Some parents hated the tradition because it ruined their nicely garnished walls and stairs, so many parents made \"efforts\" to change the origin of the goblin story. By making the goblins, evil little monsters that were locked away in your walls so they couldn't get to you. if you let them in, they would get you in the night! Parents even started selling small goblin door protectors and locks! Just for fun they started selling small, crotchet knights called \"Dick Buttkinsons\" to protect the goblin doors at tree fiddy a pop, ma nig.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395897210", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Deep down, you know she's a nice person (and a hero!), so you decide to hear her out.\n\nHer family has fallen on hard times.  She was once well-off, but isn't any more.  It's been a slow process, and her negative behavior is due to the added stress from home.  Her parents don't know what to do as their finances slowly dry up.  She eats all the time because of the emotion, the knowledge that it will soon all be gone, and to keep up appearances.\n\nUnfortunately, the time has come.  If her parents don't make the mortgage payment this month, their house will be repossessed.  The house she grew up in will be gone.

As she speaks, her voice starts to crack, \"I only need about tree fiddy.\"  You look up from your wallet and see that she is the Loch Ness monster.  It's amazing how she's managed to hide it from you all of these years, but now it's clear as day.\n\n\"I ain't giving no Loch Ness monster no tree fiddy,\" you say as you put your wallet away, glad to be done with her forever.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395945810", "subreddit": "fatpeoplestories", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt; Does nothing exist until it is proven? Was the speed of light not the speed of light until we proved what it was?\n\nI think you misunderstand me. I never have, or ever will, claim that a God/Gods *cannot* exist. I simply state that it is illogical, irrational, and therefore stupid to believe that they do, as there is (currently at least) no evidence in support of it. I think it is stupid to believe in a God/Gods in the same way that I think it is stupid to believe in Ghosts, Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster. It is entirely possible that they do exist, but until evidence is presented to show that they do it makes no sense believe in them, in the same way that it made no sense to believe that the speed of light was ~300 million metres per second until we proved it was.\n\n&gt; Until we know everything, there will always be non-falsifiable claims that are actually true.\n\nOf course. It is entirely possible that Jesus could reveal himself tomorrow and prove Christianity to be correct. However, Allah could do the same and prove Islam to be true. Or so could Vishnu, or Zeus, or Thor, or Jupiter. Just because a claim is non-falsifiable, it does not mean you should believe that it is true. Of course a God *could* exist, however, the position of the corresponding religion is not their God *could* exist, it is that their God *does* exist. A Muslim (for example) does not just believe: 'it is not impossible for Allah to exist', they would believe 'Allah *does* exist'. There is no evidence to suggest that that is the case, and therefore it is illogical to do so (suggesting stupidity).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395948847", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

IT WAS WRITTEN IN SANSKRIT, THE ANCIENT SACRED LANGUAGE OF INDIA AND IT TELLS THE STORY OF A GREAT BATTLE THAT OCCURRED ABOUT 3000 YEARS BACK. IT WAS ON THE BANKS OF RIVER SARASWATI THAT SAINT VED VYAS WROTE MAHABHARAT, APPROXIMATELY IN 900 BC. LORD KRISHNA PREACHED 'BHAGVAD GITA', THE GOSPEL OF DUTY, TO ARJUN AT THE ON SET OF THE GREAT BATTLE OF MAHABHARAT. SINCE THEN, THIS PROFOUND PHILOSOPHY OF THE SUPREMACY OF DUTY HAS BECAME THE FOUNDATION OF HINDUISM, INDIAN CULTURE AND THOUGHT. THE MAHABHARAT KNOWS HARYANA AS \"BAHUDHHANYAKA\" - THE LAND OF PLENTIFUL GRAINS, AND \"BAHUDHANA\" - THE LAND OF IMMENSE RICHES. DHRITARASHTER AND PANDU WERE BORN TO BHISHAM'S BROTHERS. DHRITARASHTER WAS BORN BLIND AND THOUGH THE ELDER, HE HAD TO FORFEIT HIS CLAIM TO THE THRONE DUE TO THIS PHYSICAL DEFECT. PANDU BECAME KING. OF THE TWO BROTHERS DHRITARASHTER COULD NOT SHARE WITH HER ROYAL HUSBAND, AND THUS REMAINED VOLUNTARILY BLIND FOR LIFE. SHE BECAME THE MOTHER OF THE KOURAVS, 100 IN TOTAL, WHEREAS KUNTI GOT THREE SONS AND MADRI TWO. ONE DAY WHILE HUNTING, PANDU ACCIDENTALLY RESIST HIMSELF AND HAD INTERCOURSE WITH MADRI AND THUS DIED. MADRI IMMOLATED HERSELF AND WALKED INTO HER HUSBAND'S FUNERAL FIRE LEAVING BEHIND HER TWO SONS NAKUL AND SAHADEV IN CUSTODY OF KUNTI WHO ALREADY HAD THREE SONS YUDHISHTHIR, BHEEM AND ARJUN. ON PANDU'S DEATH DHRITARASHTER BECAME THE KING AND THE FIVE SONS OF PANDU, KNOWN AS THE PANDAVS GREW UP IN THE GUARDIANSHIP OF KUNTI. THE FIVE PANDAV PRINCES WERE EDUCATED ALONG WITH KOURAV BOYS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF BHISHAM AND THE PATRONAGE OF DHRITARASHTER. DRONE, THOUGH A BRAHMIN WAS A VERY SKILFUL AND EFFICIENT TEACHER, WHO TAUGHT THEM THE ART OF ARCHERY AND THE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES OF WARFARE. YUDHISHTHIR, THE ELDEST OF THE PANDAVS, WAS SO RIGHTEOUS THAT HE GAINED THE NAME DHARAMPUTR. BHEEM WAS A GIANT IN PHYSICAL STRENGTH. ARJUN WAS HANDSOME AND THE MOST SKILFUL ARCHER. DHARAMPUTR WAS THE BELOVED OF THE PEOPLE AND BEING THE ELDEST AMONG THE 105 PRINCES, WAS NATURALLY, AND BY HIS RIGHT TOO, THE HEIR TO THE THRONE. DURYODHAN, THE ELDEST OF THE KOURAVS, HOWEVER WAS JEALOUS OF THE PANDAVS AND TRIED EVERY MEANS TO DESTROY THEM. WHEN YUDHISHTHIR WAS PROCLAIMED KING, DURYODHAN COULD NOT SIT QUIET AND WATCH. DHRITARASHTER LOVED ALL THE 105 PRINCES ALIKE, AND THERE PLAN TO KILL THE PANDAVS CUNNINGLY GIVING POISON TO BHEEM, BURNING DOWN THE LAC-HOUSE ETC., FAILED MISERABLY. BHEEM WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO DIGEST THE POISON. THE PANDAVS WERE WARNED IN TIME BY THEIR UNCLE VIDUR AND SO IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT THE FIVE BROTHERS ALONG WITH THEIR MOTHER ESCAPED INTO THE JUNGLE FROM THE BURNING LAC-HOUSE. AFTER THEIR MIRACULOUS ESCAPE FROM THE LAC-HOUSE, THEY DID NOT RETURN TO THE PALACE. THEY ROAMED ABOUT IN THE GUISE OF BRAHMINS WITH THEIR MOTHER. EVERY ONE INCLUDING THE KOURAVS BELIEVED THEM TO BE DEAD. DURING THAT TIME, THEY HEARD OF THE SWAYAMVARA OF DROUPADI. THE QUALIFICATION TO MARRY HER LAY IN THE EXTRAORDINARY SKILL OF ARCHERY IN HITTING A MOVING TARGET. ARJUN EASILY WON. EVERYBODY CONGRATULATED THE WINNER, AND DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS ARJUN. THUS THE PANDAVS WERE FOUND OUT, HE TOOK HIS BRIDE TO THEIR HUT AND CALLED TO HIS MOTHER TO COME OUTSIDE AND SEE WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT. INSTEAD OF DOING SO, SHE ANSWERED BACK \"MY DEAR CHILDREN, WHATEVER IT BE, YOU SHARE IT AMONG YOURSELVES\". THEREFORE, DROUPADI BECAME THE COMMON WIFE OF ALL THE FIVE PANDAVS. KRISHNA, WHO WAS ALSO PRESENT, AT THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY BECAME A GREAT FRIEND OF THE PANDAVS FROM THEN ONWARDS. ON BHISHAM'S ADVICE, THE KINGDOM WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS. NATURALLY THE BETTER HALF WAS TAKEN AWAY BY THE KOURAVS. STILL, THE OTHERS BUILT A WONDERFUL CITY IN THEIR OWN HALF AND CALLED IT INDRAPRASTHA. DURYODHAN WATCHING THE INCREASING PROSPERITY OF THE PANDAVS AND COULD CONTAIN HIMSELF NO LONGER. HE OPENLY CHALLENGED DHARAMPUTR FOR A GAME OF DICE, SAKUNI, DECEIT IN HUMAN FORM, WAS THE UNCLE OF THE KOURAVS. HE PLAYED FOR THEM. INEVITABLY DHARAMPUTR LOST EVERYTHING - HIS KINGDOM, HIS BROTHERS AND ALSO HIS WIFE. NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS GAIN, DURYODHAN TRIED TO INSULT DROUPADI IN PUBLIC. BY LORD KRISHNA'S GRACE, NOTHING DISASTROUS HAPPENED. DHRITARASHTER, FEARING THAT THIS MIGHT BRING UNFORESEEN CALAMITIES BEGGED DROUPADI TO TAKE WHATEVER SHE WANTED. SHE ASKED FOR THE FREEDOM OF HER HUSBANDS. IT WAS GRANTED. DHRITARASHTER DUE TO HIS EXCESSIVE LOVE FOR THE ELDEST SON WAS BLIND TO WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG. SO AGAIN DURYODHAN INVITED DHARAMPUTR FOR ANOTHER GAME OF DICE, AND THE BET WAS THAT THE LOSERS WOULD LIVE IN THE FOREST FOR 13 YEARS WITHOUT ANY CLAIM TO THE KINGDOM, THE LAST YEAR HOWEVER TO BE SPENT INCOGNITO. BUT IF IN THE THIRTEENTH YEAR, THEY WERE DETECTED, AGAIN A ROUND OF 13 YEARS' EXILE; AND THIS WOULD GO ON FOREVER. DHARAMPUTR LOST AGAIN. DURING THE TWELVE YEARS IN THE FORESTS, THE PANDAVS VISITED MANY HOLY PLACES. THEY HAD MANY INTERESTING ADVENTURES AT THIS TIME. ONE OF THEM LED TO HANUMAN'S FRIENDSHIP AND GRACE. ARJUN IS CALLED KAPIDHVAJA AS HE KEEPS ON HIS FLAG THE EMBLEM OF HANUMAN. KRISHNA VISITED THEM NOW AND THEN. ARJUN, AT THE ADVICE OF VYASA, PRACTICED PENANCE, PROPITIATED SIVA AND GOT FROM HIM THE MIGHTY WEAPON, THE PASUPATASTRA. HE PROPITIATED ALSO THE OTHER GODS LNDRA, AGNI, VARUNA AND OTHERS AND GOT FROM ALL OF THEM VERY POWERFUL WEAPONS. THUS THE TWELVE YEARS WERE NOT WASTED BUT SPENT IN SECURING THE DIVINE WEAPONS, WHICH WOULD BECOME USEFUL LATER ON. IN THE 13TH YEAR, HIDING ALL THEIR WEAPONS IN THE HOLLOW OF A TREE IN A BURIAL GROUND, ALL THE PANDAVS WITH DROUPADI WENT TO THE PALACE OF THE KING OF THE VIRATAS AND STAYED THERE AS SERVANTS. DURYODHAN WAS MAKING FRANTIC EFFORTS TO DISCOVER THEM. WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE STRANGE MURDER OF KICHAKA THE BROTHER-IN-LAW OF THE KING, HE CONCLUDED THAT THE PANDAVS MUST BE IN THE VIRATA COUNTRY. SO THE KOURAVS ATTACKED THE VIRATAS, WITH APPARENT PURPOSE OF CARRYING AWAY ITS CATTLE-WEALTH. OF COURSE THE PANDAVS TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE, BUT WHEN THEY WERE RECOGNIZED AS PANDAVS THE TIME LIMIT OF THIRTEEN YEARS HAD ALREADY PASSED. DHARAMPUTR WAS FOND OF PEACE, AND WAS EVER AGAINST ANY QUARREL, MUCH LESS WAR. SO HE SENT KRISHNA AS A MESSENGER TO HASTINAPURA TO CLAIM HIS KINGDOM BACK FROM DURYODHAN. BUT DURYODHAN HAD BY THIS TIME COME TO REGARD INDRAPRASTHA AS HIS OWN. HE NOT ONLY REFUSED TO GIVE THEIR KINGDOM BACK, BUT REFUSED TO GIVE EVEN 5 HOUSES FOR THE FIVE BROTHERS TO LIVE! WAR HAD TO BE DECLARED. THIS IS THE GREAT WAR FOUGHT AT KURUKSHETRA TO DECIDE THE RIGHT OF CLAIM. THE HUNDRED KOURAVS, BHISHAM, DRONE, ASVATHAMA, ETC., WERE ON ONE SIDE AND THE PANDAVS, KRISHNA, DRUPADA, ETC., WERE ON THE OTHER. KRISHNA DID NOT ACTUALLY FIGHT. HE WAS THE CHARIOTEER OF ARJUN AND HENCE HE IS CALLED PARTHASARATHY. KRISHNA WAS VERY IMPARTIAL. HE GAVE HIS ARMY TO THE KOURAVS AND HIMSELF OFFERED TO SERVE THE PANDAVS. THE KOURARAMA, AND SHAKUNTALA. THE BATTLE OF KURUKSHETRA OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS MILITARY STRATEGY, THERE IS ALSO A MENTION OF A BOARD GAME CHATURANGA, FROM WHICH THE MODERN DAY CHESS ORIGINATED. BUT THE UNDERLYING THEME OF THE MAHABHARAT CONCERNS MORAL DUTY AND RIGHT CONDUCT. THE LONG AND COMPLEX DISPUTE THAT DIVIDES THE ROYAL FAMILY OF BHARAT AFFORDS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THE DUTIES AND CONDUCT EXPECTED OF A KING. IT ALSO SHOWS THE IDEALS OF BEHAVIOR FOR SUBJECTS, SOLDIERS, RELIGIOUS HERMITS, AND PEOPLE SUFFERING MISFORTUNE. SAGE VED VYASA IS TRADITIONALLY REGARDED AS THE AUTHOR OF THE MAHABHARAT, BUT HE IS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN ITS COMPILER. THE EPIC SEEMS TO BE A COLLECTION OF WRITINGS BY SEVERAL AUTHORS WHO LIVED AT VARIOUS TIMES. THE OLDEST PARTS ARE PROBABLY ABOUT 3,000 YEARS OLD, WHILE OTHERS CAN BE TRACED TO AS LATE AS AD 500.

IT WAS WRITTEN IN SANSKRIT, THE ANCIENT SACRED LANGUAGE OF INDIA AND IT TELLS THE STORY OF A GREAT BATTLE THAT OCCURRED ABOUT 3000 YEARS BACK. IT WAS ON THE BANKS OF RIVER SARASWATI THAT SAINT VED VYAS WROTE MAHABHARAT, APPROXIMATELY IN 900 BC. LORD KRISHNA PREACHED 'BHAGVAD GITA', THE GOSPEL OF DUTY, TO ARJUN AT THE ON SET OF THE GREAT BATTLE OF MAHABHARAT. SINCE THEN, THIS PROFOUND PHILOSOPHY OF THE SUPREMACY OF DUTY HAS BECAME THE FOUNDATION OF HINDUISM, INDIAN CULTURE AND THOUGHT. THE MAHABHARAT KNOWS HARYANA AS \"BAHUDHHANYAKA\" - THE LAND OF PLENTIFUL GRAINS, AND \"BAHUDHANA\" - THE LAND OF IMMENSE RICHES. DHRITARASHTER AND PANDU WERE BORN TO BHISHAM'S BROTHERS. DHRITARASHTER WAS BORN BLIND AND THOUGH THE ELDER, HE HAD TO FORFEIT HIS CLAIM TO THE THRONE DUE TO THIS PHYSICAL DEFECT. PANDU BECAME KING. OF THE TWO BROTHERS DHRITARASHTER COULD NOT SHARE WITH HER ROYAL HUSBAND, AND THUS REMAINED VOLUNTARILY BLIND FOR LIFE. SHE BECAME THE MOTHER OF THE KOURAVS, 100 IN TOTAL, WHEREAS KUNTI GOT THREE SONS AND MADRI TWO. ONE DAY WHILE HUNTING, PANDU ACCIDENTALLY RESIST HIMSELF AND HAD INTERCOURSE WITH MADRI AND THUS DIED. MADRI IMMOLATED HERSELF AND WALKED INTO HER HUSBAND'S FUNERAL FIRE LEAVING BEHIND HER TWO SONS NAKUL AND SAHADEV IN CUSTODY OF KUNTI WHO ALREADY HAD THREE SONS YUDHISHTHIR, BHEEM AND ARJUN. ON PANDU'S DEATH DHRITARASHTER BECAME THE KING AND THE FIVE SONS OF PANDU, KNOWN AS THE PANDAVS GREW UP IN THE GUARDIANSHIP OF KUNTI. THE FIVE PANDAV PRINCES WERE EDUCATED ALONG WITH KOURAV BOYS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF BHISHAM AND THE PATRONAGE OF DHRITARASHTER. DRONE, THOUGH A BRAHMIN WAS A VERY SKILFUL AND EFFICIENT TEACHER, WHO TAUGHT THEM THE ART OF ARCHERY AND THE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES OF WARFARE. YUDHISHTHIR, THE ELDEST OF THE PANDAVS, WAS SO RIGHTEOUS THAT HE GAINED THE NAME DHARAMPUTR. BHEEM WAS A GIANT IN PHYSICAL STRENGTH. ARJUN WAS HANDSOME AND THE MOST SKILFUL ARCHER. DHARAMPUTR WAS THE BELOVED OF THE PEOPLE AND BEING THE ELDEST AMONG THE 105 PRINCES, WAS NATURALLY, AND BY HIS RIGHT TOO, THE HEIR TO THE THRONE. DURYODHAN, THE ELDEST OF THE KOURAVS, HOWEVER WAS JEALOUS OF THE PANDAVS AND TRIED EVERY MEANS TO DESTROY THEM. WHEN YUDHISHTHIR WAS PROCLAIMED KING, DURYODHAN COULD NOT SIT QUIET AND WATCH. DHRITARASHTER LOVED ALL THE 105 PRINCES ALIKE, AND THERE PLAN TO KILL THE PANDAVS CUNNINGLY GIVING POISON TO BHEEM, BURNING DOWN THE LAC-HOUSE ETC., FAILED MISERABLY. BHEEM WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO DIGEST THE POISON. THE PANDAVS WERE WARNED IN TIME BY THEIR UNCLE VIDUR AND SO IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT THE FIVE BROTHERS ALONG WITH THEIR MOTHER ESCAPED INTO THE JUNGLE FROM THE BURNING LAC-HOUSE. AFTER THEIR MIRACULOUS ESCAPE FROM THE LAC-HOUSE, THEY DID NOT RETURN TO THE PALACE. THEY ROAMED ABOUT IN THE GUISE OF BRAHMINS WITH THEIR MOTHER. EVERY ONE INCLUDING THE KOURAVS BELIEVED THEM TO BE DEAD. DURING THAT TIME, THEY HEARD OF THE SWAYAMVARA OF DROUPADI. THE QUALIFICATION TO MARRY HER LAY IN THE EXTRAORDINARY SKILL OF ARCHERY IN HITTING A MOVING TARGET. ARJUN EASILY WON. EVERYBODY CONGRATULATED THE WINNER, AND DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS ARJUN. THUS THE PANDAVS WERE FOUND OUT, HE TOOK HIS BRIDE TO THEIR HUT AND CALLED TO HIS MOTHER TO COME OUTSIDE AND SEE WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT. INSTEAD OF DOING SO, SHE ANSWERED BACK \"MY DEAR CHILDREN, WHATEVER IT BE, YOU SHARE IT AMONG YOURSELVES\". THEREFORE, DROUPADI BECAME THE COMMON WIFE OF ALL THE FIVE PANDAVS. KRISHNA, WHO WAS ALSO PRESENT, AT THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY BECAME A GREAT FRIEND OF THE PANDAVS FROM THEN ONWARDS. ON BHISHAM'S ADVICE, THE KINGDOM WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS. NATURALLY THE BETTER HALF WAS TAKEN AWAY BY THE KOURAVS. STILL, THE OTHERS BUILT A WONDERFUL CITY IN THEIR OWN HALF AND CALLED IT INDRAPRASTHA. DURYODHAN WATCHING THE INCREASING PROSPERITY OF THE PANDAVS AND COULD CONTAIN HIMSELF NO LONGER. HE OPENLY CHALLENGED DHARAMPUTR FOR A GAME OF DICE, SAKUNI, DECEIT IN HUMAN FORM, WAS THE UNCLE OF THE KOURAVS. HE PLAYED FOR THEM. INEVITABLY DHARAMPUTR LOST EVERYTHING - HIS KINGDOM, HIS BROTHERS AND ALSO HIS WIFE. NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS GAIN, DURYODHAN TRIED TO INSULT DROUPADI IN PUBLIC. BY LORD KRISHNA'S GRACE, NOTHING DISASTROUS HAPPENED. DHRITARASHTER, FEARING THAT THIS MIGHT BRING UNFORESEEN CALAMITIES BEGGED DROUPADI TO TAKE WHATEVER SHE WANTED. SHE ASKED FOR THE FREEDOM OF HER HUSBANDS. IT WAS GRANTED. DHRITARASHTER DUE TO HIS EXCESSIVE LOVE FOR THE ELDEST SON WAS BLIND TO WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG. SO AGAIN DURYODHAN INVITED DHARAMPUTR FOR ANOTHER GAME OF DICE, AND THE BET WAS THAT THE LOSERS WOULD LIVE IN THE FOREST FOR 13 YEARS WITHOUT ANY CLAIM TO THE KINGDOM, THE LAST YEAR HOWEVER TO BE SPENT INCOGNITO. BUT IF IN THE THIRTEENTH YEAR, THEY WERE DETECTED, AGAIN A ROUND OF 13 YEARS' EXILE; AND THIS WOULD GO ON FOREVER. DHARAMPUTR LOST AGAIN. DURING THE TWELVE YEARS IN THE FORESTS, THE PANDAVS VISITED MANY HOLY PLACES. THEY HAD MANY INTERESTING ADVENTURES AT THIS TIME. ONE OF THEM LED TO HANUMAN'S FRIENDSHIP AND GRACE. ARJUN IS CALLED KAPIDHVAJA AS HE KEEPS ON HIS FLAG THE EMBLEM OF HANUMAN. KRISHNA VISITED THEM NOW AND THEN. ARJUN, AT THE ADVICE OF VYASA, PRACTICED PENANCE, PROPITIATED SIVA AND GOT FROM HIM THE MIGHTY WEAPON, THE PASUPATASTRA. HE PROPITIATED ALSO THE OTHER GODS LNDRA, AGNI, VARUNA AND OTHERS AND GOT FROM ALL OF THEM VERY POWERFUL WEAPONS. THUS THE TWELVE YEARS WERE NOT WASTED BUT SPENT IN SECURING THE DIVINE WEAPONS, WHICH WOULD BECOME USEFUL LATER ON. IN THE 13TH YEAR, HIDING ALL THEIR WEAPONS IN THE HOLLOW OF A TREE IN A BURIAL GROUND, ALL THE PANDAVS WITH DROUPADI WENT TO THE PALACE OF THE KING OF THE VIRATAS AND STAYED THERE AS SERVANTS. DURYODHAN WAS MAKING FRANTIC EFFORTS TO DISCOVER THEM. WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE STRANGE MURDER OF KICHAKA THE BROTHER-IN-LAW OF THE KING, HE CONCLUDED THAT THE PANDAVS MUST BE IN THE VIRATA COUNTRY. SO THE KOURAVS ATTACKED THE VIRATAS, WITH APPARENT PURPOSE OF CARRYING AWAY ITS CATTLE-WEALTH. OF COURSE THE PANDAVS TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE, BUT WHEN THEY WERE RECOGNIZED AS PANDAVS THE TIME LIMIT OF THIRTEEN YEARS HAD ALREADY PASSED. DHARAMPUTR WAS FOND OF PEACE, AND WAS EVER AGAINST ANY QUARREL, MUCH LESS WAR. SO HE SENT KRISHNA AS A MESSENGER TO HASTINAPURA TO CLAIM HIS KINGDOM BACK FROM DURYODHAN. BUT DURYODHAN HAD BY THIS TIME COME TO REGARD INDRAPRASTHA AS HIS OWN. HE NOT ONLY REFUSED TO GIVE THEIR KINGDOM BACK, BUT REFUSED TO GIVE EVEN 5 HOUSES FOR THE FIVE BROTHERS TO LIVE! WAR HAD TO BE DECLARED. THIS IS THE GREAT WAR FOUGHT AT KURUKSHETRA TO DECIDE THE RIGHT OF CLAIM. THE HUNDRED KOURAVS, BHISHAM, DRONE, ASVATHAMA, ETC., WERE ON ONE SIDE AND THE PANDAVS, KRISHNA, DRUPADA, ETC., WERE ON THE OTHER. KRISHNA DID NOT ACTUALLY FIGHT. HE WAS THE CHARIOTEER OF ARJUN AND HENCE HE IS CALLED PARTHASARATHY. KRISHNA WAS VERY IMPARTIAL. HE GAVE HIS ARMY TO THE KOURAVS AND HIMSELF OFFERED TO SERVE THE PANDAVS. THE KOURARAMA, AND SHAKUNTALA. THE BATTLE OF KURUKSHETRA OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS MILITARY STRATEGY, THERE IS ALSO A MENTION OF A BOARD GAME CHATURANGA, FROM WHICH THE MODERN DAY CHESS ORIGINATED. BUT THE UNDERLYING THEME OF THE MAHABHARAT CONCERNS MORAL DUTY AND RIGHT CONDUCT. THE LONG AND COMPLEX DISPUTE THAT DIVIDES THE ROYAL FAMILY OF BHARAT AFFORDS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THE DUTIES AND CONDUCT EXPECTED OF A KING.

{"body": "I know no one will believe me, I guess it's worth posting. I grew up in a small town with not much to do. It was kind of out in the middle of nowhere, old fashioned customs, I'm sure you get the picture. I was in 7th grade at the time, and there were only 30 kids at my entire middle school, so as you can imagine there weren't too many girls to choose from. It was around the middle of the school year when a new girl transferred, and man, she was a straight 10/10 bombshell. She was in my grade, and got placed to sit next to me on the first day. I talked to her and asked her where she was from, she told me she was from Pennsylvania and that her name was Morgan. We became good friends over the next week, and as you can imagine a 7th grader would be, I was horny as hell, and wanted to have sex for the first time. One weekend we were hanging out at the only park in our town, and we started talking as normal. I started to lead the conversation towards sex, and asked her if she had ever done anything before. She said no, and I said that I hadn't either. Then out of no where she asked me if I wanted to lose my virginity to her. This hit me as a huge shock and I honestly didn't know how to react. I told her yes only if she wanted to, but she said that I had to do something first. She told me that she didn't come from a very well off family and she needed money for new clothes, and said that for $200 she would have sex with me. I don't know what the hell came over me, but I said yes, not even knowing where I would get the money from. That night I snuck into my parents closet where they kept their safe (they didn't trust banks) and stole the $200. The next day after school I met her at the same park and gave her the money. We started off kissing and touching, and eventually she started to unbutton my pants grab around for my dick. It was my first time, so as soon as she touched it I started to cum, and shot it all over her face. Then she said \"The 200 wasn't enough.\" I asked her \"Well how much do you need then?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time that I noticed she was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396075300", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I wouldn't necessarily start with a single season.  Instead, I would watch the episodes that are regarded as \"classics\" (as these typically fill you in on the inside jokes of the show, shed light on specific characters etc.)\n\nFor instance, a great episode about Cartman would be \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" ([http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s05e01-scott-tenorman-must-die])    This episode is definitely one that most S.P. fans know and it lets you in to Cartman's fucked up psyche.\n\nAnother episode I would recommend is \"Major Boobage\".  This episode has a great soundtrack, and is also a great example of how the creators (Matt Stone and Trey Parker) weave current issues into the show while maintaining the humor we've come to know.  This episode pokes fun at Eliot Spitzer, the former Gov. of New York, but is also relevant to any hypocritical leader.  [http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s12e03-major-boobage]\n\nOthers that come to mind that demonstrate what I would consider to be the \"gold standard\" of South Park are:\n\"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\" S1 E4\n\"Chef Aid\" S2 E 14 - (This episode features the \"Chewbacca Defense\")\n\"The Succubus\" S3 E3 - (Tree Fiddy!)\n\"Le Petit Tourette\" S11 E8\n\"Crippled Summer\" S14 E7\n\nThere are more and probably some classics I'm forgetting, but these episodes are the ones I would recommend to a new viewer.  \n\nHope this helps and you stick around the sub.  \n\nEDIT:  Fuck Dook too!  \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396122462", "subreddit": "southpark", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

I'd guessed her to be between 17 and 21. No, I don't want a 15 year old girlfriend, and my own personal standards of \"young girl\" are meanwhile at age 30.

{"body": "Big History. It's a history unit which brings science and the humanities together by adopting a panoramic view of history, concerning itself with everything from the origins of the universe to, well, now - 21st century human society. It's unique among history units in that humans don't make an appearance until midway through the course, where we look at hominids, the Paleolithic era and early agrarian communities. It was an amazing unit to study, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity. Often, we learn about bits of history and science here and there, but Big History puts it all together into chronological order, resulting in an awesome, sweeping 13.8 billion year-long (and counting) narrative. There's also a huge focus on backing up facts with appropriate evidence.\n\nActually, from what I understand, the Bill Gates foundation has put funding into expanding Big History courses into universities and high schools. At my uni, it's an optional unit, but there are some unis where it's a compulsory undergraduate course.

{"body": "Loch Ness edit (very minor changes at the end):\n\n\n Last summer, a religious friend of mine suggested that some friends go to a monastery in the mountains for a week to help renovate the monastery. I had nothing better to do, I heard the scenery was great, the place was supposed to be very peaceful so I agreed to go; I'm an atheist but religious people don't bother me. Take note that this is in Eastern Europe, Orthodoxy is the main religion here and religious people from the area aren't too annoying.\n\n\nThere we helped out doing simple construction work, painting all that sort of stuff and we'd interact with the nuns quite a lot (they worked with us, cooked for us, washed our working clothes every two days..). The nuns were sociable and pleasant to be around with. One of them seemed to be fond of me, she'd laugh at my jokes more than she should, she'd usually end up near me, she was particularly friendly, however all this cryptoflirting of hers was a bit weird and I think she did it mostly without being conscious she was doing it. At first I didn't flirt back at all but after a couple of days I started picking on her, find all sorts of reasons to do stuff with her but I was very careful so the others didn't suspect a thing.\n\n\nBy the sixth day, the day before we left, we were very friendly, there were no awkward looks or touching but there was chemistry although we never spoke of it at all, we were just friends. In that day's evening, my friends went to see the sunset on a near by mountain, like we did a couple of times before but I intentionally stayed at the monastery claiming I wasn't in the mood to climb the mountain. I stayed in the monastery that evening just to try and get close to the nun I had interacted so well during the week. I wasn't very physically attracted to her but it was something I had to do, I had to try, I was very scared about how she'd react if I made a move or even more, what would happen I we were caught in the act by someone else.\n\n\nSo I was alone, and the room me and two other friends were sleeping in was empty for a few hours, until after sunset. I went in the monastery yard and waited for the nun to appear, she did and I nodded to her to come after me. I went in my room and I sat on one of the beds, she sat on a different bed. I started telling her how fun it was hanging out and that I was sorry to leave, she said it was fun indeed. After we spoke a little more, I then told her that during the past days some feelings developed between the two of us. She said nothing, only looked down. I asked her if it's OK if I closed the door with the lock(so no one could get in from outside), again she said nothing. This was my move basically, it was obvious at what I was hinting and she didn't object.\n\n\nI went, I closed the door, then I went and sat next to her and put my hand on her leg, she didn't move or say anything. At this point my heart is racing, I was scared as fuck, I regretted I had made a move, I hated my self for the situation I've put myself in but I was still confident she wanted to do it, I mean she gave me so many signals the last few days. Then I put my hand on her breasts and then lifted her robe, she then raised her head and spread her legs a bit. I positioned myself between her legs, took of a pair of stockings she had on and her underwear and started having sex with her. It all lasted for a few minutes (5-10 minutes), I had no condom on (idiot), but I pulled out before ejaculating. She looked at me a few times during and she seemed to be enjoying it although she made very little sound; she would just lay there and sometimes thrust herself into my penis but mostly just did nothing. I couldn't quite figure out how old she was, but she was not a virgin fortunately, she had done this before it seems, I didn't see any of her body except her pussy, which was, naturally, unshaven and she had an unusual skin tone. After intercourse was done, she, very calmly, said she had to leave, waited near the door for about half a minute when she was sure no one could see her leaving my room and left. And it was around that time I notice that this nun was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \n\nI felt weird, I felt a bit guilty, I felt like I made her do it, I was confused. The next day we didn't speak until it was time to say goodbye, everybody was in the yard and we were saying our goodbyes, I went to her, I said I enjoyed my time at the monastery, she smiled and said, \"That'll be tree fiddy\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396194963", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, so I worked in a sex shop in a pretty sketchy part of town. You know the area where there's a lot of pawn shops advertising guns, lots of bums, run down liquor stores, and a generally unsavory atmosphere? That was where I worked. \n \n \nWell there were these two homeless guys who came in to the shop almost every day. One huge black guy and one Asian guy. I'd say they were both in their late 30s. Big black guy reminded me of a slightly smaller and crazier Michael Clarke Duncan. They both smelled like onions that had been left in a plastic bag out in the sun for a month. Whenever they came in I'd always light a scented candle to try and cover the smell up.\n \n \nAnyway they'd both come in pretty early in the morning and just browse for an hour, mostly looking at the sex dolls. I started to get the vibe that the big black guy was in charge, because the Asian guy would always bring him stuff and then Bigs would look it over then shake his head, and Tiny would look all deflated an put it back. They never talked to me about anything, just looked around and left after a bit. I never asked if they needed help though, I figured they just wanted to do their thing in peace. I started calling them Bigs and Tiny btw. You don't see someone all the time at work and not make up nicknames for them.\n \nAfter a couple of months they come in one morning and Bigs is wearing the biggest grin I've ever seen. Just ear to ear. The two of them go over to the section where we keep the high-quality sex dolls. You know the pricey ones, like from Lars and Real Girl? They grab it and bring it up to the counter just full of excitement. Then Bigs pulls out a big grubby ziploc bag of change and small bills and puts it one the counter. Then he explains that they've been saving up for months so they can buy this doll. They're going to essentially pimp it out among homeless folks as a kind of bartering. They'll trade time with the doll for stuff like food and booze. It's quite the business plan. But then he gets to the problem. Apparently they're a little short on cash, but they were hoping I could help them out. When I asked them how much they were short, Bigs said \"I'm gonna need about $3.50.\" It was about that time I realized that Bigs eight stories tall and a crustacean from the protozoic era! So I kicked them both out of the store. Goddammit Loch Ness Monster I ain't giving you no tree fiddy. Soon the store closed though, because no one wants to shop in a sex shop that smells like homeless people. It was probably for the best anyway, because I likely would've just stayed working there forever as it was easy and I was lazy.\n \n \n**TL;DR: Two homeless guys and the real girl**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396196762", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1533, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A few years back I went to Europe. When I was taking the train back to the airport, I noticed a huge commotion. It turned out that the crowd was trying to help the cutest, saddest little girl you have seen in your whole damn life. She was an American like me, and was telling people she had gotten separated from her parents. There were a bunch of people trying to help here, but she was either frightened by or had trouble understanding their accents so they weren't able to get through to here.\n\nAnyway, I start talking to her and eventually we figure out she was separated from her parents. We can get a hold of them on her cell phone, but they are going to miss their flight out so they want someone to bring her to the airport if possible. Her flight is at the other airport, but I'm super good about getting to flights hours in advance, so I think I probably have enough time to get her there and make my own flight. What an idiot. My friend who was with me decides to go straight to our flight since he is a lot more cynical than me and thought I was going to get robbed somehow, probably because he was weirded out that the girls parents had a french accent--he thought they were scammers, I guess.\n\nAnywho, me and the girl take the train to her airport. Right before we get there, the parents call and say that their flight is leaving and I need to get the girl on the next flight. This pisses me the fuck off (leaving their kid in another country? WTF?) but I'm pretty sure they are just dicks, not scammers because they have paid for the ticket, I just need to talk to someone at the airport to get her on the flight. At this point I'm pissed, but there is not much I can do other than abandon this crying 7-year old in a foreign country.\n\nFinally, we make it to the airport. By this point, I've cheered up the little girl. She's really warmed up to me, probably because this is the first time someone has taken proper care of her in her life. Anyway, she wants to be the one who talks to the ticket person, because she thought it would be fun or something. She does, but when she comes back she is crying again.

{"body": "Not a lawyer but I had a similar experience, so I can give some insight.\n\nAbout ten years ago I was working for a small, hole in the wall restaurant for minimum wage. Living on my own I obviously didn't have a whole lot of spending money available to me. But I loved the job so i kept at it. Well business started to slow down over the months and we kept having to make cut backs on staff, even though the owner (Let's call him Mr. Smith) absolutely hated doing it. We all knew it was only a matter of time before the place would close down, but Mr. Smith had been so good to us that most of us stayed extra to help out. Unfortunately the day came and he announced the restaurant would be closing at the end of the month. We were heart broken, but understood. To help pay for the bills he had on the place, Mr. Smith was offering to sell off various pieces of equipment. At this point in my life I had barely any furniture, so I thought maybe I can get a table and some chairs. I approached Mr. Smith and told him I'd like to buy some stuff but I don't have a ton of money, especially now that the place was closing. I asked if I could set up a sort of payment plan while I found another job. He smiled and told me I could have them for free because of the long hours I'd worked to help him out. I was astonished.. I thanked him profusely and went to find a truck to move them. Just as I was about to walk out the door he spoke up \"You know, there's one thing I'd like to ask before you take these, Greymore.\" \"Sure, what is it sir?\" I responded, looking back over my shoulder. \"Can I borrow about tree fiddy?\" Well it was about this time I realized Mr. Smith was a three story tall aquatic reptile! \"Damn it, get out of here monsta!\" I said, as he slide off into the distance. The restaurant closed down the next day.\n\nTL:DR; It's only legally binding if there's a certified legal professional available to confirm it's authenticity.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396226469", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

Some aspects to consider are that the Nessie is uni-directional, as opposed to the supermodel, which is bi-directional. The Nessie also has a kick and has a shorter wheelbase than the Supermodel (In case you're not familiar, this will determine how much room you'll have on the board).

I'm not lesbian\" and she said \"it's fine, just two roommates taking a shower, whats the worst that can happen?\"\nI jump in and continue to wash my face as she takes a shower. Her body was amazing! I kept staring and she obviously saw me staring once or twice because she says, \"can you help me wash my back?\" I say, \"Sure! Turn around.\" As I'm washing her back, she says \"wow, your hands feel amazing.. you should give me a massage.\" So I gladly start massaging her shoulders and she moans a little and puts her hands on mine.\nI'm starting to get a little turned on at that point so I stop and say \"this seems to be going a little far..\" She says, \"no! don't it feels so good.\" She then proceeds to turn around and give me the most amazing stare I've ever seen. Her green eyes hypnotizing me to keep touching her. She takes my hands in hers and puts them on her shoulders, still facing me, then starts sliding my hands down to her perky breasts. I can feel my face get flustered and she noticed as well, because she said, \"don't worry. I could tell you've been staring at me for a while.. Just relax.\"\nI start massaging her breasts as she puts her hands on mine. Her hand begins to go down towards my pussy, and I'm not going to lie, I could've stopped her, but I wanted to see where this was going.\nShe then slowly pushed one of her fingers into my tight pussy as I gasped slightly and said \"wow.. your hands are so warm...\" she says, \"mhm..\" and puts another in, slowly, and mechanically as she goes deeper and deeper. I could barely contain myself, so I figure, I'm not going to be the only one who suffers.\nI slide my hand down and start fingering her, slowly at first, then faster and faster. The faster I go, the faster she goes. I'm trying to make her cum before I do, but it doesn't work. Her hands are just too amazing. I freeze up and she continues at her speed as I start rocking back and forth, having my moans get louder and become almost deafening. She bites my neck and whispers in my ear, \"I want you to cum for me..\" I completely lost all control then and there and with a shaky \"o-o-h-h g-g-g-od-d-d!!\" I came harder than I have ever cum before. My legs buckled under the immense pleasure I was in and I fell into her as she kept fingering me and making me cum all over her hand..\nShe then stood me up and licked all of my juices off her fingers, then said, \"my turn\" and gave me a cute, yet sexy wink. I got on my knees and started eating her out. Her pussy tasted like heaven. Since she was already very turned on by then, it didn't take long for her to cum.\nShe started bucking into my face and moaning louder and louder as she gripped my hair and shoved my face into her and said \"oh god don't stop, don't stop, don't stop! I'm cumming!!\"\nafter she had finished, I stood up and kissed her and said, \"well, that was fun.\" Her out-of-breath reply will be something I'll never forget.\n\"Yes, getoutofme. That was something I've wanted to do since I moved in.. I actually have a question for you..\"\nI said \" Sure, anything.\" she said, \"can I get about tree fiddy...\"\nThat's when I realized she was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era!

{"body": "Ok, so Story Time. Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nI wasn't the driver, but the FOLLOW THAT CARer if you will. Anyway, my girlfriend and I had just gotten in a huge fight. Like monumental. We broke three lamps. She had a history of mental problems, and was on medication, but something had gone screwy with her prescription and she hadn't been able to get it for a few days, and lets just say tension was running high. Well, on this night, the dam broke. It was about something stupid, like me not washing the dishes on my turn, or whatever. \n\nAnyway, she screamed at me that she was going to go and jump off a building because of me. She had been suicidal before, so all of my anger was gone just like that. I ran out after her, but she had already jumped in the car and driven off, and, being poor, we shared a car.  \n\nWell, here I am, panicking in the parking lot of our apartment complex, thinking about calling 911. Her mother had always told me to try and get her myself, when she was on one of her freakouts, instead of calling the police, because due to some law, she would end up in a mental institution if she got arrested again. Read: High Matinence (We're still together).\n\nIt was around 12:30am, and the street was unusually dead. I remember crying and praying that she would just come back. She did, strangely enough. She apparently had gone around the block and decided to drive by again to call me a fucking asshole once more.\n\nI ran up to the car, but she peeled away. I was about to lose hope and call the cops, but then, as if on cue, a cab rolled around the corner! I hailed him by running out in front of his car, and jumped in the back seat. He was a middle-aged Hatian man (I could tell by his accent), and started yelling at me in Creole. I pulled out my wallet, Flashed some 20s and screamed \"FOLLOW THAT CAR!\"\n\nHe flashed a grin at the sight of the money, and stomped on the gas. We followed her for six blocks until, luckily, she ran over the curb and blew a tire (it was a 1980 Mercury, and I don't think the tires had been changed once before this night). I leapt out of the car, and ran up to her. She was just sitting there, sobbing. \n\nI grabbed her in a bear hug, and walked her back to the cab. I gave the man our address, and he drove us home. He was so nice. He waited while I walked her up and put her to bed, and gave me the warmest smile when I came back down. I asked him what the damage was for his insane six-block dash. He flashed me a subversive grin, and said coyly, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy. I gave an annoyed sigh, and slammed the cab door in his face. I didn't have time for no loch ness monstah shit that night. He drove away, obviously upset, but I didn't care.\n\nAnyway, I guess the moral of the story is that cab drivers are always willing to help out a guy in need. But they always want something in return. To this day, I still dislike and mistrust all Haitians, and refuse to get into and cab that has a Hatian guy driving.\n\n**Tl;Dr: Schizophrenic girlfriend goes off her meds, drives off.

{"body": "Oh, I've got a good story for you.\n\nAbout 5 years ago, I used to work as a cashier over at a local market. I was still in high school at the time, so it was enough to get me by.\n\nAnyways, it was summer, probably around July. I was working when suddenly this woman comes up. She was, say, 5' 7\", not fat but not thin, and had this angry look on her face. I looked down and realized she had not bought anything. \"Hello, how may I help you?\" I say.\n\n\"I would like to buy a certain type of sunscreen, but it doesn't seem to be here. Can you help me find it?\"\n\nOur boss never hired any of those guys who help people find stuff because he's cheap as fuck, so I just say, \"the sunscreen is in aisle 5.\"\n\nShe walks away and I wait for a minute. I remember it as an unpacked day, since most people were away on vacation or something. About a minute later, she comes back with a puzzled look on her face.\n\n\"Is there a problem?\" I ask kindly.\n\n\"Yes, there is sunscreen, but not the type I like.\" I am now pretty pissed, but since my boss is cheap as fuck like I said, and it's a pretty easygoing day, I leave my cash register and help her.\n\n\"Okay, so what kind of sunscreen do you need?\"\n\n\"I need SPF 42,\" she says.\n\nI remember seeing a bottle which said 41 SPF. \"Here, this is 41,\" I say, but she get increasingly angry.\n\n\"NO! NOT 41! I NEED 42!\" she is now raging.\n\n\"Ma'am, maybe there is some at a different store which sells it,\" I say. But she's in fullout rage mode. She goes ahead and knocks off all of the sunscreen and lotion. She then picks up one, unwraps it, and pours it all over. There are maybe two other customers here, and maybe 10 workers in the store, yet it is the most hectic day I've ever had. \n\nOne of my coworkers, Dave, then runs over and sees the mess. Neither of us had ever seen anyone go this apeshit, especially over 42 SPF sunscreen. \"What is this about?\" he asked, \"she got pissed I don't have 42 SPF sunscreen.\" He looks at me befuddled, and then walks down the aisle. \n\n\"Ma'am, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave,\" he said in a calm voice. But the woman pushes him. Dave slips and falls on the sunscreen and lotion. \"SECURITY!\" He yells, as two beefy men come towards us.\n\nShe then looks directly at me. \"You...\" she says. There are a lot of things that could have happened next. The fact that this happened was already unbelievable, but what happened next was worse. She literally runs full speed at me, and tackles me. At this point, I'm pissed and slightly scared. \"WHAT DO YOU WANT!\" I yelled.\n\nShe looks me in the eye, and says, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time I realized that this woman was about 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"GOD DAMMIT MONSTA I AINT GIVIN YOU TREE FIDDY!\" I yell.\n\nShe swam away as I yelled, never to be seen again.\n\nDave and I cleaned up the mess and I quit.\n\nTL;DR: woman goes apeshit", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396294473", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again.

Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh.
