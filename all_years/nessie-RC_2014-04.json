{"body": "so my friends and I had this idea. We would get 3 cows and release them in the school, labeling them 1, 2, and 5. The chaos to ensue would certainly be entertaining. We snuck onto a local dairy farm late at night, and led three cows over to a parking lot where my friend was waiting in his truck with one of those trailers that would usually be used to haul horses. We wanted to spray paint them before putting them in the trailer, and after realizing the black spray paint would blend with some of their black fur we used gold to label them 1, 2, and 5. The last one ran while we were painting it, but my other friend was able to chase it down on his motor bike and lasso it, (we had figured something like this would happen and had made sure to bring the propper equipment). We brought her back and loaded her in with the other two cows, and drove to the school. My friend backed the trailer up to the front of the school. We had taped the doors to the front of the school earlier that day and were able to open the doors no problem. We brought the cows into the school and left them some grass to eat and water to drink, because we wanted to make sure they wouldn't dehydrate in the time that they were there. I went up to number 2 and jokingly said to her \"is there anything else you guys might need\" to my shock the cow looked back at me opened her mouth and said \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was around that time that I realized that cow number 2 was eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \"Damn it monstah! you ain't gettin no  tree fiddy!\" The loch ness monster had nearly ruined the entire prank .

{"body": "I actually have a little story to share about this cryptodonger or whatever they're called. Allow me to polish it for dramatic effect. In my early 20's I went to the Congo as a Mormon missionary (shout out to /r/exmormon). My parents had been part of the first wave of missionaries to establish a presence in the Congo in 1986, and they loved to tell stories about this dinosaur creature the locals would sometimes talk about. Every now and again they would host another European traveler who'd tell them about their own hunt, people who carried cameras and hired guides and always came back disappointed. I decided to follow in their footsteps and stay there for one year. It was a difficult decision. Disregarding my parents love for the place and the common people, they begged me not to go.\n\nI spent most of the year in the capital Kinshasa. I did visit the area my parents lived for some time. It's near Garamba National Park, in the Congo Basin. One night, after a late night talk with two older men and a younger boy who spoke some English, I asked them about the monster my parents had talked about. One of them, an old and very fat man; grew very serious and said he had seen it many times. His companion kinda walked off, which I found suspicious. I decided to accompany him the next day on his daily walk, where he promised me a chance to glimpse the strange creature.\n\nI got up the next morning a few hours after dawn and found the man from the previous night with the boy, evidently waiting for me. We walked for about 25 minutes before we came to a lush, verdant clearing with a small creek and marshy undergrowth. My companions examined their perch beside the creek and hunkered down, the boy drank and the old man grinned at me while I stood anxiously unsure of what to do.\n\nThere was a loud crack from the jungle past the creek, and they both jumped to their feet, all three of us staring into the bushes in anticipation. \n\n\"What do we do?\" I asked the boy frantically.\n\nThe old man rumbled something to the boy.\n\n\"He says he needs something.\" \n\n\"What does he need?\" I asked, somewhat confused.\n\n\"He uh.. he says he needs about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was then that I realized the old man was actually eight stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.\n\nI ran back along the trail in terror to the centre of town where I luckily hitched a ride with a group of aid workers in their armed truck. I didn't tell anyone what I'd seen, but I knew it was something Joseph Smith had never prepared me for. I renounced all of those insane rituals and illogical dogmas, and I recently found my place in the Church of Scientology.

{"body": "Oh hey, for once, I have a story that actually fits the theme of the thread.\n\nSo I was lucky enough to meet no less a personage than Quentin L. Cook in person, and he had a huge impact on myself and my family.  We'd been going through some extremely rough times -- I lost my job, my wife was dealing with health problems, and generally speaking things were not looking very bright.  One day while walking through downtown Provo, I got the shock of my life when I recognized Elder Cook peering curiously at me from across the street.  I guess I was less composed than usual, 'cause I basically RAN up to him with hope in my heart that he could offer a word of advice on our family's bleak outlook.\n\nWell, of course he could.  He reminded us of the blessings that would surely follow if we were loyal to the Church and to our covenants.  He mentioned as well that there was, perhaps, something extra he could do for us due to his prominence in the Church.  I was blown away, as this was far beyond my wildest expectations.  I asked him what he meant, and he explained that there were even more blessings that could find their way to me if I could spare him $3.50 for the bus.\n\nNow that struck me as a bit odd.  I thought about it, and then realized that Elder Cook was in fact a six-story crustacean from the Paleolithic era, which was pretty surprising, to say the least.  Upon more consideration, I realized what was going on.  \"You dang Loch Ness Monsta!\" I cried.  \"I'm not giving you no tree-fiddy!  You go on now, get out of here!\"  Elder Cook was not easily persuaded, and continued to follow me down the block asking if I could spare maybe three...maybe even three fifty?  Just three fifty, maybe.  I think my wife gave him some soup, 'cause he's been mooching around my yard ever since.  Dang Loch Ness Monsta.

Initial reports claimed it weighed a ton and a half and was 15½ feet long. Upon inspection, Nessie turned out to be a bull elephant seal.\n\nThe zoo's education officer, John Shields, confessed he had been responsible for placing the body in the Loch. The seal had died the week before, and he had shaved off its whiskers, padded its cheeks with stones, and kept it frozen for a week, before dumping it in the Loch. The seal's body was displayed at the Flamingo Park Zoo for a few days before being properly disposed of.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396381659", "subreddit": "dogecoin", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had a girl tell me once that her daughter will love living in georgia with us, this was after we had been dating 2 months, then crazy really manifested itself when she turned up at my hotel room one night(my job had me traveling) when I didnt even tell her where I was staying. She had called our office and informed them I had forgot paperwork so she needed to know where to mail it then drove all night to get there.\n\nOh and then the kicker, after dating for about 6 months(yes Im an idiot) I find out that what I thought was her ex was not really her ex, that she had been going on conjugal visits to see him every other weekend. Thats right, he was locked up in prison on meth production charges and was due to get out in a few months after being there for 5 years but it wasnt a problem since she was going to divorce him before he got out. The conjugal visits arent an issue since that was just sex and I should understand since men need a release......\n\nRiiiiiiiiiight, well I broke it off right then and let her rant scream and throw shit at me in the middle of a restaurant I took her to break the news. Cops show up she calms down and leaves, or so I thought. She waits, follows me back to our hotel then jumps on me in the room saying \"she knows I cant give up her pussy\", like its gold or something. Call the cops back throw her out, change hotels, and leave the area, all done right?\n\nNo, one night back in Georgia I get a phone call from a strange out of state number, then someone knocking on my door.......have the guy living there with me answer it and its some guy she had hired locally to find me. End up calling the cops and get him to tell the story with the entire back story, luckily relatives are in law enforcement so I get all this on record. Then, I come home the next day and see a strange car on the road, walk inside and see beer sitting on my table with the note \"I will always deliver\" go up stairs and this crazy bitch is in one of the beds half naked with roses. I just shake my head, tell her to get the fuck out and go home before I call the cops, she grabs my crotch and tells me she knows I really want her.....\n\nFreaked out I just call my uncle while I sit outside in the car and see her staring at me from the window, he gets there, I tell him whats going on so he comes inside with me. He tells her that she does not have permission to be in the house and must leave now or be arrested. She starts crying and I start to walk over to her, he stops me and tells me to come outside where he says that I should leave, he will make sure she leaves since shes trying to get me to ask her to stay.\n\nAfter two restraining orders filed in Georgia and Missouri the late night calls/threats stop after around 4 years, the bitch even had her ex calling me saying, \"I owed her about tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396459325", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in High School, I had a good friend named Kyle.  He lived out in a more rural area of town, but we still used to hang out all the time anyway.  The woods around his house were perfect for paintball, and when we were younger we used them for late night games of manhunt.  My strategy was usually to hide low:  I'd shimmy underneath a bush, under the gazebo, one time I even hid under a car.  The games got increasingly elaborate, and they culminated with my friend Alan hiding on the roof of the house and scaring the crap out of Kyle's family.  We had a \"no roof, no trees\" rule after that point.\n\nAnyway, one night after a game of manhunt, Kyle drives me home.  He lives out in the middle of nowhere in NJ and at this point he's high (he's one of those \"I drive better stoned\" types) and we're driving through the woods by his house in pitch black.  This is around the time the game british submarine became popular.  For those of you that don't know, it's when you shut off your headlights and drive on the left side of the road, periodically making 'boop' noises like radar.  Yeah, it's real stupid, but we were teens and Kyle was high as fuck.  It didn't help that he would always claim to hallucinate when he smoked, so add that to the environment.  So we're driving along and we pass a local landmark, the Devil Tree.  It's in the middle of an open field and it looks sinister as fuck, but also we're driving along with no lights on the wrong side of the road on a foggy New Jersey Night.\n\nTeenage me decides that this is a good time to freak Kyle out, so I yell and say the tree's moving, to which he freaks out and jerks the wheel suddenly back to the right side of the road and as he tries to straighten the car he turns the headlights on.  He's overzealous and he turns the brights on, too, which reveal the back of a fucking car stopped in the middle of the street.  I shout, Kyle shouts, and, utterly freaked out, Kyle jerks the wheel back to the left side of the road and slams on the brakes.  We skid, screaming like idiots, for five feet.\n\nIt takes me like ten seconds to get a hold of myself, and then I look over my shoulder at the other car.  It looks like the windows are foggy so, pumped on adrenaline, I open the car door and walk over, fists clenched.  I can't see anyone through the foggy windows, so I rap on the driver's window a couple of times and jump back three feet.\n\nI hear a girl yelp \"fuck!\" from inside, then there's some scrambling, and the door unlocks.  At this point, it's pretty clear that some idiot couple was making out and failed to park off the road, so I'm pissed that they could've gotten some totally law-abiding citizen like myself hurt.  A kid comes out of the back left door and says in a voice that was probably shaking more than mine \"what do you want?\"  So I tell him I'm gonna need money to tow my friend's car (total lie but I wanted to extort the little snot), and he asks \"fuck, how much is it gonna take?\"  So I tell him I'm gonna need about tree fiddy, and about this time, he notices that I'm actually a five hundred foot tall dinosaur from the paleolithic era.  Needless to say, he paid for that 'tire'.\n\n**TL;DR:  Was in a car with a high driver playing a stupid driving game and shit got real**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396475578", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 1}

Granted, Facebook wasn't enough, but telling our parents was. In addition, telling ourselves was great enough too.\n\nSo, we took the plunge. Have been dating for awhile. I realize I'm not adequate enough with my small 6\" dick (hard, not flaccid). She starts to look around. I cannot do anything to try to qualm her desires. Unfortunately, I have a tiny penis.\n\nSo, I find this thread. That's when I realize that I could at least mentally change things for myself. Unfortunately, I realized my girlfriend is a giant prehistoric creature who weighs about tree fiddy. So I gave up.

I was sailin through the Rudrard pass, after a fortnight in Maracaibo, aboard the Filthy Hen, where I was squirin for a cap'n named Dry-Eyed Daegen (on account of how he never cried in his entire life, so stern was he). We'd gone to Maracaibo to crack Jenny's tea cup and so we was all dry-eyed ourselves, walkin off the grog. Anyways we spots a vessel off the port bow whose futtock had come undone. Easy picks. Daegen he spies me and says, \"Young scallywag, jump in me wherry and take a look.\" Well I was right to please him so I jumps in the wherry and rows over to the broken clipper. As I drew near and seen naught a trace of the crew and cap'n I could tell the men aboard had long since dispatched to Davy Jones locker. Something had done up their clipper fierce. I pulled to her starboard and sees their Jacob's ladder has been let down so maybe they's escaped during some warrin. Off on a longboat or something. I let out the killick and set about climbin aboard for a once-over when I hears it. Like that sound she makes on the open seas when everyone else is asleep and you're alone on the aft deck watchin' the stars. Right away I understood what had happened to the wee clipper. I turn and there she be. I knew what she want. And I tells her, I ain't got your tree fiddy.

Their eyes darted toward eachothers, then one of my buddy's friends pulled out a knife and pushed me to the ground. All the other kids gathered around.

Well, i decided a short cut was in order. To go from the drive way to the back lawn you needed to go up this somewhat steep hill that was on the side of their house. The folks that were having me load the barrel told me not to fill it to much or it would be to hard to push up the hill. well, i decided (like an idiot) to fill the wheel barrow until it was mounded over (they had left to go run an errand, so i was by myself at the time) and started to walk it up the hill. \n\nas you probably guessed it would be, it was too heavy for me and started to tip to the side. Well in a split second decision, i decided that the best course of action would be to stop and pull back on the handles. This worked in stopping the tipping, but the wheel barrow was pretty much pointing directly upward (it was a pretty steep hill) and when i stopped moving forward, it started tipping backward. i tried to step out of the way, but it caught me right in the groin and tipped the whole wheelbarrow over onto my head, burying me and crushing my nuts in the process....\n\ni was brought to the emergency room and they tried to save what was left but there was no use, and they eventually had to amputate my twins and basically make me a eunuch... luckily for me though, when i got the hospital bill, they had felt so sorry for me and my predicament that they only charged me tree fiddy for my hospital stay, and for that i am eternally grateful.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396549958", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It was a normal house, kinda big for how shabby his clothes always seemed to be, always poorly fitting and stretched, that type of person, know what I mean? We did usual things, we played video games, he was never very good at them, couldn't get the hang of the controller and he always said that the TV screen was too far away.\n\nI was really surprised to see a swimming pool in his back garden, one he was adamant to get into. I couldn't refuse a swimming pool so I got in too, he was quite the swimmer and he could hold his breath for ages. We had fun together and he didn't seem to want to get out at any point. I got out to dry and he stayed in. After a little while he got out as well and came back inside. It was as he sat down on the couch with me he said something, something that changed my life for ever.

At 25 I decided to look her up and apologize. Now this was a time before Facebook but not a time before the internet so while it took some time I finally found her. I emailed her simply saying I'm sorry. I didn't want to pander to her or make excuses, I just wanted to apologize. She emailed back a few days later and expressed her gratitude towards the apology. We ended up discussing high school and what we've done since then. It didn't go much past that.\rAbout 8 years go by and there is knock at my door. I open it and its her. I am kind of shocked (remember the 2000 mile move) but there she is. I ask what she was doing at my house and she says \"Can I borrow about tree fiddy?\" \rSorry I had to..

Thus was the birth of Gregory II AKA Junior. \n\nAt age 25, Junior was a talented fellow. He was very good at the fields of Language Arts, English, and Grammar. He really liked to make up stories that had no ending, Those were really fun to him. One thing Junior lacked was *fun*. He was simply boring, very *boring*. He always would correct anyone at *any* mistake. He would always but into conversations and was generally, how do I put this, **ANNOYING**. \n\nOn Junior’s birthday, 6925, The planet was collapsing in on itself, or so he thought. The entire planet, the size of russia with one nation and a few populated areas with Junior’s being the biggest, Unanimously decided to spread Juniors genes to save Gumanity.  Boarding the capsule headed to earth, Junior said his last goodbyes, but little did he know, no one will miss him as all the people that loved him had died in a tragic accident.  The planet was never gonna explode, they all just wanted to party better.  And, on a sleeping pill for 3 years and a VR, thus began Junior’s journey to earth. \n\nJunior’s destination was Raliegh, North Carolina, USA in the year 6928.  As he left the capsule, he started noticing how everyone on earth looked the same as everyone on Grypton. \n\nHe saw a women that looked pretty nice so he approached her and asked, “excuse me, ma’am, do you know where we are? i’m a traveler,”. She smiled and replied with, “We are in Raliegh, North Carolina,”. Then Junior said, “Thank you very much, wanna grab a drink sometime?” to which the women replied to, “Sure! my name is Jesse,”. “Great, my name is Gregory the second, but you can call me Junior,”. \n\nLater that night Junior and Jesse hooked up and started dating.  \n\nOn october 10th, Junior realized how much better he is than everybody else except in grammar. Everything he said also came true like, “I hope the weather is nice today,” makes the weather nice. So he started making a Costume immediately.  “Grammar man,” said Junior, “Grammar man, *YEAH*!”. \n\nOn that day Junior wore the costume, Climbed the biggest building in Raleigh North Carolina, and jumped off screaming “**FLY**,”.

You admit defeat once more and decide to watch regardless, maybe there is still something different.\n\nYou're heartbroken yet again. What you saw wasn't a beautiful montage of Ted and Tracy together that you were promised. You don't see them slowly grow old together as they watch their kids achieve whatever they want in life.

Everyone was getting pretty hammered. They had three beer pong tables set up in the garage, chicks were getting in the pool, and there were people throwing up in the back yard. It was serious business. Anyways, being one of the champion football players myself, lots of chicks were all over me that night; beautiful, drunk, sexy high school girls. Jail bait for anyone over 17. This one girl I'd seen around school but had been to shy to ask out was drinking particularly heavily that night and came up to me after I smashed a couple of dweebs in beer pong. She grabbed my arm and led me upstairs to a bedroom. We started making out and things got heavy pretty quick. Her top came off along with my shirt and belt. We fell on the bed and kept going forward. She pulled my pants off and said she wanted it. I asked her, \"How much do you want?\" to which she replied, \"About tree fiddy.\" I did a double take and the hot girl turned out to be the Loch Ness monster!

{"body": "This story is fucked up. Definitely the worst thing that's ever happened to me. Reader beware.\n\nA couple of years ago, I worked at a 24 hour pizza place out here in California. It was pretty slow at night but you'd be seriously surprised at how much business we'd get in the middle of the night.\n\nDuring the daylight hours we had 3-12 people working depending on the  day of the week and general rush of things. At night we usually had 2 people on staff, sometimes 3. Well, I was working a night shift this one time, myself and this supervisor/manager dude named Jonathan. Not really sure what his title would be. Anyway, it's like 2:40 AM, and we're just hanging around. Had a couple orders 20 minutes before and he says he's gonna take a piss and grab a smoke.\n\nHe steps out back and I'm chilling in there on my phone, sipping on an Arnold Palmer. It had been about 3-4 minutes, and I heard a single knock at the back door, but I figured he'd just bumped into it accidentally or something.\n\nNext thing you know, another 10 minutes passes, and I'm a little weirded out. The dude never took a break longer than 5 minutes and it had been 15 at this point. I give it another 5 minutes and he still hadn't come back. I go out back to take a look, and nobody is there. His cigarette was on the ground, about half left. I'm thinking, \"this motherfucker is trying to scare me shitless.\" I shook my head and went back inside.\n\nSo I assumed it was a joke, and sat back down to wait, but I wasn't quite sure. He wasn't really the type to do something like that. I'm a bit nervous nonetheless. Sat around biting my lip for another 10 minutes, and I started hearing some muffled noises. They were coming from the walk-in cooler, so I finally could breathe a sigh of relief, and I figured the asshole was screwing around.\n\nI open the door, and what in the righteous fuck do I see?\n\nHe's fucking tied up with duct tape: hands bound behind his back, and a strip over his mouth. His face is just fucking covered in blood, he's sitting in a pool of it, and his eyes are black and basically swollen shut. His shoes were gone and there were long slices all over his feet, bottom and top. He sees me and just starts FLIPPING OUT. I ripped the duct tape off his face and he just starts crying, telling me to get the fuck out, and he's just delirious as all goddamn hell. I'm fucking freaking out, literally so scared for my life.\n\nI leave the walk-in cooler to go grab my phone and call the police, and all the lights are off. Cannot see ANYTHING. It's completely dark. There are a couple of windows providing some light from the street lamps but any area without a window was literally pitch black. Last thing I remember was getting hit in the back of the head.\n\nI woke up sitting next to Jonathan and it was at this point I was really flipped the fuck out. The cooler light was off and I just started screaming, \"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT?!\" among other things.\n\nThere was quick reply: \"About tree fiddy.\" It was at this point I realized I had been knocked out and held hostage by an 8 story tall lochness monster from the Paleozoic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396727253", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, OP, I have a little bit more to mine. I think i would want to go back in time and change some stupid shit that happened to me.\n\nSo a little background for this, it was my senior year of high school and I had met the love of my life and probably one of the only times that i had felt happy in seriously a long time(I was a hermit throughout high school, so aside from sports all i did was sit at home). Anyways this is beside the point. \n\nSo I meet this girl, shes brand new to the school, first year there. She was in my math class and has some of the nicest tits i have ever seen in my life, like an easy 10/10. Since this is high school you know that they are natural(or least they seem to be). Naturally since shes new and doesn't have any friends i decided to play the \"Hey I can show you around\" if ya know what I mean. \n\nFast forward to the half-way point of school me and her are almost inseparable now and hangout almost every day after school. to the point where i was staying at her house almost as much as i lived at my own house. It was great. She had a great family that loved me and her brother ever played on my soccer team, so initially it was the greatest thing that could've happened.\n\nSo I finally get up enough courage to talk to her and ask her out to the school dance, but that isn't that important(those tits in the dress tho, it was like melons trapped in a dress). So later that night we get back to her place and have a nice dinner. Candle lit and all that fancy shit. From there we went straight to her living room and watch movies until everyone in her house goes to bed. This is where things really get heavy, we start kissing, just little pecks. Then i did something that will be the downfall of every female i've been with since. I kissed her neck. This got her going like a wildebeest in heat, she instantly begun to straddle me and we were making out in now time. This is where i touched a real tit for the first time(after ripping her shirt off of course). after all this foreplay, i try something that i have never tried before; I slowly and gently began to slide my hand down her stomach toward her genitals, but she stopped me \"whats wrong, what do you need?\" I asked quizzically. She looked at me with her beautiful red eyes and said \"I need about tree fiddy\" then it just hit me. I had spend all this time trying to get inside the Loch Ness Monsters pants. One thing for sure I wish i could change cause now he wont ever leave me alone. Always asking for \"tree fiddy\". Thats all i want right now\n\n**TL:DR I fucked up real bad in high school with this girl, and now shes all I want**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396758990", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

French critics' response to the film was much more positive than it was on its original release, with former editor-in-chief of Cahiers du cinéma Serge Daney calling the film \"a marvel\". The film was re-released in its original form to American theatres on October 31, 2003 and received great critical acclaim. Based on 35 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, Eyes Without a Face received an average 97% fresh rating with an average rating of 8\\.1\\/10\\. The reviewers commented on the film's poetic nature and noted the strong influence of French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader praised the film, referring to it as \"absurd and as beautiful as a fairy tale\". J. Hoberman of The Village Voice declared the film \"a masterpiece of poetic horror and tactful, tactile brutality\". The Encyclopedia of Horror Films noted the Cocteau influence, stating that \"Franju invests \\[the film\\] with a weird poetry in which the influence of Cocteau is unmistakable\". David Edelstein of Slate also compared the film to Cocteau's work, commenting that \"the storyline is your standard obsessed-mad-doctor saga, one step above a Poverty Row Bela Lugosi feature ... \\[b\\]ut it's Lugosi by way of Cocteau and Ionesco\".

I came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro.\n\nCTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed.\n\nWait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh.\n\nSince rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now, so I'll be in my bunk with dat ass. Oh, you! ...now KISS!!! I know you should never stick your dick in crazy, but DM;HS.\n\n...this kills the redditor.\n\nOP will surely deliver. In the meantime, I'll show myself out.\n\nDirected by M.

{"body": "On April 20th, 6900, on the planet Grypton, a mother, Sharkisha, was giving birth to a child.  She was high (it’s weed day after all) so all she was saying was “Gregory, Ooooh Gregory,”(her husbands name) while having 3 orgasms at once.  Thus was the birth of Gregory II AKA Junior. \n\nAt age 25, Junior was a talented fellow. He was very good at the fields of Language Arts, English, and Grammar. He really liked to make up stories that had no ending, Those were really fun to him. One thing Junior lacked was *fun*. He was simply boring, very *boring*. He always would correct anyone at *any* mistake. He would always but into conversations and was generally, how do I put this, **ANNOYING**. \n\nOn Junior’s birthday, 6925, The planet was collapsing in on itself, or so he thought. The entire planet, the size of russia with one nation and a few populated areas with Junior’s being the biggest, Unanimously decided to spread Juniors genes to save Gumanity.  Boarding the capsule headed to earth, Junior said his last goodbyes, but little did he know, no one will miss him as all the people that loved him had died in a tragic accident.  The planet was never gonna explode, they all just wanted to party better.  And, on a sleeping pill for 3 years and a VR, thus began Junior’s journey to earth. \n\nJunior’s destination was Raliegh, North Carolina, USA in the year 6928.  As he left the capsule, he started noticing how everyone on earth looked the same as everyone on Grypton. \n\nHe saw a women that looked pretty nice so he approached her and asked, “excuse me, ma’am, do you know where we are? i’m a traveler,”. She smiled and replied with, “We are in Raliegh, North Carolina,”. Then Junior said, “Thank you very much, wanna grab a drink sometime?” to which the women replied to, “Sure! my name is Jesse,”. “Great, my name is Gregory the second, but you can call me Junior,”. \n\nLater that night Junior and Jesse hooked up and started dating.  \n\nOn october 10th, Junior realized how much better he is than everybody else except in grammar. Everything he said also came true like, “I hope the weather is nice today,” makes the weather nice. So he started making a Costume immediately.  “Grammar man,” said Junior, “Grammar man, *YEAH*!”. \n\nOn that day Junior wore the costume, Climbed the biggest building in Raleigh North Carolina, and jumped off screaming “**FLY**,”.  Needless to say, he died. Just like your grammar. You fucking illiterate.\n\nStory: Hashtag_Taha\n\nCasting: Hashtag_Taha\n\nEverything else: Hashtag_Taha\n\nSince you read this, ima need bout tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396832983", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": -1, "controversiality": 1}

Crouch over the corpse to steal its boots and gloves, possibly upgrading your own mobility.\n\n* Every pilot is equipped with retractable fins for fast and agile aquatic maneuvers.  Stim users can stay underwater for extended time.\n\n* Pilots can use a jet burst to double jump, but if you try hard enough and believe in yourself, you can perform the fabled triple jump.\n\n* Look in secluded grottos and alcoves to find special power ups that will unlock the ultimate Titan abilities.\n\n* Pace yourself when firing Titan weapons.  A smart pilot never overheats his or her ride.\n\n* Facing a difficult climb?  If you can stand on your Titan's shoulders, you may be able to haul it upward using your own jump jets.\n\n* The Arc Cannon is a formidable weapon, but if an ally also has one, it is very important that you do not cross the streams.  That would be bad.\n\n* The Smart Pistol Mk. 5 is not really that smart.  When off duty, the weapon mostly watches reality television or listens to tween pop music.\n\n* Satchel Charges sometimes contain wonderful prizes.  Stay close to yours when you set them off -- that way you won't miss out.\n\n* If you start a match prepared to play three of the same Burn Card, you become known as a \"Triple Threat,\" gaining triple XP for all kills that match.\n\n* No matter which suit is trump, if you end a game with the Queen of Spades in your pile, 13 points will be scored against you.\n\n* Burn cards are actual cards physically burned at Respawn HQ.

{"body": "This is true. I spent my summers from university backpacking in various mountain ranges in America - from the Cascades to the Adirondack, I've done them all. It was a glorious way to spend time with my friends, my family, and one time even my environmental professor.\n\nI recently underwent a whole midlife crisis, during which my therapist suggested that I get back into hiking. So this past summer, I took a week off of work, packed up the mini van, and drove my wife and two teenage kids to the Appalachian Mountains. \n\nI was ready to have a great week of bonding with my family, but my kids thought otherwise - \"What do you mean, I can't snapchat my friends?\" \"I can't even check in on Foursquare, what is this shit?\" My son and daughter were absolutely distraught that we were actually away from civilization and cell phone service/WiFi for an entire week.\n\nGradually, my kids got more and more upset with me and my wife at the lack of wifi. They spent the entire time lagging behind, causing me to become frustrated with them. So one morning, they refused to leave their tent. I begged and pleaded with them to no avail, so I sent my wife (their stepmother) to take care of them. She came back crying, saying that the kids were so upset that they started using racial slurs (my kids are white, my wife is black). \n\nSo, I decided to teach them a lesson - if they didn't want to come with us, fine. I set a map outside their tent for the next two days, and told them to meet us at the rendezvous point where our car would be waiting for us. My wife was still very disturbed by the incident; before we left she went to confront the kids about it one more time. I only heard a part of the conversation:\n\n\"Raquel, Charlie, can we talk?\"\n\"No. Go away.\"\n\"If you don't accept me as a parental figure, that's fine. But using derogatory slurs is never okay. Now, I'm willing to accept an apology, but  first I need something from you.\"\n\"What do you need?\"\n\"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nI ran outside, but it was too late - it turns out, my new wife was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. That goddamn Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\n\nTL;DR - Went hiking with the wife and kids without wifi for a week.

{"body": "It was a cold and dreary night. The moon shone only for a few moments with each passing clearance of clouds, which was very rare. The sound of rain smashed, not only on the tops of trees and against the ground, but on the heads of five huntsmen, who were setting up camp for the night. The rain got everywhere on them. In their cloaks, their boots, under their clothes, even some would seep into the tents. It was, or so the accounts go, around 9 p.m. in June. This is the account of John Semik, a man who prevailed from the East.\n\n\"It's bloody cold tonight, boys!\" said the leader of the expedition, warming his hands up by rubbing them together. They were traveling in the unknown, so, of course, everyone packed what they'd expect to feel around here. Fur coats, long shirts, and short shirts. Fur boots were a must in this territory, the accounts of earlier hunters said it would get extremely cold in some regions for no reason. However, this night, unlike most in this land, was extremely cold for the summer that they were experiencing.\n\n The leader of this expedition, Luther, took out an oil lantern, and set it in the clearing of forest they decided to make camp in. It immediately expelled all darkness from the clearing, allowing everyone to see each other in vague detail. John, our accountant, set down his pack and began to set up his tent, as well as everyone else. As the hour passed, they had all had their tents pitched, and their tarps up (which it was slightly too late for) as the rain began to clear. They switched the lantern for a campfire within a few minutes, using some of the oil to help get the fire going.\n\nSoon, the atmosphere for hanging around a campfire was set. The rain had mostly cleared, and the fire was burning hot. As they all sat around the campfire, they discussed recent bearings. Wives, whores, bar fights, whatever came to pass. Then, a particular subject which is commonly discussed among those who sit around campfires, came around.\n\nSupernatural occurances. Scary sorts. John, being a fairly quiet guy, had none to tell. But the four others, they had plenty. They told them all, hauntings around ships, seeing a ghost in the hallway after dark, hearing something go bump in the night. Then, Ralph of the North, muttered something.\n\n\"Ever heard of the night critter?\" he asked.\n\n\"Night critters? Ha! There are a lot of those in the area.\" said Luther.\n\n\"No...\", Ralph said, eyes getting wider. \"The night critter.\"\n\nEveryone around the fire had heard nothing about the night critter. Even Ivan, the \"master of rumors\" had heard nothing about it.\n\n\"Go ahead. Spit it out.\" said Ivan, ready to hear another rumored beast.\n\n\"The night critter,\" Ralph started, \"is not a critter in itself. It is a being that does not speak, does not move unless you face away from it, and can and will morph into whatever it can to take you as far as it can away from your group.\"\n\n\"Oh, so it's some sort of rapist monster?\" said Luther.\n\n\"No. It only takes you from your group, then it, along with you, disappear into an apparent dream world, where it will constantly terrify you until you perish from the fear.\"\n\nThe camp was silent.\n\n\"Often stalking into parties of huntsmen or drunken people who roam the forests, it will undoubtedly sneak in as one of them. As soon as they go to sleep, or begin to drift off, or even if it gets discovered, you hear it transform. Some say that it sounds as if someone is ripping through their own ribcage, and then a deafening scream is heard, then, it gets eerily silent. The entire forest will not make noise. There, it will slowly take the people out.\"\n\n\"All at once?\" said Ivan, now clutching his flintlock. The entire camp began to slowly pick up their own weapons, now getting more and more terrified.\n\n\"No. If you are asleep when it strikes, it will take all of you. But, if it succeeds in getting at least one of them and is caught, it will fade away with the person, then after some months or even years, catch the rest of them off guard, even in their own homes.\" \n\n\"Where the fuck does this thing live?!\" said Thomas, the youngest of the group. \n\n\"We don't know. The indigenous people of this area told me the story as I was learning how to hunt with them one day. So, it lives in this very area.\" \"How can you stop it?\" asked Isaac, the last one to join their expedition. \"You can't. Not even light scares the monster off. It can, and will get you in any way. My suggestion is, if something seems off in the forest around you, it's already too late. Accept your fate, or pray to God that it doesn't decide to go for you.\" \"What does its actual true form look like?\" Luther said, almost whispering. The fire was almost out.\n\n\"Like this.\" said Ralph. Everyone was surprised as Ralph put out the fire, and the darkness around them was only broken by a pair of gleaming white eyes with tiny pupils, and a full row of 92 teeth, all razor sharp, always smiling. Ivan tried firing, but the blast only gave light to how incredibly slender and hunched down it was. As it extended into it's full length, John accounts that it was at least 6 or 7 feet tall, and it's body was extremely slender. It's hands appeared to have razor sharp claws on each hand, and it's feet ferocious and had sharp claws as well.\n\nJohn said that he heard Ivan scream, then it was eclipsed by the voice of the Night \nCritter.\n\n\"I lied about the part of it not being able to speak.\" \"Ralph\" spoke. They heard it race off into the night, along with Ivan, as they heard his scream slowly dwindle. Luther scrambled for his lantern, and got it lit. He shoved oil into it, and hit it on full burning capacity.\n\nThe clearing was empty. Ivan was gone. The forest was still silent as was before the story began.\n\n\"As long as we have our eyes peeled, it cannot get to us if we look at it. It doesn't move if we look at it.\" said Luther, still terrified. John saw that almost everyone was damn well in tears and still clutching their guns.\n\nSoon, the forest began to have sound again.\n\nThe Night Critter was gone.\n\n\"The forest is alive again. We're safe.\" exhaled Thomas, who was stifling a cry. \"For now.\" said Isaac. \"Remember what Ralph; it, said. It will come back for us.\"\n\n**and he was right.**\n\nThat remaining night, nothing happened. They decided to leave the next morning, which they all promptly did, without packing up their items. As they returned to town, they gave a full account of their experience, as well as why Ralph and Ivan were gone.\n\n**They were all hunted down.**\n\nIsaac was the first to go. He was in his house, retired from his duty of expediting after what happened, when his wife said he heard a bump from down the hall. As he lit his candle and checked it out, the Night Critter was sitting at the edge of the darkness, it's eyes wide and it's teeth showing. He let out a scream of fear and dropped his candle. Thomas, was next. He was boating when he heard a little girl cry out for help. As he went to investigate, he docked his boat and found the noise. The Night Critter manifested the voice of a little girl, and promptly took him as well.\n\nLuther, who was now batshit crazy and trusted no one, killed himself. He heard about Thomas, and took a bullet to the head after reportedly seeing eyes approaching his bedroom.\n\nHis body was never found.\n\nAnd, that leaves our accountant, John, whom we kept tabs on. He told the story, and how he escaped it multiple times, only for it to get him when he did not expect it. He was running away from it out of our Headquarters, where he promptly told us his account, what it looked like, and how everyone met their fates. He left us after he was done. He didn't want us to be a victim. As his last running trip ended, he found himself alone in the exact forest where Ralph said the story. He approached the clearing. The beast grew to its limit, 7 foot tall. It then looked down at John, and said loudly, \"I'mma need about tree fiddy.\" our scout then realized it was actually 500 foot tall and from the paleolithic era. \n\nNeedless to say, John paid his price. He shilled out the money, and it left him. His friends were found in the field next to the clearing. It turned out that, none of them were able to pay the price, so they were stuck in his trap. John was now a hero to them, saving them from their imminent doom from this beast. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396920735", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

It's been a-boiling for a while now. It's time to tell you all the story of a horrendous bitch by the name of Mrs. Brown. Mrs. Brown was my 3rd grade teacher at a Christian elementary school. Now Mrs. Brown was a classic Southern woman, Christian as Saint Peter himself, judgmental as he is too. This woman had no room for anything other than perfectly behaved children in her class. No running, no bullying, no fighting, and definitely no foul language. Combine a little bit of the first three at times with a lot of the last one into me, and you have the finished recipe for a child she does not like. Now, like any Southern woman, Mrs. Brown knows how to dole out her punishment on a rebellious child. In an effort to reduce foul language (aka punish me), she decided to punish even the most benign of foul words. Crap was the first to go, followed by shoot, dang, and darn. Now I was a very competitive little child and when I lost at anything, one of these words would inevitably fly out of my mouth. Eventually offenses stacked up, and punishments became harsher. Lost recess, detentions, write ups, etc all culminated in a week without recess. A whole week without recess is like torture to an nine year old boy. I begged and pleaded with her for the entire week but she gave me nothing. No sign of hope. On Friday however, I continued, but she relented when I said I'd give her anything she wanted. \"Anything?\" she replied. I asked her what it would take to got out and play just for today. She turned to me and said, \"About tree fidddy.\" It was about that time I noticed that my teacher was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic Era. I said, \"Goddammit monstah! I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" In the end I lost recess for a week and had nothing to show for it at all.

You act as if their are mountains of evidence to support your claim but so far the only scientific study brought into the discussion is one proving that you're wrong. \n\nAs for the transfer of skills being common knowledge, you keep using very narrow examples that no one would refute and then use that to make broad conclusions. Yes playing a flight simulator would make you better at flying. Yes playing a level of a video game will make you better at playing the next level of that that video game. Yes doing a job will prepare you for promotion. Is this really what were arguing or are we arguing whether or not playing Metal Gear Solid makes you better at math and problem solving (just to make up an example)? It seems like you're making the latter claim and providing zero evidence. \n\n&gt;wrong. by your logic we should assume there are no ET, or before we discovered any fossils we should have conclude that there were no dinosaurs, or before finding the americas we should conclude that there was no americas, etc. \n\nYou act as if science makes these hard, unchangable conclusions. In the days before dinosaurs were known it would have been prudent to conclude that dinosaurs did not exist, but willing to completely change your mind given the evidence. It would be imprudent, however, to change your mind because some guy says there's mountains of evidence to prove that there were dinosaurs but he isn't going to bother showing you any of it because its common knowledge that dinosaurs exist. You're entire premise is a bit strange because it supposes that you can find evidence for the non-existance of thing). Do you believe in big foot, unicorns, werewolfs, and the Loch Ness monster?

{"body": "&gt; Is this really what were arguing or are we arguing whether or not playing Metal Gear Solid makes you better at math and problem solving (just to make up an example)? It seems like you're making the latter claim and providing zero evidence. \n\nso indeed, like I said, you are misunderstanding what I mean. no I do not mean the latter at all (especially given metal gear solid has no usage of math and problem solving is too general a term to categorize it as a skill); I'm saying the 1st (like I just explained in my previous comment but somehow you still don't understand); I repeat: \"some of the functions/skills transfer, others not, depending on how similar the new tasks are;\". one can't just say there is or not transfer, there is degrees of transfer depending on the similarities of the tasks. and given at least some video games do involve some math, sometimes statistics are useful, some management, some economy, some eye-hand-coordination; playing those games improves your \"math, sometimes statistics (...), some management, some economy, some eye-hand-coordination\". you're not just  playing a game, you're doing some math, sometimes statistics (...), some management, some economy, some eye-hand-coordination\" while playing the game, thus you're not just learning to play a game, you're learning to do some math, sometimes statistics (...), some management, some economy, some eye-hand-coordination\". can't make it any clearer then this.\n\n&gt; In the days before dinosaurs were known it would have been prudent to conclude that dinosaurs did not exist\n\nno it would not (I'll explain why). so you conclude that there are no ETs? because that's the conclusion that kind of thinking would make.\n\n&gt;You're entire premise is a bit strange because it supposes that you can find evidence for the non-existance of thing\n\nyou can. you just did when you that source saying there is no transfer of skills, etc. the non-existence of transfer of skills. another example is if you searched the entire beach for a certain seashell and did not find it, you have found evidence that there is no such seashell in that beach. if you look for a certain pair of socks in your drawer and don't find it, it's evidence of the non-existence of that pair of socks in that drawer; (seriously wtf? and you say you are taking a PhD in a science? very hard to believe when you come up with this nonsense that is self-evident for even a preschooler). So it would not be prudent to conclude there weren't any dinosaurs because we hadn't looked, explored enough to conclude within reasonable doubt what happened on earth millions of years ago, we simply had no clear idea of what the earth was like at that time, so we should not conclude anything because we simply didn't know. same situation now with ETs, we simply don't know because we haven't explored other star systems extensively enough to conclude whether there probably are or not ETs.\n\n&gt;Do you believe in big foot, unicorns, werewolfs, and the Loch Ness monster? To my knowledge, not a single piece of evidence has been provided to show they don't exist.\n\nlike I explained just above: there's plenty of evidence they don't exist; we have been looking into forests and lakes for centuries, we've extensively explored the alleged habitats of these mythical creatures, and didn't find anything; that is evidence that they don't exist, at least not on earth.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397000958", "subreddit": "science", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was young and naive I was in a long distance relationship with a girl I met over the internet. One night we were talking on the phone about a very unsettling experience she had that day. She told me that she went to a house that was empty for years after a young girl was murdered there, she claimed that she knew the girl when she was in elementary school (burden of proof is on her, I am only telling what I remember her saying leading up to what happened to me personally). She told me that when she was in the house she saw human-like movement in places that made no sense (figures moving across open windows on the second floor from outside, things that sound physically impossible). She didn't stay for too long because she started feeling incredibly uneasy. What she admitted to being most uneasy about was that this was all taking place during the middle of a bright day. Most people tend to have these frightening experiences during night, not for her though. It only made the situation feel even more helplessly sinister. She told me since she left the house she kept seeing things that did not make sense. Out of the corner of her eye she would see figures fall upwards beside a tree, only to completely disappear after passing a branch. A shadow floating in the air as a puddle rippled by a drinking fountain, vanishing when the puddle got still. At the apex of the situation she began hearing whispers subtlety coming out of every day sounds, whispers beneath the sound of a car passing by, or a floorboard creaking. The longer the day went on the least explainable things were becoming. I didn't believe in ghosts, but I believed in demons. I was convinced that something very evil was following her and playing with her mind. I told her she should go chill in a church for awhile, talk with a pastor, priest, anyone that might be able to distance her from whatever this thing was. When I said this, the phone immediately flooded with white noise. Behind me, my kitten freaked out, hissed and ran underneath the couch. I turned around as my kitten was running and caught a glimpse of a giant white figure darting past the outside window against the black of night. Given the height of the window from the outside ground I would have to say whatever it was had to of been nine to ten feet tall. I got off the phone and promptly got the fuck out of the room. My kitten died three days later, apparently due to parasites, but that explanation didn't sit well with me. My understanding has always been demons torture people for something, that shouldn't be news to anyone regardless of how much you know about demons. I was trying to figure out what something like that would want from my girlfriend, or me for that matter, since it seemingly traveled straight through the fucking phone line. When I started thinking about what it might of wanted to do with me, I experienced one of the whispers first hand, \"I need about tree fiddy\". I knew then what I was dealing with: I said, \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy you god damn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own god damn money!\" turns out my girlfriend gave it a dollar without telling me. No wonder the Loch Ness monster was bothering me... In all seriousness though yes my g/f freaked out after going into a \"haunted\" house that day, and I did see things the way I explained them happening from my perspective as well as believed it was a demon at the time. My kitten did die too :(. Then one fateful day I pulled my head out of my ass and stopped believing in bullshit, things have been better since then.

I became close with the managers of the post office branch I worked at, who eventually acquiesced and let me keep the mail truck at my house and drive it to/from school/work.\n\nOne day, my friends and I got absolutely hammered at my house. We drunkenly thought it would be really cool to start drinking in the back of the truck, where there was space.

The truck roared to life, and my friends laughed and applauded.\n\nWe sped around my neighborhood at 2 o'clock in the morning for a while, when I decided it would be a great idea to get on the main road. I hit the gas, and we were going 30, 35, 40... suddenly, we were going 65 miles per hour on this major road outside of Baltimore, where I lived. My friend opened the window on the other side, took a box of mail, and started throwing it outside yelling \"YOU'VE GOT MAIL, BITCHES!\"\n\nIt was all fun and games until my cell phone rang.

{"body": "[fas·cism (noun) - a way of organizing a society in which a government ruled by a dictator controls the lives of the people and in which people *are not allowed to disagree with the government*](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism) [emphasis supplied].\n\nThat is you. It is spot on.\n\nAnd as for your charge that I am not \"standing with the Founding Fathers,\" you are completely ignorant of reality.\n\nOn March 15, 1783, six months before the end of the American Revolutionary War, George Washington addressed a group of Army officers at Newburgh, New York. They were gathered because another anonymous pamphlet was circulating among the soldiers accusing Washington of being incompetent, maligning the Army and encouraging the soldiers to desert. Washington told the officers that the pamphlet \"[was] designed to answer the most insidious purposes,\" and how his heart was filled with \"indignation ... when the mouth of detraction has been opened against [the Army]\". (Fitzpatrick vol. 26, p. 223, 224).\n\nWashington wondered whether the anonymous writer was \"plotting [...] ruin ... by sowing the seeds of discord and seperation [*sic*] between the Civil and Military powers of the Continent\" (Fitzpatrick vol. 26, p. 225). Nevertheless, Washington concluded: \"for if Men [*sic*] are to be precluded from offering their Sentiments on a matter, ***which may involve the most serious and alarming consequences, that can invite the consideration of Mankind*** [*sic*], reason is of no use to us; ***the freedom of Speech may be taken away, and, dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter***\" [emphasis supplied] (Fitzpatrick vol. 26, p. 225).\n\nIf, during the Revolutionary War, George Washington could not help but defend the principle of the freedom of speech, even when he thought that speech was intended to \"sow the seeds of discord,\" even though it attacked his character and called on his soldiers to desert their posts, even though the existence of this nation as a federal republic was threatened, what possible scenario could be more dire, and with higher stakes that would justify the censorship that Washington opposed? If George Washington advocated for the free exercise of expression and dissent under those circumstances, do you truly believe that a bunch of people being seriously offended requires the taking of more drastic actions than even George Washington was willing to take during a war?!?\n\nAs for that picture of Elizabeth Eckford and that mob in *Arkansas*, it is pretty apropos to the video. There is a crazy mob, not protesting or \"peaceably assembling\" mind you, on the verge of attacking others for exercising their Constitutional rights requiring the presence of police or the military. Just because I personally agree with the *views* of the mob in the video and disagree with the views of the mob in the picture, doesn't mean it isn't pretty analogous.\n\nAny concept of \"abusing the right to free speech\" that you try to justify simply does not exist. **There is no such thing as \"abusing\" the freedom of speech**. It is as mythological as the Easter Bunny, the Loch Ness Monster, or the divinity of Jesus. \"If there is a **bedrock principle** underlying the First Amendment, it is that **the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable** [emphasis supplied] [*Texas v. Johnson*, 491 US 414 (1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2084618710761560217). \"Accordingly a function of free speech ... may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of **UNREST, creates DISSATISFACTION with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to ANGER**\" [emphasis supplied] [*Terminiello v. Chicago*, 337 US 4 (1949)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2189837708321658845). You see my confused friend, the very purpose of the First Amendment is to protect the vile, offensive speech that most in society would rather ban. If I may borrow the words of an attorney from Colorado, [\"[e]ven the most repressive governments on earth will allow you to swap chocolate chip recipes with your mother.\"](http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2014/04/bradley_justice_lawsuit_f_you_copper.php) If the purpose of the Free Speech Clause in the First Amendment was to protect only the messages that made people feel all warm and fuzzy, it would be more useless than Kim Kardashian without Ray J. But because it serves to protect the speech that is most at fringe in our society, it guarantees the propagation of less extreme and more worthy speech that nonetheless isn't part of the mainstream. If you take away this protection you create the very real possibility that your own speech can be silenced if enough people oppose it. In [1996 only 27%](http://www.people-press.org/2012/02/07/growing-public-support-for-same-sex-marriage/) of Americans supported marriage equality, fast forward to [2014 and 59%](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/support-for-same-sex-marriage-hits-new-high-half-say-constitution-guarantees-right/2014/03/04/f737e87e-a3e5-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html) are in favor. Even if you don't consider those 27% from 1996 to be a fringe element, they were still the minority. Now please tell me, what guarantee can you provide that the majority on this issue in 1996 would not have silenced the minority if the First Amendment wasn't in their way???\n\nThe point is, through the [\"marketplace of ideas\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace_of_ideas) this country went from mostly being against equality in marriage to being majorly in support. That occurred because the minority was allowed to freely express their opinion. The WBC also has the right to express its opinion, and if people may so be persuaded, they may agree with their sentiments and join their cause. At the end of the day however, many people are turned off by WBC's message and end up supporting the positions the WBC oppose in a way they might not have otherwise. [It](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/03/20/westboro_baptist_church_founder_fred_phelps_is_dead_how_should_gays_eulogize.html) [is](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/mar/18/praying-for-former-westboro-baptist-fred-phelps-difficult) [arguable](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/20/fred-phelps-friend-of-the-gays.html) that the WBC helped advance civil rights for gays because by attacking soldiers they offended *conservatives* the most and caused some of them to re-examine their position on the equality question. In an oppresive society WBC wouldn't be allowed to make some of the best points of why they are wrong.\n\nFinally, I can only hope you will see the value of this most precious right and come to embrace this sentiment:\n\n[\"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\" \n— S.

{"body": "&gt;Can you imagine how alone he truly is, even in a world teeming with thousands of different creatures?\n\n&gt;Picture yourself walking down a sidewalk in a busy city. It's a beautiful summer morning, the kind where you wake up early and feel so alive you jump right out of bed, a smile already on your face before you step into the world. The sun is out high in the sky, a beacon of positivity, just perfectly nestled behind a few thick white clouds, giving you just a touch of heat while still staying shady and comfortable. You had just made your way down your stairs and through the front door, seamlessly transitioning into the lively hustle and bustle that seems appropriate only on these sorts of days. A spring in your step and a glimmer in your eye, you make your way down the road, nodding and smiling at everyone you pass. \n\n&gt;You haven't had lunch, and nothing sounds better than an old-fashioned, authentic street-corner hotdog from the vendor up ahead. You greet him cheerfully as you look down at the toppings you contemplate adding to your meal. You ask the old man for a plain dog with sauerkraut and mustard, and glance up at his face when you don't receive a response. You are instantly taken aback by the blank expression staring back at you. You smile at the man and ask, again, for a plain dog with sauerkraut and mustard. \n\n&gt;The man's face soon turns in to a scowl, and he mutters something that you don't really catch and motions for you to get out of the line. This sure isn't what you expected your quick lunch to result in on such a fine day, but you lightheartedly exclaim to the customer behind you that the vendor must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed this morning, and once again make your way down the street. \n\n&gt;Wondering if you can still make it to a local pizzeria for a slice, you ask a young woman at the street-corner for the time. She looks up at you, an absolutely beautiful face of sincerity, a portrait of youth and purity and grandiose dreams at its finest. Once again, you ask for the time, and make a pointing expression to your wrist. She smiles and answers, slowly and pleasantly, in a voice that sounds so desperately familiar, but you can't quite understand what she said. You ask her to repeat, but her eyes turn quizzical as she shakes her head and hurries across the street. \n\n&gt;What in the hell is going on? Has the city been overrun by foreigners, unable to communicate? Becoming more and more exasperated, you look around, searching for the plainest, average person in the vicinity, and quickly ask a balding, paunchy white man in a baseball cap and white sneakers what time it is. He looks at you like a loon, and turns away. \n\n&gt;Something isn't right. It's as if everyone can hear you, but nobody seems to care. Nothing you say gets across to who you say it to, and the variety of responses you receive usually end up with the stranger throwing their hands in the air and walking away as if you'd completely wasted their time.\n\n&gt;The rest of the afternoon you spend frantically greeting and prodding every person you see, shouting down the streets, but people now seem to give you looks of disgust, pity, contempt. You are lost in a world where you are supposed to know everything around you, with a voice that is the only one you've ever known, but nobody else seems to understand. \n\n&gt;Day by day the cycle repeats. Through sunny days and dark ones, rain, snow, freezing temperatures and &gt;spring flowers all blur in to one massive environment that you can't fully interact with, only observe. You have &gt;nobody to talk to, and nobody to listen. Something must be wrong with you. You must have been born to be &gt;the outcast, the excluded, the excommunicated. Life becomes a constant darkness as you peer out your &gt;window into the streets, watching husbands and wives kiss, watching children tell jokes and laugh, watching &gt;tourists shop and explore. But not you. A former shell of your old self, you fall in to a life of drifting through the &gt;days, through the streets, around the buildings, between the people you so desperately wish could hear you.\n\n...\n\nFrank had been running his hotdog stand for about a year.  He had been laid off from his engineering job a few years ago during the recession, but hadn't been able to land a steady job.  He had decided to retire, but the bills kept pilling up.  His kid had come back from college and his wife was too sick to work.  So he went and bought out a hotdog vendor, making just enough to tread above water.  It was a hot morning when Frank went to work that day.  He only had a few customers before 10.  That was when this fellow comes up hungry, looking like he hadn't had anything to eat that morning.  Frank asked him what he liked on his dog.  The fellow replied 'I need about tree fiddy'.  That's when Frank realized this fellow was about 500ft tall and from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "This reminds me of an experience I had with a mountain lion some years ago. I've had more than my fair share of staring death in the eye in my short life, but this one really stands out.\n\nSome background: When I was getting my Master's degree in geology, I worked in the Wichita Mountains in southwestern Oklahoma. Geologically (and Zoologically) it's a compelling place: the \"mountains\" there offer, at most, ~1000 ft of relief... yet they are still stunning to look at: granite crags protrude out of a table-flat prairie, seemingly out of nowhere. The scenery defies reason. \n\nBut there is an intricate story behind it all that makes sense if you are a geologist. Roughly 575 Myr ago, a layered, igneous complex formed deep in the crust below Oklahoma. Much of the complex was granite (a felsic rock) and gabbro (a mafic rock). Some 350 million years later, the region - along with much of the North American margin - was uplifted during the formation of Pangea. In the Wichitas, igneous rocks that were more susceptible to chemical weathering (especially gabbro) weathered away preferentially, leaving granitic domes behind. At that time, Oklahoma was near the paleo-equator (~10 degrees North), and was inhabited by a diverse, robust community of animals... including mammal like reptiles (Dimetrodon), giant amphibians (Eryops), and some of the earliest true reptiles (Captorhinus). Many of these creatures inhabited limestone caves at the base of the mountains.\n\nThen for various reasons the Wichita Mountains subsided, were buried under their own sediment, and the landscape itself was preserved - like a Permian time capsule. Relatively recently in the geologic past, the Wichita's started to become uncovered. So when you see the Wichita Mountains today, you are seeing them as they (roughly) looked 280 million years ago... minus the plants and animals from that time. Instead, there are herds of buffalo and other Great Plains fauna/flora that were spared from widespread culling in the 19th/20th centuries. The myriad circumstances that brought that landscape together are quite incredible to me... and it is this that attracted me to the Wichita Mountains in the first place.\n\nANYWAY, back to the mountain lion part. One day, I was perusing a quarry that had exposed some 300 million year old caves. It was oppressively hot outside, and I was alone (as I usually was) because I worked in a remote area of the wilderness. Other than the occasional buffalo encounter - the trick is to stand still, look them in the eye, and back up slowly - or rattlesnake, or prickly briar, nothing really concerned me. In other words, the possibility of mountain lions being around did not even cross my mind.\n\nDaylight gave way to dusk, and as I was turning over some [Captorinus fossils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captorhinidae) near a shallow pond, I could sense that something was watching me. You know the feeling: everything goes quiet, hair bristles on the back of your neck, and you can tell that a threat is looming... somewhere... just out of reach.\n\nIt was about then that I turned my head, and this giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era comes out of the water. I was so scared, Lord have mercy, my heart jumped out of my mouth, and I said, \"What on Earth is that creature!\" And it just stood above me, looking down with these big red eyes. Oh it was so scary! And I yelled, I said \"What do you want from me monster?!\" And the monster bent down and said \"I need about tree-fitty.\"\n\nThat's right. Three dollars and fifty cents. I said, \"I ain't given you no tree-fitty, you goddamn loch ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!\" So I gave him a dollar. I gave him a dollar. I thought he'd go away if I gave him a dollar. Well of course he's not gonna go away. You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you have more.\n\nFrom then on, I decided that it was a bad idea to work alone in the remote wilderness. I also decided to carry a concealed .357 magnum revolver and a shotgun from then on. I mean... gun laws are pretty relaxed in Oklahoma, so it was a breeze to do. Word to the wise: you never know what sort of dangerous animals you might run into in the Wichita Mountains. I would still suggest visiting them if you have the chance.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397160130", "subreddit": "EAF", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I was an only child growing up in rural kentucky, and after my parents divorced when I was only 6 I lived a fragmented, lonely life. Weeks at my dad's house were filled with lots of ranch work, because dad was really far behind on the mortgage and couldn't afford to hire on more help. I didn't too much like weekends at my mom's house because she was working two jobs, both as a server, so she could make ends meet.\n\nThere was a horse at my dad's ranch that we called 'Sage' because she had a beautiful gray coat that, in the correct light, could be percepted as a beautiful shade of her namesake. I said before that I lived a very lonely life, so when Dad unloaded Sage from the trailer that first time and she nuzzled at my hand I knew I had found my first friend.\n\nBetween feeding the animals and moving logs, I would always steal away to the stables or pen to spend a few minutes with Sage. We would play a game where she mimicked my actions; if I ran around the yard, she would follow and match my pace. A few quick head bobs, and she would return in kind. My favorite trick was to jump up in the air and watch as Sage reared her legs like a fierce stallion.\n\nMy childhood came to a shattering crash one October morning when I woke to the sound of a shotgun and dogs barking. I bolted upright in bed and yelled out for my dad, and when he didn't respond I tenuously crept from my bed and shuffled my way through the house, clutching my own self tightly.\n\nThats when the world around me flooded in and I heard a sound that made my stomach turn - the pained, agony filled cries of a mare and the verbose, damning curses of my dad. Disregarding shoes, the cold weather, and the possibility of imminent danger, I ran outside into the cresting sun.\n\nMy body was immediately wracked with dread. My father stood there in the stables. Doors flung wide. Buckets, rakes, and shovels were scattered. And blood. Blood everywhere. A coyote lay in the yard, riddled with buckshot.  That wasn't all. I knew it. I could sense it.\n\nAs I crept up to the stable doors, I caught a glimpse of Sage laying on the ground and I broke into a sprint for the last 12 feet. Dad turned, with a tear welling in his eye, and held up his hand, motioning for me to stay back. I ran past dad, dropped to my knees, and began sobbing harder than I've ever sobbed in my life. I lifted Sage's heavy head in my hands, and her limp neck poured blood from a fresh, warm gash torn by a hungry coyote. Between sobs, cursing the world for all its evils, and refusing to believe my only friend in the world could possibly die, I turned to my dad and begged him, implored him, demanded of him *How? How can this happen?*\n\nMy father took a knee beside me, slid a hand over my shoulder, and brought my head into his chest. He kissed the top of my head, squeezed me tight, and whispered, \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397233703", "subreddit": "self", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I would stuff the house to the rafters with all the things I knew she loved, antique tea cups, books, maps, and so much more.

I can say we just haven't found the Loch Ness Monster yet, but until I can produce that long-necked bastard, we have to assume it doesn't.\n\n&gt;I agree, it's not because of \"bewbs\", it's because they're given preferential treatment. If you ask me, what women usually get as sentences should be what EVERYONE gets as sentences. Again, I'll clarify in most cases. Sometimes women get off scot-free and that's just ridiculous.\n\nThe origin of that treatment is the belief that they're not really as culpable as men. It's like when a kid tries to \"wash\" your smartphone, and fries it. You don't get as mad as you would if your roommate did it, because the kid doesn't know any better. That's basically the attitude taken towards women. \"Oh, it's a woman. She couldn't control her crazy period-emotions.\"\n\n&gt;You're either really new at this, or you're taking this entirely too personal. I'm pointing out things that I have seen in my experiences with feminists, feminist blogs, and feminist authors, I am not assigning those things to what you think or say. It's refreshing to see you say that \"if you're both equally drunk no one was raped\", because repeated I see the point re-framed or re-stated to say \"If two people get drunk and one person rapes the other, then it's rape\", as if it's a clever way to dodge the issue. I have no doubt that men target drunk women as they have lowered resistance, just the same as women drink themselves to lower their inhibitions or \"loosen themselves up\". I'm sure the inverse is also true.\n\nWell, I AM going to argue that if two people are drunk and one rapes the other, then it's rape. If you say \"no\", then it's my obligation, no matter how drunk I am, to stop and pull out. Period. Full stop. And yeah, there are some people who don't understand male rape. They don't represent the majority of feminists, and I've never actually met a feminist who voiced the opinion that a woman raping a man was impossible.\n\n&gt;It's a cultural issue, but feminists (again, I'll say NOT SPECIFICALLY YOU) all over the web INSTANTLY assume guilt just because someone makes the accusation. Unfortunately we as a society just cannot assume that, regardless of ANY situation, as it's too easy to abuse. Rape is unique in that this \"guilty until proven innocent\" mindset has already crept into the legal system.\n\nHere's where *I* get to make the fine distinction. There's a difference between assuming guilt and believing the victim. Rape is an awful experience, and sometimes the victim just needs people to believe it happened to them. They could be lying, but the way I look at it is this:\n\n* **If they're telling the truth**, I helped a gravely traumatized person begin to heal, or at least prevented further damage. The rape victim is helped, or at least not hurt further. Everybody wins!\n\n* **If they're lying**, they tricked me, ohnoez. I make a note to avoid contact with that person in the future. They, on the other hand, are the scumbag who lied about rape. I remain neutral, liar loses.\n\nOn reddit, I've had people pull the \"I'm a male rape victim so your argument is invalid!\" card a few times. I've had them pull it when every instinct I had said \"This dude is so full of shit you could roll him on your lawn to help the grass grow.\" You know what I did? I believed the person immediately, offered my sympathy and scrounged up what online resources I could for them. I didn't concede my argument made before said claim, but I expressed sympathy and compassion. Because it costs me nothing to do so, and I'd like to think I'm a good person.\n\n&gt;Sadly, I'm not. I've even read a couple of articles lately on Time magazine, and Huffington Post where the authors had to remind readers that gasp men can have erections without being ready and willing to have sex. I've even seen blog posts from feminists who dismiss rapes where men are victims because \"it's just not possible\" and \"how could it be rape if he had an erection\".\n\nLike I said, not all feminists are awesome, just most. Some don't get basic facts, some don't even want to learn. That said, the idea that men can't get raped is nowhere near a majority opinion. And did you ever consider those authors were saying that to help some readers out? I mean, sometimes you just need to consider it. Hell, it took me a long time considering before I realized that a woman raping a man was possible, *and I have a goddamn penis*. More education and awareness of gender issues is almost never a bad thing, as long as the data backing the education and awareness is correct.\n\n(Also, brief disclaimer, when I say \"man/male\" and \"woman/female\" in this genital-rape discussion, I, of course, mean cis-gendered. If it upsets anyone I'll go back and edit it in, but I'm just too goddamn lazy to bother right now.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397266998", "subreddit": "MensRights", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt;You glossed over the fact that you have no evidence feminists pulled the alarm, yet we have documented evidence that the users of MensRights flooded that page.\n\nYes, unfortunately the folks who pulled the alarms and were caught on video were wearing masks, and when the cameraman tried to follow them they were blocked.  Still, we have video of the feminists (who were not wearing masks) applauding and cheering when the fire alarms sounded, visibly condoning the action.\n\n&gt;I apply intent because it's pervasive, persistent and while not usually openly stated here, is openly stated by your members around reddit. A large portion of the user base in this sub thinks women are inferior and/or inherently evil.\n\nThat's fine.  I can in turn point to numerous feminist sites/blogs that are clearing promoting man-hating, but I'm not going to sink to that level in order to have productive discourse.  There's hatred on both sides, I think we can both admit.\n\n&gt;If they're bunk then disprove them. If not, then they're the best stats we have, so accept them. Pretty simple, really. I can say we just haven't found the Loch Ness Monster yet, but until I can produce that long-necked bastard, we have to assume it doesn't.\n\nThe problem with anonymous reporting surveys with vague questions is already well documented.  It's been done.  \"It's the best we've got\" is similar to our Universe existing due to God creating it.  We've got no better explanation.

That's basically the attitude taken towards women. \"Oh, it's a woman. She couldn't control her crazy period-emotions.\"\n\nYou're preaching to the choir on this one.  What gets me is when feminists play along with it and use it to their advantage.\n\n&gt;Well, I AM going to argue that if two people are drunk and one rapes the other, then it's rape. If you say \"no\", then it's my obligation, no matter how drunk I am, to stop and pull out. Period. Full stop. And yeah, there are some people who don't understand male rape. They don't represent the majority of feminists, and I've never actually met a feminist who voiced the opinion that a woman raping a man was impossible.\n\nRight, that situation I don't have a problem with.  I have a problem with conflating \"two drunk people willingly have sex with each other\" and that situation, which is usually what happens when I present a feminist with that scenario.\n\n&gt;Here's where I get to make the fine distinction. There's a difference between assuming guilt and believing the victim. Rape is an awful experience, and sometimes the victim just needs people to believe it happened to them.\n\nThat's fine, but in a legal sense, we cannot do this.  We have to be skeptical from that standpoint.\n\n&gt;They could be lying, but the way I look at it is this:\nIf they're telling the truth, I helped a gravely traumatized person begin to heal, or at least prevented further damage. The rape victim is helped, or at least not hurt further. Everybody wins!\nIf they're lying, they tricked me, ohnoez. I make a note to avoid contact with that person in the future. They, on the other hand, are the scumbag who lied about rape. I remain neutral, liar loses.\n\nIf they're lying then depending on who you are and what position you have in our society and what reactions you have had, you have villified and tarnished the reputation of the person they falsely accused, and have caused mental, emotional, and sometimes physical harm to that person.  \n\nI would say that there is some middle ground between believing an unfounded accusation without question and calling that person an outright liar.  Unfortunately people like to deal in absolutes and this rarely happens.\n\n&gt;Like I said, not all feminists are awesome, just most. Some don't get basic facts, some don't even want to learn. That said, the idea that men can't get raped is nowhere near a majority opinion. And did you ever consider those authors were saying that to help some readers out?

More education and awareness of gender issues is almost never a bad thing, as long as the data backing the education and awareness is correct.\n\nThey definitely were saying that because they wanted to help their readers out.  Because they know that there's people out there who don't get that concept.  That's my point.  And the idea that man can't get raped is not a majority opinion, I'll agree to that.  But conversely, I would also argue that a girl wearing skimping clothing deserves to be raped is ALSO not a majority opinion, but we hear that dredged up all the time too.\n\nThey aren't majority opinions, but they're still out there and still somewhat prevelant, and unfortuantely amongst the more ugly and vocal of society.  :(\n\n&gt;(Also, brief disclaimer, when I say \"man/male\" and \"woman/female\" in this genital-rape discussion, I, of course, mean cis-gendered.

{"body": "First let me preface this story by saying that I am a girl that goes to a large public university. \nOne time, I saw a note in the bathroom stall of my college; the note simply said, \"There's a camera above... in the vent\" and then had a link to some porn site. I looked up, while taking my shit, and saw that vent; It looked a little strange with a bend in the center of the grate. It was entirely possible that a camera was in that vent, but it was difficult to discern whether there was a camera there: maybe it was just in my mind, but it looked like there was a round camera lens in the grate. \nI went through the rest of my day after that fateful shit normally, but the thought of the camera stuck in my head. When I got home, I looked up the link and found that it linked to some weird voyeur porn at which point I noped my way out of the site. \nThe next day I looked up the site again, but today I noticed there was a new video. I clicked on the video and it was, to my disgust, me shitting; thankfully enough the video wasn't that revealing, but there was a side-chatroom for reactions to the video. There was only like 3 viewers, and then one user wrote \"Guest 3444 I need assistance.\" At first, I was like what is this guy talking about and then I realized I was guest 3444. Again he repeated \"Guest 3444 I need assistance...I will find your dorm.\" After that, I logged out because I was so creeped out; I just figured that chatroom user was some troll and I was considering how to report this site.\nThen I got a knock on my dorm door. I opened the door and there was a man there; he said \"Guest 3444 I need assistance.\" I replied \"What?\" The he explained \"Guest 3444 I need about tree fiddy.\" At which time, I realized the chatroom troll was about 500 feet tall and a sea monster from the deep.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397274517", "subreddit": "funny", "score": -3, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "What stops them? With five sentient deities, numerous 'arch-spirits' (figures from mythology such as Bacchus, Diana, and Baba Yaga/The Morrigan/Hel (same figure, different names) who aren't gods but exist in their own right), and a tier of angels such as the valkyries, the leshii, the djinn, and the luck-fairies and so on, they're more interested in creating and managing life than destroying it. They largely leave humans to their own devices, and while there are demons and devils and evil spirits (for example the domovoi), again, they'd rather draw off living humanity than be destructive for the sake of it.\n\nHowever, humans manage perfectly well on their own - who needs gods?\n\nBasically, one of my cities, based on Warsaw but far bigger and more powerful than 19th century Warsaw --- it's only a provincial capital, but its metropolitan area sprawls out from one border to another, because of its excellent strategic location --- is annihilated in a war thanks to three factions - nationalists, communists and Imperialists - duking it out with no regard for civilians or for the integrity of the city's buildings. All three ideologies clash together and the people that get hurt are the folks these opinions claim to represent.\n\nLuckily, there's another power base for the communists a hundred miles away or so that pushes north, occupies a few other major cities without bloodshed or purges, and swoops back south to rescue Achava from the nationalists (proto-fascists, effectively) and another city from the imperialists (reactionary conservatives). No one faction is totally blameless, but at least the communists realise that they might have to soften their tone in order to win hearts and minds. Initially I had a 'they're all the same' conclusion to the saga, with the MC being unhappy and disillusioned with it all and then cynically grabbing power for himself, but then I thought, 'actually, I want there to be a hopeful message and that the good guys won and they can see reason in how they treat people'. I'm not a communist or even really a socialist, but I just want a happy ending, and there could plausibly be a democratic revolution within the communist ranks if the leadership realised that they couldn't just destroy the bourgeoisie, but had to work with them. My Stalin figure ends up a bleeding-heart liberal, though still with dictatorial instincts while in power.\n\nWarsaw, incidentally, suffered greater collateral damage than Hiroshima during the aftermath of the 1944 uprising. The Soviets stopped short of the city while the Germans destroyed the Polish nationalist Armia Krajowa (National/Home Army), razed the city (at least west of the Vistula; the Soviets occupied the eastern Praga districts, where I lived for a summer, which in turn influenced my books because I just imported the city layout into my story) and deported its inhabitants, so there are some real-world parallels between it and Achava. But I bet the Germans didn't have a roc unleashed from the zoo to clean up after...and a Nessie from a nearby lake. (That's just immediate riffing. I haven't really thought about that dimension much, but since I write fantasy, I try to think of a supernatural/magical element to most of my plotlines.

{"body": "Part 1\n\n**Scotland: yes or no?**\n\nBy Matthew Engel\n\n**Will they stay or will they go? Few south of the border have understood the mood that has gripped the Scots. From Glasgow to Coldstream, voters are approaching the independence question with a seriousness unknown among the self-mocking English** \n\nThe sign outside the new visitor centre reads simply “The Battle of Bannockburn” as though one had rolled up in time for the fight, instead of 700 years too late. The approach to the site goes through the dull suburbs of Stirling, via a northerly spur of Scotland’s patchy motorway system. In the distance is the monument to William Wallace (“Braveheart”), almost hidden by trees despite its height and bulk; and, more visibly, Stirling Castle, which was the combatants’ objective.\n\nBehind the building is a plain which may or may not have been the precise site of the contest. There is no conclusive archaeological evidence: “You pick up a piece of iron and it’s pointed,” explains the manager, Scott McMaster. “It looks like a sword. Then you put it under the X-rays and it’s revealed as a door hinge from the 1800s. We’ve never said this is the battlefield. It’s the traditional place where Robert the Bruce planted his standard.”\n\nInside was a party of eight- and nine-year-olds from Bankhead Primary School in Glasgow, being shown round installations using 3D technology that is the envy of rival battlefield venues. The centrepiece is a computerised simulation of the battle, which allows for up to 30 players.\n\n“You’re not here to recreate the original result,” the battlemaster explained to the kids. “You’re here to fight it and maybe to change it. We might have an English victory here today.”\n\nThe kids were divided up, with two-thirds being allocated to Edward II of England, which actually understates his numerical advantage, and a third to Robert the Bruce. There were immediate groans from those forced to be English, even for half an hour. This is normal.\n\nAnd so battle commenced. It was somewhat confusing, which is an accurate reflection of the fog of war but also perhaps a glitch that could be improved – the centre opened only six weeks ago. The English, I felt, were overconfident; the Scots indecisive. But there was no clear advantage until the lights flashed, and the battlemaster announced that Edward had been slain (which did not happen in 1314) and the Scots had won (which did). Then the “English” kids groaned again, and some of the more bellicose boys punched the wall in frustration. This, too, is normal. “The players just get into it whichever side they’re on,” said one official.\n\nAmong the items in the gift shop were various knick-knacks that included a quotation from the Declaration of Arbroath. This was a letter sent by the Scottish nobles to the Pope six years after Scotland’s victory at Bannockburn, asking him to recognise Scottish independence. The famous quote (famous in Scotland, anyway) reads: “… for as long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule. It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom – for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.”\n\nSo help me, I consider myself a reasonably well-educated Englishman. But I never knew this beautiful passage. I would feel utterly ashamed, except that I suspect I have that in common with at least 99.9 per cent of the English population. Which helps explain what is happening: that on 18 September, three months after the 700th anniversary of Bannockburn, the Scots may finally turn the Declaration of Arbroath into reality.\n\nEven more certain is that few who have remained south of the border have yet understood the mood that has gripped the Scots. The voters have not yet decided the answer to the question they must answer: “Should Scotland be an independent country?” But they are approaching it with a deep seriousness of a kind unknown among the self-mocking English.\n\nLarge numbers are telling the pollsters “Don’t Know”, as they did to the Better Together canvassers I went out with in Edinburgh South. But this was not the don’t know of a normal election, which can mean either “I hate your lot” or “Don’t care” or “I’m watching EastEnders”. You could see the voters’ brows furrowing as they contemplated the terrifying choice ahead. There is no easy option. The choice is binary, consequential and perhaps final.\n\nAmong the city’s chattering classes, there is – with more than five months to go – almost no other subject worth discussing, not even property prices. The excitement is palpable, and it is all being generated by the Yes campaign, which has more purpose, passion, unity, money and a simpler, more beguiling message. Better Together, the opposition grouping dominated by the three main London parties, has been fractured and confused.\n\nThe Westminster government’s strategy – backed up by Scottish-based companies threatening to leave – has been bluster and threat, typified by the recent shemozzle about whether Scotland would be able to keep the pound. The tone of voice was that of a parent confronting a rebellious teenager. “I’m a No voter,” one young woman told me, “and I’m affronted. Their whole approach smacks of arrogance.” (Bizarrely, the prime minister chose to make a major speech, aimed at persuading Scotland to stay, from the Olympic velodrome in London, emphasising both his own distance from this part of the realm and that London gets the best of everything.) Every time David Cameron pipes up, the Yes vote seems to tick up a point in the polls; in the case of his Chancellor, George Osborne, two.\n\nSir John Major, asked to make a speech in Scotland, rang the Scottish eminence and former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Steel for advice. Steel said he should come, but only if he could convey the message that the UK loves and needs Scotland, and forget the bullying. A new set of initials has started appearing in Scottish newspapers: rUK – the rest of the UK, that lot down there.\n\nTo anyone with a long memory, this is barely credible. Fifty years ago Scottish Nationalism as a political force was not much more serious than the activities of Screaming Lord Sutch. As the journalist Neal Ascherson recalled: “If you said, ‘Oh, he’s a Nat,’ it implied he was some sort of crazy eccentric. But somewhere deep in the brain of every Scotsman there was always a single cell saying ‘Wouldn’t it be great?’ It was overlaid with ‘Don’t be so ridiculous’. But it was always there.”\n\nThe concept of Scotland as a nation never faded, even when it was at its furthest from being a nation state. As Robert Crawford puts it in Bannockburns, his new literary history of Scottish independence: “Bannockburn lasted. More than anything else, the rewriting of it, and poetic reworkings of Bruce and Wallace, kept ideals of Scottish political freedom alive.” To this day, no small country on the planet evokes such obvious and distinctive associations (whisky, bagpipes, kilts, haggis, golf, Nessie, tweed, kippers, Scotch mist, the thistle ... ). And Scotland’s self-image was always there, through the fraught centuries of strife that tapered off first when the crowns were united in 1603 and then when the Scottish parliament allowed itself to be abolished in 1707.\n\n“The Scottish view of the Act of Union was that it was a consensual partnership, and contractual,” says Ascherson. “Whereas the English view was that it was an Act – a decision for all time.”\n\nFor most of the 307 years since, Scottish political sensibilities were muted because there was too much going on. There was the Industrial Revolution and an empire to build, then two world wars – in all of which Scotland played a very full part. There were faint stirrings of nationalism from early on in the 20th century: Home Rule was a vague aspiration for both the Liberal and Labour parties, but the Irish experience meant there was no appetite for opening cans of worms that might turn into snakepits.\n\nIt seems no coincidence that nationalism finally gained political traction in the decade when Britain ceased to feel itself under an overwhelming external threat. The Cuban missile crisis of 1962 was the last occasion when the cold war looked like turning hot; the first significant nationalist by-election win came four years later – in Wales, oddly enough – followed by Winnie Ewing’s triumph in Hamilton a year after that.\n\nThe Scottish Nationalist path thereafter zigzagged violently, but three factors ensured that it ultimately led upwards: the massive pain caused in Scotland by deindustrialisation; the perceived failure of Labour in government, both in Westminster and Edinburgh; and, above all, the long years of That Woman, who probably did more than anyone in history to unite Scotland. In 1979, a few weeks before Margaret Thatcher became prime minister, the first referendum on devolution, offering a feeble Assembly, produced 51.6 per cent in favour, from a turnout of 64 per cent. It failed because of a Westminster stipulation that it required 40 per cent backing from the entire electorate. Eighteen years of Tory rule later, the vote was three to one.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397331595", "subreddit": "Scotland", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Well it was okay I guess, I got a nice sunburn and my girlfriend was happy,\nSo that led to nightly sexy times. Well, she had the idea on our very last night there \nTo go for a walk along the beach. Mind you, it was around 2am. She told me \"bring a condom\" and I had never had (sex on the beaches) before, so I was excited. We walked out of our hotel and along the beach for about 20 minutes looking for a good spot to get it on, and then we heard the barking. The kind of barking that signified trouble. This dog sounded in extreme distress! So we go running in the direction of the sound only to come up to a dog being buried in the sand by some really really tall dude in a black jacket. I absolutely love animals so I went up to the guy with my fist cocked back and grabbed him by the shoulder. He swung around, and what I saw was horrifying...

I don't like the look of the board, it looks like a skateboard and I don't like the [look of the bacon](http://absboards.com/files/2012/03/Rippleridge_side_lores1.jpg). I also don't like that the board is rather heavy and the board is a little bit small; I have to put my front foot on the nose a little, which I really don't like. I also don't like that I can't have larger wheels around 70mm without wheelbite.\n\n So I want a symmetrical/double kick/single kick board that is rather light, can handle all my disciplines, is in the 35 to 38\" range (give or take an inch), has enough wheel clearance for around 70mm wheels, and looks f*cking sick. \n\nSo far I think the Loaded Tesseract or the Madrid Nessie are pretty great. \n\n\nMy pros for the Tesseract: It is apparently pretty light (Do you know where I can find out its weight? Should I email websites that have it in stock?), it has 2 kicks, it has quite a bit of wheel clearance. My cons for the Tesseract: It is long at 39\" so I would certainly have to try it out at a store.\n\n My pros for the Nessie: Also apparently pretty light, has loads of wheel clearance, a flat kick, nice concave, and a blunt nose. My cons for the Nessie: It only has 1 kick, and as /u/xXTowelieXx mentioned, it isn't very durable.\n\n\nOther than those decks I have looked at the Nelson BatRay 4.8: It is pretty sick, but it does not have enough wheel clearance, the Top Speed 34: It does not have kicks, which is a shame, the Jati Tanto: I don't like the nose, the Jati Karate Chop: It is cooler than the Tanto, but also has a weird stubby-ish kick, although the back kick is pretty great, and the Never Summer Admiral: It has like no reviews and I don't like the graphic, the Rayne Darkside: Not a fan of the way bacon looks, although it is pretty minor.

We decide 20 minutes later we want to check it out so we follow the music and find the place in about 10 minutes. When we get there we are greeted by a red head girl with 100 piercings offering us a \"drink\". As i look around there are people with these drinks laid out on sheets to my right and a few people dancing to my left. All around the area are guys mounted on rocks covered in glow sticks dancing their faces off. Me and my friends look at each other as she offers the drink once more and i asked if it was free.

{"body": "I'm no anthropologist but iv'e done my fair share of research on the species. I don't understand why you are so taken aback by the out-competed hypothesis?\n\nIt is clear our species interbred through genetic testing, but that likely wasn't the downfall of their species. Neanderthals, according to the evidence, lived in much smaller, more separated groups compared to homo sapiens. They also hunted largely with short spears, used up close to jab into their prey.\n\nThere's a few reasons why this isn't productive to evolutionary survival. First, humans worked closely and we can see that through shared cultural influences such as artwork or other things, and possibly even traded knowledge on hunting/tracking. Secondly, our hunting technology of the day was pretty incredible; humans had out competed  \nevery major predator wherever they have ever migrated too, and for good reason. \nLastly, they likely weren't as stronger than us as you think; compared to a suburbanite? obviously. But compared to a human male back in the paleolithic era who was scraping animals hides, hunting, i doubt they were really that much stronger.\n\nI think they died out due to a number of factors combined; interbreeding, being out competed for resources, and possibly even some minor warfare. Ultimately i think the fact that they lived in such small groups was their greatest downfall.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397427151", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

We all got off the train and gave chase, but he was just too damn fast for us--before we knew it, business guy, moderately hygienic homeless man, obvious gangbanger, and I were all falling behind. Then, a cacophony of clattering swept up behind us: the white skater kids! They bore down upon the unsuspecting gangly haymaker philanthro-fist like a pack of wolves. He juked left, juked right, but they were too quick, corralling him into a nearby alley.    \n\nOnce more, they formed phalanx and blocked his escape as the rest of us caught up. With tears in his eyes, he explained that he was on the run from the government, and that he was convinced a sleeper agent was out to get him. His only possible option was a preemptive defense, punching everyone around him, *just in case*.    \n\nMoved to tears, business guy pressed a button on a bluetooth headset no one had noticed he was wearing until then, and within seconds a chauffeured limo arrived. The skater kids departed, soaring into the sunset in a flying V formation, the lush hues of red and gold eclipsing their silhouettes dwarfed by the brilliance in their hearts. We all clambered into the limo, where we swapped stories of our adventures.    \n\nIt turns out, haymaker guy was a pretty chill dude. We asked where he lived, but it was way out of the way, so we agreed to drop him off a few stations down. Unfortunately, his one-way train pass had already expired.

{"body": "I am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing.\n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397442405", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

When does anything on reddit ever HAVE to be answered?\n\nI'll assume you were being facetious when you said you would be gentle, as you apparently consider me one of the \"bad guys.\" On that note, I find it interesting that you see the world that way, that anyone who questions you is automatically not on your side, and that you are so hostile toward someone about whose intentions you know almost nothing.\n\nI actually never once said anything about what my standards were for convincing evidence, so you might want to check those assumptions underlying your aggression. You should consider that everyone carries around certain standards for evidence on any matter, subconsciously or consciously, whatever their beliefs may be. My skepticism was no more imposed on me than your belief was imposed on you. Something has convinced you, and nothing has yet convinced me. It is as simple as that.\n\nI also think you should try to put yourself in my shoes (only for a second, I promise) and follow your reasoning: I have not yet been convinced that aliens have deliberately visited us, and yet you expect me to devote my time and effort on \"uncovering evidence or producing insight to help \"the cause.\" That is similar to telling someone who does not believe in the Loch Ness monster for lack of having seen one to devote themselves to finding it.

Indeed, it is at the root of all of modern science, and thus engineering and technology and that which makes this conversation even possible.

{"body": "It was a cold and dreary night. The moon shone only for a few moments with each passing clearance of clouds, which was very rare. The sound of rain smashed, not only on the tops of trees and against the ground, but on the heads of five huntsmen, who were setting up camp for the night. The rain got everywhere on them. In their cloaks, their boots, under their clothes, even some would seep into the tents. It was, or so the accounts go, around 9 p.m. in June. This is the account of John Semik, a man who prevailed from the East.\n\n\"It's bloody cold tonight, boys!\" said the leader of the expedition, warming his hands up by rubbing them together. They were traveling in the unknown, so, of course, everyone packed what they'd expect to feel around here. Fur coats, long shirts, and short shirts. Fur boots were a must in this territory, the accounts of earlier hunters said it would get extremely cold in some regions for no reason. However, this night, unlike most in this land, was extremely cold for the summer that they were experiencing.\n\nThe leader of this expedition, Luther, took out an oil lantern, and set it in the clearing of forest they decided to make camp in. It immediately expelled all darkness from the clearing, allowing everyone to see each other in vague detail. John, our accountant, set down his pack and began to set up his tent, as well as everyone else. As the hour passed, they had all had their tents pitched, and their tarps up (which it was slightly too late for) as the rain began to clear. They switched the lantern for a campfire within a few minutes, using some of the oil to help get the fire going.\n\nSoon, the atmosphere for hanging around a campfire was set. The rain had mostly cleared, and the fire was burning hot. As they all sat around the campfire, they discussed recent bearings. Wives, whores, bar fights, whatever came to pass. Then, a particular subject which is commonly discussed among those who sit around campfires, came around.\n\nSupernatural occurances. Scary sorts. John, being a fairly quiet guy, had none to tell. But the four others, they had plenty. They told them all, hauntings around ships, seeing a ghost in the hallway after dark, hearing something go bump in the night. Then, Ralph of the North, muttered something.\n\n\"Ever heard of the night critter?\" he asked.\n\n\"Night critters? Ha! There are a lot of those in the area.\" said Luther.\n\n\"No...\", Ralph said, eyes getting wider. \"The night critter.\"\n\nEveryone around the fire had heard nothing about the night critter. Even Ivan, the \"master of rumors\" had heard nothing about it.\n\n\"Go ahead. Spit it out.\" said Ivan, ready to hear another rumored beast.\n\n\"The night critter,\" Ralph started, \"is not a critter in itself. It is a being that does not speak, does not move unless you face away from it, and can and will morph into whatever it can to take you as far as it can away from your group.\"\n\n\"Oh, so it's some sort of rapist monster?\" said Luther.\n\n\"No. It only takes you from your group, then it, along with you, disappear into an apparent dream world, where it will constantly terrify you until you perish from the fear.\"\n\nThe camp was silent.\n\n\"Often stalking into parties of huntsmen or drunken people who roam the forests, it will undoubtedly sneak in as one of them. As soon as they go to sleep, or begin to drift off, or even if it gets discovered, you hear it transform. Some say that it sounds as if someone is ripping through their own ribcage, and then a deafening scream is heard, then, it gets eerily silent. The entire forest will not make noise. There, it will slowly take the people out.\"\n\n\"All at once?\" said Ivan, now clutching his flintlock. The entire camp began to slowly pick up their own weapons, now getting more and more terrified.\n\n\"No. If you are asleep when it strikes, it will take all of you. But, if it succeeds in getting at least one of them and is caught, it will fade away with the person, then after some months or even years, catch the rest of them off guard, even in their own homes.\"\n\"Where the fuck does this thing live?!\" said Thomas, the youngest of the group.\n\n\"We don't know. The indigenous people of this area told me the story as I was learning how to hunt with them one day. So, it lives in this very area.\" \"How can you stop it?\" asked Isaac, the last one to join their expedition. \"You can't. Not even light scares the monster off. It can, and will get you in any way. My suggestion is, if something seems off in the forest around you, it's already too late. Accept your fate, or pray to God that it doesn't decide to go for you.\" \"What does its actual true form look like?\" Luther said, almost whispering. The fire was almost out.\n\n\"Like this.\" said Ralph. Everyone was surprised as Ralph put out the fire, and the darkness around them was only broken by a pair of gleaming white eyes with tiny pupils, and a full row of 92 teeth, all razor sharp, always smiling. Ivan tried firing, but the blast only gave light to how incredibly slender and hunched down it was. As it extended into it's full length, John accounts that it was at least 6 or 7 feet tall, and it's body was extremely slender. It's hands appeared to have razor sharp claws on each hand, and it's feet ferocious and had sharp claws as well.\n\nJohn said that he heard Ivan scream, then it was eclipsed by the voice of the Night Critter.\n\n\"I lied about the part of it not being able to speak.\" \"Ralph\" spoke. They heard it race off into the night, along with Ivan, as they heard his scream slowly dwindle. Luther scrambled for his lantern, and got it lit. He shoved oil into it, and hit it on full burning capacity.\nThe clearing was empty. Ivan was gone. The forest was still silent as was before the story began.\n\n\"As long as we have our eyes peeled, it cannot get to us if we look at it. It doesn't move if we look at it.\" said Luther, still terrified. John saw that almost everyone was damn well in tears and still clutching their guns.\n\nSoon, the forest began to have sound again.\n\nThe Night Critter was gone.\n\n\"The forest is alive again. We're safe.\" exhaled Thomas, who was stifling a cry. \n\n\"For now.\" said Isaac. \"Remember what Ralph; it, said. It will come back for us.\"\n\n**and he was right.**\n\nThat remaining night, nothing happened. They decided to leave the next morning, which they all promptly did, without packing up their items. As they returned to town, they gave a full account of their experience, as well as why Ralph and Ivan were gone.\nThey were all hunted down.\n\nIsaac was the first to go. He was in his house, retired from his duty of expediting after what happened, when his wife said he heard a bump from down the hall. As he lit his candle and checked it out, the Night Critter was sitting at the edge of the darkness, it's eyes wide and it's teeth showing. He let out a scream of fear and dropped his candle. \n\nThomas, was next. He was boating when he heard a little girl cry out for help. As he went to investigate, he docked his boat and found the noise. The Night Critter manifested the voice of a little girl, and promptly took him as well.\n\nLuther, who was now crazy and trusted no one, killed himself. He heard about Thomas, and took a bullet to the head after reportedly seeing eyes approaching his bedroom.\nHis body was never found.\n\nAnd, that leaves our accountant, John, whom we kept tabs on. He told the story, and how he escaped it multiple times, only for it to get him when he did not expect it. He was running away from it out of our Headquarters, where he promptly told us his account, what it looked like, and how everyone met their fates. He left us after he was done. He didn't want us to be a victim. As his last running trip ended, he found himself alone in the exact forest where Ralph said the story. He approached the clearing. The beast grew to its limit, 7 foot tall.\n\n It then looked down at John, and said loudly, it's voice rising above the dead of the night.\n\n\"I'mma need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nOur scout then realized it was actually 500 foot tall and from the paleolithic era.\nNeedless to say, John paid his price. He shilled out the money, and it left him. His friends were found in the field next to the clearing. It turned out that, none of them were able to pay the price, so they were stuck in his trap. John was now a hero to them, saving them from their imminent doom from this beast.\n\nThanks OP!

{"body": "You'll be up on that wall one of these days, Ted! \n\n10 random things: \n\n - It's weird rewatching early episodes where Ted's kids actually react to stuff, after years of stock footage of them staring blankly at the screen. Also, knowing what we know now, is it weird the kids have no interest in this story? Or are they just afraid Dad might go into more detail about various girls he drilled in his 20s? \n\n - Love Solutions' Ellen Pierce is played by Camryn Manheim, best known for eight seasons on *The Practice* and four seasons on *The Ghost Whisperer*. Her *HIMYM* appearance occurs between those two roles, but she does not appear in the second Love Solutions episode at the end of season one. She currently has a recurring part on *Person of Interest*.\n\n - This episode features the first appearance of the cockamouse, a (supposed) mutant hybrid, as if a cockroach and mouse did (as Barney puts it) \"the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha.\"  It would reappear twice more, in \"The Perfect Cocktail\" (6.22) and the series finale (9.23). \n\n - How retro is the Love Solutions office? Everything from the logo to wood paneling screams 70s/80s, which of course is exactly what you'd expect out of a cutting-edge computer matchmaking service. Also, is that a wedding photo of co-creator Craig Thomas and his wife on the wall?  \n\n - Ellen Pierce throws some serious BS math at Ted during her sales pitch. She initially whittles Ted's dating pool down to about a half million women within five years of Ted's age, halves that for people already in relationships, then again for intelligence, humor and \"compatibility\" (whatever that means). Even if that left you with only 30,000 eligible women between 22-33, Pierce claims almost *all* of them are lesbians. Can't forget those lesbians, Ted! \n\n - The gang reveals they sometimes use Ted's name as a verb – to \"Ted up\" or \"Ted out\" -- i.e. overthinking a situation. This compliments the move the group would come to call \"the Mosby\" -- to scare someone off by claiming you're in love with them. \n\n - Both Ted and his match claim Seals &amp; Croft's \"Summer Breeze\" as their \"guilty pleasure.\" Wait, I'm supposed to feel guilty about that? \n\n - Originally, when Ted sneaks back into Ellen Pierce's office and prints out Sarah O'Brien's profile, \"Parallel or Together\" by Ted Leo and the Pharmacists plays over the scene. On the DVD release, it's replaced by a xylophone-heavy piece that might as well be named \"Wacky '80s Hacking Music.\" \n\n - This episode introduces Marshall's belief in the supernatural and beyond, which includes the Loch Ness Monster, Sasquatch, ghosts and aliens. Lily also claims to be a \"believer,\" but later in the series says she doesn't share Marshall's faith in things unseen (mostly due to daddy issues. Don't tell Barney!). \n\n - Ted once again shows he can be kind of a jerk in his search for a soulmate, and as usual, Lily acts as the voice of reason. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.\" Bad karma, bro. \n\nFive quotes: \n\n - \"These chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.\" (Barney)\n\n - \"I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.\" (Ted)\n\n - \"Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day.\" (Ellen Pierce)\n\n - \"There was a computer, and there were eight fish in a sea full of lesbians!\" (Ted)\n\n - If a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then dammit, so can I!\" (Ted)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397513385", "subreddit": "HIMYM", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms. She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet. His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name. Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.\nJoe didn't give a shit. He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either. Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom. His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\". His name was now legally Adam Adams. Why? All so he could be first in the lunch line.\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe, my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it. He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember. But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage. The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me. Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son. This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on. She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does. My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story. She does. Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words). While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out.\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved. After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad. I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story. When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her. She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy\"\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again. But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one.\ntl;dr: Friend's mom is an overprotective bitch, I get mad at her for being an overprotective bitch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397535849", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

I never said that, and you simply stating over and over that I did does not make it true. I have asked you to directly quote me from when I have said that, and in your typical fashion, you ignore the request and insist further distorting my words. \n\nAnd your example of using apples and oranges does not parallel my argument, since apples and oranges are categorically different, while mine is only that of degree. \n\nWinning $999,999.99 is *practically* indistinguishable from winning a million dollars in terns of any decision you will make with the funds and likely how you will communicate your winnings.

{"body": "When I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students. I heard most of the drama but there is one student that I will always be reminded of when people ask this question.\n\nThere was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip. She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't. Everyone could hear her, including me. Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about. She gossiped most days but one day was different.\n\nI heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom. I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not? It could be fun.\n\nAnyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with.\n\nMr. Bodom.\n\nI was shocked when I heard this.\n\nBut stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young. She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess. If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress.\n\nAfter class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work. It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head.\n\nAs soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, \"Hey Kathy. I heard you talking about me in class...\" she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, \"Oh my god! You heard me say that? I'm so sorry! And-\" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, \"I want to have sex with you too.\"\n\nShe stopped her sentence and smiled. Then she said, \"Do you know what my rates are?\"\n\nConfused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in. It turns out she mentioned that she would have sex with me... if I paid that is.\n\nI decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her. \"Alright,\" I told her. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll do it, but I need some money of course. That's just how it works.\" she said. I replied, \"Okay, what do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had tricked me again! \"GODDAMNIT MONSTAH, I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" I said to her as she swam away.\n\nClass was really weird after that with Kathy gone. I never told any of the students about our encounter but I sure as hell would never mention it to anyway. Ever. Of course I'm telling Reddit, but isn't that what the internet is for? To tell strangers your deepest, darkest secrets?\n\nThe year ended without being... too weird.\n\nTL;DR: Overheard a student talking about having sex with me... things got... weird and it ended in an unexpected way...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397586956", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 39, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Is there a possibility of interdimensional travel beyond our comprehension?  Sure.  Ever heard of the multiverse hypotheses?  There are lots of extraordinary possibilities.  A classic example of this is Russell's Teapot.  I mean, unicorns, the Loch Ness Monster, dragons, leprechauns, tooth fairies, etc. could all be hypothetically true.  On what basis do you think those are not true, if you think that way?  Without any evidence to give reason to believe something is even provisionally true, it's not unreasonable to not give that belief any special credence.\n\nAs for the similar experiences on DMT, that could be the result of many different things.  It's a drug that affects a certain section or sections of the brain.  It's not farfetched to believe that since it affects the same areas, that similar experiences are to be expected.  There's also the social conditioning part.  People hear and believe that certain things are supposed to or usually happen on DMT, so because of that mindset, it could somewhat of self fulfilling prophecy, so to speak.  While I'm not calling it a placebo effect, it is similar in a way.  Give someone an inert plant that resembles marijuana, have them smoke it, and they may start to act \"high,\" according to what they perceive as acting high.  This would probably be especially effective on young people with little or no prior experience.\n\nIt's not a stretch at all, nor does it really hint toward a collective subconscious.

{"body": "So I work at a massage parlor in the Florida. Lots of old men and college guys come during spring break/summer. There was this one occasion where an elderly gentleman came into the parlor...with his 16 year old grandson. The grandfather was extremely chill. Nice leather jacket, slicked back hair. He looked like the Fonz at age 85. Surprisingly though, he was pretty hot. \n\nSo my coworker pulls me aside and says something alone the lines of \"I call the old guy\". I'm pretty surprised. She's pretty, like, very pretty. And I'm not just saying that because I'm a girl haha. She's got it going on. Pretty big tits, nice ass, tight body, gorgeous face. She's also a huge slut. But that's okay, I accept her for the whore she is. Anyhow, I know she has a thing for older guys...but not...grandfathers. And that's definitely what she had in mind, the kinky little skank. It was NOT hard to tell. \n\nSo she brings old-man-Fonz to a room and closes the door. I'm now left with the grandkid. He's 16, I'm 22. But fuck me if he wasn't gorgeous. I'm serious. I felt like a cougar, although I don't know if 22 is old enough to be a cougar. I thought to myself \"I could easily fuck this guy, he's 16 for christ sake, that's the pinnacle of horny teenager years\". I'm debating with myself whether or not I should do it. But I've got to talk to him in the mean time, obviously, so I introduce myself and say \"hi, I'm moalfred, what's your name?\" as I lead him into a room. \n\nHe tells me his name is Billy Schmitt. My immediate thought is \"He's jewish. He probably has a nice penis\". I'm not very experienced at this age, and I'd never seen any porn. My friends told me jews have the best dicks right after black people. I PROMISE I'm not racist. I just had no idea what to believe. \n\nYou can imagine I'm more intrigued now. So we're in the room, and I tell him to take off all his clothes and lay down face first on the table, putting the towel over his butt. He laughs nervously, and starts undressing while I'm in the room. I forgot to tell him to start undressing after I left the room to give him privacy. \n\nWell, too late. He's naked. Massive penis. Holy shit. He's in fantastic shape, he's gorgeous, and I *need* to have sex with him. I feel like the biggest pervert alive. But I need to do this. \n\nI'm not arrogant, but I've been told I've been \"rated\" a 9/10. This is not coming from me, it comes from other guys. I know this sounds cocky, sorry, just want to paint the picture for you guys, haha. I'm a D  cup, 5'9, brunette, I do yoga and have a splendid ass, I will be cocky about that. I'm 110 lbs, green eyes. \n\n\nSo he's now on the table without the towel over his ass. I pretend to ignore it and get the bottle of oil. \n\nI open it, slather my hands in it, and start covering his back in the stuff. I'm not really giving a shit about technique, just thinking about how to pull this off. I'd never watched porn before, so I hadn't seen the masseuse videos that are perfect guides for situations like these. \n\nI try not to make it too obvious, buy I bend over towards him a lot, standing in front of his head with my pussy inches from his face, slathering oil on his back. I then bend over forward to get a different bottle of oil, which is unnecessary, but I want him to see my hypnotizing ass. \n\nI ask him if it's ok if I take off my shirt, I have a bra on underneath, but it's just very hot out today (I wasn't lying, it is hot out, so it was a good excuse). He nervously says \"hehahahaheheaha....*cough cough* um, yeah, sure haha\"\n\nIt was cute as fuck how bad he stuttered. \n\nSo now I'm in my bra, behind him, slathering the oil farther down his back, towards his ass. I start slathering his firm butt, oh. my. god. It's perfect. He fakes a cough, signalling that he's unsure of the situation. I  say \"oh, don't worry, this is a normal thing hehe, but you've got a killer but hehe\" acting girly as hell. His shlong is quite visible, and starting to tense up. \n\nI slather oil down his legs a bit, onto his feet. He's rock hard now. I go back up his legs and slather oil on his dick. He squirms really fast, then stops. He's not stupid. He gets up, his 8.5ish inch cock looking angrily at me. He says \"what's going on? there's no way that's normal\" \n\nI tell him it's a certain technique some people like, but I won't do it for him if he doesn't want. Now he's looking at my bra, and I smile at him and start walking towards him. I grab his hand, and place it on my chest. I then undo my bra and let him see my tits. My hands are still oily, so I slather my tits in oil. \n\nThen I walk up to him, his dick pressing against my thigh, almost directly in my pussy (covered by my yoga pants of course) and I feel like a woman. \n\nI start jerking him off, and then I kiss him. He grabs my tits, and goes full domination on me. He picks me up as if I weigh nothing, throws me on the top, and starting making out with me, his dick directly forcing it's away against my pussy. Holy shit it felt good. \n\n\nNow he pulls down my yoga pants and starts fingering me. I've never had sex. This is crazy. I stop him, and start sucking his dick. He knows his shit. This kid is experienced. \n\nHe stops *me* and picks me up again, I'm totally naked, so is he. He cock is angry looking, and then he spreads my legs and puts me on the table, he aims his cock with his hands and slaps it against my pussy a few times. He then starts to slide it in. I feel like I'm in heaven. It's euphoric. I feel like my pussy is getting hit by a train. His angry penis is displaying what it means to be a man. Holy shit. He puts his hand on my face and kisses me passionately.\n\nWe get dressed again, and I ask him to pay me. \n\n\nHe said sure, but first I'm going to get something from the vending machine, can you spot me? \n\nI said \"yeah.. of course, how much do you need?\"\n\nHe said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\"\n\n\nIt was around that time that I noticed the young man who had fucked me was about 500 ft tall, and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit monstah! I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam away. \n\nTL;DR: Go look at porn you horny fucker.

My neighbor spared no expense and it was a really great time. Yet, for some reason, he spent most of his time alone and away from the main party itself.\n\nLater, I learned from an acquaintance that my neighbor spent a great deal of time pining over a long lost love and starring out at a mysterious light from the edge of his dock. Curious, I headed down to the dock to see this light for myself. As I stared deeper and deeper into the light, I realized that it was no light, but a sort of strange and colorful Vaudeville show starring little horses. I was intrigued and continued to watch it for the rest of the evening. At some point I had fallen asleep and my neighbor awoke me early the next morning.

{"body": "In truth, you'll die from eating *any* diet, obviously. But proponents of the paleo diet overlook legitimate health concerns about it backed by actual science. It's not a good diet for long-term health. It'll sustain you, sure, but it won't help you live longer; and it might well help you live *shorter*.\n\nThe diet is high in animal products that are known to increase risk of cardiovascular disease, for example. And commendable as seafood is in any diet, seafood of today is not the same as what was around ten thousand years ago, before industrial processes polluted the oceans. No one in the paleolithic era needed to worry about mercury poisoning. We're not even sure this is what our ancestors ate; we can really only say what we're sure they *didn't* eat. (Twinkies, for example.)\n\nEven if it's correct, that doesn't make it healthier than a scientifically based diet. Our ancestors only had to live long enough to raise teens. More, their diet would have prepared them for things we don't have to deal with, such as long periods without food, a ridiculous amount of physical exertion every single day, for life, having to chase down food, and having to evade predators; that's why we have an inborn craving for fats, which now threatens our health.\n\nIf you want to live a long life, any diet based on evolution is not going to protect you from things that take you after your childrearing years. That's why evolution hasn't weeded out CV disease, cancer, and other age-related diseases. A healthy diet for anyone who wants to live a healthy life past 35 should be *science*-based, not based on romantic woo-woo.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397624121", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm not normally the adventerous type, but my friends convinced me to join them on a cave-exploring trip. And that's when I met the tour guide. We had instant chemistry. We had similar interests, a similar outlook on life, and she was low-maintenance. I fell in love at first sight, took my chance to take her on a date, and swore after that first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance. \n\nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. I won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. Besides the fact that I was studying for a medical-related track (kinesiology) and therefore had to take classes in that type of thing, I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable. \n\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime. \n\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives. \n\nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. \n\nI climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\" \n\nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\" \n\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed. \n\nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that.

{"body": "I have an incredibly disturbing story to tell about a girl who posted to /r/gonewild that I recognized. I have been thinking hard lately about whether or not I ever want to share this story with reddit and this seems like a pretty good thread to share it in. (and get a game in the process perhaps) For all of you /r/gonewild girls out there and those of you who have thought about posting nude photos of yourself, let this serve as a cautionary tale...\n\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\n\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\n\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was. \n\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to /r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was *insanely* open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about. \n\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her /r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\" \n\nNot only did I walk away without any extortion money, I didn't get any new nudes from her which is what I was holding out for more than anything else. The only good thing about the failed sextortion deal is that she never contacted the FBI which works out perfectly for me because if she did, I wouldn't have been able to share this cautionary tale with you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397674798", "subreddit": "RandomActsOfGaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

And there always was a reason for her to cry *Sigh*.\n\nBut I stayed with her because she was my first and I was thick, so we stayed together for a long time before she left me for another. \n\nAnyway I had a dry patch for a few months, didn't really see anyone and started collage. I met this girl but we didn't hit it off. So then one day the ex shows up. She made the whole two hour journey over during a collage day, and got here by nine. Of course I left at ten, but she waited until then. \n\nThis was back in my college days, so no one was home, and the teachers didn't really care about not showing up every now &amp; again. In fact she judged the best time pretty well. \n\nI know guys, big red flag. But like I said I was in a dry patch. So she walks over to me and I just stand awquardly next to the open door. She leans in and that scent if hers brought a lot of memories back. I'm struggling here and all I can do is ask her why she's here. \n\nShe leans in real close, and tells me all she needs is about tree fiddy. Of course I had this money, and I fished it out soon enough. I mean sex is sex right? But I look back at her and I realised that she was a three story high monster from the palenotithic era. \n\nSomething changed and I didn't feel under any pressure any more, I didn't feel horny or anything. I really didn't want her. So I just looked at her and told her she was getting no damn tree fiddy and to beat it. Or something like that, I mean this was a while ago. \n\nSo a couple of days later she moves to Scotland, and we never see eachover again. Apparently she burnt too many bridges, and I was her last chance to get lucky before Scotland. I get this from a mutual friend of course, we dropped out of contact pretty fast. I got one postcard with the lake loch ness on the cover but that was it. \n\nSo I think the moral of the story is that sometimes you're just going too fast, or they just don't want it.

He acquired scientific support from [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University) by donating $330,000 to the [Lamont–Doherty Geological Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamont%E2%80%93Doherty_Earth_Observatory) for the purchase of a wide-sweep sonar, in exchange for five years' use of the equipment and the services of technicians to support it. Drs. William B. Ryan of Columbia University and [Fred Spiess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Spiess) of [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_Institution_of_Oceanography) in California joined the expedition as consultants.  They nearly stayed ashore when Grimm introduced them to a supposed fellow consultant – a monkey called Titan, which was trained to point at a spot on the map to supposedly indicate where *Titanic* was. The scientists issued an ultimatum: \"It's either us or the monkey.\" Grimm preferred the monkey, but was prevailed upon to leave it behind and bring the scientists instead. \n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Robert ^Ballard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ballard) ^| [^RMS ^Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) ^| [^British ^Wreck ^Commissioner's ^inquiry ^into ^the ^sinking ^of ^the ^RMS ^Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Wreck_Commissioner%27s_inquiry_into_the_sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic) ^| [^Halomonas ^titanicae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halomonas_titanicae) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cgufpkn) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cgufpkn)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397696717", "subreddit": "MH370", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

There was this one woman who came in and said she had a very embarrassing tattoo, she was actually a regular, she came in once every so often, mostly small stuff and she was very wealthy. She once came in with a tramp stamp of a horse (Standard tattoo not the point of this story) that she wanted removed. This woman was sweet but she had, lets say..... a lot of canvas for a tattoo artist to work with. Anyway, one day she comes in with this swastika tattoo over her butt, to the left of where the horse tramp stamp used to be. I look at her and ask why she has this, she has always been very sweet to me and the jewish owner of the shop, she told me a story about how she had a bad boyfriend and she fell in with a bad crowd. I told her to sit down and it was ok, we begin the estimate (which came out to about $150) she gives me the money but she is a little short, I tell her this and she says to me \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\" at this point I realize this is not the sweet lady I have been helping with tattoos for years, but she is the damn lock ness monster!

Give me a cigarette.\" So I lit one of mine and gave it to him (don't ask what I had to do to get this pack because that's another story yet again). \n\nSo we chat and he tells me to meet him in his cell that afternoon.

{"body": "Wall of text incoming.\n\nI should be making a throwaway for this, but whatever. A couple years back (2006 to be precise), I had gone on vacation to Kerala which is one of the coastal states in India. This was in December, so if you have a good memory, you’ll remember that this was when the Tsunami of ’06 hit us. At about 9:30 in the morning, I saw the entire ocean recede. I had no idea what was going on. Hundreds of people ran towards the beach picking up shells and whatever else they could lay their hands on. Being an idiotic 16 year old, I followed them too. I’m pretty sure I felt some kind of uneasiness in the air, but maybe this is me just misremembering. Suddenly, I heard a scream cut through the air. Several more joined in. I looked up and saw the massive wave approaching. Immediately, hundreds of people started running towards the shore. Here’s a bit of advice. Don’t try outrunning a tsunami. It’s not going to work. I ran into the first building I saw, a beachside hotel of some sort. It was, as you can guess, jam packed. Everyone was running up the stairs to reach higher ground. We eventually reached the roof, which was about 50 feet above ground level. But that wasn’t nearly enough to protect us from the massive incoming 60 foot high waves. The first wave hit us with an unbelievable force. Everyone on that roof was swept away. I was struggling to catch my breath. Kept getting pushed underwater. Eventually, I passed out of sheer tiredness. \n\nFast forward a couple of hours. I wake up, still exhausted on the beach. Bodies everywhere. Debris from homes: tons of plastic and tree branches. About ankle deep water. The worst was the smell. Rotten fish smell. It was overpowering. I had no way of knowing where I was, or contacting my parents. I stayed there for a few hours and then started to walk back to where I assumed was the town. I learnt from the hotel management that my parents had not returned. I was welcomed to stay out the duration we had booked the room for (about a month). After a month of waiting, they had not returned. So I hitchhiked back to my home in Bangalore. \n\nAs I walked up the stairs to my house I saw black drapes, a sign that a member of the family had died. I walked in through the open door, and saw my parents sitting at the table. I was shocked! I ran in and hugged them. They told me that they thought I was dead, because they hadn’t heard from me in over a month. After making good with them, we all went to the nearby bar for a round of celebration. After a night of heavy drinking, the bartender comes up to my dad and gives him the bill. My dad realizes he doesn’t have enough to pay. So he turns to me, and says, “I’m gonna need about tree fiddy”. At which point I realize that this isn’t my dad, but actually the loch ness monster. I was so annoyed that I told the beast to get out of my sight immediately. \n\nTL:DR; Was missing, presumed dead for a month.

{"body": "Too short.  Didn't grab attention soon enough.  It would have been better if he had not only made the story *much* longer but has also made us somewhat care about the characters or at least give more insight as to what was happening.  Something like this maybe?\n\n\"Oh, man.  You guys aren't going to believe this.  I've been waiting to find a thread like this early on for awhile because I have the perfect story.  So about two years ago I was on the chubbier side.  I was in my room most days and just played videogames all day.  I was really lonely so I decided to try various dating websites and finally I found a girl who I really connected with.  Long story short we eventually started dating.  \n\nI really didn't think anything was wrong with her.  I really didn't.  But eventually she started getting... weird.  \n\nOH! I forgot to mention that I have a dog.  It'll be relevant later.\n\nAnyways, a few months in and she finally confesses to me that she's a paranoid schizophrenic.  You came into this thread asking for crazy exes and I'm guessing you didn't really mean 'crazy' OP, did you?  Anyways, so I was caught offguard for a second but I eventually figured that as long as she was on medication or something she should be fine.  I'd give it a shot.  Besides she was fine as hell and a little bit out of my league so it was worth trying.  Also I was really horny and hadn't been laid in a long time so it was definitely worth going for.\n\nAnyways so her schizophrenia kept getting worse and worse as the months went on.  She'd have random episodes where she'd refuse to leave her home.  She'd cry and cut herself and she was convinced that everyone out there was out to get her.  It was really sad actually.  But anyways, I need to get to the point.\n\nAbout 8 months into our relationship I'm at work and I get a strange, cryptic message from her.  She had been suicidal before so I was worried for her so I sped to her house during my lunch hour. \n\nShe wasn't home.\n\nI began to panic and started to text and call her but she didn't answer.  Finally she answered a text and just said something about Lenny, my dog, and how he was part of a movement trying to get her or something.\n\nI lost my shit and sped straight to my house.  I ran a red light which in hindsight was probably dangerous but I had to get to my house.  I finally got to my house and the house was locked.\n\nAfter some debating I broke in through the back window which I knew I could most cheaply replace.\n\nI finally got into my house and searched each room.  Eventually I found her in the bedroom.  \n\nMy dog was dead.  I could tell that already.  There was blood on the carpet and in the corner there was my girlfriend crying with a steak knife and screaming at me to get away.\n\nI couldn't hold myself in anymore and began screaming at her and crying over my dog.  I couldn't believe what had just happened and I still cannot believe it.  I chose the wrong girl.  That was an awful mistake to date her... anyways..\n\nSo I started to slowly approach her while toning down my voice because at the moment I needed to calm her down and subdue her before I called the police or something.\n\nAs I moved closer she'd hold the knife to her throat and threaten to cut and I'd have to talk her out of it.   Eventually I was probably 10 feet from her and she said not to come any further.\n\n\"Before you come any further, I need something...\"\n\nConfused I said, \"What do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that my girlfriend was a 7 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era,  that goddamn loch ness monster had gotten me again.\n\n\"GODDAMNIT MONSTAH I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" I screamed as she swam away...\"\n\nThat was a really shitty story becuase I'm low on time and I got to go but you get the point.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397764554", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 25, "controversiality": 0}

I went up to the guy at the cash register and showed him my card. He sort of blinked at me and said \"Do you think I'm that stupid?\"\n\nI asked him what on earth he was talking about, and he replied that *not five minutes ago*, a guy with the same card walked in and **stole MY money.** My vision went red with rage. I rushed over to Joe's house and searched his house. He wasn't home, no doubt bragging to his buddies or buying a new car.\n\nApparently, he was home. He found me tearing up his room and slowly, in a controlled voice, asked me what I was doing. I replied, \"Taking back what's rightfully mine.\"\n\nHe pulled out a stack of cash out of his pocket and said, \"This?\"\n\nI replied, \"Yes, now GIVE IT TO ME!\"\n\nTo my utter surprise, he said, \"Sure, but for a price.\"\n\nI asked what the price was, and he smirked and said, \"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was only then that I realized he was a 20-story tall crustacean from the Jurassic Period.

I get why it happens, I just find it interesting that it can get that type of reaction out of us just because we have been made to believe that's how we should react to it. I think this is because we have been told that this garment is for this situation, and another is for something else.

{"body": "Given the choice, I'd go to Busch Gardens Williamsburg. It's more of a \"theme\" park with actual themed areas (all themed to different European countries as someone else mentioned) rather than an amusement park, with a ton of roller coasters built over blacktop. It really depends on what you want in an theme park/amusement park experience.\n\n**Theme**\n\nBusch Gardens Williamsburg is themed to several different European Countries - England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy), and you can definitely tell that effort was put into the theming. Busch Gardens is also consistently winning awards for the most beautiful theme park in the country. \n\nKing's Dominion has themed areas, but it's less themed than Busch Gardens for sure.\n\n**Roller Coasters**\n\nAs far as \"real\" roller coasters (excluding smaller coasters geared more towards families)- Busch Gardens has 5. Kings Dominion has 11. It's not very fair to compare them coaster for coaster, because they're not the same product. \n\nKings Dominion has Intimidator 305, which is the tallest (305') and fastest (90mph) roller coaster between the two parks. They also have Dominator, a B&amp;M Floorless Coaster, and Volcano: The Blast Coaster, which is a launched inverted Coaster. Kings Dominion also wins the Wooden Coaster battle with 3 (Hurler, Rebel Yell, Grizzly) to Busch Gardens' 0. \n\nBusch Gardens has Apollo's Chariot, an incredibly smooth B&amp;M Hyper Coaster, Alpengeist, a B&amp;M Invert, Griffon, a B&amp;M Floorless Dive Coaster, Verbolten, which features some great ride elements, and Loch Ness Monster, which was the first roller coaster with interlocking loops.\n\n**Food**\n\nThough I haven't been to either park in a few years, the food at Busch Gardens Williamsburg has always been better than the food at Kings Dominion. Trapper's Smokehouse at Busch Gardens has some of the best Theme Park food I've ever tasted with their wood smoked Brisket and chicken. Last time I was there, I had an Irish Steak sandwich from a stand in the \"Kilarney\" section of the park that was incredible. (Your friends from Ireland may not appreciate the inauthenticity.) They also have a great Italian-style restaurant that had great Chicken Parmesean.\n\nIf Burgers, Hot Dogs, etc. are more your speed, then Kings Dominion is perfect. One thing I will recommend is the Shrimp Sandwich at the \"Outer Hanks\" Seafood Restaurant. It was incredible. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I love Kings Dominion, but for my money, I'd choose to go to Busch Gardens over Kings Dominion. \n\n\nAll of this said...it's very feasible to do both parks in a two day stretch. They're only about 90 minutes-ish apart. That's a trip I've done several times.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397835323", "subreddit": "Themepark", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I was an introvert mostly throughout High School.  I didn't go to many parties, nor did I have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked.  \n\nUnfortunately, I had 0 skills on picking up girls even though I was trying really hard to get a girl.  \n\nIn 11th grade there was a party around my school's christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it.  I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.  \n\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where.  I still remembered her name though, Vanessa.  She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\n\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me.  I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\n\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible.  She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back.  I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\n\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of.  Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\" \n\nI started saying more things.\n\nShe laughed even more.\n\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl.  But then it dawned on me.  I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where.  A strip club.  Vanessa was a stripper.  Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.  \n\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously.  My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once.  I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\n\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"  \n\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\n\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house.  This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue.  I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself.\n\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\n\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone.  A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms.  I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside.\n\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\n\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off Vanessa's clothes.  Finally, she was fully naked, as was I.  She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.  \n\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\".  Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\"  I couldn't believe it.  This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin.  I still can't believe it.  I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock.  She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to.  I told her I was a virgin too and she said good.  As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\"  \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\n\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life.  Been waiting for awhile for someone to post a question like this to askreddit for a long time now.  Happy I finally got the chance to tell that story.\n\ntl;dr: A stripper who aggressively threw herself on to me was actually a virgin.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397835975", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Costco's is 18\" and $10.79 at my store.  \n\nSo lets do this based just off of pizza that you're getting for a dollar.  \n\nFor a 14\" pizza you're getting 153.94 inches of pizza.  Or 8.4 cents per sq. inch of pizza.  \n\nWith Costco's 18\" pizza you're getting 254.47 inches of pizza.  Or 4.2 cent per sq. inch of pizza.  \n\n**This above information is just for funzies, below is where shit gets real.**\n\nSo for your basic membership its gonna be about $55 per year.

From the first time i saw her, she looked me straight in the eye and she knew i was attracted. well through out the first semester she turned in every single assignment, but she turned them to me directly. none of that pass it up the row crap. when she handed it to me she made sure to slowly stroke the back of the hand. well one day i was grading tests and hers popped up and it was absolutely putrid. she might of had like 20% total. i shit you not next day the bell rings and im shooing the last of the regular groupies then she comes in behind them, wearing a blouse that was half unbuttoned. I never realized how big her boobs were. Well im getting kinda scared now because this chick is borderline 17-18 years old if i do anything i could a) lose my job b) go to prison and get my anus checked daily bye a big black dude named bubba . well then she gets closer and god her perfume was getting me turned on and shit im feeling like my job is going down the shitter because she is hot. Well she sit on my lap and starts rubbing my chest . then i ask her \"what do you want ?' she replies with \"you know what i want\"then i ask \" a good grade?\" then she leans in and whispers in my ear \"i want tree fiddy\" and when i looked back she turned int a 100 foot lockness monster. and i said \"god damn it lockness monsta i aint given you my tree fiddy \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntl:dr hot chick tried to seduce to hellp her test score.

{"body": "This story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago.\n\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\n\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty.  Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.  \n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\n\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far,  I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.  \n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact.  I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\"\nI almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal.  Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\n\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\"\nShe replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.  Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!  \n\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Haha..

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\n\nOne day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\n\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\"  I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies?  I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\n\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy.  The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free.  So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.  \n\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence.  I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\n\nNope.\n\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"  \n\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too.  He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.  \n\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\n\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars.  Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\n\nFast forward one year.  I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.  \n\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\n\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\n\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.  \n\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.  He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"  Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  Goddamnit!

Here it is:\n\nI was flying from Pennsylvania to California but had a connecting flight and layover in San Antonio. I was waiting in the airport terminal when I thought I saw a man that looked very similar to Popovich, and looking around I noticed a few other people whispering and pointing in his direction. Deciding to take a closer look, I left my seat and walked over to sit next to him. \n\nI spent the next few minutes glancing out of the corner of my eyes at him and probably making him very uncomfortable, I turned and said, \"Hi Mr. Popovich, I've always wanted to meet you!\" (I know, cringe in hindsight but whatever). He let out a little chuckle and replied, still looking down at the newspaper he was reading, \"I hear I look like Gregg Popovich all the time\". Disappointed but not deterred, I asked, \"Oh, so you're not really Gregg Popovich?\". He paused for a few seconds before replying, \"Oh I am, that's why I get told I look like him\". Not even waiting for him to finish his sentence, I yelped, \"I knew it!\"\n\nAwkward silence ensued for a few seconds, before I told him, \"Mr. Popovich, I coach a high school basketball team. Can you give me a few tips to improve our chemistry? Obviously I'm not nearly at your level, but I have a ton of respect for you so any tip will help\". He nodded his head for a few seconds, and said, \"let me think\". \n\nClosing his newspaper, he turned to me and said something I will never forget. He looked into my eyes and said, \"You've got to make sure that everyone knows, win or lose, they're still the same person that they were before the game and I expect you to treat them as such. Too many coaches treat their players differently based on how they perform, but you've got to make sure you connected with the player as a person before you can improve them as a basketball player\".\n\nMy eyes got wide. I couldn't believe I was sitting here getting coaching advice from one of the greatest of all time! I stammered out, \"I'm going to need a few minutes to process that\". He let out a light little laugh, then said he understood. He started opening his newspaper again, but soon put it back down. He stood and started walking away before turning back to talk to me. \"I'm going to grab a coffee, do you want anything?\". I stood up to answer him, \"yeah, I'd like a coffee thanks. Really appreciate it! How much should I give you?\" Popovich said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Pop was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again. \"Damnit, Gregg, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as he walked away in a fundamentally sound manner. \n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nThanks for the gold, Mikhail Prokhorov!", "gilded": 2, "created_utc": "1398023655", "subreddit": "nba", "score": 1859, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Oh, but Tony was utterly destroyed by his experiences, they not only tortured him but they ruined his reputation, then killed Pepper horribly before him, and then faked his death in a huge terrorist bombing that revealed his entire career as a front for their organization. Millions of people would want him dead if he had not so obviously and publicly died in the blast. There's an infinite bounty on his head, just in case. \n\nTony revealed his true intent with a snarl of \"Die, Cockroach!\" just as he touched a button that obliterated HollyWood during a live appearance on Ellen. The bomb only affected living mammal tissue, leaving the buildings of Los Angeles unharmed but filling the area with countless decaying corpses. \n\nThe world mourned the loss of TinselTown. The only known survivor was Charlie Sheen, who was wearing a titanium cockroach costume backstage for one of Ellen's pranks. He staggered up to the camera and ranted for two uncensored hours, that were the single most watched video on YouTube. Luckily he wasn't interviewed again, after that, since he had shared his impressions at length, and everyone on Earth knew what he thought by that point. No comeback necessary. \n\nAgent Coulson could not believe he'd been fooled by a terrorist, and could not shake the feeling that his friend was innocent, yet he found overwhelming proof at every turn. He felt oddly devastated. He'd thought he only tolerated the eccentric billionaire, but finds himself dreaming of the weeks before the bombing, of himself trying to warn Tony not to appear on that show, each time waking to remember with mounting horror, the destruction that Tony had apparently devoted his life to causing.\n\nSeveral months after Tony's death, Coulson had a brief encounter with a vagrant with compelling eyes on the way to a mission in Mumbai, and could not stop having disturbingly arousing dreams about him. They were such a relief from the Tony dreams that he welcomed the change, despite the sexual confusion the dreams cause. The rest of this narrative occurs in the present tense for no real reason. \n\nJust days later he meets that same vagrant working in Mother Theresa's hospice, washing the feet of terminal patients with an oddly calm and gentle manner. Fascinated, he takes the man to dinner, despite how the stranger demurs, he wins him over by offering a fabulous dessert he had once shared with Tony at an India-themed gala in DC. \n\nHalfway through the rose pudding it hits him, the strangely sexy vagrant has the mannerisms of his lost friend. He whispers an incredulous \"Tony?\" as he realizes the horrible extent of the transformation. Gone is the goatee, replaced by transverse scars, the left eyelid droops, the eyebrow above it sliced in half. The man stares for an electric instant as those eyes fill with tears of longing and fear, until he flings his beggars veil on the table, and flees. \n\nThe next seven months are devoted to unauthorized use of Coulson's team to find the elusive man, for what Coulson says are possible sensitive testimonies related to India's nuclear power program. In order to upscale the search he identifies the man as a possible terrorist, but a real terrorist matching the man's description begins killing people, and the situation spirals out of control. It all comes to a head when 5 different little red sniper dots are playing over Tony's chest in a Souk in Istanbul. \n\nCoulson throws himself in the line of fire and shouts he just wanted to find a friend, a crippled dessert maker Tony had introduced him to. Coulson quits working for S.H.I.E.L.D, citing stress, which everybody believes because seriously you used that entire organization to hunt down a baker? Wat.\n\nIn his last act as an Agent he gets Tony a visa and new identity as Seeramat Narjawhal, the shortest Indian name he could find. Coulson has dropped his career to help his friend recover his memory and his mind. \n\nTony suffers PTSD as they work on his Grandfather's old Victorian mansion, a home full of happy mementos of his grandparents eternal love. Slowly they realize their feelings for each other and then it devolves into glorious endless sex between two weepy guys who are such a cute couple who lurve red velvet cupcakes  *swoon*\n\n**TL;DR: This is a tree fiddy story, if by \"tree fiddy\" you mean it ends in glorious buttsex.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398025822", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 26, "controversiality": 0}

Her but was actually pretty nice the kind that a girl who does sports has. But what she had in the butt department barely made up for what she was lacking in the breast department(sue me i like big racks). Well we somehow sat next to each other one day and i learned that she was really sweet and pretty funny. so over the next few weeks we talked a lot and i learned that she is very VERY christian. I mean this doesn't bother me because I was baptized christian but i hardly ever went to church. So after about a month or so i asked to be my girlfriend. She of course said yes.I soon learned that i was her first boyfriend and she was still a virgin. So im thinking to myself i just struck gold with this chick almost all the girls who go to this school are whores. So for our first date i took her to a movie and we made out,but i she wasn't ready for the big S word yet. Well after about a month i'm at her apartment and her roommate is gone and we were fooling around fondling and shit.Well i slip her pants and panties off and im going down on her and surprisingly she was waxed down there well she pulled me up and starts going down on me. well this was probably the worst head i have ever gotten it was like she was using her teeth on purpose it was god awful. then she shrieks ,i look down and she is off my dick but her face is stuck in the :O position and she grabs a pad and paper from her book bag and writes \"LOCKJAW\" then i ask her how to fix this she then writes down \"go 2 da farmacy get ask 4 lockjaw pills\" then im thinking shit im a college kid i dont have any money so ask her how much i need half expecting her to say like 200 hundred dollars she writes down \"about tree fiddy\" and when i look up at her she had turned into a 100 foot tall lockness monster then i shouted \"god damn it monstah i aint given you my tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398035433", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Paying the tab, which they're not by the way, doesn't excuse anything and everything Germany does or says. We're not slaves. People can't be bought. If you think they can, you should be bought and sold for tree fiddy.\n\nPeople don't abide by reddiquette. They vote like agreeing or disagreeing. In that sense, /r/europe is no better than an intolerant net mob. \n\nNot really a big thing, because most subs are. But it sterilizes any discussion. \n\nThere's also the rampant Islamophilia. People criticizing Islam or immigration just get banned or massively down voted. It's pathetic when we can't have an opinion on cultural traits. It always gets reduced to racism... I don't like people with signs threatening other people or treating women children and gay people as something worse than animals. If you're going to pull a relativity curtain on that, then you're just as bad as them, if not worse!\n\nAnother thing that repulses me is the naive idealistic mentality that does not correlate with the world we live in. People go out of their way to argue with someone, despite having no experience with the issue being discussed. It ranges from dealing Gypsies to some people's work ethic, to beverages and food. Redditors are not anthropologists with a thesis on issues. They're normal people with limited view of the world and sharing experiences. Counter point with your own experiences. We are not representing our countries on the UN table. Oh God, we should be glad we're not!\n\nAstroturfing is also an issue. The love for Mother Russia is getting out of hand. The amount of down votes in some well thought and well written comments only makes me think that there's a lot of blind hatred for someone or just astroturfing.

One regarding the spotting of a rare white whale spotted during a boat trip to Svalbard, and another article detailing further escalation of military presence in the arctic. This militarization seems to be key to this mystery, and the white whale may have been infected by the very same pathogen that infected the children early on in the events.

{"body": "Okay, but listen. As an only child growing up in rural kentucky, and after my parents divorced when I was only 6 I lived a fragmented, lonely life. Weeks at my dad's house were filled with lots of ranch work, because dad was really far behind on the mortgage and couldn't afford to hire on more help. I didn't too much like weekends at my mom's house because she was working two jobs, both as a server, so she could make ends meet.\n\nThere was a horse at my dad's ranch that we called 'Sage' because she had a beautiful gray coat that, in the correct light, could be percepted as a beautiful shade of her namesake. I said before that I lived a very lonely life, so when Dad unloaded Sage from the trailer that first time and she nuzzled at my hand I knew I had found my first friend.\n\nBetween feeding the animals and moving logs, I would always steal away to the stables or pen to spend a few minutes with Sage. We would play a game where she mimicked my actions; if I ran around the yard, she would follow and match my pace. A few quick head bobs, and she would return in kind. My favorite trick was to jump up in the air and watch as Sage reared her legs like a fierce stallion.\n\nMy childhood came to a shattering crash one October morning when I woke to the sound of a shotgun and dogs barking. I bolted upright in bed and yelled out for my dad, and when he didn't respond I tenuously crept from my bed and shuffled my way through the house, clutching my own self tightly.\n\nThats when the world around me flooded in and I heard a sound that made my stomach turn - the pained, agony filled cries of a mare and the verbose, damning curses of my dad. Disregarding shoes, the cold weather, and the possibility of imminent danger, I ran outside into the cresting sun.\n\nMy body was immediately wracked with dread. My father stood there in the stables. Doors flung wide. Buckets, rakes, and shovels were scattered. And blood. Blood everywhere. A coyote lay in the yard, riddled with buckshot.  That wasn't all. I knew it. I could sense it.\n\nAs I crept up to the stable doors, I caught a glimpse of Sage laying on the ground and I broke into a sprint for the last 12 feet. Dad turned, with a tear welling in his eye, and held up his hand, motioning for me to stay back. I ran past dad, dropped to my knees, and began sobbing harder than I've ever sobbed in my life. I lifted Sage's heavy head in my hands, and her limp neck poured blood from a fresh, warm gash torn by a hungry coyote. Between sobs, cursing the world for all its evils, and refusing to believe my only friend in the world could possibly die, I turned to my dad and begged him, implored him, demanded of him **How?** How could this happen?*\n\nMy father took a knee beside me, slid a hand over my shoulder, and brought my head into his chest. He kissed the top of my head, squeezed me tight, and whispered, \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398046260", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 46, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Asking me or anyone to exactly know God's intentions when He never conveyed is ridiculous and childish.\n\nThat's exactly what you are doing cherry picking the bible. I didn't ask you to do anything here by the way. I simply asked how is your interpretation any more valid than the one I proposed if interpretation is all that matters?\n\n&gt; Please tell me more about how it is supposed to be used. Is every psalm really as important as something like John 3:16?\n\nHow arrogant to decide what things god has said/done are important and which are not. This is your entire basis for viewing the bible. Some isn't true. The problem is it's all supposed to be inspired by/from god. You simply believe you have the ability to know god's intentions on this.\n\n&gt;and you weren't there so you are skeptical doesn't mean that it's not true.\n\nI'm skeptical more because of what the Bible says than any other reason. I did what most Christians don't (I wonder if you have) and read the thing. It refutes itself. There is no way to determine which parts are true and which aren't. When it contradicts itself the entire thing is undermined, and there's no way to reconcile the contradictions without doing what you're doing now. Again, the problem with doing that is that it reflects your feelings and not the reverse as intended.\n\n&gt;Anyways, I could just as easily say that atheists are simply lying to themselves to not feel bad that they don't follow any religious law and truly convinced themselves that there is no God because they have no self control or understanding of faith, but I don't say that because I'm not a dick and don't know everyone's situation and try to respect their beleifs (unlike some others around this comment thread). That's just simply being human, religious or not.\n\nWell you shouldn't say those things because that's Christian apologia, essentially propaganda to dismiss and misrepresent the other side of the argument. The truth would be closer to someone saying \"I saw the Loch Ness monster.\" and the atheist response would be \"I don't believe you.\" Disbelief is not belief in the opposite. The discussion here gets difficult when Christian confuse the word god with the name of their god, God. There actually is a name in the OT, but the hijacking of the word serves its purpose.\n\nThis idea that respecting beliefs is paramount is ridiculous. If I believed I could fly would you not try and stop me from jumping off a high roof? Every time you disagree with someone no matter what the issue, you are essentially not respecting their beliefs. Respecting every belief makes discussion impractical/impossible depending on the issue.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398052422", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Holy shit can I relate.\n\nIt was my senior year, and we had the fucking hottest professor in the college. Miss Ness had this petite, hourglass figure going on, but I didn't mind her too much; I was pretty sure I was going to pass, I was doing pretty well for myself in her class and it was an easy subject. That one time she asked me to meet her in the faculty office was a bit sketchy, but yeah okay, it's not like a teacher *shouldn't* talk to her student, right? So after class I head off to the floor of the usually-busy-office.\n\nIt turns out there wasn't anyone in there but her, which was weird for that time of day. She tells me to sit down in a chair opposite of her. I go along with it and she starts to ask why I make up strange rumors of me and her having a sexual relationship, and hot inappropriate it would be. Me being confused as fuck thinks that I was being accused of something I didn't do and didn't get the hint at first. It wasn't until she was going on and on about how \"forcing myself unto her was the filthiest thing she could imagine doing\" did I get it. \n\nI got up and locked the door to the office and ripped off her blouse. Didn't even bother with the bra strap, I just ripped that fucker right off too. buried my face in those soft, firm supple breasts and had my tongue fondle her nipples. She kept moaning about how she's been giving me As all semester and how I'd be giving her a D soon. I told her to shut up as I hurriedly unbuttoned my pants. \n\nShe hopped up on her table and hiked her skirt up. She wasn't wearing any panties so I knelt down and gave her wet cunt a short 15-minute french kiss. I was rock hard by then and I got up and started to enter her with my raging donger. Even after getting lubed up with my spit and her precum, she was still so tight. There was something weird about it though, her skin didn't feel as soft as it should have. A guttural roar escaped her lips, and she started to claw at my back in ecstasy. I looked at her as she came, but all I could see were bright, green eyes and sharp teeth. I suddenly noticed she was 500 feet tall and looked like she was from the paleolithic era. I thrust harder and harder, and finished in that scaly pussy. We dress up and I walk back out the door.

{"body": "Tl;DR: Banged teacher, furious girlfriend, approval of Dad. \n\nAll American lacrosse player here from a high school in Maryland. My senior year we got a new english teacher and she used to be a lax player. She'd talk to me about lacrosse all the time, but being oblivious of her wanting anything to do with me I carried on with my life training until the season started in spring. She came to all of the games and cheered for me in particular a lot. I was fairly oblivious because I had a girlfriend at the time so I ignored a lot of signals that should have been blatantly obvious. \n\nMy girlfriend began to notice the special treatment I was getting and seemed really annoyed by it. She brought it up multiple times, one of them being in front of my dad. He just smirked, shook his head and wrote it off as my gf being jealous. \n\nDeeper into the season it became apparent to me she was interested, but I wasn't sure what I'd do. I had a girlfriend, but dat ass. Wasn't sure how to initiate things with her. One day after english class (conveniently at the end of the day too) she asked me to hold up a minute. Commence boner becoming hard enough to chisel diamonds for kay jewlers. She just flat out said it. She told me she wanted to have sex and she found some of the guys on the lax team irresistible. She invited me back to her house after practice that day. Another teacher popped in real fast to ask about something else, and what she needed me for after school. Still really caught off guard by her blunt approach I awkwardly asked her what did she need from me. She furrowed her brows and gave me a death glare. Then she said about tree fiddy. Now it was about this time I realized that this woman was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I felt really stupid about the whole thing and decided to just go home to my girlfriend and never speak about it again.\n\n Sometimes it's just best to walk away from things before they get too far out of hand and damage the people closest to you.

{"body": "I really like the concepts you've got here - it seems very well designed, and relatively balanced as well. The only problems I see are a couple wording issues to make the cards work properly within the rules structure of Magic.\n\nUndead Hydra's ability should be worded similarly to Delve (from Future Sight). The way you have it worded right now, it's an activated ability, which means it'd either function while it was in your hand (wouldn't do anything), on the stack (wouldn't do anything because the cost is already locked in), or on the battlefield (wouldn't do anything for obvious reasons). To be completely honest, the way you have it right now, it'd only work on the battlefield; you would need to add a clarifier such as \"activate this ability only while Undead Hydra is on the stack/in your hand\" to allow it to be activated in other zones. Either way, it wouldn't work to reduce the cost, so you'd need it to be worded like this: \"Each creature card you exile from a graveyard while casting this spell pays for [1](/1).\"\n\nStormcharge as currently worded doesn't work - no matter what, a creature won't die while Stormcharge is resolving, so the second clause will never apply. Stormcharge will mark 2 damage on a creature, and if it's lethal it will die during the next check of state-based effects, after Stormcharge has already left the stack. You would need to word it similar to Searing Blood, to set up a delayed trigger that would trigger when the creature dies. Additionally, for the copy part, you'd need to word it \"copy Stormcharge, then cast the copy without paying its mana cost\". As currently worded, you're casting a copy that doesn't exist yet, and also forcing the player to pay the mana cost for it. The final wording would be something like this: \"Stormcharge deals 2 damage to each creature. When a creature dealt damage this way dies, copy Stormcharge, then cast the copy without paying its mana cost.\"\n\nRhiamanual might be a bit underpowered - losing the game when he dies is a huge drawback, and isn't offset very well by gaining control of a couple permanents (what if the opponent isn't playing black or red?). Perhaps make him cost a bit less, or give him a bigger body.\n\nThe wording on Return Homeward is a bit overcomplicated - try something like this: \"If more creatures you controlled died during this turn's combat step than creatures target opponent controlled, return a creature card from your graveyard to your hand.\"\n\nParalibri is a pretty specific name for an enchantment - try either generalizing the name a bit to something like \"Underwater Dreams\", or making it legendary for the flavor to fit a bit better.\n\nMake each of the nexuses Land - [Basic land type], or remove the parentheses around the mana-producing clause (see Mistveil Plains and similar). \n\nCounterjustice's wording is a bit ambiguous - does it trigger whenever a single card from your graveyard or library is exiled, or only when your entire graveyard/library becomes exiled? The way you have it worded right now, it'd be the latter (also add the Oxford comma after \"your graveyard\"). If you want it to be the former, try wording it something like this: \"Whenever a permanent you control, a card in your hand, a card in your graveyard, or a card in your library is exiled, exile target permanent.\"\n\nBreeding Phoenix is a pretty generic name for a supposedly legendary creature - try spicing it up a bit. \"Guardian of the Fire Nest\" or \"Phoenix Mother of the Rocks\" are a couple possibilities, but feel free to make up something similar. Just try to add a bit more flavor to it - a legendary creature would be similar to the Loch Ness Monster in our world; not exactly something with a bland name such as \"Breeding Phoenix\". \n\nOther than these small wording issues (and they truly are small, these are things that most people wouldn't even notice), the cards you've shown here are really well designed. Perhaps try to add a bit more of your world's flavor (evil lurking far below) by making the flavor text on a couple of the cards a bit more ominous, but don't worry too much about it; it seems great already.

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\n\nOne day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\n\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\"  I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies?  I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\n\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy.  The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free.  So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.  \n\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence.  I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\n\nNope.\n\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"  \n\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too.  He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.  \n\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\n\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars.  Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\n\nFast forward one year.  I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.  \n\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\n\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\n\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.  \n\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.  He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"  Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again!  I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\nSo yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst here.  But I haven't eaten smarties since then, that's for sure.\n\n**TL;DR: Kid wants drugs, I give him some, sort of.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398092720", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The first Rockness festival took place on 24 June 2006 and has grown in size every year since. In June 2008 [AEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschutz_Entertainment_Group)  took over as the main promoter of the festival. The festival is known as \"the most beautiful festival in the world\" and \"the only festival with its own monster\" due to its beautiful location at [Loch Ness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness) which is the alleged home of the cryptozoological [Loch Ness Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster).

{"body": "My lactose intolerant friend once drank half a gallon of milk while munching out on a grande burrito from Taco-Burrito King. A couple hours later we were driving around and this kid starts ripping the most noxious farts I have ever smelled in my life - this stench was otherworldly, it was searing my sinuses like I snorted vinegar or something, and my eyes were fucking streaming even with the windows wide open. He kept apologizing, but there was no way were we going to stand smelling that for the whole ride back to his house. We whipped right into the nearest gas station, I think it was a BP, and he jumped out to go annihilate their toilet. My other friend and I went inside to grab some drinks while we waited for the car to air out and for him to unleash whatever ungodly concoction his colon was brewing. Right as we were done ringing up our drinks he shouted to us from the back and told me I needed to come back there for a sec, he had a question. I thought it was a little weird he didn't just text me and instead opted to shout from the bathroom, but I started walking back there anyway. I got to the back of the store (it was a small gas station) and walked down the little maintenance hallway past the closet where they store the mops and wet-floor signs and stuff, all the way to the little dingy bathroom in the back. I got back there and asked him what he needed through the door, in a muffled voice he said, \"I got a question,\"...\"I spent all my money at TBK but I really want to buy a drink. Can I borrow about tree fiddy?\" Right at that moment the door burst open to reveal that he hadn't taken a shit. No - he'd deposited a giant clutch of at least a hundred translucent red eggs, each one the size of a softball and coated with chunks of viscous white slime. It was at this point I realized that my friend was actually a twelve foot tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Needless to say, I screamed, \"NO goddamnit I ain't givin you no tree fiddy\", and sprinted out of there as fast as I could. I yanked my other friend out the door and we hopped in the car and drove off like maniacs. That was honestly the scariest shit I have ever seen in my entire life.

{"body": "This also happened to a friend of mine. It was his 18th birthday and his parents decided to throw a huge family party for him. Normally you wouldnt think a family party can be that big but my friends mom has 8 siblings and his dad has 7 so obviously with all the uncles and aunts and cousins and what not it can get pretty crazy. I'm his best friend and hang out with his family a lot so i was able to attend the party and it was actually pretty hectic for a family party. Tons of little kids running around, crying, screaming, arguing over wiffleball, all that stuff. And the food was actually pretty ridiculous. My friend is pretty rich so his parents got him the best food, like fondue, catering by chick-fil-a, tons of appetizers, and the biggest fucking cake I've ever seen. bigger than wedding cakes. And it was so good. So they got to the present part, and in their family they have a tradition where the person who gives the present has to walk up and hand them the present themselves. Its definitely uncomfortable for the kid getting the gifts because everytime he gets a present a person is standing right there and everytime he has to act all excited about his new fucking american eagle sweatshirt or gift card to barnes and noble. Even though he just wants a case of natty and some weed. So with all his family members this clearly took a long time and was uncomfortable/boring for him and for everyone else watching. They wanted the person to go last to be his grandmother, as she recently moved to florida (from up north) with his grandfather and my friend and his grandmother were really close and hadnt seen each other in months. So after what felt like hours of fake smiling, half assed thank yous, and a bunch of shitty presents, finally his grandmother has her present. And his grandmother is where the money in the family comes from so hes expecting a lot of money as always. But he doesnt want to act like hes expecting a lot, so he opens the card and doesnt tilt it or anything so the a few bills and oddly some coins fall out of the card. But he doesnt go to pick them up as he wants to be nice and focus on the message of the card. But when he drops them the grandmother dives on the floor and grabs them and puts them in her purse. My friend looks at her and says \"what the fuck grandma, thats my money. How much was that?\" His grandma then replies \"about tree fiddy\" It was around this time I realized that his grandma was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, give me my tree fiddy!\" my friend yelled as his grandma swam away into the distance.

{"body": "So I found a dead guy in an alley once. \n\nIt was back in Richmond during college. The gf of the time and I were walking along and it was the middle of the day so we cut through an alley to save time. In some places in Richmond that's not always a safe idea but it was the middle of the day and a fairly safe part of town so we weren't worried. \n\nWe're just about to our building (we lived in the same complex) when we noticed a pair of shoes sticking out of a pile of garbage bags. The shoes are connected to legs that sure enough are connected to a homeless guy sprawled out in the trash. Again, this was Richmond so no big deal there. Just taking a nap on the softest thing he could find. We walk past him and go on with our day. \n\nNow this alley could be seen from my window. Throughout the day I'd lean out the window to smoke and would just stare outside while doing so. After a few hours I notice the guy is still there and it's a pretty warm day and that trash has to be getting ripe. Whatever, his choice where to sleep. We joke about it and go back to the our movie or whatever. \n\nNight falls, it's a weekend so we decide to pick up some beer and dinner. We walk past the guy on the way. Hasn't moved an inch. There are flies on him now. Still, best not to wake a sleeping hobo, you never know, so we pass him.  \n\nIn the store the gf starts to get worried. Maybe he ODed and needs medical attention. She gets pretty worked up about it so I agree to check him on the way back. \n\nWhen we pass him again I look closer and am a bit more concerned. His lips were blue and he's very, very pale. I don't see his chest moving. I very slowly nudge his foot with my own. Ask if he's ok. Nothing. I nudge harder. Still nothing. I carefully grab his leg and shake it. Oh shit. Dude is dead. \n\nWe call 911. We just kinda stand there to point him out when they arrive. The gf is having a minor meltdown, wondering if he could have been helped if we checked sooner. I was asking myself the same questions but was trying to be the strong one for her, saying he was probably there all the previous night, there was nothing we could have done, etc. The ambulance is taking forever. Then it happened. He coughed. \n\nWe froze like we had just heard a gunshot or something. The guy cough-hacks a loogie the size of a fist and starts standing up. We are just standing in front of him stone-still, not sure if this was a miracle or a zombie. Finally, I half-stutter half-ask if there's anything we can do to help. He looked me right in the eye and said \"I'm gonna need about tree-fity\". It was about then that I noticed he was about 500 feet tall and looked like something out of the Paleozoic era. So I said \"Get out of here you goddamned Loch Ness monster!\"\n\nI spend too much time online. No, he was actually dead. Heroine overdose. I'll never know if we could have made a difference had we acted sooner. So sorry for the lame joke, but to quote Life of Pi: So which story do you prefer?

Anyway, I don't want to be tagged as \"bundle of sticks\" so I'm delivering!\n\nI'll give some background information as well about how I came to learn about Tulpas because everyone loves stories right? If you don't, feel free to skip to the part with a long line. I should probably state here that Noca is a melanistic Jaguar.\n\nI've been a furry for eh, a good number of years. I'm somewhat used to the shit on the internet, so some things don't really bother me, such as what I'm about to mention next. Anyway, I stumped upon furry hypnosis, and was skeptical. I did some research, watched documentaries and finally proved to myself that - hey, this is legit.\n\nI tried out Furmorphed, talked on the forums and eventually tried a audio file. Before this, I asked myself many times: \"Do I want this?\" Me, being new to the scene, thought \"yes\" because hey, self research! Many nights and rests I've tried it but no success arrived.\n\nI stopped after my seventh or so listening and realised that I didn't actually want it. So I just dropped it. Right there. Even said my goodbyes on the forums. \n\nBefore I left though, I saw a post that gathered my attention. It was something similar, and it had a rather easy name to memorise. It was about Tulpas. So I read the post, thought \"cool story bro\" and went on with my life. Early Feb, I got back to the post about Tulpas and, as I did with hypnosis, did some research.\n\nThough, there aren't a lot of sources about Tulpas so I just read people's stories, success stories, tulpa.info and forums. Then I saw that there was  subreddit for it. **\"that was there the whole time? and I didn't even realise?\"**\n\nSo here I went, reading the posts and^^might ^^have ^^been ^^judging ^^everyone understanding more about Tulpas. I was skeptical, but, come on, if hypnosis was true, how fake can this be? So I decided to try it, to prove that it was real and because I had nothing better to do. I started around Feb 21.\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nI read up some guides and was ready to start. I had already actually started, finishing personality. I then realised there was a mentorship thread and decided to go for it. I checked through everyone, and realised *\"Why is visual imposition so low for everyone?\"*.\n\nI then looked out for someone who had it ranked high. I saw someone who fit and it was /u/QBtwo , my current and probably for long to come awesome mentor. I seeked him for help, and went on with forcing and such.\n\nI got my first response and wasn't as surprised as I thought it would've been. I had a nagging doubt that it was parroting, and seeked QB's help. While he said it was my Tulpa, I decided to run some tests to check. Alas, I ended up with the result that it was parroting.\n\nA while passed, and I got my second response. *\"Could it be legit this time, and not me parroting?\"* Nope, parroting. Though, I didn't give up. Why the hell should I, anyway? It doesn't consume a lot of my time. This was around Early to Mid March.\n\nTime passed, and I kept with my forcing sessions. I read more about Tulpas, and found one that talked about relationships. I was actually at first put off with the idea of a Tulpa and Host relationship, thinking *\"why.\"* \n\nIt became an intrusive thought. I still forced, but had to stop whenever the thought about Noca being with me came. I rejected it automatically, and didn't even think about it.\n\nCome early April, and I finally got a response I believed was my Tulpa. And it was! I was happy, because I honestly had expected me to take about a year. I focused on working on Noca's vocality, because she was not really too clear to me.\n\nOn 13/04/2014, I woke up again, greeted Noca good morning and decided to force in bed since I was bloody lazy to leave. \n\nIn wonderland, Before I had greeted her finish, she gave me the animal's equivalent of a kiss, licking my cheek. This rendered me kind of speechless, attempting to process what had just happened. She then nuzzled me a bit before resting upon my chest, which then I instinctually(So, TIL, thats a word. I think.) ran my hands across her fur, lying there, silenced. \n\nI got back my voice and asked her\n\n\"How.. did you know?\" \n\nShe just smirked and replied: \"It was a feeling I had.\"\n\n---------------\nSo, that was the longest post I've ever made, I hope I didn't have any spelling errors.

{"body": "December 2004 Tsunami. Wall of text incoming.\n\nI should be making a throwaway for this, but whatever. A couple years back (2004 to be precise), I had gone on vacation to Kerala which is one of the coastal states in India. This was in December, so if you have a good memory, you’ll remember that this was when the Tsunami of ’06 hit us. At about 9:30 in the morning, I saw the entire ocean recede. I had no idea what was going on. Hundreds of people ran towards the beach picking up shells and whatever else they could lay their hands on. Being an idiotic 16 year old, I followed them too. I’m pretty sure I felt some kind of uneasiness in the air, but maybe this is me just misremembering. Suddenly, I heard a scream cut through the air. Several more joined in. I looked up and saw the massive wave approaching. Immediately, hundreds of people started running towards the shore. Here’s a bit of advice. Don’t try outrunning a tsunami. It’s not going to work. I ran into the first building I saw, a beachside hotel of some sort. It was, as you can guess, jam packed. Everyone was running up the stairs to reach higher ground. We eventually reached the roof, which was about 50 feet above ground level. But that wasn’t nearly enough to protect us from the massive incoming 60 foot high waves. The first wave hit us with an unbelievable force. Everyone on that roof was swept away. I was struggling to catch my breath. Kept getting pushed underwater. Eventually, I passed out of sheer tiredness. \n\nFast forward a couple of hours. I wake up, still exhausted on the beach. Bodies everywhere. Debris from homes: tons of plastic and tree branches. About ankle deep water. The worst was the smell. Rotten fish smell. It was overpowering. I had no way of knowing where I was, or contacting my parents. I stayed there for a few hours and then started to walk back to where I assumed was the town. I learnt from the hotel management that my parents had not returned. I was welcomed to stay out the duration we had booked the room for (about a month). After a month of waiting, they had not returned. So I hitchhiked back to my home in Bangalore. \n\nAs I walked up the stairs to my house I saw black drapes, a sign that a member of the family had died. I walked in through the open door, and saw my parents sitting at the table. I was shocked! I ran in and hugged them. They told me that they thought I was dead, because they hadn’t heard from me in over a month. After making good with them, we all went to the nearby bar for a round of celebration. After a night of heavy drinking, the bartender comes up to my dad and gives him the bill. My dad realizes he doesn’t have enough to pay. So he turns to me, and says, “I’m gonna need about tree fiddy”. At which point I realize that this isn’t my dad, but actually the loch ness monster. I was so annoyed that I told the beast to get out of my sight immediately. \n\nTL:DR; Was missing, presumed dead for a month.

{"body": "When I was 17 (a while ago now) I knew this kid called Tank. He wasn't exactly a friend but at the same time I had nothing against him either. Anyway, around the same time I was doing errands for cash at the weekends, trying to save up for some wheels. I was known in the neighbourhood for being the kid to call if you wanted drains cleared or some painting done or whatever. \n\n\nI'd been out at a girl's house this one day, and when I got home my dad told me a lady had called who wanted some gardening done. I called back, got the address and headed out-it was quite local so I cycled, full of the joys of spending the morning with my girlfriend, the sunny weather and generally being alive. Life was good. \n\nWhen I got to the house, a lady answered the door and took me straight to the garage where she showed me the tools and gave me some instruction as to what needed doing in the garden. It was pretty basic stuff. I guess she would have been about 40 and looked great for her age, long legs, blonde, you know the sort. She kept going on about how grateful she was to me for helping her and how her husband had left her for some \"slut\" from the office. The conversation made me a little uncomfortable but I really needed the money so I did my best to ignore her weirdness and got on with the work. \n\nI was there about four afternoons in total. It was strange-every day she would stare at me out of the window and bring me way to many cold drinks. By the end I just wanted to be out of there and was happy to finish the job. Of course this meant going to the house to get paid.....\n\nI knocked on the door and explained I was finished and was there for my money. She insisted on me going inside to \"receive\" my \"payment\". Being young an naiive I followed her in, and noticed a picture of Tank in the hallway. It clicked then that this was his mother, and I mentioned to the lady that I was at school with her son. She seemed delighted about that, and took me into the living room, sat down on a sofa right next to me, and I swear the conversation went like this:\n\"So, friend of my son, it seems I owe you\"\n\n\"Um. Yes.

{"body": "the story behind the NPC is largely unknown, but they are dressed in similar attire to a character from dark souls 1 (perhaps elite knight armor) and you spot them close to any boss or event critical to the main plotline (killing nessie and taking the throne) as you progress and find his, his armor is darker, more tarnished, and if you look carefully its burnt, and scortched, all over. and he sounds more dark, and angry towards you, less, non-caring, where his initial dialogue is kinda condescending, as if you mean nothing to him and he isnt concerned about you, but as the game goes on, and your soul memory and ammount of great souls increases, he becomes more hostile, more aware of you, and more curious as to who you are. asking more questions about you, your predicament (the curse) and the like\n\nand constantly in front of the fog gates to boss fights, you can summon him, however when you do he doesnt appear until you've entered the fog gate, and then he enters the gate, and becomes a dark spirit, so then you have to kill him and the boss. his move set is focused on blocking until you are locked on the boss, and then casting all sorts of odd buffs (like magic weapon, and homing soulmass) on the boss (yes i know no other character does this) to give the boss buffs, and then using miracles such as replenish, and pyromancies such as warmth and immolation, pretty much buffing the boss until they are near impossible to kill. so you either have to quickly kill the boss before they get super buffed, or you have to use AOE attacks, or attacks that go through his shield to kill him before he can buff the boss. \n\n then finally at the throne room you encounter him, right before nessie. and he explains his entire backstory, that he is a traveler from a land and a time long since past, that he has been searching for those who have been destined to a fate, and tries to break them from their fate (thus the scortching, trying to stop the playing in DS 1 from killing gwyn) and break the cycle so he may finally die and be released from his eternal tourment. throughout the talk you hear him make references to eons and eons of kingdoms come and gone, and how he has been cursed to wander them endlessly. and when he finally gives you his name it will eaither be chrocusus (roughly striking time, in latin ((yes i know its merging latin words))) or, if you have a DS1 save on the console, it will take the name of one of your characters (to add to the whole \"traveling through the kingdoms\" storyline) he then goes to kill you, and a fight begins, his whole build is unlike anything youve seen before. he doesnt actually try to hit you, with any form of melee or spells. but what he does it try and simply block you from the fog gate before nessies room. his whole combat is based off of dropping the floor around himself and you, and the floor directly in front of the fog gate. so the whole point of the battle is having to dodge around a ever changing, and ever fatal enviroment, till you find him, then you slam him for damage, and he drops the floor from beneath him, and pops up elsewhere, unless you one hit him. if he beats you the first time he says \"im sorry, but to end my tourment i must end your journey\", however if you kill him the first time he says \"you fool, dont you realize we are all pawns to the games of time\", however if you come back the second time (after dying the first) and beat him he says \"so i am not the only one cursed\" however if you lose he repeats his first line (if you lose).\n\nthe whole idea of the character in a nutshell, is a traveler who parallels your path, trying to subtely stop you, so he cant break the cycle and free himself, until the end when you're forced to kill him to progress.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398175756", "subreddit": "DarkSouls2", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

On my way I had no plans to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends)\n\nSoon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\nI decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\n\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life. After the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Zeus: Gets you drunk, roofies you, and you wake up with a sore bum\n\nSatan: You drink too much and sell him your soul for a Klondike bar.\n\nCthulhu: Lord and Master. Do not upset the Under Lord you peasant.\n\nBigfoot: Party animal extraordinaire. You wake up on a boat bound for Russia in a human trafficking empire.\n\nMorgan Freeman: Your night is narrated and tripping on LSD you jump off a roof to get Morgan Freeman out of your head. It doesn't work and he speaks at your funeral while seducing your mother.\n\nAnubis: Smooth player who invites you into a back room. His friends jump you and you wake up in an icy bathtub bleeding from your sides. You have one kidney left.\n\nApollo: Taking ecstasy and ketamine, you and Apollo try to \"touch the sun\". You are hospitalized and disfigured from putting a torch in your mouth as you \"had tried to fellate the sun\"\n\nAres: Drunk, you and Ares wage war on everyone at the party. You are arrested for assault and possession of meth.\n\nDionysus: You drink and drink and drink. The room spins and you offer yourself to the God of Wine and Celebration. He's offended at your inability to hold 1000 gallons of wine and you die from alcohol poisoning.\n\nHades: He introduces the hot damsel in distress and you valiantly come to her rescue. Your powers are stolen and you anger all the Greek gods when Hades tries to destroy Olympus. It's also Monday and you have to work tomorrow.\n\nPoseidon: You end up on another boat. This time you are attacked by pirates, lured to an island of song where your friends are cannibalized, and you spend 10 years lost at sea.\n\nOdin: You get drunk and insult Valhallan custom of wearing your belt over the loops in your pants. This is Law. You are fried by lightning as Thor destroys you.\n\nThor: You and Thor get into an angered arm wrestling match. He wins and you offer to go for two/three. He is offended at your inability to suffer defeat. You are again fried by lightning.\n\nLoki: You are roofied again! He tricks you into attempting to steal Mjolnir. You are fried by lightning.\n\n(Note: Party in Valhalla, always turn down invitation. Ends in death by lightning. 4/10 would not recommend)\n\nVishnu: You get really high and are peace. You get the munchies and thus disappear for 2 hours. You return with 140 McDouble Cheeseburgers. Thor returns to burn you with lightning at the request of Vishnu.\n\nShiva: You look at Shiva. You are set on fire and spend 6 months in a hospital. When you get out, you notice you were charged for 6 PPV movies at $150,000 a piece. Your insurance drops you and you go to jail attempting to sell meth in Brooklyn. 4 Years in Riker's Island and you are banged up in the shower daily. When you are finally released, you are struck by your taxi and killed. The driver was Shiva.\n\nTengri: You have a few drinks and find out he controls lightning. The rest of the conversation is awkward and you excuse yourself. You've just met the god that controls the means of your mortality. You have flashbacks and find out you've been roofied again. You go into a PTSD fit and come out of the bathroom swinging the shower curtain. Police arrive 20 minutes later and pepper spray you. You spend all night in the drunk cell with a very angry chicken.\n\nBaron Samedi: You simply said you missed your mother and somehow the three of you are robbing a grave now. This is getting really weird but your afraid to say no because this guy kind of makes sure when you die your soul actually leaves your body. So now we're standing her digging up \"Mom!! You sick son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill...\" Samedi bashes the shovel over your head for insolence and buries you in the grave with your mother where you die 20 minutes later from asphyxiation.\n\nLoch Ness Monster: Your in Scotland and wow, this is a lot of whiskey. These guys really know how to have fun. You ride Nessie like a giant seahorse. Worst hangover of your life, but this actually ended well!\n\nCentaur: Your partying with horse people! You have too much to drink (We think you may have a problem) and try to ride one of them. This is tantamount to using the \"n\" word and you are surrounded by 10 of them. You are trampled to death with your corpse hung up to warn others. Really though, what did they expect. They are HORSE people.\n\nJersey Devil: You and your buddies are have a grand ole time in the cornfield. The Jersey Devil lands and, well, things only get worse from here. Really, you've got a problem. Why do you drink so much? I'm tired of getting you out of trouble. Do you have any idea what I'VE been through to keep resurrecting you. And you...YOU!! You keep getting drunk and finding all of these guys. Do you enjoy getting raped by lizard men and having demigods rip your legs off? Seriously, your toenails were sewn to you cock just TWO DAYS ago and now your in a cornfield with god knows what that fucker is!...that's it. That's it!! Fix it yourself!\n\nTolkein's Dwarves: You know what. That shit... that shit with the Jersey Devil was great. How are you even walking right now? That thing was huge! I mean. I've seen big ones before, but...Oh right right the Dwarves. So you're partying pretty hard and pounding the ale (really, you DO have a problem. Moving on). Gimli suggests an arm wrestling competition and you know these never end well when drinking. So you rile the dwarves up to start messing with one another. Things are great for a while until a full riot breaks out. Things are going from chill to metal pretty damn fast. This isn't looking good. You try to run, but they see you and start chasing you. 1,000 drunk, angry, and surprisingly fast dwarves are now chasing you. The killing blow is a teabag.\n\nFairies: You're partying with fairies now. You Peter Pan dipshit. These are the worst offenders! They are gonna fuck you up! Anyway, lets get this over with. You somehow get your hands on heroin and now your trying to order pizzas (seriously, pizza and heroin? Just where white after Labor Day you weirdo) This angers Oberon and he chases you around the house with a nail-gun. You are impaled to the water heater and I must now restore amends you asshole.\n\nVampires: Oh Goodie! You're walking into a giant blood orgy where Lestat has got the hookup on some premium cocaine. As you bend over to get a line, Lestat impales your side and starts draining you of life. You didn't really think these were sparkling douchers, did you? Oh well. He offers to spare you and you turn into a vampire, yada yada yada you spend the next 400 years hiding from Lestat and seeing everyone you ever loved die or worse.\n\nWerewolves: You are immediately bitten and offered to be turned into a werewolf. You say yes but they are kind of assholes and rip you to pieces. Should have seen that coming in retrospect.\n\nKing Midas: So you get into reddit and try to quit drinking. You receive your first Gold and now your really hooked but it doesn't hold you forever. No matter how much approval you get, all you want is one more drop. So you start drinking again and you meet this guy at Kroger who says he knows how to get gold. You follow him into the back alley and suddenly he shows you his golden touch. You spend all night in a Tent City with some particularly rowdy hobos named Mike and the boys and they perform \"The Soup Kitchen\" on you in your sleep.\n\nKnight Solaire: Good job on smoking opium with that wizard kid from Gamestop. You have been transported to the world of Dark Souls. Lets be honest, you kind of belong here. Afterall, I've been bringing you back for a while now and you keep going hollow so maybe its for the best. You get stuck on Ornstein and Smough after losing your internet connection for not paying your bills.\n\nLiam Neeson: You've been Taken in another bid of human trafficking after an all nighter with Charlie Sheen and the Hungry Hungry Hippos porno squad. Sheen needed to pay off some debt and accidentally sold you to some Albanian drug lords. Liam Neeson hunts you down and saves your life! In a bid to bond closer, you and Liam watch awkward videos on youtube. He chuckles at a kitten running into a wall but says Llama's with Hats is retarded. You die of embarrassment. \n\nHercules: After a long night of drinking (really, booze again?) you find yourself tied to Jason. Hercules sits in a corner \"Soooo...\" he starts with a clearly slurred speech \"you wanna say that about my *hic* mom again *hic*?\" Screaming \"I was just joking Herc, really just playing around\" does you no good as Hercules uses all of his strength to crush you and Jason together until you are no more than two grapes squashed together. \"Your mother tis\" indeed.\n\nGolem: Congratulations! You have just purchased a 19th century Golem! Please enjoy your Gollum responsibly. After an entire night of drinking and getting stoned, you put your flawless *ahem* plan into motion. You order your brand new Golem to attack your noisy neighbors. Golems don't commit sin, so instead he decides to rearrange your anatomy! Congratulations! You are now capable of kissing your own ass!\n\nAmaterasu: You've spent the night partying in Japan only to be kidnapped by the Triads. You're not the person they claim you are, and so you pray to Amaterasu to come and save you. Amaterasu appears and fights off the evil spirits (yes, they are spirits now. Welcome to morphine induced hallucinations) and throws their bodies in the sea! You pass out only to wake up in a Russian prison camp... its time for that intervention Timmy!\n\nBeowulf: You're the life of the party at High Hrothgar! Ever man wants to be you and ever women wants to be in you! You've never drank mead before, but that honey nectar is giving you all the right moves. Grendal attacks out of nowhere and uses you as a hammer to kill other Hrothgardians. When finished, he squeezes the blood out of you like a bum wringing out his undies. You gain +10 personality points!\n\nExcalibur: You've henceforth gained the perk to use walking sticks and umbrellas as deadly weapons. +5 survival skill, +1 Masturbating. King Arthur is very angry after you started swinging chairs at the roundtable. What really pissed him off is you rubbing against Lancelot and helicocktering on the throne. You spend two weeks in the stocks.\n\nChupacabra: You've decided to visit the magical land of Columbia! After ingesting far to much cocaine (in the form of brown brown no less), you run into the forest and get lost about 2.3 miles in. You sense you are not alone and find the legendary beast, the Chupacabra, breathing on your neck behind you. You can run fast, but the beast is faster. You have now lost large pieces of your gluteus maximus. You bleed to death in a cave.\n\nMedusa: What a fine thing that demigod is. I'd like to...oh yes, of course. You've been drinking wine with Zeus's wife Hera and she introduces you to the Gorgon! First things are all good, but slowly you notice she wont look you in the eyes. Your very confident so you serenade the beauty to look at you. She does and turns you into stone. A smirk grows across her amused face as she laughs and takes your wallet. \n\nDeath: You've finally worked your way up to the real VIP on the party list. After a night at the Playboy mansion (Ole Man Reaper was there visiting Heff, just like every night) you and Death are whisked away into the night by Mark Zuckerberg. Apparently Death hasn't been doing the job Mark pays him to do so now he's in real trouble. Mark wants a donkey show and you're just drunk enough to oblige. In the morning, you'll need to repair your \"Pants of Delusion\".\n\nGenie: You found a magical lamp at the thrift store you just drunkenly robbed. You and your friends are throwing bottles into the air, shooting them. When it comes to the lamp, you pull the trigger and its immediately clear your skills at angering great beings are as sharp as ever. The genie shoots from the lamp screaming \"3 WISHES, 3 WISHES, 3 WISHES Time to fuck you up bitches!\" You die a horrible death after being turned into a tampon.\n\nLeprechaun: You've been stoned for far too long and this jungle isn't making the paranoia go away. That's okay though, because you've just found the end of the rainbow! A Leprechaun named Romeo is waiting on a unicorn with a pot of gold. \"I've found it!\" you shriek as you run towards the now terrified unicorn. He impales you with his horn and you bleed skittles everywhere.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398183560", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 45, "controversiality": 0}

Charlotte (the dog) has always had an absurd hatred for my cousin and will run to the safest place she can find whenever he comes over, she seems to have a preference for cowering under the sink. Conveniently however, we were having a bit of plumbing done that day, so under the sink wasn't an option.     \nSo cousin comes over, greetings are made and he comes through to the living room where Charlie is lying relaxed by the fire doing dog stuff.     \n*Her tail flicks*.     \nSuddenly Charlotte bolts up, stops dead and stares at cousin, all I could see in her eyes was a mix of pure hatred and fear, perhaps some twisted arousal as well.     \nCharlotte ran out of the room as if the devil itself were chasing after, straight past the sink and the startled looking plumber rubbing his head.      \nThe last we saw of Charlie that day was her tail disappearing round a corner out the back door.      \n12 hours later, at 2AM, I got a call from a sweet old lady who lived in a delightful country cottage 40 miles away telling me where my dog was.     \nWhen I got there, after sending the cousin home, there was the sweet old lady holding my dog, I reached to grab the lead but the sweet little octogenarian wouldn't move in to give her to me.     \nI asked her why and she mumbled something under her breath about a reward. I thought, 'well she's been so lovely it can't hurt' and asked, \"How much?\"     \nTo which she replied \"I want tree fiddy\" i then realised that the sweet old lady was not an old lady at all, but a 30 story tall monster from the palaeolithic era.

The sides are a different issue at the Nessie, where as you say, the supporters section could be multiple sections wide and people at the sides might have trouble picking up on things.  \n\nI guess my point is down to the idea that in a large supporters' section, we will not learn songs mid-match.  However, if it is a song some of the group has sung before and the song is to a recognizable tune, even casual fans at the fringes of the section should be able to recognize the tune and look at the words on the sheet of paper they were given and sing along if they want to.  Trying to pick up the words of a song in a large, distracted crowd is hopeless, megaphone or not.

Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, he said, \"What?\" Without looking at him she said, \"Put it in slowly.\" I couldn't believe it. I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock. She said she was serious, she was looking to fuck tonight and she didn't care anymore. I told her I was a virgin too and she said good.

{"body": "Back in medical school, I was rotating through Gynecology and during my first day in clinic, I was supposed to do history and physicals of all the patients and report to the attending doctor. \n\nNow I absolutely dreaded clinic because most patients were old or rude and the physical was hell. \n\nHowever, there was one incident in particular that was different, and that experience is forever etched in my brain. \n\nI knock the door and she says, \"come in\". Her voice was soft like butter and oh so feminine. I enter the room to find the most absolutely stunning lady, probably in her late thirties. She had long silky black hair, deep red lips that were so kissable, and her eyes were big pools of hazelnut. \n\nAs soon as I enter, she bats her long dark lashes and gives me a wink. Usually the patients would be changed before I enter the room, but she was sitting on the examining table in sexy business attire complete with a short skirt and her long tanned legs crossed in front of me. \n\nI quickly sat down to conceal my growing erection. As I asked her about her history, I was entranced by her feminine tonality and the speed at which she sang. Finally, I knew the moment was here. \"Maam, I'm going to have to do a physical exam, can I please have you change into your undergarments while I leave you for a second?\" \n\nI will never forget what happens next. She giggles like a teenager and says \"There is no need to leave\", and proceeds to slowly strip her clothes in front of me. My jaws dropped, and after what seemed like an eternity, I was suddenly awakened by a loud knock on the door. Before I could react, my attending marches in, stares at the woman stripping in front of me, turns and stares at me, and the stares back at the patient. \n\n\"SILLYWABBIT1, MY OFFICE, NOW\" She shouts before storming out of the room. I give an apologetic smile to the patient and meekly follow my attending to her office, trying not to have a heart attack.\n\nI almost pissed my pants. Before I could talk, however, the attending closes the door and says \"well ain't that something\", before kicking off her heels and slowly unzips the back of her dress. \n\nNow my attending was an older woman, probably married and in her 40s, but by no means was she an ugly woman. She begins kissing me and whispers in my ear \"Fuck me, please\" Wowowowow. That was the only thing going through my head at this point. The two of us had amazing sex. I was surprised to find my attending had the best body ever, and the tightest vagina I'd ever felt.\n\nWhen we were done she brushed my cheek with her hand and I asked her \"So... Should we see the other patients now?\"\n\n\"In a little bit,\" she replied, \"I need one more thing though.\"\n\n\"What do you need?\" I asked. She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\" Now it was about this time that I realized my attending was 9 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That goddamn Loch Ness Monster had got me again. I stood there screaming at her as she swam away into the distance. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398211741", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 282, "controversiality": 1}

I have a brother, and he is on reddit, so Nate if you see this, you are mean. we are pretty bearable people, I ignore him, he ignores me. sometimes though, he gets... angry. when I say angry, I mean angry like a lion on its period. one of these times was when we went to vermont. I love vermont. I live in MA, and sometimes It just gets boring down here. so, we go to our other house, and we just have fun there. also, if we are lucky, out friends come up there too, and they have a boat. they take us on a lake near where we stay, and we have an amazing trip. Most of the time. 3 years ago, unfortunately, he. lost. his. shit. to this day, I don't know why. ever since we got in the car to the minute we left, he was pissed. well, luckily, our friends were there that time, and they took us boating. now, this ain't yo mama's boat. this thing is fast as shit. We went, I took the wheel [that's how nice they were] and I went to the end of the lake, turned it up to full, and flew across the lake. by now, since i am the worst driver anyone has ever known, bro is getting visibly pissed. he proceeds to throw me out of the seat, not violently, and demands that the friends take the wheel back. so, I'm offended because i thought my driving wasn't terrible, but oh well, i sit down. the friends don't want to drive anymore, alright, no more for me. Nate takes over, and keeps it at full throttle. i am giving him tips on keeping us alive, and he doesn't like it.  so, being nate, he proceeds to sparta kick me over the edge of the boat. going 40 mph. I went flying, and with the wind already knocked out of me, I couldn't get enough oxygen to hold my breath. so there I am, 6 feet underwater, nearly drowning, and I see a shadow above me. It turned out nate came back for me, to keep me from drowning. I said \"thanks. but don't do that.\" \"yeah, yeah. you give me something in return for saving your life\" \"ummm... sure, what do you need?\" \"imma neead about tree fiddy.\" It was about this time that I realized that my brother was 500 feet tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

It's an abomination entitled [The Crater Lake Monster.](http://deepasabirdbath.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/crater_lake_monster_poster_022.jpg)\n\nThe movie begins with some scientists investigating a cave near a lake in the American Midwest.  They find some cave drawings of humans fighting dinosaurs and take it as indisputable proof that humans and dinosaurs co-existed.  Shortly after that, a meteor crashes into the lake and the impact heats up a fossilized egg on the bottom (Implausible, but it's a Sci-fi movie, so I'll allow it.)  The egg eventually grows into a plesiosaur (like Nessie).  You'll notice that the cover art is a T-Rex.\n\nThe main characters in this film are two good-ol-boys, who's names I have forgotten, so I'll just call them Cletus and Jim-Bob.  They own a boat-rental business on the lake.  In the morning, they rent a rowboat to this guy, and all seems well.  Cletus and Jim-Bob discuss the upcoming ho-down, and Jim-Bob admits that he wants to ask a special girl.  Neither the ho-down nor the girl are mentioned ever again.\n\nWe go back into the middle of the lake.  It's night, and there's ominous music.  Shit is about to go down.  The guy sees rippling in the water, and looks around.  Nothing.  Suddenly, he is knocked out of the boat and falls into the water.  After some screaming and struggling, he is dino-food.  We cut back to Cletus and Jim-Bob in the daytime.  It's about four pm and they're discussing how the guy has been out on the lake all day.  IT'S THE SAME DAY.  The boat drifts back to shore, filled with blood.  Like at least four inches of blood on the bottom.  Never mind the fact that the dude was killed IN THE WATER.  They call the sheriff.\n\nWe cut to a different character.  A man is in a hotel room cleaning a gun.  We'll get more of him later.\n\nCletus and Jim-Bob get into an argument on the lakeshore.  It escalates to fisticuffs and they both fall into the lake.  They discover the head of the eaten individual nowhere near where they found the boat.  The sheriff shows up and Cletus and Jim-Bob get out of the water, completely dry.\n\nI could go on, but is there any point?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398227617", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Oh geez, here we go.\n\nSo I live in South Korea, and I was at a bar the other night. So I was just chilling with my friend Chris when some girl approaches us. She was completely stunning! 9/10 body, and the perfect face for an Asian girl. She starts talking to us, asking the usual questions, where are we from, why are we in South Korea, etc...\n\nI kindly offer her a drink as she seems fun, but Chris seems more focused on getting into her pants. So I buy her a drink, and Chris buys us some shots. We're having a good time and are throwing back the shots of tequila like there is no tomorrow. She asks us if we want to play a game of pool, so we both say sure. She giggled at us and said \"only one of you can play at a time, but whoever beats me might be a lucky surprise!\"\n\nChris eagerly stood up and said \"me first!\" So he starts playing her at pool (billiards). He pots a few balls, she pots a few balls and before you know it they're down to the black. Now Chris is a pretty good pool player (billiards to others), but this girl was pretty amazing. It's her turn and she takes the most amazing shot I've ever seen. The black ball rattles in the pocket, then suddenly drops. \"Hahah, sorry Chris you lost\" she says. Then she looks at me, \"it's your turn!\" Chris grits his teeth and sits down angrily. \n\nI step up and take the cue from his hands. I break and pot 2 balls instantly, both stripes. \"I guess I'm stripes then!\" I giggled. Now normally I'm not so great at pool, but that nightt may be I had just drunk enough alcohol to utilize my inner powers. I managed to pot one ball, then another, then another, before I knew it I was on the black and I hadn't given her a turn. \"Wow, are you trying to hustle me?\" she questioned. \"Beginners luck\" I say as I pot the black ball. \n\n\"So what's my surprise?\" I teased her with a big grin on my teeth. She grabbed my hand and whispered into my ear \"follow me!\" So I followed her towards the bathroom, where I started to feel more excited with every step she guided me.\n\nWe go into the bathroom and she locked the door, she started putting her hand on my belt buckle and leaning towards me. She gaves me a kiss on the lips and then the neck, biting ever so softly. She pushed me onto the sink and I learned on it. Then suddenly she grabbed my balls through my trousers. I whimpered \"ouch! stop! Why?!\" She giggled! I shouted \"I'm not joking!\" trying to push her off. She fought my pushes and started squeezing harder and harder! I continued to shout \"Stop! what do you want! please stop!!\" She moved closer and whispered \"I need about tree fidy.\" At this point I realized that the girl was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era! I shouted back \"God dammit Nessie! I ain't given you no god damn tree fiddy!\" At that point I had, had enough. I pushed her aside, ran out the bathroom and left without saying a word to Chris.\n\nTLDR; Got freaky in the bathroom", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398227675", "subreddit": "dogecoin", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I maintained a steady thrust into the throbbing womanhood of this now brainless woman, while doing a 180 degree turn with my hips - driving the scalpel into the female aides' lung (I'm a doctor, trust me on this). When the male aide attempted to stop me from fulfilling my deeply rooted and twisted sexual fantasy, I bashed his skull in with the business end of the Beretta 92FS handgun that I always carry on me (Because why the fuck not, right?). Then I popped a cap into this brainless cunt's left tit, shot the security guard at the door and splooged all over the mangled corpse.\nI took one last look at my handiwork before I turned my temple to kiss the pistol.\n\nThe brainless cunt's corpse was so disheveled that it had an uncanny resemblance to a golden retriever after being ran over by an 18-wheeler. I stood there, basking in the afterglow of the most beautiful orgasm I have ever achieved.\n\nIt was time now, I pressed the gun against my temple - walked out the door, but before I could make outside to create a piece of modern art on the wall with my brains; a homeless man approached me - he asked me: hey man, you got tree fiddy?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398234542", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not even posting on my throwaway because fuck it, I didn't do anything wrong here.  Not a story I've told a lot of people because I don't consider it worth mentioning.\n\nI was working fast food at about 19 years old.  I was putting myself through college on my pittance of a wage.  This story is sort of \"par for the course\" where I worked. \n\nWorked with a woman who wanted me real bad.  She was married to one of the managers.  They had a kid.  Her marriage was in shambles because they were both really dumb and made everything about trying to get the better end of the deal in the relationship.  She told me that she wanted me and said she'd pay for a room at the hotel down the street one night after work if I wanted.  I told her that I wasn't going to do that because I'm not interested and she was married.  She came in a week later and told me she filed for divorce and that we can go have sex now.  I told her I'm still not interested.\n\nA few days later, her stupid friend at work starts hitting on me, too.  Also offers a hotel for the night.  Offers to talk to other woman into a threesome.  She's also married, has two kids.  Her husband is very controlling but she seems happy in her marriage.  The first woman gets pissed at the second one for flirting with me.  Over the next week or so, they are both vying for my attention and affection.  Flirting with me, grabbing my crotch, flashing me... making ridiculous offers of going out to do things and saying they'll buy me stuff.  I mean, seeing boobs is always awesome, but I was legitimately scared that one of them was going to snap and go stalker on me.  I had to start driving roundabout ways home because one actually said she's been trying to follow me home but I drive too fast.  I couldn't go to the management about it because all they'd have to do is say I've been harassing them.  Two versions of the story against one.  Let alone the fact that one of them was still technically married to one of the managers. \n\nA few days later, the first woman quits.  Then, a week later, the second woman quits.  Two weeks later they come in to get a bite to eat and announce to everyone that they're both divorced and they decided they are in love with each other, and they want to start a new life together.  That was the last I heard of them.  No regrets about turning them down because I'm happy I don't have a story about sticking my dick in crazy to share.\n\n__TL:DR;__ Two married women fight over me, I turn them both down, they hook up.

He had to go to this guy's place, knock on the door three times, and wait on the porch until someone answered. After about thirty minutes, the door opened and the dealer was holding a brown bag wrapped in rubber bands. He asked the dealer try it before he bought it. \"That shit was sketchy, and I could have sworn it wasn't heroin when I tried it,\" he told me. He decided to buy it anyway. The rest of the story is probably better in his words (not verbatim, this was awhile ago but it's the gist of the story): \n\n\"So I'm sitting there, feeling barely anything with this shit tar. I looked at the guy and asked how much, to which he replied 'How much are you willing to pay for it?'

{"body": "Here you go, feel free to copy and paste it and unleash it upon unsuspecting redditors.\n\n&gt; Story time! Gather 'round.  \nI was at this bar, right? Good ratio of girls to guys tonight. I wasn't drinking that night because I was dd which was nice for a change. I walked up on these two girls who were obviously together, and we hit it off. They were definitely the hottest girls in the room. They told me they wanted me to go join them at the apartment they apparently shared, and I couldn't believe it. \"I'm going to get a threesome with these hot bitches? Sweet!\"  \nNext thing I know, I'm in the back seat of their car. One of them is driving, and I'm making out with the other. She tells me to lay down, and she starts sucking my dick. Next thing I know, she pulls my Dick out of her mouth and slams her fist into my balls.  \nI scream out in pain as the girl says \"Did you like that?\" I wanted to say \"no,\" but the only thing I could say was \"Ah! Fuck!\" Apparently, she took that as a \"yes,\" and SHE DID IT AGAIN! What was I supposed to do? I was in a moving car! I was scared that a third round was coming for me any minute. I rolled over and fell into the space between the back seat and the front seat as I contemplated my escape.  \nThe girl flipped me back over, and she was naked. She climbed on top of me, and my dick couldn't help but harden up (fuck college hormones). She slid a condom on me, and she just started fucking. I didn't know if I was being raped or if this was going to be one of those stories that always ends with \"that was a wild night.\" Apparently, I decided to just go with it and fuck her. It was amazing sex, but my balls still hurt too bad for me to come.  \nWe get to their apartment, and I'm thinking \"After that performance, I don't know if I should race then to bed or run for my life.\" They convince me to follow them to their place, and the next thing I know, I've got four beautiful boobs pressed against my face. It was amazing. Then I felt my hands going behind my back. I felt rope being tied around them. \"Oh shit. Now what?\"  \nThe girl I fucked in the car goes to the other room, and the other (hotter) one slips on my still-rubbered dick. \"Maybe this will be fun.\" I don't remember ever seeing the other girl come back around (probably because the boobs in my face were far too enticing for me to see anything else), but I sure felt it when she falcon punched my nuts. Good God, not again!  \nI wanted to run away, but with my arms tied I couldn't get up. The girl on top of me was still riding my dick, but it was rather hard to enjoy. Then, another uppercut to my little friends. My God, how much it hurt. I'm not even sure if this girl on top of me realized what was going on. I started kissing her hoping that it would distract me enough to enjoy this sex.  \nNot when a third one hit. I went soft (which I can't believe didn't happen sooner), and the girl quit riding me. She turned around and saw what her friend had been doing. I remember her saying something along the lines of \"I told you not to do that anymore!\". She replied \"I'll stop when I get my money.\" Puzzled, I said out loud \"What money?\".  \nShe quickly replied \"I need about three fiddy\". It was around this time I realized that those two were not girls at all. It was an 8 stories tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned loch ness monster had gotten me again! I said, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy\"  \nTLDR: My poor, poor balls", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398294774", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, I want someone to make me an app/game for my phone that combines my camera, augmented reality, and motherfuckin pokemon snap. I'm thinkin of somethin sorta like geocaching, where the participant travels to a particular location in the world to seek out physical containers n whatnot, but instead of doing that, the participant will travel to a particular location to try to take a photo of a pokemon that will appear there, augmented into the environment. While viewing the location through the camera, the HUD could have some helpful indications to help you pinpoint the exact location of the pokemon you're looking for in that particular area (like a simple cold/warm/hot meter perhaps). \n\nAt its most basic, the augmented pokemon could just be a static image that appears in the environment and that'd be pretty cool (most of the fun would just be travelling to the locations themselves and trying to find the pokemon), but it'd be badass if the augmented pokemon was 3d animated and was aware of its environment via AI programmed specifically for that location plus any external sensory input from hardware that might be installed at that location (microphones, thermostats, photosensors, etc). This would allow the pokemon to have their own interesting behaviors and varying degrees of difficulty in photographing that are unique to each location.\n\nFor instance, the Pikachu that can be found in front of the Starbucks at Pike Place could be easy to photograph because its AI is programmed so that it's always just chillin there during business hours, but the Rattata that can be found at the Dairy Queen on North Ave. could be notoriously difficult to photograph because its AI is programmed so that it only crawls out from under the dumpster by the drive-thru whenever you order a medium butterfinger blast on a Tuesday while the moon is at its waning gibbous phase and the temperature is above 80 degrees. Or the Articuno that can be found on top of the ski lift at Powder Mountain can be programmed so that it only flys out and perches on the lift whenever it's currently snowing. Or the Ninetales at Fenway Park will appear whenever a home run gets hit etc. etc. whatever you get the idea.\n\nImages would be (optionally) shared with the community through the app and/or the various social media apps. Such an app/community would probably have its own subreddit (/r/PokemonSnapIRL or whatever) where images will be posted and tips/guides for locating and photographing certain pokemon will be shared.\n\nStats should be available with all types of information available (who photographed what, number of pokemon photographed that week, most popular photo, rarest pokemon photographed that month, most popular location that week, etc). Challenges or achievements could be created (photograph 5 pokemon within a day, photograph two pokemon within the same week that are located 500 miles from one another, etc). Groups/meetups can be formed within the community (just out of common interest and/or perhaps a particular pokemon can only be photographed if there's 5 or more participants in the area, like a WoW raid or something).\n\nI'm not sure what technologies would be required to make such an app possible, or how the community/player base should be organized, or what tools participants would need to be able to create these location-aware pokemon, place them in the environment, and publish them to be shared with the community, but if someone can figure out a way to pull it off I'll fund the shit out of it (up to an amount that would be fiscally responsible for me at least, so probably tree fiddy).\n\n**TLDR:** pokemon snap + geocaching + instagram + augmented reality + other details = cool shit", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398300377", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 37, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; a) what you believe \n\nLots of things, possibly many of the same things you believe...I just don't believe in any deities.\n\n&gt; b) why you believe it \n\nI am an atheist because I have found the claims and arguments of theists unconvincing.\n\n\n&gt; c)why I should believe it.\n\nIf you believe there is a god, what is your single best reason why you believe?\n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398307360", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Based on current needs, I am typing with a touch screen. Mistakes will be made. I will also not be able to quote for this week.\n\nGot a keyboard now. Here we go.\n\n&gt; If you think that you are talking to a monkey, you will speak differently.\n\n1) Good thing that I'm not a talking monky, just descended from common ancestors as chimpanzees. Science is not a fairy tale. It won't tell you what you want to hear, only the truth as we understand it.\n\n&gt; OK. But if some build their points of view as if what is beyond is according to their wishes, then there is the problem.\n\n2) What do you mean? \"beyond is according to their wishes\"? That would be religion, not science. Scientists have to be given a good reason to invest itself in any point of view.\n\n&gt; Religion also uses observation, maybe not as a blind faith.\n\n3) Explain the observations that religion uses.\n\n&gt; This is natural. Since the God is the God of all.\n\n4) No. This is not acceptable. Give me a concise definition.\n\n&gt; Do not you? What were the deterministic ways which resulted in this universe?\n\n5) I don't believe in a deterministic universe. I have seen no evidence either way that the universe is deterministic or if free will exists. This is *different* from a random and arbitrary universe.\n\n&gt; For a new one? What is your basis to expect a theory?\n\n6) Fuck you. \"What is your basis to expect a theory?\"??? You really are just grasping at straws here.\nI later said that this quote follows the guidelines of a troll.\n\n&gt; You mean yours as well? Nice to hear that.\n\n7) I can neither prove nor disprove a deistic god that refuses to interact with its creation. We have no proof to point to an interactive god, only away from. Also, just because we can not disprove something, does not mean we have to accept that \"something\" as a fact, or even a reasonable and logical explanation. The Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, and the Flying Spaghetti Monster can not be 100% disproven (due to reasoning like \"It's just hiding. Keep looking!), however I do not think any of these things are real, because I have seen no evidence for it.\n\n&gt; For example that scientists will be doing similar tests the next hour.\n\n8) I have a feeling you were trying to make a point and forgot to type half of what you were saying.\n\n&gt; So if the engine moves a car, thus making the car moving, then you will assign the moving ability to the body of the car and will you say that the engine is superfluous?\n\n9) Cars don't move without engines. Cars *can't* move without an engine. The universe is *not* a car. However, we have found the laws (at least a lot of them) that govern the formation of stars, galaxies, etc. I have said before that some things will seem arbitrary. \"Why does green look green, and not blue or red? Why do I interpret green one way, but not another way?\" We can show the wavelengths that determine what \"color\" light is, and how our brains see and interpret that light. However, why green \"looks\" a certain way in our heads seems to be arbitrary. Similarly, why the red wavelength is red and not green is similarly arbitrary.\nBut simply, if we have an explanation for something, and it is entirely satisfactory by the scientific community, someone coming by and saying, \"But the *engine* only runs because my little brother Jimmy *lets* the cars go!*, *is* superfluous. *That* addendum is not needed, nor does it improve our understanding of how the car works.\n\nThe problem is this. You believe that once created the matter can behave by itself.\n\n10) *I* don't believe in a deistic god. But that argument works reversed as well. *You* believe that an all-powerful god can not create a stand-alone universe.\n\n&gt; Do you have a reason for that? Why would not He give attributes to things and make them happen?\n\n11) If a god changes anything happening in the universe, then the universe is not functioning normally.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398322173", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I wrote this the week after Scotland and this post inspired me to reread it. It's maybe a little self-indulgent to post it, but I think it does our story more justice than the summary did. And hey, look at me using my Bachelor of Arts to do something! \n\n\"You smiled when I chose the seat next to you; I, of course, chose the boy who would be most likely to let me sleep on his shoulder and offer to carry my bag (though I'd never accept, stubborn thing that I am). By the end of the first day, you asked if I had enough cough lollies and ran with me through the rain, laughing as we tried to find the liquor store in this backwards little Scottish town. You sat patiently while I did my hair, and then when I had to do it again after the rain. You extended your hand to me at the ceilidh and pulled me up: \"No, whinger, you're going to dance too.\"\n\nThe second day, you let me have the window and hovered nearby so that I could share your body heat without us actually touching; I was so sick. You woke me up when the bus stopped, and smirked \"we're going to see another monument. Get up, Canadian.\" You continued to smile as I grumbled my way up the cliffside, only to turn me around at the top and point out what was opposite the monument: the Harry Potter bridge, which you knew I'd want to see. I lost my voice and you did all the talking so that I wouldn't have to - you hovered just inside my personal space bubble at the highland demonstration because it's too, too cold and my hands feel like ice between yours. My bag needed to be rescued from a huge pile of them at the hostel, and for once I let you. We had dinner at the last table left, meant for two, and when I put myself to bed early you made sure to get all the gossip for me to tell me the next day on the bus (and later, you tell me that you asked \"what do you mean?\" when they asked where your girl was.)\n\nThe third day, we wander the new town and find dinner together. I laugh at your casual \"g'day\" to the server, and you start counting the 'eh's. We stop to bring back drinks, and eat on a couch with your arm around me, thigh-to-thigh. We think up this clever game, to trick the others. Our guide has been going on about DSL for days now. Deep Scottish Love. He tells us that people fall in love, and even get married after this tour. The others look expectantly to us, and so we're sure that it will be a pretty good time to let them believe. At first my hand feels like a weight on your shoulder, but we keep drinking and then it feels right with your arm around my waist, tucked into your side. We congratulate ourselves with sly looks whenever someone points to the two of us and makes an excited face or draws a heart in the air with their hands. We are so very clever. One am finds most everyone going to sleep, as the music ends. Two am finds a private party with an accordion, and all of us screaming the lyrics to Don't Stop Believing. Three am, we're dispersing and one girl is off to find Nessie, in the middle of the night. You walk me to my room, and we end up sitting in a hallway alcove. We are still touching; commenting on how no one is here to see the game, but it's hard to stop. I get distracted by how blue your eyes are, and tell you so... you lean in and kiss me. Game over.\n\nI worry that we won't know how to act, because it would be so easy for you to be weird. You've changed places on the bus, but you're still holding the seat for me. Someone else took our normal spot. I tell you that I'm exhausted - I got locked out of my room and had to figure out a way in - but that I regret nothing. You light up and tell me that you're glad. On the way there you sling an arm around me and pull me in close, and I wonder if people know that the game has ended and that it ever was a game. We go shopping on our lunch break and you don't complain at all, you just slip your hand inside mine and hold your umbrella over both of us. We stop at a beach later in the afternoon, and you take my picture on the rocks before lifting me up and kissing me, not caring that the others are all a hundred metres away, plainly giving us our space. That night we stay in a castle, and you and I roam the halls with the ghosts finding secret places and placing secrets of our own. \n\nBack in Edinburgh, we check into the same hostel and you lie down beside me in my bed. When I fall asleep, you stay to keep me warm. You never do leave. You buy a train ticket back to London the morning that I fly to Berlin, and then afterwards you beat yourself up when we figure out that you could have come with me. I play mad at you, and you believe me. You ask \"is there room for one more?\" when I crawl into bed, exhausted and attached to you and not ready to leave us behind, because you somehow think you've ruined this. You get up with me on that last morning, at 4:30 when I need to leave for the airport, and you follow me into the hallway. \"Come to Australia,\" you whisper. That whisper stays with me, and the idea has to keep me warm while I wander the streets of Berlin alone. \n\nHere's what I want to tell you, and it occurred to me one day with my legs splayed across yours and my head nestled against your chest. It strikes me as funny how anything can become a love story. You can go from shaking someone's hand to watching him trace the beauty marks on your cheek (\"I love the triangle,\" you say, drawing one finger over them first one way and then the other) with no effort at all.

{"body": "Here you go- 2 quickies that took me a whole minute to find.  Unfortunately, most of these debates center around a God discussion, but we need not go there.\n\nTHe following is a quote:\n\nOf course, those who say “You can’t prove a negative” will insist that I have misunderstood their point. As Hales notes, when people say, “You can’t prove a negative,” what they really mean is that you cannot prove that something does not exist. If this point were correct, it would apply not just to supernatural beings lying beyond the cosmic veil but also to things that might be supposed to exist on this side of the veil, such as unicorns, Martians, rabbits with twenty heads, and so on. We would not be able to prove the nonexistence of any of these things either.\n\nBut is the point correct? Is it true that we can never prove that something does not exist? Again, it depends. If John claims there’s a unicorn in the tool shed, I can quickly establish he is mistaken by going and taking a look. We could similarly establish there’s no Loch Ness monster by draining the loch. But what of the claim that unicorns once existed? We can’t travel back in time and directly observe all of the past as we can every corner of the tool shed or Loch Ness. Does it follow that we can’t prove unicorns never existed?\n\nIt depends in part on what you mean by “prove.” The word has a variety of meanings. By saying something is “proved,” I might mean that it is established beyond all possible doubt. Or I might mean it has been established beyond reasonable doubt (this is the kind of proof required in a court of law). Can we establish beyond reasonable doubt that unicorns have never inhabited the earth? True, the history of our planet has been and gone, so we can no longer directly inspect it. But surely, if unicorns did roam the earth, we would expect to find some evidence of their presence, such as fossils of unicorns or at least of closely related animals from which unicorns might plausibly have evolved. There is none. We also have plenty of evidence that unicorns are a fictional creation, in which case, it’s surely reasonable for us to conclude that there never were any unicorns. Indeed, I’d suggest we can prove this beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nIn response, it might be said “But you can’t prove conclusively, beyond all possible doubt, that unicorns never roamed the earth.” This is undeniably true. However, this point is not peculiar to negatives. It can be made about any claim about the unobserved, and thus any scientific theory at all, including scientific theories about what does exist. We can prove beyond reasonable doubt that dinosaurs existed, but not beyond all possible doubt.   [this guy](http://stephenlaw.blogspot.com/2011/09/you-cant-prove-negative.html)\n\n[More here](http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/146-proving-non-existence)\nPROVING NON-EXISTENCE\nDescription: Demanding that one proves the non-existence of something in place for providing adequate evidence for the existence of that something.  Although it may be possible to prove non-existence in special situations, such as showing that a container does not contain certain items, one cannot prove universal or absolute non-existence.  The proof of existence must come from those who make the claims.\n\nLogical Form:\n\nI cannot prove that X exists, so you prove that it doesn’t.\nIf you can’t, X exists.\nExample #1:\n\nGod exists.  Until you can prove otherwise I will continue to believe that he does.\nExplanation: There are decent reasons to believe in the existence of God, but, “because the existence of God cannot be disproven”, is not one of them.\n\nExample #2:\n\nSheila: I know Elvis’ ghost is visiting me in my dreams.\nRon: Yeah, I don’t think that really is his ghost.\nSheila: Prove that it’s not!\nExplanation: Once again we are dealing with confusion of probability and possibility.  The inability to, “prove”, in any sense of the word, that the ghost of Elvis is not visiting Sheila in her dreams is an impossible request because there is no test that proves the existence and presence of a ghost, so no way to prove the negative or the non-existence.  It is up to Sheila to provide proof of this claim, or at least acknowledge that actually being visited by Elvis’ ghost is just a possibility, no matter how slim that possibility is.\n\nException: If Ron was to say, “That is impossible”, “there is no way you are being visited”, or make some other claim that rules out any possibility no matter how remote (or crazy), then Sheila would be in the right to ask him for proof -- as long as she is making a point that he cannot know that for certain, and not actually expecting him to produce proof.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398373690", "subreddit": "scifi", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;When I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\n\n&gt;One day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\n\n&gt;I could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\" I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies? I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\n\n&gt;I went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy. The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free. So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.\n\n&gt;That was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence. I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\n\n&gt;Nope.\n\n&gt;I got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"\n\n&gt;This is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too. He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.\n\n&gt;The next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\n\n&gt;This goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars. Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\n\n&gt;Fast forward one year. I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.\n\n&gt;He solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\n\n&gt;Shit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\n\n&gt;I'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.\n\n&gt;We started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\n&gt;\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\n&gt;\"What?\" I asked. He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again! I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\n&gt;So yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst here. But I haven't eaten smarties since then, that's for sure.\n\n&gt;**TL;DR: Kid wants drugs, I give him some, sort of.**\n\n\ncompliments to /u/Thehealeroftri", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398380442", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I guess this is my thread. When I was thirteen,  I had a rich best friend. His father was an investment banker, and his mom was some young hot piece of ass that you knew didn't do anything. That summer my best friend invited me to a weekend at their lake house. Of course I jumped at the opportunity to hang out at the lake, and look at his hot mom sun bathing. That Saturday we all went to the beach, or lakefront or whatever. We were all having fun playing around in the sun and water. I went inside to use the bathroom, and I saw my friend's mom sitting on the couch. She asked me to sit down next to her. Of course I did, how could I not? She had an amazing body and I wanted to be close to her. We small talked for a bit, and out of nowhere, she said, \"I know you want me Robertmeowneyjr\". I froze, unable to say anything. She smiled a coy, sexy smile, and reached over and started rubbing my shorts. She slowly undid the string, reached in, and in no time I was erect and in her hand. I couldn't believe it! My friend's super hot mom was holding me in her hand! It was the kind of stuff I dreamt about, and did other stuff too, if you know what I mean. She slid my shorts down while stroking me, and she put her mouth on me. It felt so good... It was a fantasy come true. I just sat there, enjoying her pleasuring me with her hand and mouth, looking down her bathing suit top, admiring her perfect breasts. I wish I could say I lasted forever like a porn star, but I only lasted a few minutes. The orgasm was amazing. And she swallowed!!!  She looked up, smiled that coy smile, and told me, \"Robertmeowneyjr, you must do something for me\". I weakly responded, \"Sure, what do you need?\" She looked me dead in the eye and said, \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was at that point that I realized that she was seven stories tall, and a creature from the  paleolithic era. I shouted, \"God dammit Loch Ness monster I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I'll never forget that summer, I wonder how she is doing now?\ntl:dr; Got blow job from friends hot mom", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398388288", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

But I put about as much thought into that as I do about the existence of leprechauns, unicorns, bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n&gt;To pose my second question, do Atheist believe that there is no governing principles over reality?\n\nWe do. It is called physics.\n\n&gt;And finally my third question, if the Atheists are truly correct, what motivates the human person to perform good actions?\n\nWe evolved that way as a means to ensure our genes are carried on. Even if you don't think of it in terms of an evolutionary advantage (IE- the development of empathy), then it should just be common sense that when we are nice to each other then life is better for us all.\n\nOne reason we had to develop traits like empathy as an evolutionary tool is because we simply do not reproduce at the same rate as some animals which can lay hundreds or thousands of eggs. These are species that have to worry about many predators. Humans, on the other hand, used our larger brains to avoid predators in contrast to animals that produce so much offspring that losing 70% of that offspring was no big deal.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398398174", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The gun was a grey rectangular block with a inlet on the end. \n\n   I would pretend I was a homeless and every time I spawned I would get the gun that was in an alley and hide there waiting for some unsuspecting person. Anytime someone walked in the alley I would type in caps \" Aye were you going?\" \"You got me duckets?\"\nand the other player would either ignore me or say something along the lines of \"No\" or \"lolwut\" I would than procede to pull out my gun and go \"I would Like about tree fiddy\" and blast them. I was nicked named in the server \"Some kid with a gun\"\n\nThe players who were lucky enough to spawn as cops would try to arrest me as I started a rampage in the small city blasting anyone near by. When I finally got arrested and teleported to jail (with a tool they were given) I would always get freed by a crooked cop.\n\nSoon the citizens of the small city got smart and found where the gun spawned, so they teamed up against me. They tried to hunt me down as soon as they saw me. I managed to get to the police station (it's located in the middle of the city no big deal) and climbed to the roof where I made my final stand. I proceed to shoot anyone in my view while typing furiously Scarface lines and say I have no regrets and is willing to take everyone down with me.

{"body": "There's a long(ish) story ahead, so prepare yourself (I promise, the words \"tree fiddy\" are no where in here).\n\nAbout 8 or so years ago I was living in Phoenix. I took the bus to work, which was about 2 hours worth of morning commute. So it's 5:15am, and I'm standing there when the bus pulls up. The doors open, and like an internal trigger, the rumbly in my tumbly hit. It was like a bag of Quikrete dropped from the top of my stomach to the bottom. I was faced with the choice to abandon mission and be late to work (a job which I had just started 2 weeks prior), or try and doing breathing exercises and fight it back until I made it to work. I chose the latter.\n\nSo I'm on the bus, and I'm dying. Cold sweat, and while I couldn't see myself, I knew that all of the color was gone from my face. The time came to make decisions. I either had to get off the bus and shit, solidifying that I would be late to work, or severely risk shitting my pants. I was in an area that I was totally unfamiliar with, so I couldn't make any kind of plan to go to a known shit-stop spot. I still chose to get off and go search, because I reasoned that if I shit my pants, which was seeming *highly* highly probable, I would most definitely be late to work.\n\nI get off the bus in search of my spot. Now, as I had mentioned, it was way early in the morning, so absolutely nothing was open. I couldn't walk far because by this point I was in total, all-out shit-cramps. I found a McDonald's, but it was across the street, through six lanes of traffic, and no light to cross at anywhere close. Not only was I damn near doubled over in pain, I'm also a left leg amputee, and I don't exactly move with speed. On down the road I go.\n\nI pass a church, and it seemed like there was some activity, meaning that they probably had an available bathroom. I was in a low period at this time, and couldn't imagine any church allowing my heathen, atheistic ass into their holy building, so I thought \"I'll keep this place in mind if I don't find something shortly after\", which I did. A diner. A glorious, beautiful diner...\n\n...A diner ran by assholes who absolutely refused to let anyone use the bathroom unless they were a paying customer. As I mentioned earlier, I had only been at my new job for a short amount of time and hadn't got paid yet. I literally had only a dime in my pocket, which I happily offered in exchange for the use of their facility, to which they declined. \n\nThe total elapsed time between getting off the bus and this point is somewhere between 5 and 7 minutes. In shit time, that's an eternity. I'm still surprised the bomb didn't go off. I only had one option now, and it was the church, so back I went.\n\nWhen I arrived, I still felt too embarrassed to ask the nice, early-rising church people to destroy their holy bathroom, but I had no other choice. I went to the door, which was locked. I knock, and no one answered (still no idea where those people that I saw earlier could have gone). I was doomed. I, an adult man in his early 20's, was about to shit his pants. In front of a church. \"Not like this\", I said to myself, and made my way around the back of the church. I did so slowly- almost crawling- and near throwing up from the poop pain.\n\nIn the back there is an air conditioning unit that I basically decided would be my throne. I dropped trou, and sitting on the edge of the AC unit I threw my legs up in the air, and literally shot liquid green shit in a straight line out of my ass. It went all over (luckily, all over didn't include my clothes or shoes, as I worked very hard to get my legs (one of them prosthetic) up high and arch my body at enough of an angle to avoid them). When finished, I found some palm leaves to wipe up as best as possible, which while rough as hell, actually took care of the job. Somehow when I walked back up front of the church there was a bus sitting there, on the exact same run as my original bus, and I made it to work 1 minute early.\n\nFlash forward a couple years, and some things in life have changed. I felt bad about shitting all over the church building, so I looked up that church (which I cannot remember the name of now), sent them an apology letter, and enclosed a $50 donation (or penance, whichever you prefer). Many people make fun of me for this part (including my wife), but I really felt bad for whoever had to clean it up.\n\nI'm a pastor now, and anytime someone needs to use a bathroom, even if I'm late for something, I'll always let them in to do so if I'm the last one in the building.\n\n**TL;DR** Shit outside of a church.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398483312", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was actually pulled over during an emergency a few years ago.  About 2 years ago mid-July my wife went into labor just after noon on a Saturday evening.  We were sitting peacefully in our living room of the house we just put our down payment onto.  It's pretty nice weather here in California, so I don't think it was much hotter then about 80 at the time.  Just then my wife begin complaining of cramps and kicking.  She then yells that her water just broke.  Sure enough I look over and see a wet spot on the chair she had just been sitting on.  This was our first child, so you can imagine how exited and nervous I was at the time.  So as fast as humanly possible I rushed her out of the house and into my 2006 ford explorer and took off towards the Good Samaritan hospital about 5 minutes of freeway driving away.  My mind has gone blank at this point and my only thought is to get this woman I love to the hospital to deliver my child.  So I'm booking it down the freeway as fast as I can safely drive.  In hindsight it definitely wasn't a safe speed to be driving with a woman laying down in the back.  I'm all the way in the left lane and softly talking to my wife, when I glance in my rear view mirror and see the blue flashing lights and realize the siren has been going on now for about 10 seconds.  At this point I'm totally numbed but I snap out of it in about half a second because next thing I know is I'm pulled over to the side of the road and there's an officer approaching my driver side window asking for my license and registration.  My first instinct is to try to explain to the officer what's going on, so I open my door and begin to step out without even thinking.  That was a horrible decision on my part. Instantly the officer takes a few steps back and unholsters his firearm and tells me to get back into my vehicle.  I suddenly realize I hadn't explained to him yet that the woman i love was laying in the back seat about to give birth.  I begin jabbering complete nonsense at first.  Then I slowly come to my senses and look the officer in the eye and take a deep steady breath.  I then tell him how my wife is in labor and needs medical attention immediately.  The officer puts away his firearm and slowly approaches the driver side back window.  I can hear my wife tell the officer something and as I lean in I hear \"officer please I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\". I glance into the window about the same time officer is staring and it's about that time i realize there's a 8 story tall prehistoric Loch Ness monster in the back of my car.

{"body": "One day Tom was walking downtown, as he normally does.  Today Tom was feeling particularly sad, as he had just been fired. He went into his favorite restaurant, The Inn some called it, and asked for a number 3. While his 3:00 meal was cooking, he saw a man walked through the front door. This man was wearing a old jacket and asking for change. Now Tom did not have much money to spare, as he had just been fired that day, but he felt a particular connection with this man. He waved to him to come over to his stool, and the man obliged. Tom and this man spoke for quite some time; for some reason the number 3 was taking a long time. \"...well I was just fired today, whats happened to you? Who are you?\" said Tom. The man responded, \"Well I never really had a job. I was just some freak show for people to look at. Over time I became less and less forthcoming, and people began to forget about me. I am just asking for change these days.\" Tom asked, \"Well, what is your name? Maybe I can get you some help!\" and the man responded \"Well I just go by Loch, you know like that guy on the T.V. show?\" \"Lost?\" \"yep thats the one.\" said Loch.\n\n\"Well here is all I have in my pocket, just four dollars. Sorry its all I have left\" said Tom. Loch took the money with glistening eyes and said \"Thank you so very much.\" Tom got his food and ate it, feeling proud of himself. Tom was about to leave when he noticed two quarters sitting on the stool. He picked them up and walked out the door, but there he did a double take. \"four dollars.. two quarters left....what in the world..?\" Tom muttered to himself. \"He took tree fiddy\" said Tom a little louder. It was about this time where he realized that Loch was about three stories tall and a monster. \"Loch...Loch ness.... Loch Ness Monster!!\" Tom screamed at the top of his lungs. Tom yelled  \"GOD DAMN LOCH NESS MONSTER\" as he jumped into on coming traffic.\n\n\n&lt;&gt;\n\n\n--Thanks! I hope I win!

Pizza guy said he had no more pizzas to deliver for the day, so it was cool for him to stay for a little, he would just tell his boss that there was traffic. \n\nTurned out, he was training to become a professional swimmer. He didn't have any family, he was from Scotland, I learned stuff about him, and he learned about me, it was a good time.We sat down and watched a game of soccer and we were getting worked up. The score was 3-5 and his team was losing. I had bet him that if his team won, I would pay double for the pizza. But if my team won, I wouldn't have to pay anything. So we sat there for what seemed like hours.\n\nThe time flew by, next thing we knew, the score was now 35-05. My teamed hadn't scored anymore points. But his team was on fire. We sat there, both with an intense look on our faces. My wife came in and told us why it looked like we were pooping, and who the other guy was. I told her that it was the Pizza Guy and how we had a bet. She was confused but left and decided not to ask any questions.\n\nNow the game had finally finished, and I had to pay the man double. I asked him, how much is it going to be, and he said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I realized this pizza guy was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as he swam away into the distance.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398545186", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I'll try to keep it brief(ish) but keep in mind that most of this happens over the course of a year and I will not get into names and places because no burnt bridges and all that.\n\nTL;DR - Had a really sweet gig making good money, lose my mentor, white guy takes over, shows preferential treatment, wants me to play House Nigger, realized it was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era, Loch Ness Monster, tree-fiddy...\n\nI (African-American) was working as a sales representative for a major beer company through a local distributor with territory both in an urban and suburban environment.  When I first started working there my team leader was African-American and worked as a sales rep in the urban neighborhoods prior to being a manager.  Everything was good, sales numbers were fine, no friction or issues, and the team was social with each other and the other teams.\n\nThe one of the other urban team leaders (African-American) was having issues with some of the sales managers(Caucasion).  I was the new guy at the time and wasn't in the inner circle yet so nothing within the teams was candidly spoken about with me, but when you grow up both middle/upper middle-class and in the intercity you can get a sense when things are bordering into racial territory.  That particular team leader decided to leave the company.  Since he worked a higher sales % segment of the company they moved my team leader over to that team and one of the sales managers became our teams direct team leader/manager.  This guy made his bones in the suburban areas and came up from that side of the business.\n\nSuddenly our sales goals (bonus money) started increase and being more and more unattainable.  Products that really don't work in our areas became the focus and not the strong sellers.  When promotion items/sports tickets/party events came around and were handed out our areas started getting less and less.  For those of you not familiar with alcohol, in the poor areas of a city it's about high alcohol content for as little as money as possible.  That's why you'll see the street littered with Steel Reserve 211 cans and not, say, Miller Lite.  One get's you drunk for $2 and the other you have to spend $16 to get a good buzz going.  To sell your deals to the stores and distributors you HAVE to do things like give out T-shirts, schedule promotions there, and do things for the owner.  I can't go into my distributor and convince him to give me a deal on a pallet of beer to match my competitors price if his friend in the suburbs is getting football tickets and music events at his place and I can't even get him t-shirts.\n\nSo now the sales manager wants/needs someone to blame.  He doesn't go after the guys on the team who have been there for 8-9 years (union shop) because seniority and (frankly) they aren't gonna be taking that shit.  So now he focus's his attention on the kid that's a year out of college.  Accusations of not working as hard as the suburban guys (15 year vets who have the relationships to work from home and call up orders for their customers and just show up to pick up merch and drop it off), being lazy and \"hanging out with my bros in the 'hood instead of working the owners\", and asking things like \"why are you at [St. Patrick's Day social event] talking about how much you are going to drink when you can't even push [new promotion we have] at the price we want?\"  It got to the point where I dreaded sales meetings or even interacting with him AT ALL.\n\nBeing new to the industry and losing my mentor made me really think that it was me, so we scheduled a ride-along where he would work my territory with me.  I started to see the truth of the matter when some of my better owners/customers started directing their anger right at him instead of me.  \"How come [customer] out in [suburb] is getting football tickets but I can't?  We haven't gotten any promotional items sine [team leader] left.\"  After being in my territory for a week he couldn't even match the numbers that I was already putting up and constantly got shut down.  He never brought it up again, but continued to hound me in sales meetings and talk down to me as often as possible.  And when I say \"talk down to me\" I mean say things that, while semi-professional (considering it was a union shop and cursing and insulting co-workers happened as a fun interaction all the time), would never cross his mind if he wasn't my manager and I was just some guy on the street.  \n\nMy team and I ended up skipping most of the social events, not interacting with the other teams at all, and just working and going home.  I was in the middle of getting my MBA and decided to simply remove myself from the negativity and finish my Master's and roll the dice on the employment market rather than put up with the abuse.  Last I heard things got testy in the office when the C.E.O. of the local distributor started to notice that all of the after work events, social interactions, and company functions started looking really, REALLY white and coporate was also taking notice.  Never got the skinny on the fall out but I moved on and out of the situation as opposed to deal with it.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398558001", "subreddit": "nba", "score": 75, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "On April 20th, 6900, on the planet Grypton, a mother, Sharkisha, was giving birth to a child.  She was high (it’s weed day after all) so all she was saying was “Gregory, Ooooh Gregory,”(her husbands name) while having 3 orgasms at once.  Thus was the birth of Gregory II AKA Junior. \n\nAt age 25, Junior was a talented fellow. He was very good at the fields of Language Arts, English, and Grammar. He really liked to make up stories that had no ending, Those were really fun to him. One thing Junior lacked was *fun*. He was simply boring, very *boring*. He always would correct anyone at *any* mistake. He would always but into conversations and was generally, how do I put this, **ANNOYING**. \n\nOn Junior’s birthday, 6925, The planet was collapsing in on itself, or so he thought. The entire planet, the size of russia with one nation and a few populated areas with Junior’s being the biggest, Unanimously decided to spread Juniors genes to save Gumanity.  Boarding the capsule headed to earth, Junior said his last goodbyes, but little did he know, no one will miss him as all the people that loved him had died in a tragic accident.  The planet was never gonna explode, they all just wanted to party better.  And, on a sleeping pill for 3 years and a VR, thus began Junior’s journey to earth. \n\nJunior’s destination was Raliegh, North Carolina, USA in the year 6928.  As he left the capsule, he started noticing how everyone on earth looked the same as everyone on Grypton. \n\nHe saw a women that looked pretty nice so he approached her and asked, “excuse me, ma’am, do you know where we are? i’m a traveler,”. She smiled and replied with, “We are in Raliegh, North Carolina,”. Then Junior said, “Thank you very much, wanna grab a drink sometime?” to which the women replied to, “Sure! my name is Jesse,”. “Great, my name is Gregory the second, but you can call me Junior,”. \n\nLater that night Junior and Jesse hooked up and started dating.  \n\nOn october 10th, Junior realized how much better he is than everybody else except in grammar. Everything he said also came true like, “I hope the weather is nice today,” makes the weather nice. So he started making a Costume immediately.  “Grammar man,” said Junior, “Grammar man, *YEAH*!”. \n\nOn that day Junior wore the costume, Climbed the biggest building in Raleigh North Carolina, and jumped off screaming “**FLY**,”.  Needless to say, he died.

{"body": "Oh boy I got this one. We were on a route from Detroit to San Francisco on an AA flight, and this one guy who was wearing a black shirt and cargo jeans seemed very disturbed. At first when he came on the flight we thought he had some stomach discomfort or something (do I have stories for that one), so we left him alone. As the plane started taking off he disobeyed orders from the head stewardess to not remove his seat belt and he starting making obscene gestures and even made a baby 2 rows in front of him cry, so because the other passengers were starting to get agitated we just cooed and consoled him until the seat belt light went out again and he was allowed to stand up. He started drinking whiskey he had somehow snuck up into the plane (this was before 911), and started swearing at other people around him. At many points during the flight each of the junior staff thought he was going to whip out a pistol and hold us all hostage. The last straw came when he whipped out a MacBook and put on his glasses and started cursing Bill Gates and Microsoft Office. That's when we realized he was actually Steve Jobs and he was demanding we returned him the three fifty he had spent on his airline fare. So we gave it back to him and then he parachuted into the arms of a fifty foot crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "Okay. Here goes. \n\nSo, it's a lazy Saturday afternoon and my buddy calls me up and asks me to come over and watch the game. (Jets/Patriots. Jets lost because they always fucking lose.) \n\nI drive over there and we're hangin' out, watching football, drinkin' beers, talkin' titties and being guys. Half way through the third quarter his girlfriend shows up all crazy-eyed like somebody just shit in her cereal. \n\nShe's standing at the doorway squeaking and squealing and my buddy's standing there trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and I'm just sitting there watching the Jets lose and eating Cheetos. \n\nSo, after a few minutes she stops caterwauling and my buddy goes off to find a bottle of Xanax he keeps for emergencies and she comes sauntering listlessly into the living room and plops herself down on the couch. I could feel her squirming and I could sense that she was looking sideways at me but I just reeeaaaally didn't wanna engage. \n\nI ignored her for long enough that she got the point and she stood up and left the room, in search of somebody who gave a shit. I noticed after about 20 minutes that neither of them had returned and assumed that she was having another manic episode. Also, that I had had 7 beers and hadn't pissed yet. \n\nSo, I head down the hall to the bathroom and when I open the door there's my buddy's cock waging war against his girlfriend's gag reflex.

I just stood there. \n\nThen boom. His girlfriend reaches over, undoes my zipper and pulls my cock out and before I can even process that bit of weirdness she's got it in her mouth and going to town on it. She was AMAZING. I was dumbfounded. \n\nI look over at my buddy, still unable to figure out how this happened, and he gives me a sly nod and smile.

{"body": "TL;DR: The Disappearing Man Without A Face.\n\nBefore you read any further, I'm just letting you know that this is not a tree fiddy story or a troll post and that this is a story that I talked a little bit about two years ago in AskReddit but I never went as far in talking about this experience as I will now. I can't really give you a TL;DR because it would ruin the story so I've given this story a title in its place.\n\nI used to live next to two people when I was a kid growing up before I moved. I had no neighbors that \nlived behind me because my yard was pretty big and there was a creek behind my house and no neighbors who lived in front of my house because it was just a bunch of trees and a trail that led to a park. On both sides of my house I had neighbors. The neighbor to my left was a middle-aged woman who had lost her leg during a car accident when she was a teenager and she was cared for by her parents who lived in the same house with her. I was always friendly with them and my mom would take me over to their yard to play with their dog with the lady because she was isolated from most of society and because I was a young kid who loved playing fetch with dogs and running around with them. On the other side of my house I had a 65 year-old man who lived with his wife and who mostly kept to himself but did talk to me from time to time. He had these three really cool cars from the 50s, 60s, and 70s that he used to shine up and work on and he used to let me wash his cars from time to time in the Summer and even brought me cookies that his wife made for me as a way to thank me. Two things that stand out all these years later is that I can't remember the man ever appearing with his wife at the same time and that I can't remember my mom ever getting close to the man like I did. My mom used to wave to him from our steps about 30 yards from his house but she never really talked to him and never got very close to him or his house.\n\nI was between 6 and 10 years old when the man began to talk to me on occasion and let me look at his cars, wash them, sometimes sit in the driver's seat and pretend to race, and give me the cookies that his wife baked for me. I cannot remember what his face looked like at all but I know that he was a White man that was about 6 feet tall with greyish hair that he often covered with a golf cap. I must have been too young to remember the man but it still is strange that I honestly could not pick him out of a line-up if my life depended on me doing so. When I think about him, I remember that he had a soft voice that was almost like a whisper when he spoke to me yet I can't remember us talking about anything important which may have been down to my young age or that I was too preoccupied with looking at his cars and wondering if I was going to get some cookies from his wife that never talked to me (I think?) and who I cannot recall venturing outside of the house with her husband. When I was about 9 years-old I had what is easily the most disturbing and bizarre experience of my life.\n\nIt was a nice Summer day and I was outside shooting hoops in my driveway while my mom was inside watching TV and looking at me play from the window. I was working up a sweat and drinking some iced tea that mom had made at around noon when my neighbor appeared from his house and started chatting with me about how nice my jump shot was and how good at basketball I was going to be if I kept practicing. I was just a kid so I just smiled and nodded and said kid stuff back to him but don't remember much else. He then asked me if I wanted to wash his cars for him like I had done before that Summer and I was excited about doing so and said \"yes\" to him. He told me to go and ask my mom if I could do so and I ran inside to ask her if I could. She said that I could wash his cars for him but to do nothing else, stay where she could see me, and to come get her when I was done washing the cars. I was pleased with her response and ran back outside to the man's cars where he handed me a garden hose, a bucket, some soap, and a sponge to do the job. He stood on his step for a few minutes watching me getting all wet from the hose while I tried my best to wash his cars properly. After watching and churning out a few barely audible laughs, he asked me if I wanted Mrs. Neighbor to make some cookies for me and I happily said that I would love it if she did. The man then went inside and then went in and out of the house maybe 3 or 4 times in about 20 minutes before bringing me out a plate of chocolate chip cookies. I took a break from washing his cars to eat the cookies and I can remember thinking about where Mrs. Neighbor was but didn't pry because I was 9, didn't really care, and was too busy scarfing down cookies. I can remember that I never was able to look into the front of his home because he had his blinds closed almost all the time and I could never see into his kitchen very well because there was a big plant on the inside in a pot blocking my view of whoever was at the sink. \n\nBefore I could finish the two cookies that I had left he appeared from his house and asked me if I wanted to see how it was that his wife made those cookies that I loved so much and - stupidly - I didn't listen to what my mom told me about staying in her sight and followed him into the house without giving it much thought. I had no reason to be alarmed when I set foot in his house for the first time because everything looked normal and he had a nice TV set with some car and baseball memorabilia in plain view on top of a shelf above the TV and on top of his mantle above his fireplace as well. The house looked well-kept and nice and the kitchen looked nice as well and smelled even nicer. I followed him into the kitchen and he showed me the recipe book that his wife kept with the cookie recipe and he started reading one or two ingredients before he said that he had to go and grab some chocolate chips out of his pantry in the basement and that I should sit at his kitchen table and wait for him to get the chocolate chips. Well, I did what he told me to do for about ten minutes before my brain started asking me where his wife was, why I didn't hear or see her moving around the house anywhere, and why it was that he was taking so long to just grab a bag of chocolate chips from his pantry. \n\nNow, it's obvious that I didn't listen to instructions very well and so I'm sure that none of you are the least bit surprised that I got off of that kitchen chair and slowly, quietly walked towards the basement door that he had shut behind me ten minutes earlier. I didn't want to get his attention so I slowly opened the door without making it creak or squeak and saw that there wasn't much light down there with the exception of what must have been a lamp or something illuminating only a small part of the visible basement stairs for me. I was very afraid that I would make the stairs creak or squeak on my way down them so I went down as slow as possible and held my breath so that he wouldn't hear me snooping on him. I wasn't scared at all about what I might find down there but I was concerned about him getting mad at me for not listening to him when he told me to wait for him to come up. The fact that he closed the door made me think that I should have listened to him as well. I slowly made my way down the stairs and when I got far down enough I dipped my head down and saw that the basement had one lit lamp on in the corner, some boxes, an old TV, some dusty furniture, and not much else that was visible given the poor lighting. What I could see was a door towards the back of the basement that was closed and I could see that there was a small bit of a light barely visible from under the door that came out on the other side where I could see it. At this point I was nervous because I didn't see the man anywhere in the basement, there was no sound emanating from anywhere that might be him, and after my eyes had finished darting around the basement I couldn't make out what could be construed as a pantry anywhere. There was the light of the lamp, the light from the day's Sun coming through a small window in the basement, and just the sliver of light coming from the underside of the door at the back of the basement that I could see from the bottom of the stairs. I still decided not to say a word or to call out for him by name because I was getting more and more nervous, confused, and afraid after being in that basement for no more than a few minutes. I don't know why I didn't go back upstairs instead of slowly moving towards the door at the back of the basement but I held my breath and slowly crept towards that door with my fists clenched by my sides and my eyes wide. I got within a foot of the door and could hear some breathing on the other side and maybe the rustling of clothing or hands being rubbed or pressed together but I kept quiet and kept one ear close to the door for a minute before standing back and deciding if I should knock, go back upstairs, look for his wife that I rarely ever saw upstairs or call out his name to see if someone would answer. \n\nBefore I could make my next move I heard my mom yelling my name and I froze.  I froze and I also heard the breathing on the other side of the door freeze and whatever light was coming from the other side of the door quickly went out. I could hear my mom still yelling out my name in a panicked way yet I was still frozen because I knew that someone was on the other side of that basement door yet I knew that I needed to get up those stairs fast because my mom was yelling for me. I slowly turned around away from that basement back door and started to walk fast on my tip toes to the stairs and that's when the basement back door creaked open and I whipped my head around instinctively to see what was emerging from it. Out of that door came a woman in a blue dress with white flowers on it, two pearl earrings in her ears, white thong sandals, and a soft shade of red lipstick on. My eyes got wider than they had ever been in my life when I saw her and I couldn't move. My heart was in my throat because the woman seemed like she was towering over me while she stared at me with big blue eyes in complete silence. My mind was racing to come up with the answer to where the husband had gone but before I had time to work out my thoughts I heard my mom yelling at the top of the stairs at the basement door and I shuffled backwards, ran up the stairs, and was grabbed by my mom who started asking me why I didn't stay outside, why I was in the house alone, and where Mr. Neighbor was. She could sense that I had seen something so she asked me what was wrong but I just looked down at the floor trying to think of the words to explain what I had just witnessed. \n\nBefore I could look back up at her a light from the basement was turned on and up came the woman that I had encountered. She wore a smile on her face now and on second viewing she looked like she could have been someone's grandmother. She smiled at me and my mom and asked us if everything was alright and my mom asked her where her husband was and why he had taken me inside their home without her permission. The woman told my mom that her husband had gone upstairs to rest and that she was going to show me how to bake the chocolate chip cookies that I loved so much and that she had been baking for me that Summer almost every week. At this point my mind was scrambled and I have a hard time remembering what was said next between the woman and my mom. The next thing I knew the woman was asking us not to worry about something and that she just thought that she should spend some time with me since her husband was always the one outside of their home spending time with me washing his cars, talking to me about my jump shot, and offering me the wife's cookies. My mom didn't turn around to respond to any of this and briskly walked out the door of the house with her arm tightly wrapped around me until we got back inside of our house. She sat me down on our couch, gave me a glass of water, looked into my eyes and said \"When I tell you to stay in my sight when you are outside I mean it!\". I was very shocked at this point and just couldn't process what happened in that house and just nodded very fast with my eyes wide open at my mom. She then went into another room and started talking on the phone with someone but I'll never be sure who it was that she was talking to. It could have been my dad or it could have been either the husband or wife next door but all that I remember is that she raised her voice while speaking and that she didn't sound happy at all. She then told me to stay inside for the rest of the day before putting on an episode of Pokemon for me to watch while I drank my glass of water. \n\nI really can't remember how I felt after that but I'm sure that I was in shock because I didn't bother asking my mom or dad about what might have happened over at that house and they didn't say anything about it to me other than \"You are not allowed to go inside that house ever again and are not to be outside on their property with them without our supervision.\" I was too young to figure out what had happened in that house and I never bothered to ask my parents about it and they never, ever mentioned it in my presence for years. How could a 9 year-old kid understand what the hell just happened in that basement? Well, by the time I was 14 years-old I had my answer to what happened in that basement on that Summer day. \n\nI was at my new house that I had moved into a year earlier and my aunt and mom were in the dining room talking about whatever while I was in the TV room watching SportsCenter or something and paying no attention to their conversation. Suddenly, my TV watching stopped when I was able to hear them talking about our old house and about our neighbors. I lowered the volume on the TV just enough to not arouse suspicion that I was listening and then found out the answer to the mystery of that scary and extremely confusing day that I had when I was 9 years-old. It turns out that the man and woman living next door never was. It turns out that my neighbor was a transvestite and that the reason why I can't remember ever seeing the husband and wife together at the same time was because the husband was the wife and vice-a-versa. This revelation blew my mind. I'm old enough now to understand that there are people like this out there but as a 9 year-old it was the most disturbing and creepy thing that I had ever experienced and it stayed that way until I was 14. To this day that woman emerging from that back basement room in place of the husband is the most disturbing shit that I have ever witnessed in person.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398621086", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 142, "controversiality": 0}

I'd like to say that I was a hero who talked him out of it, but I could not collect my thoughts.  I just sat there for a few seconds, shocked at what was going on.

How did you enjoy [reading the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/faq#wiki_do_atheists_believe_in_ghosts_.28or_other_supernatural_things.29.3F)?\n\n----\n\n### Do atheists believe in Ghosts (Or other supernatural things)?\n \nSome atheists do. Many do not. Atheism only describes a person's lack of belief in deities. Everything else is negotiable. Being an atheist does not *necessarily* make one a materialist, or a rationalist, or a humanist, or an empiricist, or a positivist, or a skeptic- it's just that being those things tends to make one an atheist.  \n \nYou can still be an atheist and believe completely uncritically in ghosts, reincarnation, souls, heaven, hell, zombies, wizards, unicorns, leprechauns, bigfoot, spells, curses, auras, divination, astrology, homeopathy, crystal healing, psychics, ouija boards, alien abductions, UFOs, astral projections, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster, The Lost City of Atlantis, and honest used car salesmen. \n \nMost of those you'll find here *are* skeptics, however, so they would apply the same skepticism they use with the god question to the paranormal as well. Given the complete lack of any evidence of ghosts, unicorns, or $SUPERNATURAL_THING, don't expect them to believe in it.  \n \nIf *you* have any evidence that they exist, you're welcome to submit it for peer review and collect your Nobel Prize, or at least contact James Randi [so he can give you $1,000,000](http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html).

I agree.\n\n&gt; i guess my point is that the description itself has a lot of assumptions attached and yet does nothing to indicate what you belief.\n\nSure. This is a problem.\n\n&gt; just like saying someone is a christian, there is a basic understanding of the core dogma, but the differences between catholics and mormons is too vast to assume you can predict what a christian, who could be either, actually believes. \n\nI totally get where you're coming from.\n\nConsider that there isn't one single label that you can use that will clear things up for people. Thankfully, we're all interesting and complex and one single label isn't going to cut it. My advice, if you need to use labels, use the ones you feel are appropriate to the situation. For instance, I use:\n\n* non-religious: when I want to be vague about my beliefs. \n* atheist: when I was to be explicit about the fact I don't believe in a god. If someone is pestering me about which church I go to, this usually shuts them up.\n* agnostic atheist: places like here on reddit when I want to be a bit more explicit about epistemology \n* anti-theist: when I want to let people know I think religion is bunk and that we're better off without it\n* secular humanist: when I want to convey the idea that humans need to work together to solve our problems and that we are capable of many wonderful things if we can just get along\n* skeptic: when I want to be clear on my position regarding all kinds of things like the Loch Ness monster, bigfoot, UFO abductions, etc.\n\nThose are the ones that come to mind. In a pinch, I'll use secular humanist, as that implies I value naturalistic explanations for things as well as rationalism and empiricism (which covers skepticism) as well as atheism, though it isn't explicit.

Anyways, when I was about 8 years old my mom bought me a brand new bike for my birthday. It was hot red colored, had the brightest reflectors, the loudest bell, and the biggest basket. Throughout my  childhood many toys of mine went missing, and would strangely end up in the hands of the two Steelers children. When anyone would try to talk to them about it they would claim that it was their item, and the parents would say that they purchased it for them. One day I was outside biking when my parents called me in for supper. I pedaled up to my porch and went in for supper, leaving my bike out front. Once I was eating I ran outside to hop on my childhood pimp-mobile only to find nothing. Someone had taken my bike. I immediately sprinted inside to tell my parents. They helped me look for it but we couldn't find it anywhere. Fast forward about two weeks and im playing outside when suddenly I see the young Steeler boy, who we'll call Billy, riding on the exact bike that I received for my birthday. I immediately ran over to him and pushed him off of it. I tried to take my bike back but Billy wasn't letting go of it. I ran inside and got my mom to come out and help me get it, but Mrs. Steeler was already at the scene. She started yelling at me and telling me that she purchased the bike for Billy. Mrs. Steeler then began to tell me that if I wanted my bike back I'd have to purchase it off of her son for tree fiddy.

{"body": "This is probably going to get buried but here we go..\n\n\nLet me start off by saying that this guy was actually a pretty cool guy for the most part, but his mannerisms were not as nice. Tim started to room with me in college, when I decided to get an apartment senior year. I had a part time job as a lifeguard at the pool the university had, and Tim got his money from his parents. And he'd love to blow his money...\n\nSo one day I came back from work and he invited 10 people over to do cocaine. So yeah, dealing with those people wasnt fun. He blew money on hookers which he would bang every other day, he would throw parties, leave the place a mess for me to clean, and over time he became a huge douche. Well, one day I come home and the place is mess and he's sitting there on the floor drunk as a skunk. He tells me he can't pay rent and his parents cut him off. After some arguing and threatening me to kill me I kick him out. I don't see him for a few days. Finally one day I'm coming back from class and I see him sitting on a bench crying. I walk up to him a bit worried and ask him what's going on, and he says..\n\n\n\"Man, I'm done. I can't live without my money man, my parents cut me off and I got so many drugs in me I don't even know what's real anymore.\" I tell him that he can turn in around if he just shapes up and gets a job. I sit down with him and we talk about life, where he came from and all that. Turns out this guy had been through a lot and apparently some people have been trying to catch him for all the wrongs he did. Poor guy. He thanks me and then smiles, \"man, you're such a good guy, I'm touched you'd give me second chance\" \"no problem man, you just gotta get your feet planted a move forward\" he then asked me something that I'll never forget. \"Yo man, I hate to ask but could I have a few bucks so I can get my shit together?\" I shrug, \"sure I guess. How much do you need?\" \"I-I need about tree fiddy\" well, it was about that time I realized my roommate was seven stories tall and a creature from the Paleolithic era.

It's resulted in amazing advances in virtually every other industry. Apple is solely interested in profit yet has made my life better off. Again, just bringing up profit as a motive isn't sufficient to say anything, unless all you care about is ideological purity.\n\nWhen profit is a motive, it means schools will aim to obtain as many vouchers/students as possible.

I don't see how this is relevant? Are YOU concerned about talking about educating kids? I'd prefer to stay on that topic, but it seems like you just want to go back to \"Business is bad.

And not to mention she was gorgeous. Everything about this girl was beautiful. And though I'm sure she was drowning with neckbeards trying to hook up with her, for some reason she settled on me.\n\nWe started messaging each other back and forth, when, sadly, I learned she had been living in Australia for work. Yet our late-night chats turned into phone calls for hours and hours, every night we'd talk and get to know more. Just the sweetest person, ever: volunteered at a soup kitchen, running fanatic, and even started a small drive to donate shoes to less fortunate kids. \n\nThen, suddenly, she disappeared. No pictures of her in yoga pants online, no daily \"sup babe :)\" messages, nothing. I tried calling and calling, and eventually I tracked down her work in Australia and they informed me that she had been hit by a truck. I cried. For days. Her boss was very consoling and he'd asked me about some stuff on her work computer that he needed to get to, but was locked with a password. So, being a network admin, I coordinated with them and remoted into her computer and retrieved the files, and they were ever grateful.\n\nBut I still missed her. Every night on Facebook I'd wait for that green light to pop. Months and months, nothing. Then, one night while perusing /r/birdswitharms, it popped up. \"Emily ********\" appeared, and I shat myself. Maybe it was her boss? Or a friend...? I didn't know. And it stayed lit for an hour, and each second chiseled at my sanity until I messaged her.\n\n\"Hello?\" I said.\n\n\"r u D***?\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I...I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time I realized that this angel, the love of my life's account was hacked by a seven-foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "Don't worry brother, they will see your rationality some day just as I have. It's precisely posts like this that slowly started to eat away at my diminishing faith. I was born in a typical evangelical Christian family and faithfully attended church every Sunday. We used to have prayers at home all those kinda thing and I was never really taught to question Scripture nor had I ever the intention of doing so. Fast forward to a few years ago, I got accepted into medical school. I realised once I came out of the bubble that was my small home town, faith started to present more and more questions. My peers were largely uninterested in religion and frankly speaking those that were were a little weird. Nevertheless I put a lot of time and effort in and started a home Bible study group for students, basically a \"model christian student\" so to say. I think you guys know what I mean.\n\nTime went by and I started having a lot of doubts. I used to lurk around subreddits like this and found that atheists raised many interesting questions. Questions that I have never even thought about. I began to ponder questions. What is God's own purpose and meaning? Was the earth really created in 7 days? Are our human bodies really a result of intelligent design. I remember looking through pathology slides of animal and human tissue and as far as I could see, the differences were miniscule. Christian responses on these questions also seemed lame at best.\n\nThe christian god at times seemed vindictive even violent. I could not understand why people would worship him let alone believe that he was the source of all objective morality. I was struggling daily with my intellectual reasoning.\n\nI began to read books like Richard Dawkins's The God Delusion and Sam Harris's The end of faith. My roommate who was an ardent atheist sat down with me for many civil debates. In fact the books were his and he had no hesitation lending them to me. Surprisingly enough I found myself nodding every two or three pages in. The logic was cold as it was convincing. I was pretty convinced I had finally found the nails to nail shut the coffin of faith in my heart once and for all. I even brought these books to my youth pastor and watched sadly as he tried to explain some of the dilemmas away that the books posed. His answers mostly revolved around the fact that Gods will is good and every thing was for the best. \"Try telling that to the children who were dashed on the rocks\" I thought.\n\nBare in mind this was a very difficult time for me. I was raised in the faith and had no where to go. To totally shut out something that had been such an integral part of my life for so long felt essentially the same as donating one of my kidneys away. What would my parents think as well? Would they disown me for joining the other side so to say. I became disillusioned with church and stop attending altogether. When church members came around to visit me, I raised questions from books that I knew they had no idea how to answer. My God delusion book was neatly stacked on top of my medical textbooks reminding me that science was the answer to everything and that faith was for people who I slowly began to realise, intellectually challenged.\n\nOne night I was just lying in bed looking out of the window and seeing the stars in the sky. Passages in the God delusion kept assaulting my conscious mind and I knew I had reached a breaking point. I got up, grabbed the book and approached my roommate. \"How much did you pay for this book?\" I asked him. \"About tree fiddy\" he replied. At this moment, I realised my roommate was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. Looking in the mirror, i tipped my fedora and realised it was time to shave my neckbeard.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398781920", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

So while the plane was at it's peak altitude and the cabin lights turned off, I slipped out of my seat and made my way towards the center of the cabin where the restrooms were located. You had to go down a short flight of stairs to get to the bathrooms(big plane). No one was around at all, I started to splash some cold water on my face and got ready to go into the bathroom to do my business. I took a piss on one of the most uncomfortable toilets i've ever been on. I heard a knock at the bathroom door. Who the hell would bother me, there has to be other restrooms. I yell, \"Almost done\". \nI flush the toilet, and almost instantly, the lock on the door unlocks and the flight attendant is standing there.  \nShe walks into the bathroom and shuts the door behind her. At that moment, one of the most passionate love making escapades began. I was mind blown at how skilled she was. When we had both finished, she put herself together.  \nI exclaimed,\"Do you do that often.\"  \nThe attendant turns and says, \"Only when I really need it.\" and winks.\nI ask, hoping for another go, \"Oh, do you still need it?\"  \nthe flight attendant than turns and says, \"No, I'm gonna need bout tree fiddy\".  \nWell it was about that time that I realized that this flight attendant was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398803745", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago.\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty. Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398827794", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "During middle school I joined band. I did it because I'm musical and I wanted to learn how to play trumpet. This class was not like your average class. As the years went on the band class got closer and closer and by the end we were pretty much all friends.  \n\nI played with the trumpet section kinda above the flutes (there were steps we sat on). One day this girl that played flute was messing around and got her finger stuck in her flute. It was really funny because I had kinda known this girl before so it was really silly to see her do something like this. We laughed for probably 10 minutes before our amazing teacher laughed and helped her out.  \n\nAfter middle school, a lot of the kids quit band because it wasn't in their interest anymore. This included me and finger-flute girl. I still wanted to take music classes though. There was a beginning guitar class that you could take for about a year and I thought to myself, \n\n *\"This would be nice! I already know how to play so it'll be fun and it'll be an easy grade.\"*  \n\nSo I took the class and coincidentally finger-flute girl was in the class as well. We didn't really sit by each other but we made weird faces at each other and just had a fun time in the class. It was just a little awkward but that's how all high-school friendships are. After the semester ended and most everybody switched classes, flute-finger girl and I found each other in the same class. We talked. We laughed. We punched each other for fun. We had an awesome friendship.  \n\nThis is the part of the story where you ask, *\"When are they going to date?!\"*  \n\nIt doesn't happen.  \n\nI never wanted it to happen though, because we were just friends, and we both knew that, and it was completely fine!  \n\nI was talking to her in class one day and the subjects of friends comes up, so I ask her who her best friend is. She starts talking about this girl named Corinne who is really nice and I would apparently really like. I thought it was a little weird just because I literally had *no idea who this girl was*, and flute-finger girl made me text her.  \n*It was really awkward* and it went a little something like this,  \n\n(Me) 12:13 pm - Hey so flute-finger wanted me to text you for some reason haha  \n\n(Corinne) 2:36 pm - Who is this?  \n\n3:46 pm - Just one of Flute-finger girl's friends. My name is how_do_i_breathe!  \n\n7:06 pm - Oh cool!  \n\n8:53 pm - So what's up?  \n\n8:58 pm - sorry my phone times out at 9 bye!  \n\n\n\nAnd that was basically it. I had no idea who she was or anything, so I just didn't text her anymore. I still talked to flute-finger girl and we stayed friends until summer came. We snapchatted a lot until one day she made me add Corinne as a friend because Corinne finally got a phone that could get it. So she and I started to snapchat. And snapchat. And snapchat. Then we moved to facebook messaging. Then texting. After about a month or two into summer Corinne and I talked all day, erryday on the phone. It was a routine basically. I would wake up, text her for a little until she wanted to talk on the phone. After a couple hours we would get off, have our day texting more, then talk at night until her phone timed out at 11. It was really fun and great until we both realized that we had never actually hung out. It was crazy! We both felt so close and connected and we had never even seen each other. So we made a date to hang out and it was awesome. I spent the whole day at her house and her parents loved me. It was especially crazy because her parents are super mormon and I'm not, so it was a one in a million chance that they just *accepted* me.  \n\nAnyway, we hung out a couple more times after that until the school year came back around. I couldn't even text her anymore because the phone bill hadn't paid back and my dad only had about tree fiddy. He tried to pay it back but the Loch Ness Monster just wouldn't accept any more money.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398829797", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I'm sick of seeing this thread and I've told this story at least once before on a different account. But. It's almost 5 AM and I have nothing better to do.\n\nI once accidentally the entire night.\n\nIt started simply enough, drinks with friends; both great plans and great stories often start with this. My friends Danny, Jessica and I headed out on the town for my 21st birthday. This wasn't America, I was already legal drinking age but 21 is 21. And we're Irish. So drink.\n\nWe drank briefly at Jess', we headed to a pub around 7pm and the night began. Every pub we went to they both bought me a shot. By 9pm we'd been to at least eight of them. I was wasted. I honestly can't believe any doorman let me in. I must have been exuding the 'luck of the irish' because somehow I held myself like a sober man. Or so I'm told, honestly what I remember about the night is bits and pieces. Here's how it went from Danny's perspective though. The three of us pieced this story together pretty easily, and they don't let me forget it.\n\n9:30. There's a band playing and the singer is drop dead gorgeous, short, pink hair and bright blue eyes. The band does a cover of a Red Hot Chilli Peppers song and drunken me is singing along, I even do the solo on my Jack Daniels brand air guitar, and this singer smiling at me the entire time. When they finished the set I actually had the dutch courage to offer her a drink.\n\n11pm, we all leave for a house party. Right as we get there she pulls me aside. First kiss.\n\n11:30. Drinking games. Everyone is now on my drunken level.\n\n12. Everyone is now semi naked.\n\n1am. Everyone is passed out. Despite the odds the only people still awake are myself, the singer and the drummer. They're sisters, they're drunk, and it's my birthday. You know from that exactly what I was thinking, and yes. I was drunk enough to suggest it. The singer and I were giggling, whispering, and I just brought it up. \"You know...I've always had this fantasy...\" and she stops dead, looks me in the eye and says, \"me too.\" I probably had the biggest, shit eatingist grin. She walks over to her sister, leans into her and whispers something. The sister gets up and starts to take her top off, then stops. I'm drunk, I'm pretty horny, I'm confused. She puts her top down, I remain boobless,and she goes to leave the room. \"I just need one thing,\" she says. \"What do you need?\" I asked, drunken singer climbing on to my lap. \"Oh, about tree-fiddy.\" said the sister. At this point I realised my beautiful musical sisters were actually 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed. \n\nThe rest of the house woke up.

{"body": "The problem is with the TAG argument is you have to ignore everything you lay down for your argument when it comes to your god. For example, one of the principles of TAG is something can't come nothing. The obvious question is why does your god receive a free pass? Where did he come from? But exploring that further, we need an example of nothing. Lawrence Kraus has a beautiful explanation exploring exactly what nothing is. Secondly, abiogenesis is a relatively new field of study. In time, like most of science we will have a clear answer to this. http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/cheme.htm. this link provides how much science we have and research as of 2010. I can't find it right now, but just recently there was an article on r/science that was published by a research team that was able to recreate earths atmosphere and overtime amino acids randomly stated to appear. \n\n\nAs far as Aserthian is concerned, you are right. I can rename your god whatever I want and that doesn't change its existence. But what if I wrote a book about Aserthian that lasted for two thousand years? That doesn't make any of my claims about Aserthian correct. I understand that TAG is not the sole basis for your belief. But Aserthian is just to point out the giant leap you have to make to turn the TAG argument into the Christian god. \n\n\nAs far as logical absolutes. They are absolute regardless of a conscience mind and they do not require a conscience mind to exist. A=A regardless if a conscience mind is able to conceive them. It's the language we use in identifying them that doesn't exist without a conscience mind. A rock is a rock regardless if you have a mind to call it a rock. \n\n\nThe default position on supernatural claims is disbelief until sufficient evidence is presented. This protects us from believing in leprechauns or the loch Ness monster until there is undeniable proof. It's a filter that allows us to move through life rationally. To date, there is insufficient evidence for the god of the bible. The Bible conflicts with science, history, genealogy, geology and basic logic. \n\n\nAs for the illiterate fisherman are concerned, why would your god, the amazing being who created the cosmos give his message to those people?
