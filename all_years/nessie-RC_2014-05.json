{"body": "&gt; not one person ever claims to ever have seen useless.avi\n\nI saw it once on one of my bored torrent hunts. It wasn't labelled as useless.avi, but I went to download some Disturbed or Slayer or something and got that instead. It was around the time that P2P was mainstream, but there was a lot of shady shit like viruses and CP that you could unintentionally end up downloading\n\nI'd say the woman was closer to brunette than blonde, but that's just me. She was wearing a pair of really short green shorts, but nothing else. There's rope covering her chest, but only over her breasts (and arms, of course). There is also rope around her legs, thus why she can't escape. Her blue-shadowed eyes were frenzied, like she knew what was about to happen to her. Tears streaked her mascara. And yes, her mouth was taped shut with either gaffer tape or black duct tape (or maybe electrical tape, the video wasn't the greatest quality). She's lying, writhing, trying to escape.\n\nThe suited man kind of looked like one of those Anonymous guys, but the mask wasn't the one from V for Vendetta, it looked more like an all-white version of one of those [drama masks](http://www.clipartbest.com/cliparts/yik/k8q/yikk8qpiE.png) (the smiling one) from what I could tell. He was on the heavier side. \n\nThe red chimpanzee wasn't perfectly shaved; there were some large patches of (red painted) fur, but not many. It had definitely been whipped or something, but with the paint and artifacting it was hard to see exactly what it was.\n\nOnce the chimp enters the room, the woman starts hyperventilating, trying to get the tape off of her mouth, trying to escape the ropes holding her down. Of course, her efforts are futile and the chimp goes to town on her, screeching intermittently. \n\nIt starts with the belly, the most accessible area. The woman is full-on thrashing as hard as she can, but she's tied down very well. Blood begins to fill the bed, but the chimp is painted the same color so it's hard to tell how much blood is on it. Her intestines are yanked from her abdominal cavity, but the chimp isn't interested in that so it tosses them to the hardwood floor. \n\nIt moves down to the legs, the woman is obviously getting weaker as her movements have much less energy to them. Blood is all over the bed and starting to pool the floor. Her ribs are slightly visible, and once the chimp finishes with the legs, so is her left femur. \n\nThe chimp is now tearing at the woman's face and neck, and this is when she finally dies. As stated in the synopsis, there's about 4 minutes of the chimp eating flesh from the dead woman's carcass.\n\nThis is where my story veers off a little. Maybe I had an edited copy or something. After the part with the chimp eating the woman, there's a cut (like the one described in jimbo.avi or tonguetied.avi) and the masked man in the suit is alone in the room with the dead body. He reaches into the mess and covers his hand in blood, and proceeds to write \"USELESS\" all over the walls, continuing for a minute or so, dipping his hand occasionally. \n\nThen the video ends.\n\nI have seen useless.avi, and have never seen it again after that. I didn't know the significance, so I didn't think to share it before deleting it and passing it off as some Russians trying to spook P2P users. The image is still vivid in my head, and no one but me and some people on the internet will be able to show it to anyone. Maybe I'll try running an undelete on my old laptop later, but I don't have high hopes.\n\nEdit: I ran an undelete, it wanted tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398912577", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Anyone else have a boner?\n\n[Edit] in response to barnacledoor's edit, I'm over 25 and have a \"professional\" job and have a story of why it's obviously not okay.\n\nI work in a profession that is predominently male oriented, but there are a few women that work here. Every lunch hour, the guys get together in the lunch room and shoot the shit while the women mainly keep to their desks. They still come by to heat up their food though.\n\nNow these convos can get pretty raunchy and often teeter on the line of what sexual harrassment is considered to be. Well this story doesn't quite involve that... Maybe the stripper part does... But this one guy definitely crossed some boundaries one lunch.\n\nSo we're there referencing the usual stuff: simpsons quotes from the glory days, rob ford at it again, etc. And the usual stuff always progresses into something next level. Somehow, drugs get brought up. I immediately decide to sit this one out and see where everything goes.\n\nI guess I shouldn't say somehow got brought up, because rob ford definitely got mentioned so the convo went in a cocaine direction. Everyone automatically denied ever using, but this one guy felt the need to tell the story of how he almost tried it once. In the middle of the lunchroom.\n\nThe story goes something like this: him and his buddies are having a night. Drinks, shots, darts, the whole 9 yards. This particular night for them led to the rippers.\n\nAt this point, I noticed a female manager walk by and I can tell that she just heard everything, but she's puting on her ignore face and slowly walks by. I. Have a feeling that she's hanging out by the doorway, but am not completely sure. Anyway, his story progresses.\n\nHim and his buddies are pounding beers and getting lapdances into the wee hours of the morning. When his story takes a turn and he claims that his buddies got a few of the rippers back to their place (yeah right, right? But I didn't call BS).\n\nSo he says that everything is going smooth at their place when one of the rippers wants to go skiing. Now he claims to have never done the devil's dandruff before, be he's drunk and he's interested. She lays out a couple hollywoods for the two of them when his buddy knocks some sense into him and says \"what are you doing!?!?!\". Now the ripper is apparently pissed and wants money for the line still. He asks how much and apparently she goes \"I need about tree fiddy\". \n\nNow this is about the time that he realizes that she isn't a stripper at all and was 8 stories tall and was actually a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamn Nessie! That god damn loch ness monster had gotten him again. He said he stood there yelling at nessie about who was supposed to pay his bills as the monster swam away into the distance. \n\nThe manager comes from around the corner at that moment and said that she was going to ignore everything she heard cause she believed he learned his lesson and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nPoint is, of course we know it's not okay to do it in the work place. Some people are idiots. Shout out to /u/Thehealeroftri for the nessie story idea.

Perhaps these are just Valve's animation team being lazy, or there's some technical reason in SFM why they couldn't apply the texture or something or another, but the main thing is that: Heavy could have had the baboon heart removed afterwards; the other classes could have had a completely different operation done on them; and that it's unknown is foreign matter (IE a mega-baboon heart and a supercharger attached to the mercs) would be kept after dying and respawning.\n\nThis also raises the question: Is it only the Quick Fix that requires a mega-baboon heart+supercharger to do the normal medigun's ubercharger?

{"body": "/u/donttalktomepls, the Reddit Grammar Police Bot has detected an error in the description of your link:\n\n&gt; Okay, first of all there's me.  A 36yo female, some geeky tendencies, but more of a science nerd.  Glasses, short dark hair, questionable fashion sense, slightly overwieght, divorced a year or so ago, not interested in dating *at all*.  But worked in social jobs for many years, so can smile and chit-chat without staring at my shoes like a mostly normal human.  \n\n&gt; Second on our cast of characters, there's this dude, let's call him Bob, because that isn't his name.  I met him at a local board gaming group.  He honestly, not making this up, has a neckbeard, wears a dingy old trenchcoat when it is cold, and owns at least one fedora.  He probably weighs north of 400lbs.  He's very socially awkward, but seriously folks, ~~its~~ [**it's**] a gaming group.  Pretty much every one is awkward.  \n\n&gt; After attending a few gaming meets and chatting with multiple people, it became obvious that Bob and I share some superficial interests. I mentioned an obscure film I was planning to attend, and Bob asked if he could tag along. I hesitated, knowing there was some risk that he'd fixate on me, but decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I mean, fuck it, I can be friends with the weird, heavy, trench-coat guy, right?  All people need friends, and it'd be nice to have a friend who liked some of the same obscura.  \n\n&gt; Anyway, I'd been open with the group about being divorced and enjoying being by myself, not wanting a relationship. Additionally, at the time of the movie conversations, I actually said out loud to him, \"Okay, it would be cool if a friend comes with me.\"  At the film, while waiting for it to start, we were discussing families (yanno, the do-you-have-any-siblings type small talk), and in this context I again said that \"I just got out of a difficult relationship, and I'm not looking for or interested in a relationship right now. I really enjoy being single.\"  Our interaction at the movie was basically fine with a few awkward pauses, and we parted ways pleasantly.  \n\n&gt; I figured everything was fine, I was making a new friend, and went on my merry, blithe way.  *Oh how wrong I was.*  \n\n&gt; A few weeks later, there was another gaming meet.  Sometimes folks got together for a drink afterwards, and it ended up being just me and Bob.  Fine, whatever.  Well, about ten minutes into the conversation he told me he'd gotten us tickets to a gaming convention a few months and a few states away and asked about making plans to go.  *What???*  This was an event he'd mentioned in passing at the movie as something a few members of the group went to annually, and I'd said I don't usually do conventions but might consider getting myself a ticket (this con does not sell out, tickets are still available day-of).    \n\n&gt; I was flabbergasted, and told him that I hadn't decided whether I wanted to go or not, and wasn't really planning to.  He basically ignored that and said, \"Well, when you want the ticket, it'll be here.\"  Oooooohkayyyyy.  I said, \"I really don't think I'll want it, so you might think about reselling it,\" and resolved to finish my drink and GTFO of the bar.  As I was slamming my gimlet, he first said that then we should also go to a different convention together, then said that he'd found an old LinkedIn profile of mine and asked a question about it.  *Dude, you just told me that you'd been internet stalking me.  UNCOOL.*   \n\n&gt; I just wanted to get out of there at this point, mumbled something about not having updated that profile in forever, said I had to go, left some money on the table and bailed. I had no desire to feed any more of his fantasy which clearly ended with us flying away into the sunset on a pair of dragons with matching Tolkien inscribed rings and me in a plump Leia costume.  \n\n&gt; I stayed away from the gaming group for several weeks, mostly because a family member was having health issues and that ate my time, but I also didn't make an effort to go because I didn't want to see Bob. During that time he sent me a few text messages that I did not reply to, mostly inane stuff about his day, a few about things we should go to together, and one telling me he'd bought me some candy complete with inappropriate blushing smiley icon.  I guess that was to lure me into replying so I could get the free candy and he could see me?  I dunno.  I mean, I'm adult, I can buy my own damn candy.  \n\n&gt; Anyway, I'm really missing the gaming group, as everyone else there seems okay.  I was planning to just show up at the meeting tonight until I got a text message from Bob *inviting me to the group I'm already part of*.  Seriously?  Now if I go, I feel like he'll think I'm going to meet him, which a big ole' **HELL NO**.  Yuck.  \n\n&gt; This is a very unfamiliar situation for me as I've spent most of my adult life married, which seems to have allowed me to avoid this sort of thing.  So, I have none of the clever tools that would allow me to dance out of this weirdness.  \n\n&gt; Honestly, I'd just ditch the group and tell Bob I never want to see him again (and hope that would actually deter him), but I live in a very small city and would like to stay part of this group as there just aren't any other options.  But obviously, I don't want any more of this dude's attention.  \n\n&gt; Has anyone successfully navigated this type of situation?  I don't really want to be mean, and suspect that being direct would cause him to either make me his constant target or to simply ignore it and continue to fixate.  Maybe a bit of both, honestly.  \n\n&gt; Help?  \n\n&gt; ---     \n&gt; **tl;dr**: Real-life sighting of mythical trenchcoat-fedora-neckbeard, complete with grainy photos.  Nessie has decided that I'm his Fedora Queen and is going full creeper.

{"body": "So, one regular Monday morning, I'm driving to work, just like everyone else on the road. Just in front of me, I saw this crazy sight. This one man, I'd say about 50 to 60 years old, took an illegal turn, and came only a couple feet away from ramming a young woman, maybe 25. Anyways, the older man accelerates, and speeds past the woman. All of a sudden she just snapped. She opened her window and flipped off the man, and then sped up. I guess its worth mentioning that she was driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee, and the man was only in something like a Miata, or a Civic coupe, I don't quite remember. Anyways, so this woman just rams the back of the mans car, knocking him off of the highway, and onto the grass. His car tipped over and came very close to flipping over. The woman just drives away. Since I see smoke coming from the guy's engine, I get worried and stop my car, and go make sure he's okay. As I come closer, the door is swung open, and the man had blood flowing from his forehead, it looked like his head hit the dashboard. I worriedly ask, \"Oh my god, are you okay?\" He responds rasping, \"I don't know but I just need one thing.\" I ask again, \"Wait what? I can get it to you, I promise\". Then he said, \" All I need is about tree fiddy\". And that's when I realized the older man was actually a 8-story tall giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "Hey, dude.  As someone who's struggled with her weight, I hear you.\n\nThat said, the other folks who replied to are correct.  As I stated in the description, Bob literally (and I'm using that word accurately here) has a neckbeard.  That was an accurate description of his physical appearance.\n\nAdditionally, he internet stalked me and said/did several things that made me feel really creeped out.  Hence, \"Creeper\".  \"Creeper\" is definitely not an appearance-dependent word.  A traditionally attractive guy can very much be a Creeper.\n\n\"Nessie\" was used as an allusion to a mythical creature that people report seeing but which does not actually exist.  I could have chosen a different creature like \"Bigfoot\" (which I actually rejected because I thought it would be too physically derogatory).  \n\nAll of these terms were intended to mesh with the light-hearted, wry tone of the rest of the writing.  And, as pointed out below, I was certainly no kinder to myself.  \n\nIn short, I get your point, but my intention was not to place him in a bad light because of his appearance.  Honestly, if I wanted to do that, I could have included several other details (like the fact that he often wipes his face on his shirt in public instead of using a napkin, and his shirts are all food-stained because of this), and peppered in words like \"land-whale\" and that sort of crap-o-la.  I clearly choose not to do that.\n\nI chose to include some physical details as relevant descriptors because they give the reader a more clear understanding of the level of social awkward-ness, and thus make the situation easier to advise on.\n\nSo, I'm sorry that I triggered you with my writing.  I've felt similar about the extremely common fat female bashing on reddit, and have had to learn to let it go when it is just a descriptor, not an insult.  It can certainly be so pervasive that every time it is mentioned it sets my teeth on edge, even when it is an innocent description.  But be assured, this time, it was genuinely a descriptor.

{"body": "Oh right! The question: How to reach the not-very-bright hordes, when they simply refuse to be reached by logic, fact, or modern mode? How to communicate obvious and vital truths (conservation, global warming, public health, sexuality, basic nutrition, religion as parable/myth, the general awfulness of Mumford &amp; Sons) the lack of understanding of which keep the country straggling and embarrassing, the laughingstock of the civilized world?\n\n\nAnd who are these people, exactly? And are they all really in Kentucky and Florida and Mississippi? Are they all in the Tea Party? Is failing education to blame? A dumbed-down media? Reality TV? In the wealthiest and most egomaniacal superpower in the world, why is the chasm so wide?\n\nThere is no easy answer, but there is a great deal of irony. It is a wicked conundrum that you and I can debate the definition of elitism, whether or not it’s fair to criticize those who believe that, say, gay marriage means kids will be indoctrinated into homosexuality, or that evolution is still a theory, or that Jesus literally flew up out of a cave and into the sky, when the discussion itself is, by nature, elitist, exclusionary, requiring fluid, abstract thinking the very people we’re discussing simply do not possess, and therefore cannot participate in.\n\nDiscussion of elitism is elitist. Intelligence can talk itself blue about what to do about all the dumb; the dumb will never hear it.\n\nIt’s a fact even recognized by Louisiana’s own Gov. Bobby Jindal, who had the nerve to defy his own state’s (and his own party’s) famously low IQ by saying, after the last election, “The GOP must stop being the stupid party. It’s time for a new Republican Party that talks like adults.”\n\nOf course he’s right. But where would that leave their base? And who will tell the megachurches? And does Jindal not know Louisiana is where they teach that the existence of the Loch Ness monster is evidence that evolution is a lie?\n\nBrings to mind a stunning study about facts and truths. Have you ever heard it? It goes something like: Here is hard evidence, scientific evidence, irrefutable proof that something is or is not true. Here is dinosaur bone, for example, which we know beyond a doubt is between 60 and 70 million years old. Amazing! Obviously!\n\nBut then comes the impossible snag: If you are hard-coded to believe otherwise, if your TV network or your ideology, your pastor or your lack of education tell you differently, you will still not believe it. No matter what. No matter how many facts, figures, common senses slap you upside the obvious. You will think there is conspiracy, collusion, trickery afoot. The Bible says that bone is only eight thousand years old. Science is elitist. Liberals hate God.The end.\n\nIt is not enough to say people believe what they want to believe. They will also believe it in the face of irrefutable counter-evidence and millennia of fundamental proof.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399112469", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I spent a week getting drunk every night and putting food in a friend's neighbor's mailbox.\n\n\nIt started as a joke. One day we accidentally burnt some pizza rolls, but we didn't want to throw away food, so we decided \"We'll just give them to the neighbors... but they're probably sleeping. Let's just 'mail' them to them.\"\nThe next day we were remembering that night and decided to make sandwiches or something. Ended up making an extra sandwich and put it in their mailbox, as an apology for giving them burnt pizza rolls.\nThen the next night we decided a sandwich isn't good enough. We made scrambled eggs, toast with jelly, and some bacon. We put that on a paper plate with a red solo cup full of orange juice in their mailbox because we thought they deserved a good breakfast.\n\nThen we made an ice cream sundae for them the next night. I mean all out, we even went to the store for the cherries. We had chocolate syrup, whipped cream, sprinkles, all the good stuff. Even left them a spoon to eat it with.\n\nWell... The next day I'm at work and I check my voicemail during my break. It was some police officer saying that he's leaving me a voicemail because he needs to talk to me, now. So I call him back and he starts questioning me about the trauma and hardship I had been putting this family through. Apparently after the 3rd or 4th night they installed a camera pointing at their mailbox and caught us with the ice cream. So I told the officer I was sorry, but he didn't sound mad. He just sounded... confused. He kept asking, \"But... why? Why on earth would you do that? I mean, they didn't make it sound like you vandalized anything or hurt anything. But... did you really make an ice cream sundae? What on earth for?\"\n\n\nI confessed to the whole thing. The breakfast, the sandwich, the ice cream. The officer wanted to know if I had harmful intentions, and when he realized that I was just acting out situational comedy on a whole new level that he'd never dreamed of he told me he would try and convince them to not press charges as long as I promised to give the Loch Ness monster about tree fiddy by the next morning. It was at this time that I realized the police officer was over 500 feet tall and wearing a kilt. I said \"Goddamnit Loch Ness monster!

{"body": "I was vacationing in Cambodia when I tasted this honey flavored treat that was a little spicy, and very sweet in the Bazaar in Phenom Penh that I have quite forgotten.  It was AMAZING, the flavors hit every part of the mouth, almost like liquor, how it reached the top of the palate, under the tongue, and even the back of the mouth.  I bought about a pounds worth for everyone back home from this middle aged man with very distinctive koi fish tattoos on his arms, and really really dark black eyes.  the day after trying the treat I went and got myself kicked out of the country for smoking pot at Angkor Wat.  I was lucky that the State Department got me out.  It was a scary time, and in my haste to leave Cambodia, I left the honey treats in my room at the US Embassy, and they were 'lost'.  After being slapped on the wrist when I arrived back home, I wondered if I would ever have those treats again.  In my hope, I visited several 'Little Cambodia's' on the west coast, hoping to find the treats again.  Nothing.  after a few years, I had given up hope and moved from Boston to San Francisco pretty close to Chinatown.  After settling down and getting a job, I went walking in Chinatown.  In early 2004, I was walking down Stockton St. when I SAW THE MAN who sold me the honey treats all those years ago.  I remembered the tattoos.  I hurried up to him, and told him the story.  He wore a toothy grin, and said he sold the treats in a little shop here in Chinatown.  I immediately asked him how much for six pieces, He immediately replied \"It'll be about tree fiddy.\"  It was then that I noticed that the scale tattoos were actual scales, and this guy was nearly eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the late Paleolithic era.

{"body": "When I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students. There was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip. She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't. Everyone could hear her, including me. Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about. She gossiped most days but one day was different.\nI heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom. I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not? It could be fun.\n\nAnyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with.\n\nMr. MakeMeASteak..\n\nI was shocked when I heard this.\n\nBut stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young. She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess. If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress.\nAfter class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work. It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head.\nAs soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, \"Hey Kathy. I heard you talking about me in class...\" she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, \"Oh my god! You heard me say that? I'm so sorry! And-\" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, \"I want to have sex with you too.\"\n\nShe stopped her sentence and smiled. Then she said, \"Do you know what my rates are?\"\n\nConfused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in. It turns out she mentioned that she would have sex with me... if I paid that is.\n\nI decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her. \n\n\"Alright,\" I told her. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll do it, but I need some money of course. That's just how it works.\" she said. I replied, \"Okay, what do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had tricked me again! \"GODDAMNIT MONSTAH, I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" I said to her as she swam away.\n\nClass was really weird after that with Kathy gone. I never told any of the students about our encounter but I sure as hell would never mention it to anyway. Ever. Of course I'm telling Reddit, but isn't that what the internet is for? To tell strangers your deepest, darkest secrets?\nThe year ended without being... too weird.\n\n**TL;DR: Overheard a student talking about having sex with me... things got... weird and it ended in an unexpected way...**\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1399236471", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1633, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, when I was about 16 years old, there was girl at my high school who liked me, and I liked her. We weren't dating at the time but we would stay up for hours on end every night just talking to each other. Our mutual friends were planning this trip to Santa Cruz and had ended up inviting both of us. Knowing we would be together for some time on this little trip I figured I should buy condoms first, just in case. For some strange reason though, I convinced myself that if I indeed needed them, I would just end up buying them in Santa Cruz from one of the various shops on the boardwalk.\n\nSo that was the plan, try my hardest to make the perfect moves on the way over there and if everything went well I would just buy my first pack there and use them there on her. \n\nSo the ride over went exactly as planned. There were a lot of \"future couples\" in our car (we were carpooling) and the conversations during the drive got very sexual. My and this girl ended up holding hands for a bit and it even escalated to a few kisses and some thigh rubbing. She even saw that I had somewhat of a chub about halfway there and just giggled. She seemed a little bit turned on by it, dare I say! Perfect. Fucking. Start.\n\nWe end up getting to the boardwalk at Santa Cruz and the fun times continue. We hold hand while we were walking from ride to ride, we exchange kisses here and there. On one of the darker rides we even had more fun---\n\n\"Haaha it's so dark in here I bet I could give you a handjob and nobody would even notice!\" - In her most playful voice ever.\n\n\"You won't though! too scared, I get it..\" - I say, desperately trying to peer pressure her into giving me a handy.\n\nShe did! As soon as the ride started, the room that it was located in got pitch black, and sure enough her hand starts sliding down my pants! She grabs my dick and starts giving me a hanjob! I could hear everybody who was waiting in line for their turn to go one the ride, but they couldn't see anything! It was such a turn on! After about 20 seconds of this, and some making out while it was happening, I whisper...\n\n\"Let's do it, real quick, I don't care if we're on a ride..\"\n\n\"Do you have a condom?\" - As she is still furiously jerking me off.\n\nFUCK. No condom. \"No\" - I reply\n\n\"It's ok baby, I have one.....but it'll cost you\" - She said in a very seductive voice.\n\n\"Oh yea? What's it gunna cost?\" - I can barely even say this as I'm really close to whipping out my wiener and going to town on this girl.\n\n\"....about tree fiddy\"\n\nSure enough the ride ends as soon as she said that. The lights came on to reveal that a prehistoric creature from the paleolithic era had it's hand down my pants.

So me and my friends started hanging out with her, and eventually one of my friends started dating her.  This guy was really nice, and it was quite horrible that he had to go through this.  So they had been dating for a couple weeks, and we've just found out about some of the lies she's told.  She said she was in band, and she wasn't.  She said she was in all AP classes and getting straight A's, and she wasn't.  But here's the kicker.  She told my friend that she wasn't cheating on him, and, you guessed it, she was cheating on him.  So we decide to stage an intervention.  My friend,(the one dating her) tells her he got some tickets to a movie premiere, and is going to pick her up.  So they drive to the theatre, and once they get in, all of us were waiting there and confront her about it.  We talk about how it's horrible to lie, how we know she's cheating and lots of other things.  So eventually we decide that if she can go for at least a week without lying, we'll give her some money as a reward.  We ask her how much she wants, and she says \"Tree Fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399245735", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**NOTE - This bad stuff at the beginning is just background to show how it was all the more better**\n\nWhen I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\n\nOne day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\n\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\"  I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies?  I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\n\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy.  The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free.  So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.  \n\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence.  I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\n\nNope.\n\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"  \n\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too.  He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.  \n\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\n\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars.  Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\n\nFast forward one year.  I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.  \n\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\n\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\n\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.  \n\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.  He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"  Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again!  I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\nSo yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst here.  But I haven't eaten smarties since then, that's for sure.\n\n**TL;DR: Kid wants drugs, I give him some, sort of.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399250902", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This one that's currently on one of the front page threads was pretty good:\n\n\nWhen I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students. There was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip. She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't. Everyone could hear her, including me. Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about. She gossiped most days but one day was different.\nI heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom. I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not? It could be fun.\n\nAnyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with.\n\nMr. MakeMeASteak..\n\nI was shocked when I heard this.\n\nBut stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young. She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess. If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress.\nAfter class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work. It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head.\nAs soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, \"Hey Kathy. I heard you talking about me in class...\" she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, \"Oh my god! You heard me say that? I'm so sorry! And-\" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, \"I want to have sex with you too.\"\n\nShe stopped her sentence and smiled. Then she said, \"Do you know what my rates are?\"\n\nConfused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in. It turns out she mentioned that she would have sex with me... if I paid that is.\n\nI decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her. \n\n\"Alright,\" I told her. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll do it, but I need some money of course. That's just how it works.\" she said. I replied, \"Okay, what do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had tricked me again! \"GODDAMNIT MONSTAH, I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" I said to her as she swam away.\n\nClass was really weird after that with Kathy gone. I never told any of the students about our encounter but I sure as hell would never mention it to anyway. Ever. Of course I'm telling Reddit, but isn't that what the internet is for? To tell strangers your deepest, darkest secrets?\nThe year ended without being... too weird.\n\n**TL;DR: Overheard a student talking about having sex with me... things got... weird and it ended in an unexpected way...**\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399252771", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago.\n\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\n\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty.  Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.  \n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\n\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far,  I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.  \n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact.  I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\"\nI almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal.  Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\n\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\"\nShe replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.  Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!  \n\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Haha..

{"body": "I HAD POSTED THIS EARLIER TODAY ON A POST ABOUT THE FIRST TIME YOU EVER BOUGHT CONDOMS\n\nSo, when I was about 16 years old, there was girl at my high school who liked me, and I liked her. We weren't dating at the time but we would stay up for hours on end every night just talking to each other. Our mutual friends were planning this trip to Santa Cruz and had ended up inviting both of us. Knowing we would be together for some time on this little trip I figured I should buy condoms first, just in case. For some strange reason though, I convinced myself that if I indeed needed them, I would just end up buying them in Santa Cruz from one of the various shops on the boardwalk.\n\nSo that was the plan, try my hardest to make the perfect moves on the way over there and if everything went well I would just buy my first pack there and use them there on her.\n\nSo the ride over went exactly as planned. There were a lot of \"future couples\" in our car (we were carpooling) and the conversations during the drive got very sexual. My and this girl ended up holding hands for a bit and it even escalated to a few kisses and some thigh rubbing. She even saw that I had somewhat of a chub about halfway there and just giggled. She seemed a little bit turned on by it, dare I say! Perfect. Fucking. Start.\n\nWe end up getting to the boardwalk at Santa Cruz and the fun times continue. We hold hand while we were walking from ride to ride, we exchange kisses here and there. On one of the darker rides we even had more fun---\n\n\"Haaha it's so dark in here I bet I could give you a handjob and nobody would even notice!\" - In her most playful voice ever.\n\n\"You won't though! too scared, I get it..\" - I say, desperately trying to peer pressure her into giving me a handy.\n\nShe did! As soon as the ride started, the room that it was located in got pitch black, and sure enough her hand starts sliding down my pants! She grabs my dick and starts giving me a hanjob! I could hear everybody who was waiting in line for their turn to go one the ride, but they couldn't see anything! It was such a turn on! After about 20 seconds of this, and some making out while it was happening, I whisper...\n\n\"Let's do it, real quick, I don't care if we're on a ride..\"\n\n\"Do you have a condom?\" - As she is still furiously jerking me off.\n\nFUCK. No condom. \"No\" - I reply\n\n\"It's ok baby, I have one.....but it'll cost you\" - She said in a very seductive voice.\n\n\"Oh yea? What's it gunna cost?\" - I can barely even say this as I'm really close to whipping out my wiener and going to town on this girl.\n\n\"....about tree fiddy\"\n\nSure enough the ride ends as soon as she said that. The lights came on to reveal that a prehistoric creature from the paleolithic era had it's hand down my pants.

She is not allowed to involve herself with any of the players, so their \"relationship\" is very secretive. (She comes over late at night, parks her car a few homes down from our campus apartment) \n\nAnyway, Sammy doesn't know that Richie actually already has a girlfriend. Who visits, I might add. Richie thinks he's a player. \n\nWhat makes it worse is that I once overheard him talking on the phone with his girlfriend. This is how it went: \n\nGF \"Is everything okay with us?\" \n\nRichie \"Ugh, yeah. We're cool, babe.\" \n\nI feel so bad for her because she is being lied to and abused. (Richie has sex with his girlfriend when she visits, during the day, and with Sammy at night) \n\nI've finally gotten up the courage to confront Richie about his douchebaggery, as I personally feel you should tell your SO of the problems in your relationship instead of running away from it. \n\nI told him, \"Richie, I'm sorry, but I have to tell Sammy you are using her.\" \n\n\"Don't be like that, bro.

{"body": "Get ready...I've got one.\n\nOk so this happened about 5 years ago. I was 19, working my first \"real\" job. People had tried to tell me that I wouldn't be able to handle what happened at grave yards during the middle of the night, but I mainly just shrugged them off. I was young and cocky and nothing could ever weird me out.\n\nSo my first night on the job and I already get some weird things happening. I took my round, nothing out of the ordinary, but by the time I took my second round I noticed something by the front gate of the graveyard. I slowly walk over to the dimly lit area to see a woman's dress lying there. About three feet away from the dress was a pair of women's shoes as well. \n\nI'm not terribly scared at this point, or weirded out, but I'm certainly confused. Who would leave their clothes by the gate? Was someone actually in the grave yard at this hour? Was this a prank being played on me by the day staff? Not being able to shut off these questions, I tell myself that I have to figure out why these clothes were there, I MUST know why. \n\nI end up walking around the grave yard looking for what I assumed could be a naked lady. About halfway around the place, I notice a clue. One of the graves had fresh dirt over it. It was almost as if something had been dug up exactly where a grave was. Now silly 19 year old me made up excuses as to why the dirt and grave had been roughed up. *Maybe a dog had come up when I wasn't over here and dug up some dirt. Maybe the dirt on this grave had always been like that, and I just never noticed*\n\nAfter finishing up looking around at the messed up grave I make it all the way back to the front gate. Here's the kicker, the clothes were gone. No trace they were ever there. I had not seen anyone, not heard anything. And I was really paying attention too, it would have been difficult for someone to be pranking me at this point. But silly me, I sort of shrug it off and continue the rest of the night.\n\nWell, fast forward two weeks after that first night. Every single previous night it was the exact same thing. Would go on a round, everything is fine. Would go again and women's clothes would be at the gate and the same grave would look like it had be dug up. Now, two weeks in and I couldn't take it anymore, I had to figure out wtf was going on. \n\nOn the 13th night of my job, I don't start off in my usual place. I start off in spot where I can see the gate. For about 15 minutes I'm standing in this spot, peering through bushes at the front gate, waiting. All of the sudden, I see a woman. She approaches the gate, silently opens it and starts to undress. After she has shed her clothes she begins to walk toward that one particular grave. I follow her, unnoticed, from about 100 yards behind her. After a short time she has made it to the grave, and I'm watching her from behind a tree. She reaches down at the grave, pulls what appears to be a lever that was under the grass, AND THE FUCKING GRAVE OPENS. Now, my vantage point isn't particularly great but I can see what appears to be an open coffin with human remains in the grave. (Obvious I know, but at this point I had no clue what was going on)\n\nThe naked woman, looks around (doesn't see me, thank god) and then begins to lay inside the coffin. When she gets all the way in the coffin she closes the hatch. The grave yard is now empty again. She has completely fucking layed inside the coffin with a mother fucking dead fucking body. I'm so weirded out and intrigued at this point that I muster up the courage to go confront her about what she is doing. I slowly walk over to the grave. I shuffle to loose dirt on the top until I find the lever. I grab the lever, shaking at this point from a mixture of fear and wonder, and I open the grave.\n\nThere she was, laying naked with a corpse. The look on her face when I opened wasn't that of shock though, it was look of sadness. Startled by this I mutter \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"....Well....ever since my husband passed away....I've only wanted one...I've only wanted one thing....\" - she replied, tearing up at this point. \n\n\"What would that be?\" - I gently say back.\n\n\"Well I just want......about tree fiddy...\"\n\nAnd sure enough as I looked closer at the lady the more I realized that she was actually an 8 foot tall prehistoric creature from the paleolithic era.

My older sister has some kind early dismissal pass so she can go to work early in the day from high school.\nAnyways, so I go home on one of my early days and notice my sister's car was in the driveway. This was weird because she was supposed to be at work that day. The garage door was already up so I quietly slipped in the house. That's when I heard my sister making really dirty noises. There wasn't anyone in the living room, so I thought she must be upstairs. As I walked to the staircase, I almost gasped out loud. Lying on the stairs was a trail of my sister's clothing. Some underwear, a shirt, pants, and a bra. I walked the staircase, still hearing the moaning noises. I turned the corner, and there was my sister, in her just her underwear. \n\"Hey,\" I said calmly.\nShe slowly walked over to me, reaching out to touch my face.\n\"Do you want to do something with me?\" she asked seductively.\n\"Umm, yeah I'd like that,\" I muttered. I knew she was my sister, but I didn't know if I would have this chance again.\nShe ran her hand down my back, sending chills through me.\n\"Okay,\" she replied. \"But it's going to cost you, about tree fiddy.\"\nIt was around this time I realized that my sister was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "It was dark late one night, I was walking home from a friend's house with said friend. We were nearing the end of his neighborhood. He said he'd stop when he got to the end as he needed to go let his dogs out, and I said that was fine, parting ways as I crossed the street and approached the field that separated our neighborhoods. It was definitely private property, but I didn't care, I took risks when I was young and used it as a shortcut instead of walking down several streets to get to mine. \n\nI hop over the wooden fence and proceeded to walk towards the lights of my neighborhood. It was unusually quiet that night, feeling slightly paranoid about my well-being, like I was in some sort of danger, or that I was being followed. I didn't want to look behind me, I thought I was hearing only my footsteps crunching through the grass, but once I stopped walking, the sound of footsteps continued. I slowly turned my head and was mortified to see the silhouette sneaking up on me. Horrified by this, I started to sprint, looking behind me several times to make sure he wasn't too close, but he was hot on my trail. I found a big hill of hay and began to climb onto it, trying to fake the guy out, but he followed me close and I wasn't able to juke him easily. I eventually faked him out at one point, jumping right off the top of the hill and doing a badass tuck and roll maneuver, and he stumbled to follow me again. I finally was able to reach the end of the field and hop over the other fence towards my neighborhood. \n\nI was running out of energy at this point, heart pounding, sweat pouring out of my pores, still heading towards my home. He was still following me as I reached my home and fumbled for my keys. As I finally got my key in, I was frantically trying to unlock it as the man reached me, grabbed me by the shoulders and threw me down on the ground, pinning me down as he did this.\n\n\"What do you want?!\" I screamed, trying to make sense of the situation.\n\nThe silhouette moved their head in closer, eyes meeting mine finally, and whispered, \"I need about treefiddy.\"\n\nThat's when I realized he was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam away into the distance.\n\nI'll never forget that night.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399334589", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 1}

I was a lonely floating euphoric neckbeard. But 10th year is when that all changed. At the time I was really into 4Chan, I worked my way through /b/, /a/, etc. But then one day I went onto the /fa/ board (fashion), and I discovered a whole new world.\n\nI discovered that I didn't have to look like a greasy, pimply, piece of shit. So over the course of 2 weeks, I really got it together. Learned to comb my hair, got glasses that didn't make me look like a pedophile, bought the latest clothes. I was a well oiled machine. \n\nSo once I had gotten out of the ugly-rut, things started to change. People talked to me, girls payed attention, I started to open up socially, I was king. \n\nI got to talking to one girl in particular. Lets, for the purposes of this story, call her, Andrea. When I say started talking I mean we got into it. We would talk about *everything*. Movies, games, books, school, you know the drill. We really go to know each other. Eventually the subject of sex came up, we got to talking and she told me she'd never had sex before. Of course I was a complete virgin as well. I wanted her so bad, just one word and I would have been all over her. Then one day, it was Friday is I remember correctly, Andrea pulled me aside after AP Chem and said something I'll never forget. \"I want something.\" Me being the clueless dope that I was said, \"What?\" (I had no idea what she was implying). Then she said, \"I need about tree fitty\".

{"body": "Finally I have something to contribute! \nOne day me a a few of my friends decided to take an 8 mile hike up a local mountain we live near. Me and my friends, all being 18 at the time and not thinking ahead decide that the inky supplies we should bring along with us are 4 bottles if water and a bag a cheezits. Mind you, there's 4 of us hiking so that divys up to 1 bottle and about 34 cheezits each. \n\nSo morning comes around and we head to the bottom of the mountain as planned. The first thing I thought when we pulled up to this place was \"this looks a little more rugged than the reviews on google said.\" At first I was hesitant but I thought \"screw it, what could go wrong.\" Boy was I in for a surprise. We start traversing this mountain side like were some type of bear grylls cosplayers and all I can think about is how much brush and rock are around us and how little trail was there. \n\nWe clutch up and make it to the top where the mountain plateaus. There are huge rocks and tons of old mattresses and what not. As were scoping out the view we notice a big P on the mountain next to the one we had climbed. That was cool, until we realized that the P was on the mountain we had intended to climb. We all start freaking out and feeling like were badasses because we climbed this mountain that was meant to be climbed. As our celebrations continue one of my friends notices smoke coming from behind one of the rocks. We figured might as well check it out. Here's where it gets weird. We look over this rock and there's a man in a full KKK suit doing some sort of ritual right before us. Before I could think I hear a loud thud. I turn around and 2 of my buddies are running and one is on the ground bleeding from his head. I am tackled and subdued with rope. The man in the hood tells me not to speak unless spoken too. And ask what my last words to my family will be. I could barely think. Let alone come up with a makeshift last words speech. He then went on to tell me that blacks have ruined this country and that I need to pay for what my race has done. \n\nHe then walked over to his bag and pulled out a .44 magnum. I'm pissing my pants at this point knowing I'm going to die up here. He puts the gun to me head and says \"before you die I need one thing from you\" I said anything please just don't shoot me. What do you need. He says in a calm voice \"I need about tree fiddy\" it was at this point that I noticed this man in the KKK suit was a 7 story tall creature from the Paleolithic era. I says \"Damnit monster. I ain't got tree fiddy. Leave me alone\". He says ok and proceeded to let me go\n\nTl;dr: held hostage by a strange man in a KKK suit ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399349674", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First, I would quietly make sure I'd won the money. After all, there's nothing worse than looking like an asshole in front of everyone you know. \n\nI'd quietly talk to an investment lawyer for a while. We'd discuss the best way to store the money, talk about diversifying my portfolio a little. Security would be high on my priority list for this conversation, so I'd be sure to pick a good accountant. Someone that really knew his stuff, knew where to put money, what to invest in - that kind of thing. I'd also make sure to befriend him. I'd chat him up, talk to him about his life. Learn about his kids, his wife, his hobbies. Understand something - this is not out of some creepy desire to know everything about everyone in my life. This is because it is much, much harder for someone to screw you over if they think of you as a friend. I'd be protecting my assets.\n\nI'd take a little more time after this before telling my family and friends to do one very important thing. I would give my girlfriend the perfect proposal. I've been hesitating for far too long now, because there's always something in the way - we're generally close to broke college students, stressed about schoolwork and real work and money. It's never felt quite right, and I've never been able to afford the time and money to go the whole nine yards. A romantic dinner, a walk through the park, a wandering violinist, watching the sunset - everything. I'd propose with a family ring, because I want it to be clear to her that that's what she's becoming, to me and to my family.\n\nAt no point during this would I tell her that I'd won the lottery. Before you say that this is selfish, hear me out. No matter what her response, I would clear her of her debts, clear her single working mother of her debts, and set up an account to put her through med school. This woman means more to me than anything in the world, and I wouldn't want to leash her with something as petty as money before I proposed. No matter what, I would pave her way to do what she wants in the world. She's a damn good person, and I'm not going to make what I do for her dependent on what she does.\n\nWhen the money was secure behind its walls of bank accounts and guardians of law an accountancy, I'd quietly talk to my friends and family. I would sit everyone down in a room and explain that I'd won the lottery, and it had been a big jackpot. I'd explain that I had no interest in being besieged by requests for money, and that, at the same time, I had no interest in holding on to all of my money. I'd go through my family and friends, and find out what they needed. Student loans? Gone. House payments? Gone. Car payments? Gone. \n\nI'd help people move if they wanted it - after all, a house payment doesn't help a lot in the grand scheme of things if you're going to turn around and sell it in two years. I'd also make it clear that this was, mostly, a one time thing. I'd pay for young relatives' schooling when they got there, of course, and I'd help out for emergencies, but I'd make it clear I wasn't a money tap, to be turned on and off at will.\n\nI'd settle down after this - buy a nice house wherever was most convenient, and explore my interests. I'd talk to my accountant a little more (his name is Mike, by the way) and see what it would take to start up a game store. I'd love to run one - gamers have one of the best communities I've ever seen. I'd run that shop like it was my livelihood. \n\nAll this time, I'd be sure to stay friends with Mike the accountant. Maybe we'd start golfing, or shooting pool. Who knows? The point is that he'd be my friend, and the money would be safer because of it.\n\nAs my fiance progressed through med school, I'd continue to explore my interests. I don't really know who I am as a person, what I enjoy - and I'd aim to find that. The money is just a means to an end. I'd move where I pleased - probably where my fiance's work and school took her. We'd grow old together, and have a family. Vacations would be nice and quiet, with all the fun of a normal family.\n\nI'd raise my children to be savvy about the money. They'd know when they were ready (around age 10 or so) that their parents were rich, and I'd be sure to educate them on how to handle that. I'd want to teach them how to be decent people, because that is the most important thing you can teach your child. Money can be a corrupting force, and the worst thing I can imagine is having my own child corrupted by that.\n\nI'd be sure to reach out to Mike once in a while - I've moved around, but he's still my accountant. I wouldn't want to betray someone I thought of as a friend, and he's done a damn good job of looking after the money. It turns out, though, that he's fallen on some hard times. His wife left him, and she got the kids, and the house. He has a crappy apartment now, and a drinking habit to boot. I feel sorry for the guy, but I can't just solve his problems for him by throwing money at them. I set him up with some rich buddies of mine, and he does well out of them - after all, he's damn good at his job, when he's sober.\n\nTime goes on, and all is well. Mike does okay for a few years, but then he drops off my radar in a big way. The money has diversified, and he's no longer really my accountant, through no doing of mine. It just sort of left his control. I decide I'll change that, though, and I call him.\n\n * \"....Hello?\" - Mike\n * \"Hey, Mike, good to hear your voice! Look, I wanted to talk over my accounts with you.\" - Me\n * \"Oh. krutdurk. Good to hear from you. Look, this isn't a great time. Can you maybe drop by tomorrow?\" - Mike\n * \"Uh...sure, I can do that. See you then, Mike.\" - Me\n\nHe sounds drunk, and he seems to have forgotten that I live halfway across the country now. It's no big deal, though, and he needs my help. I'm his friend, so what else can I do?\n\nI book a plane and fly out there the next day. It's drizzling out when I reach his place and ring the doorbell. I stand there, my clothes dampening slowly, until he opens the door. Mike looks goddamn terrible. He's put on at least a hundred pounds, and his dank, greasy hair hangs about his face. He's in a rumpled suit, and his eyes are bloodshot and unfocused. I stare for a second at my old buddy, waiting for him to invite me in. He finally does so, and  I step inside.\n\n * \"So..how are things going, Mike?\" - Me\n * \"Not so great, krutdurk. I uh...well, I sorta picked up a gambling habit. Shit's bad, but it makes me feel alive, you know?\" - Mike\n * \"Uh-huh....\" - Me\n * \"Thing is, I kinda got in over my head. I owe the mob nearly half a million. You gotta help me out, man.\" - Mike\n * \"Look, Mike, you know me - I don't hand out money like that.\" - Me\n * \"Man, just help me! It's three hundred and fifty grand. They're gonna kill me!\" - Mike\n * \"Okay, Mike, calm down. I'm sure I can work something out with them, but you've gotta get yourself together in the meantime.\" - Me\n * \"GET MYSELF TOGETHER? THEY'RE GOING TO KILL ME, AND I'M THE LAST OF MY KIND!\" - Mike\n * \"Last of your...?\" - Me\n\nAnd that was when I notice that my overweight, run-down friend and accountant, Mike, was actually nearly five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era. \n\n * \"Yes, the last of my kind! I just need about tree fiddy!\" - Mike\n\nAs I ran out the door, I yelled one last thing to the towering monster standing behind me in a booze-soaked suit.\n\n * \"Fuck off, Mike!\" - Me", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399426414", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 83, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Story time! This was a few years ago, I had been feeling a little ill for a few days and had been unable to poop. It also happened to be my friend's birthday that same week so as it people do, celebrations needed to be had.\n\nWe decided to meet up at a Montana's steakhouse to have some supper and drinks to celebrate my friend's birthday. Though I was feeling sick, I figured that I would just fight through it, nothing could be that bad right? \n\nSo we go to the restaurant and order our meals, since I am feeling under the weather, I order a salad and a small sandwich, there is no way I am risking getting steak and having an explosion in the restaurant. I also decide to stick with vodka since it does not usually hurt my stomach in the way that beer might.\n\nSo all is well and we get our meals. I eat my food and we order another round of drinks. Around this time my stomach begins to feel funny. I hear it churning and my insides are gurgling. I ask the server if there is any reason that my meal would make me feel sick because I am started to get cold sweats. \n\nAfter checking with the chef, he tells me that there might have been a mistake and my sandwich might have been made with expired mayonnaise. Now it might just have been a reverse placebo effect but at that very moment, I felt like I was going to explode from both extremities. I need to get to a bathroom and fast. \n\nAs I rush to a stall to destroy it beyond any regular means, the waiter comes in and says \"sir I know you are feeling sick but I have to ask you a few questions, you know for regulations' sake, and to see if I need to call an ambulance\".\n\nAt this point I am irritated so I just yell out \"yeah yeah go ahead\", as I prefer to unleash my fury at the toilet. \n\nSo the waiter begins his questioning, were you sick beforehand? Did the sandwich taste bad? Do you feel like you might pass out? \n\nHe gets to his final question, which I will never forget, \"I think we need to call an ambulance sir, you are severely sick right now, but I need to use the public phones and have no change, could you spare about three fiddy?\" Well it was then that I noticed that my waiter the whole night was actually about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. And I said \"god damn Lochness monster, I ain't giving you no three fiddy\". I don't think I had ever been so embarrassed in all my life. \n\nI still think about it and cringe. Worst day of my life. \n\nTLDR: Explosive diarrhea in a public restroom", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399444518", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Sexyyyy.\n* **Sugarplum Fae** Sugared plums with a deeper background to keep it from being just linear sugary plums.\n* **Aurora Borealis** Vanilla'd, sugared berries with a hint of pine and a touch of mint just to \"cool down\" the overall scent.\n\n**Floral (I'm not much of a floral person, but I have one I like, and it's from DM):**\n\n* **Suspiria** Ugh, this is such a sexy, lightly spiced woody floral. Very deep and evocative.\n\n**Fresh &amp; Light:**\n\n* **Aloysius** I used to layer DC's Tapadero, Serpentina, and Mad as Birds, and Aloysius smells like that mixture to me. :D\n* **Nessie** A light, dainty aquatic floral with a touch of salt.\n\n**Resins &amp; Incense:**\n\n* **Incantation** Smells like old, yellowing paper, like an old library, and herbs. Makes me think of a witch's apothecary. :P\n* **Saturnalia** Cranberries and incense. I don't know why, but this is ridiculously addictive for me. Hahaha\n* **Mad as a Hatter** I can only take this scent in small doses, but it's a deep, woody, mossy smokey blend.

From there he progressed pretty quickly and just a few months later a sex swing came in the mail and he was setting it up in his room.\n\nThat weekend we were throwing a party and eager to try it out he showed it off to some of the girls that showed up hoping one would want to try it as well. Eventually people got more drunk and one of them wandered back into his room with him, and about 15 minutes later when I was going to the bathroom I could hear them both calling out \"Help!\" I knocked on the door, it was of course locked, but they said they needed me to come in there somehow - so I butterknifed it open.\n\nI then saw that one of the straps had bound around one of each of their legs and they were dangling there in a mess. I asked what they wanted me to do and my buddy said to squirt some lube into his hand so he could try to slip their legs out of the bind.

{"body": "So listen: last night, I went on. The. Worst. Blind date. I mean, you think you had some bad ones? \"Oh, he only talked about himself! He chewed with his mouth open! He kept calling me 'm'lady' and tipping his stupid hat!\" Nope, I don't wanna hear it. That's baby stuff compared with the clusterfuck I had to sit through. \n\nBut first, some background. I'd been going out with Johnny Moretti for like, what, 8 months? It went alright at first, but then he starts saying he wants me to cook like his Ma, and clean like his Ma, and all this bullshit. And I'm just like, the fuck? You know? He was a nice guy, though. Not to mention he was built like Mark Wahlberg from back in the day. So I'm thinking of breaking it off anyway, but before I do, I find out he's been cheating on my with some fiftysomething broad he met on Craigslist. Right?\n\nSo, long story short, I swore off guys for all of, like, a week. But then my sister, Sharise, says she wants to hook me up with some guy, and I'm like \"No, it's to soon,\" and she's like \"Honey, you're not getting any younger. Plus, Donna from work says she heard he's well endowed, if you know what I mean,\" and I'm like, \"Alright, what the hell?\"\n\nSo anyway, fast forward a week. I get to the restaurant, and it's some seafood joint. Not a huge fan, but whatever. I grab a table for two, and I'm sitting around nursing a cosmo for, like, a full half hour. Typical. Finally, the guy shows up. OK, not what I was expecting. First of all, he's an older guy. Not a big deal, but Sharise knows I don't usually go for them. But also, his body was just sort of...I don't know, outta proportion. He had one of those long, skinny necks, but he was chubby from there down. His eyes were squinty, and his skin? Terrible. But, I think, I'll probably get a free meal out of this, and after a few drinks, who knows?\n\nHe sits down, and I'm suddenly downwind of this awful smell. It's like my Uncle Vinnie's fish market on a hot day. When was the last time this guy showered? I'm starting to regret this more and more, but I figure he must at least have a decent personality. \n\nThen he opens his mouth. He's got some sort of weird European accent going on, so I could barely understand half of what he said. What I did get was that he was some kind of famous swimmer in his home country. I asked him if he was in the Olympics, like that Phelps guy, and you'd have thought I called his mom a whore. He starts getting all shitty about how thousands, no, millions of people would kill to meet him, and I was lucky to even be looking at him right now, let alone having dinner. \n\nWe hadn't even gotten through our appetizers, but I was just like, fuck it, I'm done. I tell him, \"I'm sure that shit flies with your 'fans,' but I ain't dealing with it. I figure my chances of getting him to pay for me just flew out the window, so I lay out the cash for my half. \n\nAll of a sudden, he gives me this embarrassed, sheepish look. I ask him what his problem is, and he says he left his wallet at home, and all he has is some change on him. Great. I sigh and ask him how much he needs, and he says \"about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time I realized my blind date was an 8-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "I have only five minutes to live. On this paper I will share a story I've never shared before. A few years ago, I was engaged. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. We met in university, in math class, and from the moment we saw each other, we couldn't stay away. I had never felt the way I felt with her before. We began dating, and we got to know each other better. We were completely in sync. It truly was like we were made for each other. I began to consider that this might be the woman I marry.\n\nOne night, we went to a party together. She was the designated driver and I didn't want to get too drunk in front of her. I was drinking responsibly, when my friend Gary walked up and challenged me to a drinking game. I tried to refuse, but his slurred obscenities enraged me to the point of accepting just to shove my victory in his face. We got a bottle of tequila and some glasses and turned on the news. Every time the reporter used the term \"cyber\" we had to take a drink. Ten minutes in, we were both wasted.\n\nGary collapsed on the ground and started shaking. I leaned in to get a closer look and his breathing was irregular. I should have known right then that he was in danger. I dragged him to a bedroom and just set him down. If I had the chance to do it over again, I would have saved him. But I didn't. I just left him alone. I checked the next day to find him dead in a puddle of his own vomit. It was that moment that I swore I would never drink again. Seeing a close friend die like that is not something you ever forget.\n\nIn my grief, I began to grow distant from my love. I was emotionally unavailable and it was straining our relationship. Maybe I should have tried harder. Maybe I was simply too broken up over Gary. But we slowly started to drift apart. One night, I went out and bought some drugs and took them all in the living room. When she found me, I was barely concious, flipping through channels. I overdosed, and she took me to the hospital.\n\nEven after Gary, even after everything we had been through, she never left my bedside. When I recovered, I realized that this truly was the love of my life and I could never stand to lose her. The day after I was discharged, I took her on a lovely date at the fanciest restaurant in town. Later that night, I took her up to the rooftop, got down on one knee, and asked her to marry me. She said yes, but that she had a confession she needed to make before she could marry me. I thought I was prepared for anything, but I was not prepared for this. It turned out that this beautiful woman was in fact the goddamned Loch Ness Monster. When I asked her why she would keep this from me, she simply replied \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399536841", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Wait a few minutes, still nothing. I know that students sometimes go to the gym and hide underneath the bleachers for a nap or whatever, so I tell all my students to stay there and go check. Still nothing.\n\nWell, time to face the music and head down to the front office and tell them that I lost a student. I'm walking down the hallway, when all of a sudden I hear giggling coming from the custodial closet. Also, lots of rustling around.\n\nShit. Please no. Please.\n\nI open the door, and yep. The security guard is in there with one of the students. She's sitting on the lowest shelf, her arms up over her head and her hands handcuffed to the shelf above her.

{"body": "So I'm out one day with my wife, just chillin' in the Boston Aquarium area, and I'm like : \"it's hot, I need a drink\". There's a 7/11 nearby, I go in, and I'm looking for my Arizona Watermelon can. Then I see Shaq's clown face all over and I'm thinking: \"Who's brain damaged mind would ruin my favorite Arizona drink with Shaq's ugly face?\"\n\nBut I've been playing basketball for 20 years, there's no way I'm not buying a drink with Shaq's face on it, right? I'm thirsty, but now I'm too curious. \"How bad can it be?\", I kept telling myself. So I got the Shaq Cream Soda, fully prepared to throw it in the trashcan after the first sip. Alright, I'm outside, I'm mentally prepared for the experience and I take the \"I'm gonna do this\" stance. Abs tight, I leaned forward ever so slightly in case I need to spill the drink and avoid messing up my shoes. I carefully take the sip.\n\nMy mind was not prepared for this. That sip was so many things at once. It was sweet, it was vanilla, it was creamy, but most importantly, it was so goddamn nostalgic. You know that warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you have a trip down memory lane, and you just stand there looking like an idiot having a seizure, with that big grin on your face? Yeah, that was me. \n\nI was taken back to when I was 15 years old, when on Saturdays we'd have 4 hours of basketball and volleyball training. After practice, we'd buy these miserable drinks for 25 soviet cents, which must have been made from raw Chernobyl leftover Uranium. These semi-transparent, sugar-loaded things were pissed into a cup by the most rusty ass communist soda machines you can imagine. But hey, at 15, dehydrated after practice, you'd drink *anything*. So everyone from the team formed a circle and enjoyed a nice cup of soviet Cream Soda in silence. Then we'd say goodbye until the next training.\n\nThe team's all over the globe now, I haven't seen them in decades. Those skinny children have kids now. Some of them have passed away. But in that second there, I went back to childhood and saw them again, jumping, dunking and laughing hysterically.\n\nMy wife didn't get it. She tasted it and said: \"you'll get diabetes\". I didn't care. I chugged the whole thing, and bought another one from the store. The next weekend they were gone, and I've never had another one since then. I don't know if it was a promotion or what, but I'd spend all of my money on these drinks. \"How much is that?\", you ask? Well, about tree fiddy, if I had to guess.\n\nAnd that's how life is, kids. You meet people, you have your fun, and then they die. All you have left is an empty can of Shaq Cream Soda in your hand and a whole bag of memories, and every once in a while you stop to look into this bag, only to find yourself alone in the cold darkness, with only the faint shadows of your childhood friends keeping you warm inside.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399565191", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 146, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sometimes my sense of humor is just a bit too bizarre.\n\nHumor, by its very nature, is an attempt at connecting (and occasionally commiserating) with people, and as a result, it has to be intrinsically relatable. For example, the feeling of getting kicked in the dangly bits is something that most men can understand, which prompts us to laugh when we picture Justin Bieber straddling a toaster. \n\nMost of the time, I don't have much of a problem with humor... but every so often, I'll go *way* beyond an approachable joke, completely off the deep end, and end up crashing into some poor kid's sand castle.\n\nSeveral months ago, I started spreading a lot of hype for a creative project that I was undertaking. Every time that an opportunity presented itself, I'd drop hints about it, insinuating that the final result would be the funniest thing ever to grace the Internet. While I did honestly think that people would find it amusing, the truth of the matter is that the hype was *part of the joke*.\n\nSee, you've likely encountered a \"Loch Ness Monster Story\" before. It starts with a lot of buildup and a bunch of details, and then ends with an intentionally absurd let-down. It's the Internet equivalent of a \"Shaggy Dog Story,\" which is a long-winded joke that ends with a bad pun. (\"Better Nate Than Lever\" is a popular example.) I've always loved Shaggy Dog Stories. Hell, I started a minor trend with them back in my days on 4Chan, when I posted a tale about having slept with my teacher... who turned out to be a grizzly bear. My latest attempt - with the hype and the post in question - was supposed to be a sort of meta-commentary in addition to a standalone joke. \n\nIt was, in essence, a Shaggy Dog Story that was the punchline *to* a Shaggy Dog Story, followed by a dramatization of how the Internet typically reacts to being tricked by one. (Namely, a pun thread.)\n\nI spent close to $400 on the project. I learned an entirely new skill, researched formatting standards for comic books, and even sustained a fairly painful injury, all in preparation for this joke. Also, I wasn't quiet about mentioning those details, since they added to the hype. Then, when I finally released the finished work... it completely flopped. People were *furious* with me (which I thought was hysterical), and there are some folks who *still* won't let me live it down.\n\nThe people who were in on the joke (or who recognized it) thought the entire thing was funny as hell. Unfortunately, as I said, humor needs to be relatable... and most people just couldn't relate.\n\nI guess I should have gone with a fart joke, huh?\n\n**TL;DR: Andy Kaufman is my spirit animal.**\n\n*If you'd like to see the project in question, you can view it [here](http://imgur.com/a/5T7gy).

{"body": "Ok so I did not write this story, all credit goes to /u/red321red321, but it fits this prompt well and shows how something like this can turn out.\n\nTL;DR: The internet is a very scary place for young girls and you should be insanely careful about what you post on reddit and anywhere else.\n\nI have never posted nude pics online but I have an incredibly disturbing story to tell about a girl who posted to /r/gonewild that I recognized. I know that the OP here is asking for funny ways of telling people that they were recognized but I have been thinking hard lately about whether or not I ever want to share this story with reddit and this seems like a pretty good thread to share it in. For all of you /r/gonewild girls out there and those of you who have thought about posting nude photos of yourself, let this serve as a cautionary tale...\n\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\n\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\n\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was.\n\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to /r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was insanely open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about.\n\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her /r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her.

{"body": "When I was 20, I started dating a girl who there was instant chemistry with. We had similar interests, a similar outlook on life, and she was low-maintenance. I swore after the first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance.\nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. I won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. Besides the fact that I was studying for a medical-related track (kinesiology) and therefore had to take classes in that type of thing, I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable.\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime.\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives.\nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\"\nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\"\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a land-dwelling crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed.\nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that.

The kids were getting anxious when finally, the airline opens the door and begins boarding. We board the plane and take off without a hitch, discluding the large smelly guy who was seated between me and my wife and refused to switch seats. An hour or so into the flight, we make a sharp 180-degree turn and head South back towards Malaysia instead of North towards China. We were all confused, but the flight attendants offered no answers and the pilots made no announcements over the intercom. We didn't think much of the incident and enjoyed a smooth, peaceful flight. All of a sudden, I hear the whine of the engines die out. We start gliding towards the ocean below us as the oxygen masks deploy. The passengers are going crazy at this point, crying frantically. The pilot attempted to make a landing in the ocean, but the tail end of the plane disintegrated as soon as it made contact with the ocean. My two sons, gone in an instant. Luckily, my wife and I were merely 2 rows ahead of the section of the fuselage that was destroyed. Because we're all buckled into our seats, we can't escape the sinking plane. However, just as passengers are taking their final gasps of air, I hear a voice. **\"Hello! Everyone remain calm. You will all be rescued.\"** Great googily moogily, I thought to myself. **\"But first, I'm going to need about tree fiddy,\"** exclaimed the voice.

The abominable snowman came forward in a hunched over rush, stopping behind the bull dozer mound.\n\n\"I hate it when you call me that, Foots. Abby is a woman's name.\" The Snowman complained. His pristine white coat of fur had been greyed with ash. The camoflauge he wore made his thick coat of fur stick out in tufts above and below.\n\n\"Sorry, bro. I won't call you that again.\" Bigfoot had a smile on his face that said otherwise. Abby noticed but before he could call him out on it, Foots raised his field glasses to his eyes and raised a closed fist, calling for silence. \"Its the entrance to Nessy's secret lab.\" Foots said, passing the glasses to Abby and pointing toward the fissure in the rocks ahead.\n\n\"Three guards.\" Abby told him. Foots just smiled and gestured for his partner to take the right flank. Foots disappeared into the fauna and vanished after only a few feet. \"I could do that.\" Abby boasted under his breath, knowing how conspicous his white fur made him. He swung the AR 15 on his back around to a ready position and screwed the silencer on. He vanished into the forest, though not as complete as Foots had.\n\nThe guards weren't really problem. There was a fourth sentry behind a jumble of stone they hadn't noticed. Foots fell on the first two from on high, grabbing a skull in each hand and squeezing. The third sentry reacted predictably, turning and raising his own rifle. There was a hushed cough from the AR 15 in Abby's hands and the guard hesitated to look down at the smoking hole in his chest. The fourth guard made a rush for the alarm, but Abby chased him down with a deal trail of lead. The man spun to his right, landed hard, coughed up a fountain of blood and died.\n\nFoots wiped off the gore from the sentry's skull on the back of Abby's fatigues and surveyed the scene even as Abby rushed forward to deal with the key pad.\n\n\"That was easy.\" Foots quipped, swinging his own AR 15 around in preparation for the breach. Abby had the keypad open in seconds and quickly hot wired the security lock. The was a click and whine as the heavy door blocking their way slowly slide aside. \"Great job, Abby.\" Foots told his comrade in arms before slipping through the opening door. Abby tucked his tools away, grimaced at Foots continued use of the feminine nickname and hurried in after.\n\n\"We meet again.\" A booming voice said in greeting. The each hugged a wall out of reflex, gripping their silenced rifles tightly. \n\n\"That you Nessy?\" Foots called, glancing to his partner. Abby shook his head and held up one finger.\n\n\"No, Mr. Foots. I'm here to make sure you never get close to Mr. Ness.\" The mysterious voice announced ominously. Foots smiled.\n\n\"Mr. Chu, I presume.\" Foots called out, guessing accurately that the voice belonged to Nessy's Lieutenant. He risked a glance and saw the Chupacabra surrounded by Jersey Devil footmen. Mr. Chu was easy to spot. He was the one wearing the monicle.\n\n\"Indeed.\" Mr. Chu replied. He sent Devils out to either side to hunt down the intruders.\n\n\"You know, the monicle is really cliche.\" The Abominable Snowman called out.\n\n\"Is that you, Abby?\" Mr. Chu called with laughter in his voice.\n\n\"The names not Abby?\" The Snowman cried in anger, popping out from the wall just long enough to mow down a cluster of Devils guarding the Chupacabra. Mr. Chu leapt over the barrage and came down behind a crate. He pulled out two nickel plated forty-fives and laughed.\n\n\"Temper. Temper.\" He sang. Foots gave Abby a look, shook his head and followed suit, mowing down two more henchmen. The Devil's responded by turning the crates around the pair into toothpicks. Foots and Abby exchanged fire with the henchmen even as they sprinted for better cover. Devils dropped. Foots took a bullet through the hand. Abby was shot several times, but due to the fluffy quality of his fur, the shots missed flesh every time.\n\nAfter ten minutes of battle, three Devils were left. Foots and Abby had gotten seperated in the warehouse of crates. Mr. Chu was hunting them while they hunted him. No shots had been fired for several moments as everyone went to ground. Foots was the first to encounter the henchmen. He seized one by the throat and threw him like a baseball into the emerging face of another Jersey Devil. The two collided with a wet soppy sound. Neither rose again.\n\n\"Foots! Behind you.\" Abby called, diving through a space between two crates. Bigfoot turned just in time to see the last Devil emerge from the shadows. His gun was already spraying lead, but was missing Foots by several feet. The Devil quickly corrected his aim, but not before Abby squeezed off two rounds. The second of which took the devil between the eyes.\n\n\"Die, Mr. Foots.\" Mr. Chu shouted, leaping atop a crate overlooking Foots position. Bigfoot half turned before seeing that the Chupacabra had the drop on him. His nickel-plated forty-fives were both trained on the side of his head. \n\n\"I got him, Foots.\" Abby called, training his AR 15 on Mr. Chu.\n\n\"Not so fast,\" A deep booming voice called out. A gun barrel the size baseball bat came sliding out from between two walls of crates and was aimed at Abby. Nessy was big. His gun was big. Bigfoot trained his rifle on the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n\"Looks like we have ourselves a . . . Mexican standoff.\" Mr. Chu announced. Foots was the first to snicker, then Abby, followed by Nessy. Even Mr. Chu smirked at his choice of words.\n\n\"This isn't a very lovely position I find myself in.\" Abby commented.\n\n\"Jokes aside,\" Foots called, this is a no win situation for any of us.\n\n\"What do you suggest?\" Mr. Chu inquired.\n\n\"A truce?\" Nessy suggested.\n\n\"We should have this fight on a different day.\" Foots agreed. \"What's it gonna take for you to let us walk out of here?\" Abby started coming to his feet slowly.\n\n\"What you think, boss? What's it gonna take to end this?\" Mr. Chu quizzed.\n\nNessy relaxed. \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399663060", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

He grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and screamed, \"You can take all of your fucking money, but I'm keeping this!\"  I looked down into his hand, and saw exactly three dollars and fifty cents.

I'm a little fuzzy on the details, but to my understanding this guy walked in through one of the doors in the back of the cafeteria posing as a parent that was late. He took his seat in the back and watched the program normally (can't recall what it was). Everyone was gathered in one place, so it would be easy to gain control for him. About halfway through the program, shots rang out behind us. Confusion and pandemonium ensued. Everyone was panicked and screaming. Kids were crying, hell, even some of the teachers. He finally calms everyone down and hops on the stage. He tells everyone to be calm, and that nobody will be injured if they cooperate. He had all of the blinds closed so nobody could see in, and all of the doors to the school locked. He waited around and thought about what his next move was. Apparently he hadn't thought it out too well. After what seemed like hours, we hear sirens outside. Someone across  the street had heard gunfire and called the police. Again, it seemed like forever before they actually did anything. A negotiator had a megaphone, and was talking to us. He said that they could negotiate a deal. He offered him whatever he wanted if everyone was returned unharmed. His only request...was about tree fiddy. That's when we realized he was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

This happened about three years ago.\n \nI was in university at the time while living with my girlfriend who was working full time.  I had a few night classes because it was the only time they were offered so our schedules often didn't sync up (I would be home and she wouldn't be and vice versa).\n \nI got invited into a study group for my upper year physics course and the one girl from the class who was one of those cute little Asian nerdy girls that you just know reads manga and stuff was part of the group.  We hit it off pretty quickly but I kept it together.  We spent tons of time studying around December for exams and had to spend nights at the library in the group.  It wasn't a big deal though since it was a big group and nothing came of it.\n \nNext semester she's in another one of my classes but the rest of the group wasn't so we ended up continuing our study group just the two of us.  Since it was just two of us we kept studying but at each other's houses.  One thing led to another and soon we were augmenting our study sessions with sex sessions.  As I said the gf and I had different schedules so it was easy to get away with.\n \nOne day she came home early and caught me in bed with my study partner.  She was shocked at first but ended up not being angry.  We had talked about threesomes for a while and while I know she was hurt she also seemed really turned on.\n \nShe didn't say a word and climbed onto the bed.  I wasn't sure if she was going to kill the other girl but instead she just starts kissing her.

She asked me if I liked her butt and I told her I did, as she began to slowly take off her short shorts, she seductively whispers, \"I want something from you, I need it bad\". \"Anything\" I respond, she then says \"I need about tree fiddy\" it was about this point in time that I noticed that she was not my teacher but in fact she was a five hundred foot tall monster from the paleolithic era.

Finally I thought of my question:\n\n\"Well I guess I would hope that we can answer the question of if human life can be preserved/revived.\"\n\nAfter saying it I realized how ridiculous it sounded. I mean, that's some straight up Frankenstein shit, but wouldn't you want to bring back the loved ones who you have lost? OR if you had a terminal illness, wouldn't you want there to be a way that your body could be frozen and reanimated when the cure was created?

Weird question, but interesting,\" and he went back to eating.\n\n I asked him the same question and he said, \"I really want to know if we are the only ones in this huge universe. It mind boggling to think we might be the only ones, so I wanna know if we are or not.\" \n\n\"Heck ya that's a good question to ask man.

{"body": "I graduated summa cum laude in education at a prestigious university, and here is a story about one of the students that surprised me the most. He was a lazy scumbag, sat in the back of class, and never did his homework. His parents seemed not to be concerned that their son was failing my class most of the year. I had scheduled several meetings between his parents, our school guidance counselor, and I, but they never showed up. I had to call his parents after a particularly rough day, but they insisted that their child could never have done anything wrong. He was a plain out asshole. It I think he had some potential, even though academically he was a failure. I later heard that he got a 32 on his ACT, and I was so proud to hear that he had done that well. Many years pass, and I leave that school and take another teaching position. I don't hear anything about him for many years, until one day I see him shopping at our local big box store. I almost was  sure if it was him or not, so I asked if he graduated from XXX High School. He said yes, and I was elated to meet one of my former students. I asked him how he was doing and shook his hand, which felt a bit slimy at first. He told me that he got a degree and is doing marine research in Scotland. I was so proud to hear that! I asked him how much he was making a year to which he replied \"about tree fiddy.\" It was at that point that I realized my student was actually the Loch Ness Monster.

{"body": "Oh man.. I found my thread. This is how I lost my virginity...\n\nSo... I was in 9th grade and my sister was in 11th. I don't want to sound rude talking about her... but she was kind of a slut. By the age of 17 she had already slept with at least 7 guys (that I knew of) and had to have an abortion when she was 15. I don't know what age she lost her virginity but I'd imagine it was around 12-13.\n\nMe on the otherhand was a virgin who had kissed a girl a few times but had never made out with someone before. I always thought my sister was attractive but never voiced it because that's very socially frowned upon and I never thought anything would come of it. \n\nMy sister and I had a pretty good relationship together. We weren't very close but we talked often and joked around a lot. Sometimes she's rant to me about how her current boyfriend was being a jerk or whatever and I'd listen and be nice. (In hindsight maybe it was because I found her attractive.) \n\nOne day in 9th grade me and my sister ended up having a conversation in which I admitted I was a virgin and for some reason my sister was shocked. She kept saying, \"No, seriously. I tell you stuff all the time you can't lie like that. You have to tell me.\" and I kept insisting that I was a virgin. (Because I was) \n\nWhat my sister said after I had told her I was a virgin for the 40th freakin' time shocked me. She said, \"Well Thehealeroftri, I could probably fix that for you. We just can't tell anyone.. hehe\" and she winked.\n\nAt first I thought she was joking and I said, \"Haha, very funny. Stop mocking me\" but she kept insisting that because mom and dad weren't home she could take my virginity from me and give me a head start in high school when it came to women.\n\nI was a horny 9th grader... I think in my current state of mind I wouldn't have done it but man I was a horny 9th grader and my sister was a 9/10. The only thing she didn't have was a nice ass but she had everything else. I'm confused on how she turned out so great and I turned out so... average.\n\nAnyways.. so we go to her bedroom and she hands me a condom. I couldn't believe this was happening but it was. I'd pinch myself and she was still there.\n\nSo we started making out and it was a little weird so my sister stopped and said, \"Just taking off those fucking clothes\" \n\nSo I did.\n\nEventually we were both butt naked and I had the biggest boner I'd ever had in my entire life. We were lying on the bed and she helped me put the condom on then she climbed on top of me.\n\nI wish I could say I lasted longer than 30 seconds but I didn't. I still remember her perfect tits bouncing up and down as she rode me. Her face as she bit her lower lip while bouncing on top of me. I came in a very short amount of time and she rolled over and said, \"So how do you like that?\" \n\n\"It was amazing.\" I said. I couldn't believe I just lost my virginity... to my older sister nonetheless. \n\n\"You can't tell anyone!\" she said. She kept saying it over and over in different ways so I would get the message. I got up and got dressed all while promising her I'd never tell anyone and as I was about to leave she stopped me and said, \"You're not going to tell anyone, right?\" \n\n\"Of course not,\" I said. I turned to walk about when she said again, \"Wait. I need something before you go....\" \n\nI was suddenly horny again because I assumed she wanted round two or something so I said, \"What do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that my sister was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Goddamnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nMy relationship with my sister didn't really change after that even though she did seem a little more... sexual with me after that incident. \n\nMy parents never found out as far as I know nor did any of my other siblings. I've never told anyone (Except for my best, best friend in high school and he didn't believe me) but I guess now I've told Reddit. Oh well.\n\ntl;dr: Sister is a slut and steals virginity then something unexpected happens\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399769022", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Tons of dudes in our clan were super possessive about her\n\nWe would casually chat every once in a while, and became pretty good friends, and then entered pseudo-relationship territory. Of course everybody else in the clan knew about it, and typical passive-aggressive behavior was had. In an off-hand comment I mentioned the city I live in, and she said \"You live in X, Texas? Holy shit, me too!\" \"Wanna meet up?\" \"Sounds good to me!\"\n\nSo I give her my address and in about a week she shows up at my doorstep with a roller-suitcase and a computer. I thought it was kinda weird, but I wanted to hear her out before I turned her away (remember, lonely neckbeard with no experience with women). She told me that her parents had kicked her out of their house and she needed a place to stay for a while. \n\nWe were pretty good friends, and kinda had a thing going already so I decided to let her stay for a while and BOY were those first few days an experience. We smooshed and played WOW almost non-stop. \n\nThat didn't last for very long though...\n\nThree days later I get a knock on the door. It was her dad. Apparently Rainbow had not been entirely honest with me. Instead of being 20 years old, she was actually 16 years old. And instead of being from X, Texas she was from Charleston, South Carolina. \n\nI was floored. It broke my heart that I knew our relationship would end so soon. Her dad didn't blame me for anything and was a pretty nice guy. Rainbow finally came clean about everything and packed up her bags and computer. \n\nHer dad gave us a little time to say goodbye while he loaded her stuff into the taxi when she turns to me and says something I will never forget... \"Ten, I'm really sorry it's not going to work out. I know I've put you through a lot but I need to tell you something before I go.\" \"What Is it?\" \"Can you spare about three fifty?\" Well it was about then that I noticed that the girl I fell in love with was actually 500 feet tall and a monster from the paleolithic era. Well I was angry, I said, \"god damn loch ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nShe turned to her dad, who gave her a nod, gave me a peck on the cheek, and left for good.

The first house in the residential area had a group of kids playing basketball and while they were playing, their ball went out of bounds toward the street she was about to enter the neighborhood on. I was ecstatic; *Yes! The stars have aligned! I'm going to go get the ball and stop her enough to talk to her, all while looking fit and looking like a dude who's great with kids!* Unfortunately, the kids must have known her because as she entered the neighborhood, they were waving at her and her at them. She didn't see me and didn't hit the breaks. *BAM!* She just fucking drills me with her little TT. I broke over 20 bones in my body including my spine. I went unconscious right away, though, and woke up in the hospital with her bawling her eyes out next to my hospital bed. They wanted to see if I was paralyzed since they knew my spine was broken and asked who my insurance provider was.

{"body": "This happened to me when I was a sophmore. \r\rSo, I was doing what I usually do on my average day at school, go to zero period Jazz Band. It was pretty cool, played some head charts and had a pretty good time. I went through all the classes, finally reaching lunch. Now at my school, we have a thing called the Lunch Pass. Now this is like a shitty school drivers license, and it has my picture on it. Now, this lunch pass allows you to go outside for food and very few in my grade level had one. I did, and so did my best friend. But he left his at home that day. I hate going outside alone since its kinda bland and awkward, but if I had known what was coming next I swear I would have gone in a second.\r\rSo I spend the next two minutes finding someone else to go outside with, to no avail. I had given up and was just gonna stay inside until my friend Rashid asked me to buy him a loaded griller. Now, I usually don't just go outside for someone else, but Rashid is special. He's our eternal leader. But that's a story for a different time. Anyway, so I go outside to go to Taco Bell. While I'm waiting in line I see a nice girl standing in front of me. This girl just happened to be in my Spanish class, yet I never got to talk her often. So I decided I would, and fuck was she prettier when j got to know her. So we talked for a while, and after this I asked her if we could hang after school. She said sure, and this is where things got interesting.\r\rSo after we hang out, I meet her after school, running away from track practice, and we start the walk home. Now, its important to note that I was really attracted  to her and I wanted to show this, and when I got home I tried to be as romantic as a fifteen year old can be. While doing this, we are about to get it on when she pokes a whole through my condom with her bracket. Blue balls soon to come, I thought with my dick and came to the conclusion that, we needed to walk to 7-11 and buy more. So we walk there together and I'm at the register ready to buy my condoms. And I do, right size and everything, and I'm  ready to go. Now my girl has a bag of Fritos and a powerade in her hand. She asks me, \"hey can you help me pay for this?\" I said \"yeah, how much do you need?\" \"I'mma need 'bout tree fiddy.\" It was at this moment that I realized that the girl in my Spanish class was actually a giant creature from the Paleolithic era. And I said \"god dammit monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy.\" And that's how I got the blue balls to end all blue balls, and became a legend at my school.\r\rEdit: Typo", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399785541", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Warning, this story rambles considerably, 90% of it is me reminiscing an incredibly interesing night and 100% of it is useless information. But then again, it's reddit. This isn't a tree fiddy. \n\nI'm not a drinker, well not anymore. Both of my parents are alcoholics, and I tried to drink casually for awhile but I always was the guy who lost his pants and regretted himself in the morning so i stopped.\n\nI went to a house warming party with, lets call her \"flying squirrel\". Well Flying Squirrel and I were hanging out the whole night,  she was sisters with one of the party throwers and we were planning on staying the night with half of the people there since she was my ride and I was her company. \n\n30 minutes after we get there, the hottest man I've ever laid eyes on walks into the room. The sun was just going down and gave him a bit of an aura, right when he was pulling off his sunglasses. He had a flower in his hand and a white button up shirt that was open enough to show a bit of chest hair. I later find out he is Bolivian, Getting a PHD in genetics and was probably 3x as smart and 20x as hot as I would ever be. Let's call him \"Sexy chest\". \n\nAfter some of the older people left, thats when the party started getting a bit crazy. I walked outside for a cigarette and come back inside to see people on the top of chairs and tables triple fisting and double fisting drinks. To each their own right? Flying Squirrel at this point was loosening up, and so she came out for a smoke with me after a bit more drinking and started confiding to me in that drunken way that only makes sense if you understand the situation somewhat already. \n\nFlying squirrels sister and her sisters roommates were all teachers  The roommates were already drunk before I got there and they didn't stop drinking and kept up with everyone else.\n\nNow to the meat of the story: Nothing good ever happens after 2:00am. Flying squirrel and her sister go upstairs, I go up there with sexy chest right behind me and theyre bawling their eyes out, I grab them water and give them both hugs. I go back downstairs to grab a water for myself I turn around and see the drunkest girl at the party saying she's ready to go home. She was supposed to stay there that night and said she lived 10 minutes away and she was planning on driving there. \n\nI could be an asshole and not say anything and let her go, everyone else was so drunk they didnt even give a fuck. I'm not an asshole though so I told her she shouldn't drive anywhere.\n\nMore useless context: The number of Dui's in that room was incredibly high. Not everyone had one, but the amount of them just shocked me since I never was around people who would drive home drunk. \n\nI kept her busy for a bit by asking her a few questions that she could talk about for a bit then I asked her about her car and what her keys looked like making up an excuse that I really like cars and I heard the car she had something cool on it (I don't know grasping at straws here but it worked out). She stumbles across the room to her purse grabs it, slurs something incomprehensible and digs into her purse for keys and hands them to me, I said thanks and told her I'll be holding onto these in the morning. She got mad. \n\nI turn to find sexy chest, he was pretty drunk way too drunk to drive but yet he was still able to have an intelligent conversation with me. He wasn't there.\n\nI look outside and there he is and he said he thinks his car got towed.  Shit. He was worried, he had a performance car and tow companies won't always be as gentle as they need to be when it comes to towing expensive vehicles. I find the tow place for the area and we give them a call. It's a flat rate and not hourly so he would be fine to pick it up in the morning. Flying squirrel comes down, i give her a smoke and she sucks it down with red puffy cheeks. Flying squirrels sister comes out and says I need to give her the keys back or the girl is gonna call the cops. I told her if she wants to call the cops she can, but it's not gonna be like the cops wouldn't side with me. We ask if her husband would pick her up she starts bawling her eyes out. We all look at eachother and didn't understand. She walks outside and one of the drunken teachers followers her. She comes back in says she called her mom to pick her up and get her to her house while still saying she was fine the whole time. She waits outside for 15 minutes comes back inside and sits down infront of the door and falls flat on her back. Now at this point if no one believed me that she was incredibly unfit to drive then their minds were changed. She was still upset at me, but I told her, you can hate me tonight, you can hate me tomorrow, but one day you'll look back at this night, realize what I did was right.\n\nAfter her mother came and picked her up We sit in their living room,  and get ready for bed, the couch was for a guy with braces the rooms were taken already so me and Flying squirrel had the futon. She talks to me about the situation a bit more and I give her encouragement. We fall asleep and wake up in the morning drop off sexy chest to the tow truck, and just at the point where I didn't think that man could get any hotter, he pulls out of the towing place with a sleek black car, aviators on his head and that millionaire smile showing pearly whites.\n\nI probably won't see anyone again except flying squirrel and her sister, but that night made me feel secure about my decision to never drink again, if I wasn't on top of things, people couldve gotten hurt of killed, friends would have been saddened and strangers would have woken up to being in an Ashton Kutcher knock off of \"Dude, wheres my Car?\"\n\nI can't drink, but I can be a friend to those who need one.\n\nTl;dr: A fun housewarming party turns sour as 3 different problems arise.

I regret that I only have one upvote to give, because they cost around tree fiddy. But I was not disappointed.\n\nWait, why do I have you tagged as this post is tagged? What did I just read? Dafaq? How is this WTF? Seriously, YOU HAD ONE JOB. And because of this, I can't fap to this. It's totally not my cakeday, so whatever you're doing, stahp. For science.\n\nOkay, that's enough internet for me today. -2/10 would not bang or even hug. Really, what is this I don't even... /r/circlejerk must be leaking. Better lawyer up, delete my Facebook, and hit the gym... Said no one ever. I do have the weirdest boner right now, though. However, directions were unclear, as my dick is now stuck in my own mouth, as I laughed much harder than I should have. It's almost like Reddit is thousands of different people with thousands of different opinions. But, get ready for this. Plot twist: Step one: be attractive. Step two: don't be unattractive. Can confirm, I am attractive. I have two broken arms, a combox, a pair of cumboxers, a great jolly rancher, my cat Wednesday, a bag of Doritos, Colby, a bad case of Dagobah (Ass Injection Infection), a hambeast, a shitfisting potato, and vaginal bacon.\n\nEdit: wow I can't believe my top comment is about potentially being on the front page, even though it wasn't my first post.

{"body": "I went into my local fedoramaker's shoppe. A humble place of small dimensions, it smelled of leather and fine tobacco. \n\nThe old man who usually took my hats was gone that day. In his place, behind the front desk, sat a far maiden in an MLP t-shirt. My heart leapt: her beauty was undeniable. Her face seemed to press itself on my memory even as I uttered a flustered *Good day.* \n\nAs I handed her my well-worn trilby to be repaired, I felt bashful and without identity, like a knight without his armor. Still, I gathered courage. \"M'lady,\" I continued, \"Wouldst thou accompany me to m'local coffee shop this Saturday next?\" I don't have to tell you gentlemen the joy I felt when she assented. Her beauty increased: her cheeks glowed like embers, she caught her breath. She, too, had become more bashful, like a goddess discovered sleeping in one's garden. \n\nSaturday came and I rose early, about 10am, and neatly pressed my finest trenchcoat, ironed my neckbeard, and chose my finest cargo shorts for the day's events. I carefully selected my favorite fedora -- an old Stetson of the \"Indy\" variety, I recall its sloping brim well -- and made my way to m'local cafe. \n\nM'lady arrived on the dot, noon sharp. Her beauty seemed to have intensified: I need not tell you gents that Paris of Troy could scarcely have felt more desire for Diana than I felt that day for m'lady. She was radiant in another MLP shirt, her eyes sparkling. We drank mochacchinos and talked of any subject that crossed my mind: Politics (I spoke long and forcefully about libertarianism and America's need for a Ron Paul figure as president); gaming (I informed m'lady that Gabe Newell was a cad and a miscreant); and about how lame my mother is for threatening to cut off Doritos privilege a fortnight before. I need hardly tell you that she was fascinated by my words, showing an intense interest at all I had to say. \n\nWhen our date ended, m'lady seemed sad. A tear formed at the corner of her eye as we parted ways. I brushed it from her glowing cheek. She looked at me intensely, a fire seeming to burn in her eyes. \"Meet me at the fedoramaker's tomorrow evening,\" she said. \"The old fedoramaker is a crook and steals my money if my work is not perfect\" -- (Ah, methought, so that is why my fedoras always seem to come back even better than before) -- \"and I want to run away with you.\" We kissed -- ah fairest Aphrodite! -- and parted into the night, as though the tryst had never occurred. \n\nThe next day I could scarcely keep my thoughts together. I packed a suitcase with my favorite MLP dolls, donned my best samurai sword, and informed Mother that she should fuck off, that I was going to be with m'lady from now on. I hastily grabbed a few bags of Doritos and made my way to the miliner's. \n\nWhen I arrived at the fedoramakers, m'lady was nowhere to be found. The storefront was dark. I drew m'sword and wandered into the back. A smell of the tomb greeted m'nostrils. So this is where the old fedora maker lives, eh? I thought to myself. \n\nSuddenly a deep bass resounded through the building. \"Fool,\" it said.\" You dare challenge me??\" What I saw that day I can scarcely relate, it be so foreign to what I had ever seen. Great tentacles swirled about the room, and above them red eyes like burning coals seem to stare into my very being. \"Tree fiddy,\" the beast said to me. \n\nI jumped into action, using my samurai sword to slice off one of the beast's limbs. It howled in pain. Its eyes glowed brighter. A sharp pain radiated from my ear: the beast had hit me with one of its tentacles. But it was too slow: with another slice, a tentacle fell to the ground. I leapt forward, running my blade to the hilt into where I imagined the beast's heart to be. A great gurgling sound like a hot tub being emptied emerged from its jagged mouth. \"You fool!\" the beast said, and expired.\n\nIn the back of the shop I could hear a voice. Making my way through corridors of satanic design, I could make out m'lady's call. At the very back stood a sacrificial altar on which m'lady lay. With m'blade, I cut the thick ropes that kept her to the altar, and gave her my trenchcoat to warm herself.\n\nI need not tell you gents that we married, and after a bit of cojoling were able to work out a deal with my (admittedly hated) Mother to rent out space in her basement.

{"body": "When my son was in the 3rd grade he was diagnosed with cancer.\nIt was an absolute shock to all of our family, and we couldn't have seen it coming from a mile away. Months went by and his chemo didn't really work that well, he was getting worse and worse as the days went by and our family had pretty much given up hope, and my son was kind of content with dying he said. Sad time for us all.\n\nThere was one last hope though, our doctor was apparently part of some medical testing group that had their hands on a new type of treatment for the cancer that was similar to chemotherapy but didn't have as bad of side effects as the other, more commonly used chemotherapy had.\nSo, we decided we'd give it a shot, we didn't have much to lose anyways. The doctor guided us step by step on how to care for him following the chemotherapy and even helped us move into a new house while he was our doctor. (We moved closer to the hospital so we could get better healthcare than at our local clinic, we used to live in a pretty small town)\n\nOver time, his diagnosis got better and better, about 5 months later it was as if he no longer had cancer at all, he was healthy enough to run around and play sports, it was as if the cancer had never even happened. Everyone in our family was overjoyed.\nBack at the doctors office, I was worrying and worrying over what the bill was going to be, I mean.. new treatment.. not only that but it worked.. and extremely well at that.\n\nThe doctor came up to me and I asked, \"So, will my insurance cover any of the costs?\" and he replied, \"yes, most of it actually.\" I was relieved,but who knows how much money would be left... Then he said \"I've been touched by your little boy, and me and my nurses have gathered enough money to pay off the rest of the costs.\nI couldn't believe it. I started to walk away in disbelieve when I heard the doctor say, \"Oh, one moment, wait\" I turned around and said \"Yeah?\" he said, \"I need just one thing from you though.\" Confused by what he would need I asked, \"What do you need?\" The doctor said, \"I need about Tree Fiddy\" Now it was around this time when I realized the doctor was 7 stories tall and was actually a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamn Nessie! That goddamn Loch Ness monster had gotten me again. I stood there screaming at him about who was going to pay my bills as he swam into the distance.\n\nSo now, I don't really trust doctors that much anymore, because I always remember this incident and it makes it that much harder to trust them.\n\nTl;dr: I really, really don't like hospitals that much anymore.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399839165", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -4, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "&gt; I doubt there's any way to prove that God doesn't exist...\n\nThis is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. \n\nMany definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. \n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nBut, I think you're going about this backwards. You don't go around believing in things and asking for evidence to disprove them before not believing in them...do you believe in Bigfoot, faeries, and the the Loch Ness monster until they are dis-proven?\n\nIf you believe in a god, I would ask you to define  and then ask you to present your single best reason or evidence that leads you to believe that god exists.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399841372", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, once I went out to the cockpit country in the middle of Jamaica. In those parts in the night, there is total darkness, and I mean total. No streetlights for miles, you're basically in the middle of a jungle aside from the dirt roads leading out of the place. My family was staying at a little cabin owned by a friend of my mother. The caretaker for the place is a sweet old lady, and earlier in the day she sat with me and told me of the history of the place. She told many stories of heroic battles between the maroons and the redcoats (British). However, later on she got to the more sinister tales.\n\nOne of the most terrifying was that of the goat foot woman. In the day time, she would appear as a normal goat, always walking alone never with any others. Any real goats or animals would flee from the creature apparently seeing its true nature. However, as night fell the creature would transform into a woman, however one leg would stay as a goat. The 'woman' would therefore walk with a limp and walk near the edge of the road because the goat foot would be more comfortable in the grass. Typically, the creature appeared as an old woman. They would ask for help and act injured, but once close enough, would attack the person and tear out their heart - a diet of which kept them alive indefinitely.\n\nFast forward to the end of third day, it is a cloudless and the northerlies are coming in so the wind howls gently in that way that half comforts and half terrifies you. Around midnight I decided to go out to look at the moon and hopefully catch a glimpse of a few shooting stars, the house was on a small hill, so I took the dirt trail down through a little bamboo patch into a clearing where I could see the sky better.\n\nI was probably there for 20 minutes when I heard some faint footsteps along the trail, going past the clearing, down to the small town a few miles further on. At first I was a bit scared, expecting some murderer or thief. However, the moonlight illuminated the face of a remarkably attractive woman, I guessed about 22-ish. I said goodnight, and she glanced at me nervously, but didn't respond. I didn't find it strange, I supposed she probably thought I was a murderer or rapist, which was fair enough in the middle of the night.\n\nShe was wearing a long skirt and as she got closer to me, I noticed she was walking a bit strange, yet I couldn't pinpoint exactly what was wrong.\n\nWhen she was about 30 feet from me her she stumbled, and I glimpsed one of her feet, which had no shoe on it, another step later the next - all I saw was the shine of a small hoof. I was overcome with a wave of fear. She was now 10 feet from me, and getting closer. then, she stopped. I could hardly speak, I said 'Please' pause, shaking 'What do you want?' then I heard her speak, she said 'I need about tree fiddy'. That's when I realized, this ain't no goat-foot woman, its the goddamn Lochness Monster!

Tre, being the 4'10\" horny black preteen, invited her in and said he would get Roland for her. Tre walked upstairs and pretended to be talking to someone.\n\nA few minutes later he comes downstairs, 100% nude, and tells the girl that he is Roland and wants what he called for. She agrees, and she sucks him off (he didn't want to lose his virginity to a hooker) and after a few minutes he dry-fires and is done. She then says \"It's time for my fee.\" Thinking this would be free, he asks how much with a confused look on his face. The girl says her fee for a BJ is $19.75, and Tre goes into his wallet to see how much of his $25 dollar allowance he had left. He gave her all the money he had, and seeing that he only gave her $16.25, she got angry and sternly said, \"I'm gonna need about TREE FIDDY!\"\n\nTre then realized she seemed to be a few hundred feet long and possibly from the Triassic Period.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399869167", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 68, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Canon comes from authority.  In the original sense, it was a committee of bishops deciding which Biblical books counted (were canonical) and which didn't.  There is now the Biblical canon, which is the modern Bible.  There are plenty of other gospels and texts, but for one reason or another they were excluded from the canon.\n\nCan as we know it, in the sense of which works count for a given fictional universe, comes from Sherlock Holmes fans.  There were a lot of Holmes books, not all of them written by Doyle.  It was decided that for the Great Game of extrapolating the details of Holmes and Watson's lives from the books, only books by Doyle counted.  Only his books were canonical.\n\nIn a more modern sense \"canon\" is which works in a fictional universe \"count,\" meaning they most certainly happened within the universe, can be drawn upon, and should not be contradicted.  This is decided by some authority.  For Star Wars, that's George Lucas.  And recently Lucasfilm redefined the canon of Star Wars.  All the movies are in, the Clone Wars tv show is in, and everything else is out.\n\nComic books like Batman have an even more complex canon, down to the issue.  And it's ridiculous.\n\nDoctor Who does not now, nor has it ever had a canon.  Never in the show's history has anyone with any authority sat down and looked at every single licensed Doctor Who work and decided whether it was part of the canon of Doctor Who or not.  For much of the series, they couldn't even if they wanted to, because all of the master tapes before some point in the '70s were destroyed.\n\nNow that the show has a specified show runner with authorial control over the series, you'd might think that the canon might be decided upon.  Nope.  Both RTD and Moffat are against the idea of canon.  Moffat says that it's impossible with a show of this nature, and RTD actively made the show more anti-canon, introducing the idea that time is in flux.  Indeed, the very second episode of the new series immediately contradicts the classic who death of the Earth.  This is nothing new for a show that has two Loch Ness monsters and destroys Atlantis three times.  In fact, the idea that what you see in the show isn't definitely what happened was introduced way back in Genesis of the Daleks, in which the Fourth Doctor says that he's delayed the Daleks by 1000 years.

{"body": "Every morning I woke up and go into my routine life. A large part of my life was a grinding affair. Working away, having a job and making the whole thing happen. The only thing that was real to me was the thermal existence we are in right now. Everyone’s attitude was cynical; what you would call an asshole. I was one of them.\n\n\nIt occurred to me one time when I was driving to work that I am simply shoveling through this life making left Twix, waiting on my right Twix counterpart to do their job. One day I had the opportunity stop. I gradually began to notice that I had begun doing things backwards… I actually made a couple of right Twixes by accident. I couldn’t make left from right, and it was affecting my work. This work that I was so unsatisfied with from the beginning. I was put on a temporary work hiatus as I worked through my problems.\n\n\nIt was then that I traveled to Mexico and met this wonderful girl who actually happened to have worked as a right Twix worker. Her name was Vanessa. Vanessa and I actually accelerated through life during my hiatus. I felt connected to her in the same way we are all connected to the Earth; centered, as it were. Vanessa and I continued to build our relationship. For a while I thought that I might be going crazy because I was simply too happy.\n\n\nVanessa and I decided to get married in Las Vegas because we knew that we just had to continue our lives together. We had three children shortly after getting married. We had our twins James and Anabelle in January, and Avery nearly 13 months later. Life was sublime. By this time, I was back at Twix working as the shift supervisor of the left Twix.\n\n\nThen, almost without warning, my life came to a halt when Vanessa was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Once again I went on a temporary hiatus at work – this time with pay. Our mission in life was for Vanessa to try and experience as much of the world as possible. We made arrangements for our young ones to stay with her sister in Montana whilst we traveled.\n\n\nEverything in my life became unbalanced. Vanessa was the right to my left; she was my anchor to this thermal existence. I had no idea how I could continue when she shuffles off this mortal coil. We attempted to make the best of life and went everywhere, did everything… together… As we got back home and she lay on her bed, holding onto this life I asked her if there is anything else that I could do for her, somehow repay her for all of the happiness that she brought me. Her simple reply was that she would need about tree-fiddy. It was only then that I realized my sweet Vanessa was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399933916", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Orientation happens, we are put into our house colors and me and Eddie are in the same house, sweet!\n\nWe have a bunch of Ice-breakers with the other kids, like what was your name, favorite color, movies, music etc. Things go decently well, my friends and I find a spot that isn't taken by the senior students (Who were twice my size) and we decide to settle there for the day. Fast forward a few weeks I am sitting with a group of maybe 20 guys in our one spot when a group of girls in our grade take the spot under the tree next to us.\n\nIt was one of those planter boxes with the tree shade covering the wooden outskirts of it that you would then sit on despite mounds of birdshit and other droppings.\n\nSo as young children trying to be teenagers do we start talking to the girls, Eddie in particular has a pretty big crush on this girl named Louisa and dear lord was she a trouble maker. Eddie decides to pair us up with Louisa and one of her friends for a science assessment on food chains in the rain forests or some shit like that. So as usual I am the only one doing any work whilst my \"best friend\" and his hoe flirt so cringe worthy it tears the fabric of space and time. Eddie starts getting a big head, he doesn't want to hang out with us guys anymore its all Louisa, let me remind you he is around about 13 at this point, we all were, it just didn't make sense.\n\nOn top of that you know those inflated ego's guys get when they start talking to a girl, yeah he got the alpha mentality pretty early for my liking but whatever, my worst memory of high school? Watching my best friend break down into tears when the girl he liked found a replacement for him.\n\nIt was awful, as much as Eddie had pissed me off we were still friends, I don't pretend to know how girls work but one day Louisa just decided she didn't want anything to do with him anymore, he approached me in geography and asked if I could step outside with him. I knew something was up because he was fixated on the ground and his voice was really quiet, that and 7 years of experience with him probably helped as well. So we go outside and he breaks down into tears because his crush had kissed another boy, it was awful he threw himself onto my shoulder sobbing. The good person in me asked if there was anything I could do, or if there was anything he needed, whatever (no homo.) Through the tears I could make out; \"I... I, I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this point I realized that my best friend of 7 years was in fact an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era, \"God Damn it nessy! You ain't never gon' get my tree fiddy!\" I screamed, as he dove back into the water, and swam off, never to be seen again.\n\nTL;DR: My friend used me as a human kleenex when a girl dumped him.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399941076", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The answer is that we don't know.\n\nThe Bible does not say.\n\nIt says in a couple places that god is \"the lord god almighty\" which is actually \"el Shaddai\" literally rendered \"God of breasts\" but we understand that in the ancient world having a strong breast (a la a warrior's breastplate) meant being powerful. So God is considered \"Almighty\" or \"omnipotent\" and some say omniscience is an extension to that.\n\nWe also have a few references to God knowing things we don't, Mostly about things God himself was going to do in the future, but sometimes not, and we have Peter in John 12 saying \"Lord you know all things\" in the middle of Peter being generally wrong as Peter often is.\n\nAll that said I don't know a singly christian who does not affirm some kind of omniscience, but they vary wildly on what sort of omniscience they believe in.\n\nSome believe in a very very tight omniscience. God knows all things meaning he knows what is going to happen before it happens, he knows your thoughts before you think them, he knows the square root of the color yellow and he knows how much the Loch Ness monster weighs despite the creature's non-existence.\n\nSome have a looser omniscience. Plantinga and Craig famously affirm what they call \"middle knowledge\" where they say that God knows all things which are knowable. God does not know things which do not yet exist such as the future, but god knows what all the possible futures are, and what all the possible ramifications of all the possible futures are. God also knows that there are some facts which are going to occur in all possible futures. Craig will make the point that this is actually \"more\" knowledge than the tight omniscience.\n\nFinally some people simply hold to radically loose omniscience that says basically God knows more than anyone or anything else, but god does not necessarily know every fact even that I know, God has never been me and doesn't know what it is like to be me, but he has access to a very complete copy of wikipedia.\n\nIt all depends", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399944784", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This story is actually pretty difficult to tell, but no throwaway because no one knows my reddit account. I used to have this friend named Sheridan in high school. In 10th grade we met but we didn't really talk that much, 11th was about the same but senior year we became really, really good friends.\n\n\nWe hung out everyday and used to tell each other all about our girlfriends and such. He was my most trusted friend at the time, which was kind of weird for me since I had some weird trust issues from always getting other friends using me and not really wanting to be my friends.. if that makes sense\n\n\nBut that's not important.\nAnyways, there's an amusement park called Lagoon a few miles from where we live, it's a pretty fun place and it's a good hang out spot in the summer for teens. We spent the entire year being friends and when the amusement park opened for the year in early June, we decided we'd both ask out a girl if they wanted to go to the amusement park with us and just hang out for the day.\n\n\nI ask out two girls before one says yes, he only needs to ask out one.\nThe day there was pretty fun, we went on rides, played the side games, at lunch and dinner there, and overall had a really fun time.\n\n\nTowards the end of the evening we decided to switch into our swimming suits (which we had brought with us) and go to the waterpark section of the amusement park.\n\n\nSo, we get our stuff and go into the water park. We haven't changed into our swim suits yet so the girls go into the girl locker room and me and Sheridan go into the boys locker room.\n\n\nFor some reason, Sheridan got really self conscious about his body all of the sudden. I asked him jokingly what was wrong and he got very offended, saying things like, \"Fuck off, dude.\" and \"Leave me the fuck alone.\"\n\n\nI'd be joking with him, but he sounded very serious, so I decided to lay off and get dressed. Instead of getting dressed with me he runs with his swimming suit into a bathroom stall. I get dressed and go out of the locker rooms to wait for him.\n\n\nAfter 5 minutes the girls come out but Sheridan still hasn't come out. Another 5 minutes goes by and me and the girls are starting to get worried. I tell them I'll go check on him.\n\n\nI walk into the locker room and can see his feet and clothes everywhere under one of the stalls. (The locker room and bathrooms were in the same room, by the way, this might be confusing)\nI thought he was masturbating so I get a genius plan to pop out under the stall and say \"boo\" or something.\nI creep up to the side and slide under the stall and shout \"STOP MASTURBATING\"\n\n\nHe was masturbating. But that's not the bad part, I expected that. The scary part was I discovered he was a hermaphrodite. I would have never known. I have nothing against hermaphrodites but I was absolutely shocked at finding this out. It explained why Sheridan was self conscious about taking his clothes off in front of me and everything.\nHe started freaking the fuck out when he saw my facial expression change so quickly.\n\n\n\"DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK? OH, GOD\" he kept saying over and over. I kept saying \"sorry\" as much as I could but he was absolutely furious.\nI felt absolutely awful, still do in a way. I get him to calm down and he starts yelling at me, \"I need you to never tell anyone.\"\n\n\n\nI say something like, \"Ok dude, I will never tell anyone, I promise. Is there anything else I can do?\" , he responds, \"No.\" but I keep insisting that I do something else for him. He keeps telling me no, so I suggest we go swimming now. As we're walking out he says, \"Wait, I need something else.\" \"What do you need?\" I ask. \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\nIt was around this time I realized Sheridan was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit Nessie, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam off into the distance.\n\n\nI didn't get laid that night, neither did any of those girls.

{"body": "&gt; I mean wrong as in it guides you to an incorrect conclusion.\n\nYes, 'incorrect' is a synonym of 'wrong', but what exactly do you mean by these terms? I'm not trying to be pedantic here: I'm genuinely confused by your viewpoint. You are stating that emotions can be 'right' and 'wrong', but emotions have nothing remotely to do with what I understand 'right' or 'wrong' to mean. So therefore I have no idea what you mean by 'right' and 'wrong' in this context. \n\n&gt;Once science comes up with a truly ironclad (and I mean bulletproof, not just \"we think this is a way the universe could have come about without God\") way to disprove that God exists, I'll become an atheist. But they've been trying for some time, and I'm not holding my breath.\n\nYou don't have to disprove something that hasn't been proven in the first place. The onus is on people making the *positive* claim. No-one has to disprove the loch ness monster, or bigfoot, because these things have not been proven to exist in the first place. The default is not: *'assume it exists until it is proven not to'*. The default is that it doesn't exist until it is proven *to* exist. And by the way: god is an unfalsifiable concept, so it literally cannot be proven *not* to exist.\n\nA convicted man is not 'guilty until proven innocent'. It's the other way round: those making the positive claim (\"he is guilty\") are the ones with the burden of proof. Likewise, if you claim that \"god exists\", the burden of proof is on *you* to demonstrate this. It's not up to everyone else to disprove your claim if your claim has no evidence behind it.\n\nWhat can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400018908", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I mean hot, like, most guys my age would have crawled through a mile of razor wire just to see where she pees, hot. I remember her hazel eyes, her perfect smile, her rose scented perfume, hers curves that went on for days. being near her was absolutely euphoric. Now back then I was, let's just say, shy and this girl was way out of my league, so when she started talking to me I was blown away. Why would she be interested in me? I was half way convinced it was a gag and eventually i would be getting drenched in a bucket of pigs blood. \n\nIt never happened tough, we got to know each other over the next few weeks. I found out that she was a huge Quenten Tarantino fan and this was just around the time that *Kill Bill Vol 2* was hitting the theaters so I invited her to go see it with me. Believe me if I knew what was about to happen I would have just stayed home.\n\nWe get to the theater, find our seats, yadda yadda yadda, we sat in the back. About half way through the film she leans over and whispers in my ear \"I know what would make this even better\". I don't know, Maybe she was turned on by the carnage (I'm not one to judge), maybe she saw the look of wonderment in my eyes, but a feeling of excitement and danger washed over me when she casually unzipped my jeans and started sucking my throbbing, hormone fueled, surprisingly erect cock.\n\nI couldn't believe it, my first blow job was from the hottest girl i had yet to lay eyes on, in a theater, during one of the greatest movies of all time. I tried to last as long as I could, I tried ignoring the fact that I was getting a hummer and focus on the movie for a minute, it helped. Eventually i couldn't control it any more and came, hard. \n\nNow, being the nice girl that she was, she swallowed, and being the nice guy that i am, I asked if she wanted something to drink. She wanted a sprite so I made my way to the concession stand and almost shat a brick when I walked by an usher who was looking very accusingly at me. \"Fuck, I fucking knew I would never be this lucky\" I thought but I kept my cool. I realized that the usher was following me but I kept walking. I get to the concession stand and order the sprite and just as I was asking the clerk \"So what's the damage?\" I feel a tap on my shoulder. I couldn't even take my eyes off the floor when I turned around to face the guy and I 'll never forget the words that came out of his mouth, he said \"That'll be about tree fiddy\". I looked up in shock to realize that it wasn't an usher at all, but the god damned Loch Ness Monster. I yelled \"Go away Loch Ness Monster. I work hard for my money\" and then the concession clerk jumps in and said to me \"Hey bro, how about that tree fiddy\" HOLY FUCK!

{"body": "I met this girl when I was 15 on one of those group-student trips over one summer. We became friends, found out we lived close to each other, had mutual friends, similar music tastes, etc. We kept in touch and end up having a lot of late-night chats on skype and what have you. She dates this guy for a year or so but still continued the late-night chats with me and constantly brought up her relationship problems. After their relationship ended, she flat out asked me if I wanted to hook up. I said yes, and then she proceeded to ask me to send her my favorite porn clips so she can \"learn\" what I liked. She told me she could come over the next day when my parents were out of the house. I was feeling pretty nervous as I was young and inexperienced at the time. She came over wearing a very nice, unrevealing, dress which she immediately removed to reveal very kinky and lacey underwear. I was very taken a back at her forwardness and wasn't exactly sure what my next move should be. She took control, starts kissing me, and asks me if she can take my pants off. I looked at her and said something along the lines of: \"You have my permission to do whatever you see fit.\" She gives me this somewhat-relieved look and tore my pants and underwear off. She immediately shoved my dick down her throat, grabbed my hands, and put them on the back of her head. She started fucking me with her throat while her eyes are watering, massacre running, spit flying EVERYWHERE. She comes up only one time to tell me to hold her head down harder and not to let her up the first few times she struggles. After about 20 or so minutes of very intense oral, she looks up at me with a sort of desperate look and screams \"FUCK ME IN THE ASS!\" Immediately flip her over on my bed and insert my dick where she requested. At this point, I had had sex with only one other person so this was all very new and VERY intense for me. I was trying to be as gentle as possible but she kept looking back at me and screaming \"HARDER!\" So I go harder and harder until I just couldn't hold it anymore and cum in her asshole. As soon as I pull out, she gets back on her knees and starts gagging on my dick again. For something like 45 more minutes until I cum again in her mouth, she spits it onto her boobs, and then licks it up. She tried to put my dick her mouth AGAIN afterwards but I told her my dick was already getting sore. \n\nFast forward a few years when we're in college. We still talk every now and then. It turns out she's bipolar and was having a manic episode when we hooked up. She barely remembers it.

{"body": "I had traversed over terrain untouched by human civilisation. My body was slowly giving into the fatigue that had accumulated over the past few months. I had barely slept while on my journey, as the tent I had packed in was infested with parasitical creatures which I had never seen before. \n\n\n\n\nMy food supplies were dwindling, and the dryness in my throat increased tenfold with every step I took. No matter the condition of my body, I was focused on the single and final goal, Reaching the temple of Nicolas Cage, a mysterious being who was rumoured to possess mystical powers. He had been known for curing terminal illnesses, and went into solitude following the outing of his powers. People all around the world had looked for him, and now, me and my partner had received a lead onto his location.\n\n\n\nThe map had shown a temple that had suddenly appeared overnight, located deep within the Amazon forest. My friend, James, had contracted typhoid the previous day, and had to remain in the village that we took solitude in. I fear for his health, almost as much as I fear for my safety. The orange South American sun was melting into the horizon. Each second reducing my chances of reaching the temple. The night time in the Amazon is when different predators emerge from hiding, looking for a meal that could most likely be me.\n\n\n\nI walked for what seemed like forever before reaching a clearing the forest, the sun was now below the horizon and all that remained was a faint orange glow that lighted up the sky. I was puzzled after trekking through thick jungle and came to the realisation that this clearing is where the temple was supposed to be. Dread filled my body as I walked towards the center of the empty space. As I reached the middle, I saw strange markings which littered the ground. Kneeling down, I read the letters inscribed on the floor. \"ESIR EGAC SALOCIN\".\n\n\n\nAs I read out the last line, the ground began trembling, I jumped out of the way as a massive pillar flew from beneath the ground. Three more appeared all around the clearing, then parts of rock began appearing from the ground. The temple was being built in front of my very eyes. A smile crosses my face as I realised I had finally found him. I walked up the newly formed stairs, towards a massive stone door with a picture of Nicolas Cage, that I had only seen in books. \n\nA small hole next to the door was what I assumed was a way of opening the door. Foreign letters lay above the hole, I managed to translate most of the sentence. And when I was finished, I wish I hadnt. The words, in their full meaning, were:\n\n\n\"To access the temple, Imma need about tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400066499", "subreddit": "RandomActsOfGaming", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There's two highways from my house to get to the nearest city, one is a very long way to get to the city, one is a very short way to get to the city.\n\nI occasionally like to go out for jogs towards the city and I always take the very long route because it gets me more exercise, my parents always say this is very inefficient but I like it because it gives me more exercise and has caused me to get laid once. \n\nHow? A few years ago I was doing my daily jog towards the city and back a few years ago I always went the short route, this is my story of me switching from the short route to the long route. So I was jogging and I had the sudden urge to go to the long route, I jog a bit longer than usual since I took the long route and I was kind of upset with myself because I was very tired.\n\nHowever, as I was nearing the end of the highway about to enter the city a BEAUTIFUL girl stops by me and says \"Hey, do you need a ride?\" I didn't really need a ride obvious but I was hoping that maybe I could get lucky with said girl, the only problem is is that since I had taken the longer route I was sweating more profusely and was a very disgusting human being.\n\nI get in, we talk a bit and asks if I want to go over to her place.. Well fuck yes I want to go over to her place! She drives us over there and I expect us to get out and small talk a bit, but nope, right when she stops the car in front of her house she tells me that she has a fetish for sweaty men (Really weird, I know), and so we start kissing a bit, after awhile we go inside and things really started really heating him, asking me to do things to her that I happily obliged in.\n\nA few hours later we're lying on her bed and I am amazed at my luck and what had just happened, she turns around looks me in the eye and says \"I need something else\", eagerly (I'm expecting a round two) I say \"What?\" and she replies \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was about this time I realized that this girl was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era, that goddamn loch ness monster had tricked me again.\n\nTL;DR: Fuck Nessie, the longer route is always the better route either way though.\n\nRepost from Thehealeroftri.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400080535", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 25, "controversiality": 1}

Cut to him giving a lecture comparing the myths and legends surrounding historical events such as rome and egypt with nordic and arthurian legend on how no great society is without it's share of conquest mythology, but ultimately is rooted in mysterious technology (Excalibur, Mjolnir)\n\nLater on he receives a letter about a recent discovery by Hitler's Nazi explorations that might lead to uncovering of the lost city of atlantis and greatly expanding the historical evidence that merely implies that atlantis is what is now left of the volcanic explosion of santorini. Instead it talks about a great war between early advanced societies and how the technology was so advanced yet isolated that it imploded on itself (while also lending itself to imply that the power of the ark stems from this society as it's last remnant) and this led to the regression of technology (paralleled with the recent development of tv, jet propulsion and atomic energy) that lead to the birth of ancient Greece.\n\nMeanwhile, the American government is in a contentious battle with the Russians based on those findings to gain an upper hand in the upcoming cold war and are using military forces as a diversion for the CIA and KGB so they can secretly obtain this lost technology. As Indy flirts with death against the ruskies, his continued battle with alcoholism and evolving cynicism as to how the world has changed because of the war often leads him to be on the wrong side with his home team as well because, apparently they weren't as different from the Nazi's as he thought. Eventually it becomes a race against time as he begins to come to terms that that's the world he's got no other choice to live in and tries to stop both parties from obtaining what will eventually lead to an implosion similar to the atlanteans, but on a global scale. \n\nMovie ends, Nessie was the prototype for a biological weapon from that society\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400115535", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I bought the wrong type of hummus for my brother. The store was all out of original hummus. They only had garlic, pinenut, and hot pepper. I assumed he would like garlic. He hates garlic. We began talking about what we should do. We debated on whether or not I would go return the hummus in order to buy a different brand. Personally, I have never returned food to a grocery store so the idea felt a bit weird. I have no issue returning clothes or other merchandise, however, food seems strange. Anyways, my brother asks how much the hummus costs. I say about tree fitty. It was at this point in time that my brother noticed that his brother was about five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era. So now, instead of worrying about returning the hummus, I am worried about my survival.\n\n Surely, if humanity saw a dinosaur they would immediately attempt to capture it. Not only is it a threat to human beings but I imagine the government would most likely desire to observe and experiment upon a dinosaur. And this is why I am writing you. I am currently trapped inside my house, which just so happens to be able to fit a being of my size. However, my brother ran out of the house screaming and I am sure he has alerted the authorities. It is only a matter of time before I am taken away. Continuing on, the specific question I want to ask you is this: should I take the gold or the purple pill? You see, moments after my brother left, a man appeared in my house. He wore a midnight black suit, freshly waxed Italian loafers, and a fedora. Upon entering the house, he tipped this fedora, which had two silver feathers sticking out of the brim. He never told me who he was or how he arrived so quick, but he did present me with two pills. He left them with me, but first he explained the consequences of each. The gold pill will recreate the entire world in such a way that little half-frog and half-man creatures will rule the world. Under their control, they have banned all steak, fried chicken, chicken wings and pizza. Life is just about normal otherwise, mostly due to the fact that these frogmen are relatively peaceful beings. Secondly, the purple pill. If I take the purple pill the cosmos will teleport back in time many millennia ago. However, humanity as we know it will never have the knowledge, resources, and ability to make beer and soda-pop. \n\nSo, which pill should I take? This impacts everyone in the world in some way. Is life better without steak, fried chicken, chicken wings and pizza? Or should we live free of beer and soda-pop? Remember, I am unsure about how long I have to decide.

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied.\n\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends.  At the start of High School we did everything together.  But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\n\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year.  Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\n\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.  \n\nThey were together that entire summer.  It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling.  I even heard them having sex once.  I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life.  That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.  \n\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother.  I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\".  She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it.  To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\n\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over.  The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem.  I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door.  She said hello and gave me a kiss.  I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic.  She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\"  I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\"  I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing.  Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned.  I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\n\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives.  Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now.  I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\"  Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded.  She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\n\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone.  I was back in the game with her.  We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great.  Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now.  We layed there for a bit.  Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.  \n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend,  I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.\n\ntl;dr:  Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400167611", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was waiting for a charter bus one stormy spring friday. This was back in university, I lived Toronto and went to school in Hamilton (about an hour away). I had transferred into a different program and needed to catch up on some courses for the upcoming year--and I honestly didn't mind having to settle for a half-assed summer because I was really enjoying doing something new.\n\nThe way these bus loops were set up allowed you to approach them from a variety of directions. Basically it was on the edge of campus and you could've gotten there from campus, from the street, from the library, whatever... I'd taken the long way through campus to grab a coffee (and some cigarettes), having stayed up late the night before getting way too high with my new housemates. As I was walking through the campus I noticed there weren't as many students around as usual, which is usually normal in the summer. But I noticed also that there were many more construction workers than usual--I thought nothing of it because I was burnt out and caught in the rain with a spilling cup of coffee and the flimsy umbrella that I'd had since the first week for my first year. So I just tiptoed around all the puddles on the ground and continued towards the busses, trying to keep as dry as possible.\n\nWhen I finally made it, much to my surprise, there was no one there. Not a single person. I looked around in every direction. \"No one's here, fuck.\" I guessed that they were closed for the day. \"Must be some construction issue,\" I thought. So being desperate and tired as hell I decided to just go ahead and have a seat in the smelly old booth by the stop, just to be out of the rain for a little bit. Ten minutes, a cup of coffee, and a cigarette later I was just about ready to walk all the way out of campus and down a long street back to my rented house. As I gathered my things and exited the booth I saw a girl walking hopelessly in the rain through the stop, completely drenched, toward the residence building at its side. Being the suave motherfucker that I was--she was gorgeous, I couldn't help myself--I ran over there and offered to walk her to the building. She smiled her beautiful smile and accepted graciously. We walked for a couple minutes and I summed up the courage to get her number. I decided to quit smoking right then and there like the dramatic ass hole that I am. Great outcome from the start on that one, it was a habit I developed back in my sophomore year of high school and I was very glad to have finally beat that, as a side note.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks and we we're on our 5th date or so: glow in the dark mini golf in a popular place back in Toronto, where she was also from. So UV lights, arcade games, junk food, all that fun. We spent the whole night making funny faces at people in the distance and just having a completely wonderful time. It actually got pretty tiring after an hour or so and she asked me if I had any change for a couple can of pops. I said \"sure\" and reached into my back pocket for a handful of coins. \"How much are they, anyway?\" I asked her. \"About tree fiddy,\" she said. And it just happened right there. As she was walking away all I could think about was how good I felt with her scaly body in my arms.\n\nTL;DR -- Met girl at bus stop. Act of kindness got me a date. Finally quit smoking. Fell in love in a weird place. \n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400171318", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Re-Post: /u/red321red321\n\nTL;DR: /r/gonewild sextortion.\n\nI have told this story once before and was hesitant to do so. For those of you that have read my story before I'll ask that you refrain from replying to this comment so that others can give their opinion of me and my actions. Let my tale of lust serve as a cautionary tale to anyone who has ever thought about giving in to their primal urges...\n\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\n\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\n\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was.\n\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to /r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was insanely open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about.\n\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her /r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Protoerozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\"\n\nI understand how truly horrific this failed plot was and it is truly the worst thing I have never done. Not only did I walk away without any extortion money, I didn't get any new nudes from her which is what I was holding out for more than anything else. The only good thing about the failed sextortion deal is that she never contacted the FBI which works out perfectly for me because if she did, I wouldn't have been able to share this cautionary tale with all of you wannabe /r/gonewild gals out there. I was seriously bummed about not getting any more exclusive jerk-off material from this bodacious babe but c'est la vie no smoking hot gonewild noodz 4 me :(\n\nJust remember this, girls: If you're gonna get your tits out for the lads, don't show your face.\n\nEdit 1: Link to original post\n http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1z1muz/whats_the_most_illegal_thing_youve_ever_done_nsfw/cfpsfmb\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400187251", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 31, "controversiality": 0}

I think it's sharp, observant character work.\n\nAn easy explanation is that Scully makes no claims of her divine beliefs being comprehensible or defensible in our material existence; faith necessarily depends on an absence of material evidence.

{"body": "When I was around 21, my girlfriend and I liked to go exploring.  The city we lived in had quite a few parks that we hiked around, but there were also quite a few 'unofficial' areas outside of town - private property where everybody seemed to hang out.  One of the fishing lakes had a cave system a short distance from shore, and we decided to take a look around one afternoon.  It wasn't anything huge, but the entrance was big enough for an adult to walk upright.  After a few turns, you were completely cut off from daylight, with stone surrounding you on all sides.  Not really freaky, but the idea of tons and tons of unmoving rock above, below, everywhere, was a little mind bending the first time.  So we got partway into the cave, and (being a guy) I decided to turn off the flashlight and see if she wanted to make out in the dark.  As soon as we cut the light, we both were overcome with the creepiest feeling that something else was in there, further down in the cave, just waiting and watching.  Back on with the flashlight and we hustled out butts right back out of that cave, not even looking back.  Once we were in the sunlight, we laughed about how foolish we were being, but neither one of us wanted to go back in and press our luck.  We both wanted to go someplace where there were other people, so we got in her car and headed over to a swimming hole we knew about on some farmer's land.  \n\nDuring the summer, a lot of kids our age would hang out there on hot days.  You probably know the type of place - a sinkhole where a river suddenly gets wider and deep enough to dive into.  There was a diving rock, along with a rope swing, and nothing else but trees and water.  We hung around with some of her friends for a while and didn't really talk about our little adventure in the cave, but it kept bugging me.  \n\nI got bored after an hour or so and decided to wander upstream to see what I could find.  I was probably about a quarter mile up the river when I started getting that same feeling I'd had back in the cave. Something was out there, watching.  Waiting.  I stopped where I was, trying to listen over the sounds of the water, and only catching the occasional rustling of leaves off in the woods somewhere.  At first I thought some of my girlfriend's pals were trying to play a prank, but there really wasn't any way they could have followed me without me hearing them.  Then the feeling started getting worse.  I was convinced there was something near, I just couldn't see it.  Have you ever had that feeling where you KNOW something's wrong - out of place - but your senses don't agree with you? You start to wonder if you're crazy, and then that fear hits that maybe you aren't crazy and you just need to pay closer attention and protect yourself because there really could be something out there, and you're too far away from other people to count on help, and besides you don't want to yell for them because then you'll look like an idiot because there can't be anything out there, really.  And then you hear it.  Something bumps or crashes and your mind starts whirling and you feel that sense of panic rushing through your head and you start trying to go back the way you came while looking in all directions at the same time.  I had just gotten to that point, where I was ready to say \"F it all\" and start running, when I noticed the shadow in the woods.  I couldn't make out a shape, just a spot of darkness under the trees.  It moved when I moved, and I knew (without knowing how) that it was following me.  It was huge - twice as tall as I was, at least.  As soon as I focused on it, as soon as it knew it had my attention, it started creeping forward.  Slowly, just a foot or two at a time.  Now that my grey, nameless fear had a form, I couldn't move.  I felt like I was stuck right there in the river, water flowing past me, and this dark thing getting closer as I watched.  Just as it got to the edge of the trees, I freaked.  I started screaming at it.  \"Leave me alone! Go away!\"  It stopped moving for a moment, and I could tell it was waiting.  I couldn't stand it. I had to move, or cry, or fight, but I still felt like I was frozen. Finally, sobbing, I just whimpered, \"What do you want from me?\"  The thing - whatever it was - bent down closer to my level and I heard it growl, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" That's when I noticed it was eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

You're saying that the authority of Jesus comes from \"*the claim*\" that Jesus is the Son of God???\n\nI would say there's a *basis* for Jesus' authority is his *status* as Son of God, and that, **yes**, this is a *claim* the Church makes.

Maybe no on seriously asked the question, but *Torah*, which **first and foremost** is not something written down but is something lived, in the customs, the feats, the sacrifices, etc.  The God of Israel is encountered through the lived experience of the Law through which Israel and God were bound in a Covenantal (which is to say *familial*) relationship.  \n\n&gt;So UFO's and Loch Ness monster are real.

That's like saying that since the average age of a man was thirty-five in 1790, that no one lived into their nineties.

{"body": "Well I've never seen very compelling evidence, most (if not all) of it is a lot like the 'proof' you get for Bigfoot or Loch Ness Monster. The government has absolutely no reason to cover up the existence of those creatures, and yet all the evidence we have of them is inconclusive at best and and absolute rubbish at worst. And all of the evidence I've ever seen for aliens and UFOs falls into the same category.\n\nYou have to remember that people *want* to believe this stuff. The day we have proof of extraterrestrial visitation is the day our universe gets a lot more interesting. The evidence is, by and large, not coming from objective sources. It is usually trumpeted as 'proof' by people who are already convinced that aliens exist and that they have visited us. From a purely scientific perspective that should make anyone extremely skeptical. It's the same sort of problem you have when people try to claim proof of god. They usually end up looking for evidence to support the conclusion they've already made, instead of deriving the conclusion from available evidence. You can't prove anything that way. \n\nAnd as for your second point, I am inclined to agree that life probably exists on other planets, but you're making some pretty big assumptions. Practical interstellar travel is a technical accomplishment unlike any that humanity has ever even considered. Despite all the wonderful science fiction that revolves around this idea, it is a very real possibility that faster than light space travel is physically impossible.

{"body": "When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms. She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet. His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name. Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.\nJoe didn't give a shit. He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either. Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom. His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\". \n\nHis name was now legally Adam Adams. Why? All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe, my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it. He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember. But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\".\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage. The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me. Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son. This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on. She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does. My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\n\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn. Anyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.\n\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story. She does. Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words). While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out.\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved. After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad. I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story. When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her. She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again. But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one.\n\ntl;dr: Friend's mom is an overprotective bitch, I get mad at her for being an overprotective bitch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400335962", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

We talked for a couple of weeks, and got really close, and we soon started having regular sex. \n\nI do not know why he chose me to cheat on his wife with out of all of the girls in the world, but I was happy that he did. For nearly a year him and I had sex regularly. I would usually go over to his house in the morning when I saw that his wife left for work, and we would get business started. Occasionally though I met him at his job and we did it there, or he would pick me up and we would go somewhere exotic. \n\nThe thing that I remember about him mostly what that he had some weird fetishes, but I would always incorporate them when we were doing it even though I sometimes felt uneasy. I do not know why I did this, maybe because I knew that I would get gifts from him if I did. \n\nThrough the course of the year I was with him we had had sex about 150 times, mostly early in the morning right when his wife left for work. One morning I went to his house to do the business after I saw that his wife left. Things start getting steamy and then he said \"I need something from you first...\" Confused and worried that it would be about one of hi weird fetishes, I uneasily replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this man was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

The only difference was the choice of venue. I'd decided to try somewhere new; a little falafel place a short walk away from the office. I'd been waiting in line when he had rushed right into me. Of course, I was indignant at first, but the way he apologised so profusley calmed me down.\n\nHeck, even made me chuckle.\n\n\"Its alright, accidents happen, as mum used to say.\" I'd smiled, helping the poor guy onto his feet. \n\n\"Yeah, I know...\" He'd let out a small chuckle after that, a bright grin growing across his face.\n\n\"What're you so happy about?\" I asked, dusting myself off.\n\n\"Ah, nothing. I just... used to have a friend who said 'as mum used to say' a lot.\" He shook his head, fumbling about in his pockets. \"Good friend too... one of my best.\"\n\n\"Used to? Did, um... something happen? If you don't mind me asking?\"\n\n\"Nah, its fine.\" He smiled again. Something about that smile was so familiar. \"This is sorta embarassing, actually. He was, well... imaginary.\" He blushed, and it was my turn to laugh.\n\n\"Embarassing? I'd be more surprised if you didn't have one. I know I did.\"\n\n\"Really? What was he like?\"\n\n\"Well, he smiled a lot, for one. Always had a great big friendly grin plastered across his face.\" I smiled, thinking back. It was hard, I have to admit. It had been a long time since I'd thought about him.\n\n\"Sounds like me. Love to smile.\" And he did, his big old grin growing and growing. \"Mine was far more serious. Always had his homework in on time, always knew what to do... I kinda looked up to him.\"\n\n\"Mine was a prankster. This one time, he convinced me to set a bucket of water above the teacher's door. She spent the whole day glaring at me as I-\"\n\n\"-Sat in the corner?\" He finished, his grin vanishing quickly.\n\n\"How did you know?\" I asked, a nervous chuckle coming into my voice.\n\n\"I remember trying to convince my friend to do that. I didn't want to get in trouble. But, being imaginary, he couldn't, so I did it. And I had to sit in the corner.\"\n\n\"... Mrs Morris, age 7?\"\n\n\"Yeah, how did-\"\n\n\"This is so weird.\" I had exclaimed. looking him up and down. \"There is no way this is happening.\"\n\n\"No bloody way. This has to be a coincidence.\" He replied, giving me a look over as well.\n\n\"Awfully specific coincidence...\" I muttered, pinching myslef lightly. Not a dream. \"Okay, okay... this is starting to freak me out.\"\n\n\"You're telling me. All I wanted was to try a new place for my-\"\n\n\"Lunch break?\" I finished.\n\n\"... Okay, wow.\"\n\n\"Yeah.

Wow, I just... wow.\" He shook his head, the grin coming back. \"Shit, man, and I thoguht today was goign to be boring.\"\n\n\"Yeah, holy hell were we wrong.\" We laughed in unison, catchign the attention of passersby. I smiled, and reached for my wallet, laughing again with him as he did the same in complete unison.\n\n\"Aw, man.

{"body": "&gt;To deny any existential proposition is to necessarily assume its negation, for example, you must say that the Loch Ness Monster either exists or does not exist, there are no other options for you to choose.\n\nFalse. Either the Loch Ness Monster exists or it doesn't. That doesn't mean that I have to choose one of these as my belief.\n\nHere's a better example:\n\nYou bring me to a barn and tell me there is a horse painted green in there, and ask me if I accept that claim as truth.\n\nI don't know you, I don't know what's in the barn, so I have no reason to agree with you and actively believe that there is a green horse in that barn. \n\nSo I don't accept it as true.\n\nThis does *not* mean that I believe there is *not* a green horse in the barn. There very well could be one. I just don't join the \"there is a green horse in the barn\" camp until I have reason to believe that it is actually true. Similarly, I don't have to join the \"I believe there is *not* a green horse in that barn\" camp. I simply don't hold a positive belief either way.\n\nAll an atheist is, is one who does not join the \"God positively exists\" camp. This does not necessarily mean that he is in the \"God positively does not exist\" camp. I can lack the former without having to subscribe to the latter.\n\nAnd even if I *did* join the \"God positively does not exist\" camp, that still doesn't meet any definition of \"religion.\"\n\nSo, this author is an idiot.\n\n**EDIT**: Actually, commenter *DarkStar* pretty much destroys the author in the comments, and the author shows just how stupid he actually is by accusing categorical error to his analogy without explaining *why* the analogy doesn't apply. He just repeats that it is a categorical error, even when *DarkStar* challenges him to explain how it qualifies as one.\n\n**EDIT 2**: As I guessed, the author reveals the standard theistic stupidity in his comments:\n\n\"Not having knowledge...you cannot make any claims.

{"body": "I split into two categories, mirroring characters and plot similarities\nCharacters:\nGodzilla is Batman. Is he good? is he bad? We will never know. But will he destroy a city to save the lives of hundreds? We still don't know. Also he is depicted as a vigilante. Well it was about that time they realized that this batman character was 8 stories tall and a coruscation from the pedidoic era! And when asked if he'd save the city he said he'd need 'boout tree fiddy. Er' go, Batman is Godzilla. Making Godzilla Batzilla.\nLt. Ford, the second main character of the movie is well you guessed it, Lt. Gordon. Skeptical at times, but understands what needs to be done to save the city. ﻿As he is the only character who shares a tender moment with batzilla as they both look over the city, with a mushroom behind them, wondering just how long they have until the city is in peril again.\nBut i know what you're saying where does Alfred fit in to this? Well I'll tell you, Bryan Cranston, Ford's dad, Provides wisdom but of course no one listens to the old guy, who also happens to be the best actor in both movies. As well as only be a part of the movie for a total of 15 minutes. So dissapointed DAWG.\nBane is MUTO 1. MUTO 1 will litterally do anything for the love of his life, even leveling an entire city in hopes of one day getting it on.\nAs you guessed MUTO 2 is Miranda, who strings MUTO 1 along just so she could get what she wants. And after sometime passes our \"hero\", batgod, realizes that the true enemy is not MUTO 1, but MUTO 2 and kicks MUTO 2's ass after having his abnormally small sized arms/ hands all over MUTO 2's body.\nNow it would seem like I listed every possible character development,WRONG! Our dear freind Robin (Gordon-LEvitt), is Dr. IChiro. The Doctor, much like Robin was always a believer in our vigilante. And repetedly looked dumbfounded at he dumbass generals who wouldn't believe him, when he uttered those brilliant words...\"Let them fight\". And not even once did he give up hope, becasue he knew Godman would save them in the end\n\nK, that was characters. I will now delve into plot points.\nI'll start off with the easy ones. The nuclear bomb in the distance, and yet everyone survives. In Batman...well you know. In Godzilla they hatch a scheme to blow up these monsters, with a nuclear weapon. Boom! did anyone die? of course not, everyone magically dissapears and its chill, that a mushroom cloud is 15 miles away from the city.\nPanic is everywhere, as there should be...\nBoss Fight\nGodzilla wins and everyone in the theater stands up and claps while chanting USA! USA! (this actually fucking happened I kid you not )\nFord, along with everyone in the city, look in both amazement and despair. A city they once loved now destroyed, but they have hope because Godman, might not be the hero they deserve, but he's the hero they have. \nMore uproar from the audience, roll credits. I leave disgusted at the filth they just put in front of me, cry about how similar it was to Batman with Eric. Pass out in bed thinking about how I want to be BatGod for Halloween. \nAnd that my friends is how Godzilla is Batman.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400457128", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Once it had happened in Denmark we knew what to look out for. A conspiracy nut had disabled a shredding machine in the Palace, and because it still made the noise and fed into a black plastic case no one ever thought to check if the documents were destroyed. They’d ran round the back, and rifled through the garbage hoping for some confirmation of Chemtrails or Nessie or whatever. What they found was something entirely different.\n\nThree months. From total ignorance too complete, terrifying reality took us all of three months. Watching that old footage I swear a lot of them were happy to get caught out. Putting on their angriest faces, calling some of their best friends and colleagues morons and liars. We must have lost some of these last few Generations’ best actors I can tell you that.\n\nI think my favourite was the Ultra-Conservative southern Senator who immediately used the revelation to write a four page apology to the LGBT community. He was an Atheist too, but you know, he had neatly parted grey hair and a deep southern accent. We all wanted him to play the part that he did, and he did it beautifully.\nThere were of course the legal battles. It was decided that holding power illegitimately was a obviously wrong, but they wrote all the rules that would have allowed us to prosecute them. If we found them guilty of anything we’d also have to admit that the laws themselves were invalid and hence they couldn’t be tried under them. Some countries took longer than others. After a while there was just this collective tacit agreement to kind of ignore them as a problem and reform the government.\n\nIt got real scary real fast. You know when you see two toddlers arguing over which cartoon character is better, or forum arguments on whether Harry Potter would be more likely to bone Jeeves or the Patrician? Every governmental debate looked exactly like that. There was no confidence. People were incredibly trepid to give any opinion at all. All of us regular citizens had to look at things like the issues and facts of a case and try to work out the best solution ourselves. It was exhausting. The public started completely ignoring every law passed and argument made anywhere outside their own house. \n\nWe think that the first five paper was found on the UK Welfare minister’s desk on 12th September 2017, although it’s more than likely that there were a few undisclosed ones beforehand. You can see copies of it in the Victoria Albert and some Universities, but again it messes with the act. It said “Minimum Wage: £8.20. Start January 2018”. It made sense. It fitted with inflation, gave people a fairly stable life whilst not discouraging them to look for something greater. It got passed. More and more of these pieces of paper started showing up around the world. They’re always in the first language of the first person who reads them (it’s made it a little awkward when a diplomat or an ex-pat happens to glance at it first and has to translate the Senator’s next policy for them), precisely five centimetres by five centimetres and perfectly square up to the atomic level.\n \nThat was six years ago. Since then, as you know, we’ve had most of the World’s ex-politicians “re-elected” back to their old positions. It’s undeniably more comforting to just have to return to rooting for your favourite team rather than keeping up with the information. I hear they’ve even stopped telling the kids about the scandal and the Hiatus nowadays. People say that there are a lot more people going into Politics after acting, but I’m older than I look and I can definitely tell you that this isn’t the case.\n\nThis is the eighth time, by the way. Though the first seven were a lot more local, news has been getting a lot quicker these last few centuries. Well, I told you I was older than I looked.

{"body": "You might already be familiar with this, and I am not myself sure of the probabilities involved (perhaps nobody is), but there are a number of factors to consider in pondering the existence of extraterrestrial life with which we can detect or interact with (if we're talking about intelligent life). I know you asked about intelligent life, and [The Drake Equation](http://www.quickiwiki.com/en/Drake_equation) is very much related to that question and my discussion below (merely my personal thoughts on the matter of extraterrestrial life, intelligent or otherwise). I'm no expert on anything involved with evidence for extraterrestrial life, but I *do* find things like this fun to think and read about and so what will follow is based on little concrete evidence--it's more a generalized rendition of my beliefs and considerations. \n\nBefore going forward, here's a short description of the Drake Equation [from the wiki link above]:\n&gt; The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation was written in 1961 by Frank Drake not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations, but intended as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at the world's first SETI meeting, in Green Bank, West Virginia. The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life. The Drake equation has proved controversial since several of its factors are currently unknown, and estimates of their values span a very wide range. This has led critics to label the equation a guesstimate, or even meaningless.\n\nTo begin, it seems that [NASA scientists may have discovered evidence for the existence of Cyanobacteria with extraterrestrial origins.](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070038326.pdf)\n\nThat sort of life is simple, and thus its discovery would require that an intelligent life form (like humans) can detect, does detect, and correctly identifies it as an organism (in the case aboe, we're talking about possible fossils of microorganisms detected on a meteorite). That's easier because the microorganism is perhaps a necessary (but not sufficient) first step towards the development of more complex life, and thus instances of these sorts organisms coming into existence elsewhere in the universe might be more frequent than more complex life (like worms, trees, fish, dogs or people).\n\nHow often does single-celled life emerge in the universe, and how distant are these occurrences? What about multicellular life? Intelligent life? \n\nAs we reach higher stages in what we might call a \"hierarchy of being,\" it seems that the probability for a form of life's coming into existence (and the abundance of that life form) diminish. Consider the example of the number of bacteria in existence compared to that of the number of bugs, and then we might compare those to the number of frogs and then to the number of humans.\n\nGiven those considerations, how likely is it that intelligent life sees existence beyond Earth? To me, it seems quite likely (but I am neither a scientist nor a mathematician). But, we must ask, *when* do these intelligent life forms come to be in the history of the universe, *where* do they emerge, and *what capacity* do they have to detect us or communicate their existence? What capacity do *we humans* have in this regard?\n\nThose questions are important: There may have been human life which emerged somewhere in the universe before us(or some other form of intelligent life, if you prefer it or if the thought of humans existing before Earth's unsettling), but perhaps they died out before Earth was even formed. Unless we found artifacts, fossils, or some other indication of the intelligent life which preceded us, it's difficult to imagine how (or why) we'd posit their existence at all. For example, if no dinosaur fossils were ever discovered, how would we know that they ever existed? Or, we might point to things like the Sasquatch or Loch Ness Monster--we need to find a body, or some other good evidence, that these things exist if we (the public generally) are to believe that it exists with little doubt.\n\nOf course, just because we lack evidence for the existence of something, it doesn't mean that the evidence isn't there; in fact, we might already have the evidence and simply be ignorant of the what it's evidence *for.* That is, the only life we are familiar with is that originating on Earth--even the study I linked above takes the similarities between the meteorite's fossils and that of known cynobacterial structures as evidence that it is, indeed, life (they note that there are some important differences, though, which indicate possible extraterrestrial origin). The fact is, life might emerge in a number of different ways than we are aware of or familiar with. Hence, life might look quite different than we are used to seeing, and it might not fit our taxonomies, or perhaps even our definitions, of life and of its intelligent forms.\n\nSo, then, we return to some questions that we have to consider in our pondering about extraterrestrial intelligence and why we haven't found it, or why it hasn't found us: Do our existences overlap in time? Does our concurrent existence in time also include an overlap of manageable spatial distance (e.g., is it possible for either one of us to reach the other or communicate with them)?  Or, perhaps, is the intelligent alien life able to simply exist in space and fly around (here I'm thinking of something like the whale-like alien in Star Trek TNG that thought the Enterprise was its mother)? If we exist in a reasonable spatial proximity at the same time (and if it isn't able to fly in space), does our existing together in the universe also include both of our life forms reaching a sophistication (of, in our case, technology) allowing for communication or detection? Just how manageable is the distance or our separation--that is, can we transmit messages back and forth to one another? For how long? For example, if we send a radio transmission will it be received before we perish? Will it be recognized as an intelligent creation? Can they get a message back to us so we can because galactic pen-pals? Do they *want* us to find them? For example, perhaps aliens have traveled here, decided we're mean and ugly, and so made themselves undetectable to us (maybe with their superior technology, or maybe just by getting way the hell away from here).\n\n\nIt's the fact that so many significant factors--factors that we can't accurately characterize or quantify--are related to the question of extraterrestrial life which makes, to me, the question all the more wonderful and fascinating to consider. Ultimately, I'm not personally convinced of either the claim that there is intelligent life out there for us to discover or its denial--in fact, both seem equally possible. Again, though, my personal belief is that there is indeed life (including intelligent life) which has, does, or will exist and which sees its genesis somewhere other than our solar system. Whether or not we can find good evidence for it, though, is a big part of why we ask the questions like you have asked here.\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* **The fact that we haven't discovered any trace of alien intelligent life forms or, alternatively, the fact that we haven't recognized anything as evidence for just such life--that is, life both alien and intelligent--shouldn't be so worrying, I don't think. There may be many reasons that we should never make such discoveries, even if there are indeed intelligent beings coexisting with us somewhere (somewhen?) in the universe.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400482762", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

In particular, as the Earth cooled, the climate became drier and the forests disappeared, forcing our ancestors to spend less time in the trees and more time walking over grasslands. \n\nWhile I don't suggest relying too much on Wikipedia, I think their article on the climate and the cycles might be helpful to [you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene#Paleogeography_and_climate).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400485495", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The people and creatures that live there are classified as an \"Entity\" and if an agent is to contact one he must report to his commanding officer.

{"body": "\"I was back\" was the first thought to crawl into John's Dormant mind. A sudden flash and a vast recollection of what seemed to be memories faded out of his mind. \"Am I finally dead? Has the cycle been broken?\" John thought to himself as he began to notice his surroundings. It was warm. He wasn't sure where he was but it was very dark and cramped. Suddenly John remembered everything. He had been alive, and was about to be again for the 21st time. He wondered when this vigorous cycle would finally come to an end. A blinding light came into view, John was not sure what it was but he decided to embrace it. \n\ndays turned to weeks, weeks to months. John was still mentally asleep. He wasn't sure of where he was but he knew that there were two people who tended to him everyday. John felt as if He had lost something, he was not sure what it was, it was something to do with time, He knew that much. Alas, it was forgotten. \n\nJohn was finally home, \"Another year, I wonder what'll happen this time around\" John thought as he crashed into his bed. John was 19, and it was now the year 2015. John had just come back from a New Year's Party at a friend's house. lying in bed, John decided to flip on the news, he had a tv mounted on his ceiling so he could watch tv while lying down. This was common in most homes, he seemed to remember thinking it uncommon and strange, it felt out of place, like some memory was suggesting he was not used to such a device even existing.\n\nJohn was eventually bored and decided to drift off to sleep, He turned off the tv with a snap of his fingers and turned his head towards his pillow. John thought about what he had seen in the news as he drifted off to sleep. Russia had began war with various smaller countries around Europe, it had started last June,\"It happened around the 28th\" John thought to himself. \"Some Russian Noble murdered in a foreign country by a nationalist group\". \n\nJohn found himself suddenly awake, He was not sure where, John was in a tent with many other men and boys. every one in the room seemed to be dressed in clothing that would be fit for farm work, although there was one gentleman wearing a suit on a small podium. He was directing the people towards a crowded desk. At this desk were two soldiers, these two soldiers were not dressed like the soldiers he knew. they had no vest, they were wearing green jackets with helmets he had only seen in museums. John took in his surroundings and noticed a calender on the edge of the desk, the date was October 1914.\n\nThe year was now 2023. John had found a job as a journalist. as he was driving to work, he remembered his dream. It had something to do with the letters A and L. He felt confused \"A.... L..... hmm.....   Al? Al.....   Alcohol?  But Al is also a name, who was named Al?\" John thought. As he parked his car at work,John checked his watch. \"On time as usual\" he thought to himself. John suddenly had a moment of realization, or that's what he would call it at least. It was like watching some sort of movie, except John could move about himself and interact with the world. maybe it was a dream, John was not sure. \"He looked around him and found himself in a basement with about 5 other men. One was behind a counter, the rest were at a counter. John was at a bar. \"how much'd you like boy?\" said the man behind the counter. He had a gruff voice and shaggy beard, His breath smelled of alcohol. There was a knock from the floor above. It was the police. The police claimed that they heard there was a speakeasy located in the very house John was in. Everyone in the tiny tavern fell silent as they counted the slow footsteps from above. They stopped at the basement door. The men knew that they had been caught and surrendered to the law. John was confused. \"what did we do?\" he whispered to the barkeep. he responded with a confused look and said \"you're not from here aren't ya lad? don'tcha know drinks illegal here in America?\". John was puzzled, he was from America. He slowly turned around and noticed a calender on the walls as he was being marched out by an officer. The calender read the year 1923 on it. It was night at the cells. John was suddenly woken up by a guard and was told to follow, John did so accordingly. The guard led him out of the prison gate and into a car. a bag was placed over his head to block his vision of where he was going. when they arrived, John was escorted to a small room and tied to a chair. The bag was removed and he found himself faced with a large Italian man. the man said \"Hey, names Al. Al Capone\". a few moments later, John was on the ground sobbing, a few of his teeth missing. He was being interrogated. they had asked him questions about who he was, where he was from and \"who squealed\". John heard a man enter the room, he said \"Sorry, you're no use to he boss anymore\". Things went black and John found himself back in the parking lot at work. he quickly checked his watch. not a second had passed since he parked it seemed\n\nJohn walked up to his office bathroom and washed his face. He was confused. \"what was that?\" he wondered. John crept back to his office and began his work. He had interviewed a protester for the legal use of marijuana the previous day and now he began his work writing an article. Something felt familiar. John wasn't sure, but he felt as if this had happened before. Marijuana was illegal in his state. His task was to write an article about it for the paper. \"Strange\" he thought. 100 years ago Alcohol was on prohibition , now it was the same but with marijuana.\n\nIt was now John's Birthday. John was still asleep. He was dreaming again, this time He remembered his birth. John's mind was flooding with memories, of himself. except he wasn't the same person in each memory. they were all seemingly historical versions of himself. John realized in his dream that he was re-incarnate every 100 years with no memory of the last. Something was different this time. He was aware of it. as John woke up he forgot the events of his dream and continued with his day. He was walking to a friend's house who had invited him to lunch. His route may not have been the greatest. John decided it'd be quicker if He walked down the alley between his friend's apartment and an office building. A man stopped him on the way and asked him if he wanted some bud. John was curious. he had always been curious to see what it was like to get high. he asked how much could he get for enough to just experience what it was like. he explained to the man his thoughts and the man stood there and nodded. He said \"I'll give it to you for tree fiddy\". It was only then that John realized that this was no drug dealer but it was in fact the lochness monster. John stormed off, disappointed. \"damn lochness monster\" he thought, \"always trying to get tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400519176", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let me tell you the story of a girl that does not directly answer this question.\n\nI met her in high school.  it was the heyday of high school internet, I feel, with myspaces and xangas and AIM (aol instant messenger).  Facebook had just recently entered the scene where I lived but was still restricted to college students.  \n\nI had been introduced to a forum (createblog, if you must know) for xanga themes by a friend of mine and down the rabbit hole I went.  Rather than simply stay in the themes section, I found the supplemental forums where people could just chat.  I gravitated to the debate forum and dove in.  I had many a good debate there (at least as well as high schoolers on the internet can), and I think my love of a good argument today stems from that.  Unfortunately, I'm willing to argue about almost anything, including things I don't know enough about. \n\nEventually I branched out, hitting up other forums.  My post count grew and my prominence grew and I was regarded as one of the more high profile members.  Then, in some stroke of fate (or maybe it was someone I was debating with who invited me), I joined the AIM chat-room for the forum. \n\nImmediately I was asked what my name was.  I had not revealed my true name yet in the forums, and so I declined to do so here at first.  One girl decided then that she would called me derrington, after a stuffed moose.  \n\nAnyways, the discussions on the chat-room had ranged far and wide and I enjoyed it.  I don't know if it was after an hour or a week or a month but somehow I found myself messaging the girl who called me derrington directly and we would talk for hours about anything and nothing, and I quickly found myself having a crush on her.\n\nThe community on the chatrooms enjoyed having phone parties as well.  With the magic of three-way calling long chains could be connected and many high schoolers all across the US could chat away for hours in the middle of the night.  I had my own cell phone by now with free nights and weekends.  The girl who called me derrington and I ended up talking directly on the phone as well, an evolution of our AIM chats. She sounded cute. \n\nI racked up thousands of free minutes talking with her about anything and nothing.  I was afraid of my parents finding out, so I waited until I was sure they were asleep to talk to her. It was often late in the night. I remember one time early on watching eternal sunshine of the spotless mind with her; or more accurately staying on the phone with her while she watched it and described certain themes because some parts were scary.  \n\nThis went on for a while.  Eventually it was our nightly routine; after my parents went to sleep I would call her and talk for an hour or two about or days or whatever we did or so.  I think she liked listening to the sound of my voice to fall asleep; when she got tired she wouldn't hang up, she'd ask me to talk at length about anything and nothing until she fell asleep.    I enjoyed it and I was in love.  \n\nEventually we both graduated (we were in the same year) and both went to college, both separate.  We sent each other care packages and letters.  But there are new people to meet in college, new things to do, and we were busy. We didn't have time to talk for 2 hours each night until 2 or 3 AM.  And so slowly our little talks faded and suddenly it wasn't working anymore.  We talked about it and it ended. \n\nWe still kept in touch and bit.  More at first.  We were facebook friends (we never exchanged photos, but facebook is where I learned what she looked like.  She was cute, like her voice implied. By then though I'm not sure it would have mattered what she looked like. I had thoroughly fallen for that voice on the phone.)  We both looked separate ways for romance, to find something closer.   We gradually kept less in touch.\n\nBy chance a year or two ago I was traveling to a city where she lived, and we met up.  We spent a day together (along with a few friends who were traveling with me). She was what I had always imagined she would be, a driven woman (by now); successful and interesting.  There was an awkward unacknowledged tension between us; although we never talked directly of love we both knew we had been in love.  But she had changed and I had changed-- there was no pang of love stirring from my heart even when I hugged her.  Did I hug her? I don't remember. I haven't talked to her much since.  All I felt was a yearning of nostalgia for our talks on the phone.  I don't even remember what we talked about.   \n\n\nTL;DR: \nFell in love with a loch ness monster in west philadephia.

{"body": "&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was a nerdy kid in 7th grade who loved nothing more than playing in the band. Anyone who's been through a concert/marching band experience knows that its a pretty tight-knit social group. Anyway, this girl moved to town in the middle of the school year and joined band. I never talked to her, but I just watched her. I watched her play her flute, I watched her change books at her locker, and worst of all, I watched her with her boyfriend.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I had never even had a relationship at this point, but the second I laid eyes on her I knew I wanted one. So for years I just watched and waited. I had a girlfriend on and off for a few months, and she stayed with *him*. Eventually he became one of those sad cases you see in school where everyone moves on and matures, and he just stayed in the middle school mindset. She left him. The first year of high school we actually started talking, and became pretty good friends. Then I was again crushed, as she started dating not only one of my best friends, but my section leader in marching band. This means that I saw them together about 8-10 hours a week, NOT including school hours. They eventually broke up, and when I asked why he told me that neither of them felt a spark. I knew that I felt one, but being told that she didn't was a worse scenario in my mind than never being with her, so I never attempted to progress the relationship.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sophomore year came and went, and at the very end came her birthday. She was having a party at her house, and I was invited. I was overjoyed, but didn't think much of it, as it was probably a big affair. Turns out she only invited 4 non-family people to the party, one of which being myself. That night we swam in the lake near their house, had a cookout, but the part I remember most vividly was that night.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We sat by a bonfire in the middle of a field with nothing but stars above our heads and woods to our backs. other than each other of course. And with three things to look at, we looked at each other. I stared into her eyes, and she returned my gaze with even more emotion. She inched closer and leaned up against me. It was that first contact with her that let me know that she felt the spark too. I flat-out asked her if she wanted to date, and she said she did with a huge smile on her face. It went away for a split second, but I caught it, and I knew something wasn't right.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\"What's wrong?\" I asked her, dreading her reply, hoping beyond hope that she wouldn't tell me we couldn't be together. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\"I just need something from you first.\"\n\n I knew it had to be about one of her other relationships, and in an instant I was wondering if they had hurt her, or abandoned her, or had done anything to make her nervous about being in another relationship. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\"What is it? What do you need?\" I asked her, \"Name anything, and I promise to do my best to make it happen.\"\n\n She looked me in the eye again, this time with a single tear running down her cheek, and said:\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" \n\n\nIt was about this time that I noticed this so-called love of my life was an 8-story tall monster from the Paleolithic era. I said \"DAMMIT MONSTER, YOU AINT GETTIN' NO TREE FIDDY, NOW LEAVE ME BE!!!\" I shoved that goddamned Loch Ness Monster into the bonfire with all my might, and it shriveled up into a tiny husk before vanishing completely, no doubt to return to torment me again.

{"body": "Reminds me of a story. Sorry this is probably gonna be long. I remember everything like it was yesterday. Back maybe 5 years ago my grandfather was severely ill. Like on the verge of death. He'd gotten Alzheimer's and, in the past year or so, had slowly forgotten everything. He had to ask who my mother was (his daughter in law) many times, called me Freddy a few times (not my name), and just seemed to know less and ask more.\n\nFinally, his time had come. He was like 85 at the time and lived across the country. So I flew over. My entire family; my mother, father, aunt uncle, you name it was there.\n\nHe was staying at a local hospital. We drove over to the hospital and walked to his room. We walked in and saw the nurse. She was maybe 5 and a half feet tall, had dirty blonde hair, and had an overall pretty look. She donned a concerned expression. \"Are you here for sterninator39's grandpa?\" My cousin nodded. \"How's he doing?\"\n\n\"Not well, to be honest. I don't know how long he has. Could be tomorrow, for all we know.\"\n\nI walked up to my grandpa. He lay there, pale face with a shallow smile. I walked up to him and said, \"hi, grandpa.\"\n\nHe examined me for a second, not recognizing me. \"Grandpa, it's me, sterninator39.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nI was fighting back tears. I rarely cried. \"Remember, your grandson? Please, remember me.\"\n\nHe looked for a second and shook his head. I walked back, defeated.\n\nThe next day, we came back. Same nurse was there. \"I've got some... bad news,\" she said. \"He's basically on the verge of death. I don't know if he's got another hour.\" My father started bursting into tears. I've never seen that before. He's always so joyful and gregarious. My mother put her hand on his shoulder.\n\nOnce again, I walked to my grandpa. \"Hi, grandpa.\"\n\nHe looked at me again, thought for a second, and then remembered. \"Are you that guy from yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Hello,\" he said, but he nothing else in him. He was about to die.\n\nBefore he closed his eyes for a second, he snapped. His eyes reopened and he stared at me. \"I remember you,\" he said, \"you're sterninator39!\"\n\nI smiled. I almost burst in tears of joy. \"Yeah, that's me.\"\n\nHe looked at me for a second. \"You've always been one of my favorite people ever. You've done so much for me, and I need one more thing.\"\n\n\"What?\" I said in almost a whisper. I was holding back tears again.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time I realized that my grandpa was about 8 stories tall and was a Crustacean from the Paleozoic era. God dammit! Nessie got me again.\n\n\"God dammit monsta I ain't paying you tree fiddy!\"\n\nHe swam away, never to be seen again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400558734", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "So I'm not sure if this will be as interesting for you guys as it was for me, but it happened at the first wedding I ever attended. I was 16 at the time and the groom was an older gentleman, and a very good family friend on my father's side. Probably a good friend of my grandfathers or something. The bride was a young beautiful woman, probably marrying him for the money, as he was well off financially, but  he looked happy. I believe they're still married.\n\nAnyways it happened right in the middle of the ceremony, not at the \"objection part\", but when they were giving their vows. The groom had a very long eloquent poem about how he had finally found the love of his life, he talked about how they met at a coffee shop. She was the waitress and didn't really notice him, as he was just another customer, but then when he grabbed his coffee, their hands touched and at that moment, he knew they would be together forever. He talked about how he thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever met, and that he thought their kids would be beautiful (although to be honest I don't know if he was young enough for kids, I mean who wants a 60yr old dad). At this point I was insanely bored and started playing with my phone, and then he dropped the most beautiful poem I've ever heard, now I'm not usually the \"poet\" type, but for real, this shit was beautiful. It felt like he was throwing down some eminem lyrics (for real though, it was really good). The priest finally turns to the young woman and asks her to say her vows. She looks the groom straight in the face and says \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was obviously quite a shock and I still think about it sometimes. I just hope my wedding goes a lot better.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400561222", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Godzilla is Batman. How? Well lets delve into it, shall we? I'll split it into two categories, mirroring characters and plot similarities\nCharacters:\nGodzilla is Batman. Is he good? is he bad? We will never know. But will he destroy a city to save the lives of hundreds? We still don't know. Also he is depicted as a vigilante. Well it was about that time they realized that this batman character was 8 stories tall and a coruscation from the pedidoic era! And when asked if he'd save the city he said he'd need 'boout tree fiddy. Er' go, Batman is Godzilla. Making Godzilla Batzilla.\nLt. Ford, the second main character of the movie is well you guessed it, Lt. Gordon. Skeptical at times, but understands what needs to be done to save the city. ﻿As he is the only character who shares a tender moment with batzilla as they both look over the city, with a mushroom behind them, wondering just how long they have until the city is in peril again.\nBut i know what you're saying where does Alfred fit in to this? Well I'll tell you, Bryan Cranston, Ford's dad, Provides wisdom but of course no one listens to the old guy, who also happens to be the best actor in both movies. As well as only be a part of the movie for a total of 15 minutes. So dissapointed DAWG.\nBane is MUTO 1. MUTO 1 will litterally do anything for the love of his life, even leveling an entire city in hopes of one day getting it on.\nAs you guessed MUTO 2 is Miranda, who strings MUTO 1 along just so she could get what she wants. And after sometime passes our \"hero\", batgod, realizes that the true enemy is not MUTO 1, but MUTO 2 and kicks MUTO 2's ass after having his abnormally small sized arms/ hands all over MUTO 2's body.\nNow it would seem like I listed every possible character development,WRONG! Our dear freind Robin (Gordon-LEvitt), is Dr. IChiro. The Doctor, much like Robin was always a believer in our vigilante. And repetedly looked dumbfounded at he dumbass generals who wouldn't believe him, when he uttered those brilliant words...\"Let them fight\". And not even once did he give up hope, becasue he knew Godman would save them in the end.\n\nK, that was characters. I will now delve into plot points.\nI'll start off with the easy ones. The nuclear bomb in the distance, and yet everyone survives. In Batman...well you know. In Godzilla they hatch a scheme to blow up these monsters, with a nuclear weapon. Boom! did anyone die? of course not, everyone magically dissapears and its chill, that a mushroom cloud is 15 miles away from the city.\nPanic is everywhere, as there should be...\nBoss Fight\nGodzilla wins and everyone in the theater stands up and claps while chanting USA! USA! (this actually fucking happened I kid you not )\nFord, along with everyone in the city, look in both amazement and despair. A city they once loved now destroyed, but they have hope because Godman, might not be the hero they deserve, but he's the hero they have. \nMore uproar from the audience, roll credits. I leave disgusted at the filth they just put in front of me, cry about how similar it was to Batman. Pass out in bed thinking about how I want to be BatGod for Halloween. \nAnd that my friends is how Godzilla is Batman.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400629876", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have a hard time coming up w/ 'bests', but here's some shit that came to mind\n\nthe given - 8/6/71. When a segment of an audience recording gets an 'official release', you know it has something going for it. There is more to it than Hard to Handle, tho - Lovelight melts paint, Bertha rages, Truckin&gt;Other One&gt;MAMU&gt;Other One...there's just a lot to love w/ this night and its recording. Bob's discussion w/ the taper (i think after Bertha, but i could be wrong) is hilarious, given the context. Bob's telling the guy recording what's arguably the best AUD recording where to put his mic, and the guy vociferously disagrees. Good for him. \n\nsame w/ 7/31/71 - there's more close-to-the-mic distractions throughout than 8/6/71 for examples sake, but in a lot of instances, that's part of the fun. Listen real close to the Dark Star on the Road Trips release - the audience patch there is sonic voodoo, it's so damned perfect. \n\n1970 port chester, Capitol Theater - all of them. the bulk of the audience recording of 3/20/70 has apparently disappeared into the ethers (I can't find it in any of the usual places, at least) w/ the exception of AUD patches on the available SBD from the night. 3/21 SMOKES - Viola Lee &gt; The Seven &gt; Cumberland. I say goddamn. \n6/24/70 is probably one of the most jaw dropping setlists ever put to paper. It's one of those that if you haven't heard it, stop making excuses....right now....and correct this. It needs to be inside your earholes. Now. \n11/5-6-7-8/70 back at the Capitol - great playing, awesome song selection/cross section of what the band was up to at that point, and variably awesome recordings. The guy tapping on the rail the mics were attached too can get a bit obnoxious during the acoustic sets, but overall, they're just great recordings of great music. The Main Ten struts around a couple of times, Good Lovin' gets the show-band treatment a couple of times, a nascent pairing of Truckin&gt;Other One shows up (2nd time, i think?), a pile of rarely-played but fun songs show up (Mystery Train&gt;My Babe? OK, more please) and great acoustic sets (least those that survived, anyway)\n\n8/18 &amp; 19/70 don't seem to gather much attention, but they certainly deserve it - the FW was apparently a hellhole to record in, and these are some of the best examples of somebody getting the place recorded somewhat effectively. Lots of American Beauty material making its way to the stage for the first time including what are likely the closest to 'Album version but live' renditions of Brokedown and Ripple. An acoustic Truckin' or two as well as a great How Long Blues both benefit greatly from the mystery piano player (Pig? Nelson? Lagin? The Loch Ness Monster?) \n\n6/4/70 - there are a couple of SBD segments of this show, but for the bulk of it, the AUD that appeared in the last couple years is the only way to hear it. Great acoustic set, It's a Sin (altho it suffers from a cut), Man's World, one of the frothiest of the frothy Minglewood's, St. Stephen complete with the summer 1970 death metal segue followed by a NFA that just can't let go of St. Stephen - Jerry teases and bends Steve throughout NFA so much that the band just says screw it and revisits the song they just played 5 minutes ago. This lands in my favorite slow Midnight Hour and gets a Baby Blue encore. \n\n9/6/80 - this one is kind of out of my typical listening wheelhouse, so I don't have much worthwhile to say about the bulk of the show....but I will say this much - Sugaree. Shake it.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400689786", "subreddit": "gratefuldead", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Actually, in the third book it was mentioned that wizards were burned specifically to explain why that didn't matter.\n\nAh yes. I forgot about that part. I was rereading Fantastic Beasts, and it does mention the idea that there was a dark time that sent them into the dark ages, but it only said to look at History of Magic for the reason.\n\n&gt;So we have to assume that all magical creatures of this level are boarded up somewhere by the ministry, or the magical creatures just keep themselves in check somehow and don't murder people by the hundreds?\n\nFantastic Beasts lists several ways that they protect themselves from muggles.\n\nMost creatures have certain properties that make them impossible to find. Some look so much like a non-magical creature that they are mistaken for it. Some live in places that make them almost impossible to reach without the use of magic, such as phoenixes living on extremely steep mountains or acromantulas living in a very remote forest. There are only a very few that look for their prey, while the majority of them have ways to avoid their prey through magic or shyness (such as unicorns).\n\nThere are several safe habitats with anti-muggle protection created for non-migrating creatures (such as merpeople and centaurs). For creatures where it is more dangerous, unplottable land is used. Dragons have to be supervised for being too dangerous.\n\nSelling and breeding is extremely regulated, especially on highly dangerous animals and highly muggle-populated areas.\n\nDissilusionment charms are used on a daily basis for magical pets.\n\nMemory charm is the second to last resort if someone finds a magical creature. It's similar to what you would see in Men in Black.\n\nThe last resort is the office of misinformation, which meets with the Prime Minister to come up with a logical solution for a magical event.\n\nA lot of times, when a magical creature is spotted by a person, the person could be left alone. After all, who would believe them. After a while they wouldn't tell the story for being called crazy 1 too many times.\n\nIn some cases, it's impossible to cause a protective charm because of the creature's magical abilities. For example, the magical beast the kelpie is a water horse that can change shape and drown people. Since it likes attention, and it's magical abilities revolve around that, they're hard to hide.

This is a super niche product from this weird tiny company where three unnamed audiophiles banded with a DJ, an engineer and a producer (who goes by the name of no milk) to design headphones. If that doesn't sound like the plot of a Kurasawa movie, I don;t know what does.....\n\nThey came up with these closed headphones that look generic, cheap and no-name from the outside but apparently sound incredibly awesome (the problem is that very few people know about it, even less have heard it, and most of the (few) reviews that I have read are either mega hype or cryptically brief.\n\nThe bigger problem is that the design principles that the Six Samurai (that's not what they really called themselves, but I digress) at Phonon used activated my bullshit meter to 11 on a 1-10 scale. At the heart of their innovation is the so called PHD device, which sounds like something from an anime episode (*\"Activate the PhD device!\"...\"Uhhhh? No, the labor unit will be destroyed!\"...\"I order you, Captain Goto, do it now!\"....\"Hai!\"*)\n\n I will let the folks at Phonon describe it in their own words, from [their website] (http://phonon-inc.com/en/about/)\n\n\n*Through the phd device, the original soundwave is not effected or altered. As a result, it delivers \"a never experienced before\" honest reproduction of the original sound.*\n\n*How does it work?*\n\n*The PHD is a small, very sensitive vibrating metal device that connects to the + and - of your speakers (for pre-amplified speakers, you will have to open your speakers to connect it).*\n\n*The PHD vibrates in harmony with soundwaves coming from your speakers, simultaneously transmitting ultrasound waves that compensate for the delay in transmission of some frequencies, causing all the frequencies to align. The original musical waveforms are replicated without changing the characteristics of the speakers.*\n\n*The PHD enhances your perception and sense of hearing, making you feel and experience the \"real sound\" of the original waveform. Result: a more precise and detailed soundscope.*\n\n*The PHD concept comes from the unique notion of compensating for the waveforms that speakers cannot replicate.*\n\n*It is a sophisticated subtle \"high end\" audio instrument. For most effective use we recommend using it in a good sound set up and environment. The better your set up, the better the effect!*\n\n...\n\n*We have also applied the innovative phd technology to our 1st monitor headphone the SMB-02 Subtonic Monitor Basic Headphone to be released in February 2011, and the NTC Rack.*\n\nTL;DR: This is not just any headphones, folks.

{"body": "nothing. The capsule was clearly lived in up until recently, and from the lid a thick viscous slime ran down his arm. He stuck his head in the capsule and discovered although the lid he opened had been thoroughly sealed there was a small hole burned into the back. He stuck his finger to measure, three inches of steel, something had melted through three inches of steel.\n\nThe capsule was large enough him to fit in, so the thought of something that size on the lose struck him as particularly worrisome. He had already walked around the facility, and he decided it was time to leave. He cautiously turned around and walked away from the capsule, tossing quick glances behind him. He walked into the hallway and quickened his pace.\n\n&lt;&lt;Was that a creak just then?&gt;&gt;\n\nThe man walked faster, he didn’t usually work out and the power walking  began to require some heavy breaths. He turned right at the end of the hall and kept his pace beginning to pant.\n\n&lt;&lt;Wasn’t it a left back there?&gt;&gt;\n\nThe man looked over his shoulder again, running at this point.\n\n&lt;&lt;Were those footsteps?&gt;&gt;\n\nThe man kept running down the hallways. Right. Right. Left. Right. Straight ahead. Left again.\n\n&lt;&lt;I was already here wasn’t I?&gt;&gt;\n\nThe man stopped paying attention, he was running as fast as he could and his slow breath couldn’t keep up. He saw a sign for stairs, threw it open and ran up all the flights he could. He burst out the top door and ran down the hall.\n\n&lt;&lt;I can hear something right behind me!&gt;&gt;\n\nHe glanced over his shoulder one more time.\n\n&lt;&lt;nothing&gt;&gt;\n\nThe immense pain woke him up, he rubbed his hand through his hair. Blood.\n\n“Ahem”\n\nThe man glanced to his side, and crouched down was an old janitor looking at him curiously through his thick white mustache. \n\n“Are you okay there lad? You’re bleeding quite heavily…”\n\n“uh… yeah, I just…” the man glanced up, an already red fire extinguisher box was above him slightly redder than usual, and dripping.\n\n&lt;&lt;Did I run into that?&gt;&gt;\n\n“… I just hit my head.”\n\n“Well you should be more careful! Come with me I can fix you up.”\n\nThe old janitor helped prop the man up, and walked with him down some of the halls.\n\n“thanks for helping me… but… I thought this place was abandoned”\n\n“Abandoned? No. We’ve been getting some downsizing lately that’s all.”\n\nThe janitor and man talked a bit, but not over anything complicated for the man was still a bit groggy.\n\n&lt;&lt;I must have been running to hit my head that hard, but why would I have been doing that?&gt;&gt;\n\nThe janitor brought him into a small office, it appeared to him that it was used for some kind of medical practice but he couldn’t bother analyzing it much. The janitor sat him on an operating table and went over to the cabinet and started collecting some supplies. The man closed his eyes for a moment…\n\nHe woke up again to a jolt of pain, the janitor was wrapping his wound and had wound it too tightly.\n\n“Oh terribly sorry! Didn’t mean to wake you again.”\n\n“…no… it’s okay…”\n\n“You really had a nasty fall back there, you should really see a doctor about this.”\n\n“yeah… I will… I should leave any…way… do you know the way out?”\n\n“Oh of course!”\n\n“…can you… lead me there?”\n\n“Oh, but why would you want to leave so soon? It’s only tree-fiddy”\n\nIt was at this time that the man realized that the janitor was in fact eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. It had been what escaped from the capsule! That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten him again! “Damn it Nessy! I’ll get you for this!” the man screamed, and the Loch Ness Monster disappeared into the hallway.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400806625", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Probably too late to the party but I might as well.\n\nI met a girl off POF. I talked with her for a little while but I hadn't met her in person yet. She called me up while I was working overtime at work. She wanted me to come over to her apartment because she was having a party with her and a friend, and this was on a Thursday. Her apartment was 45 minutes from where I was working, but I had to stop at my apartment first, so about a hour and a half in total before I could be there.\n\nAfter what seemed like forever I got home and I took the fastest shower I've ever taken, hopped into my car and hit the road again. I finally got there at about 10:30 PM. I was worried about being super late but when I got there all was good.\n\nI knocked on her apartment door and she opened it up. She was better looking in person than her profile picture. She was a solid 7. Her friend, who I did not know was also female at the time, it just never came up in conversation, was a solid 6. What I also didn't know was that it was going to be just the three of us that night. \n\nWe started the night off by eating some vodka gummy worms. They had already had a drink before I got there so they wanted me to catch up. So I slammed a shot of vodka and continued to eat some gummy bears. After talking for a bit we started playing cards. We were sitting around a small floor table; the 7 to my left and the 6 to my right. I floated the idea of playing strip blackjack and they were all for it. I didn't really think about how it would work, but who ever won the hand didn't take off a piece of clothing. The first game went ungodly fast so we ended up starting over and playing again. During the 2nd game we began talking about a threesome. I was acting pretty coy about it, I could see where this might be heading so I didn't want to seem super eager. Then they asked me if I had ever had one before, I said no, which was true. They looked at each other and then looked at me \"Would you like to have one?\", \"Uhh, yes?\".\n\nIt was on!\n\nWe got up off the floor and I started to make out with both of them as we moved to 7's bedroom. While I was making out with the 7 the 6 started going down on me. I was standing with the bed behind me facing the door way. After a few seconds the 7 started working her way down my stomach until both of them were on their knees. Each of them took a turn on me and eventually both of them started licking and kissing up and down my unit at the same time and both were maintaining eye contact. It was exactly like a POV porno of a similar situation. I had fantasized about this moment many, many times. It was perfect. \n\nAfter getting the double beejer for a couple minutes they asked if I had a condom. I did. I ran to my pants and pulled one out of my pocket and came back into the room. They stopped me and said \"That'll be tree fiddy\" That's when I realized they were--- just kidding!\nThey took the condom out of my hand and put it on me themselves. They started making out with each other and moved to the bed. I grabbed 6 and started nailing her from behind. The 7 was laying on her back so 6 started going down on 7 while I was plowing 6 from behind. After a couple minutes of that I told them to switch. I started to plow the 7 from behind while she ate out 6. 7 was incredibly tight and it was too much for me. I finished after a few minutes while in this position and pulled out. I didn't stop there though, and continued to finger the 7 until she squirted all over my hand and her mattress. \n\nAfter that we stopped and the 6 left. I ended up staying the night in the bed with the 7 and I left for work the next morning. \n\nI never saw either of them again. I talked with the 7 briefly but she was busy with work and we could never get around to hanging out again. \n\nTL;DR: When you take a 6 and a 7 you get a 13. I'm probably in a porno online somewhere, seemed too good to be true. \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400811512", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Once on tour a young Bozo decided that the time had come for him to visit the land known to song and fable among the people of tour as Backstage. He had seen many shows and made his stripes on tour; he was known among the peoples of lot and campground, to the bus kids and the spinners and the juggler guy with the jester's cap and the other juggler guy without; verily had he passed the Acid Test and seen his original face reflected on the ceiling of the Coliseum. He had a cute girlfriend with long hair who smiled and twirled in flowered sun dresses and made love to him in the back of their van. He deemed himself ready. So he gathered about him supplies for barter and trade: all the riches of Shakedown passed through his hands, and he had withheld the best of each for such an occasion.\n\nThe first Guardian of Backstage Passes he met was called Dan, who spent much time among the Bozos and Bolos in the course of his duties and was known to them to be approachable in matters of commerce. The young Bozo approached with his cute girlfriend and proclaimed, \"We are ready to go Backstage; what do you need in exchange for two Passes, which I know you possess?\" \n\nAnd Dan said to him in return: \"I only accept advanced electronics and exotic psychotropics. I see you lack the former, so you must provide the latter.\" He drove a hard bargain, but these were the Bozo's stock in trade, and soon the deal was struck. They took their Passes, emblazoned with the sign of a dancing cartoon frog in a top hat, and passed with a thrill of anticipation through the gate called Security into the hallowed halls of Backstage.\n\nBut sad were the Bozo and his cute girlfriend when they found out the truth - that not all Backstage Passes are created equal, and that theirs would only admit them to the Outer Backstage, a domain of cheap catering and empty Heinekens. Boredom reigned among those unhappy enough to become trapped in this benighted zone, wedged heavily into cheap couches or slouched against inscrutably stenciled road cases. \"This is lame,\" said the Bozo's cute girlfriend. \"There are no band members here.\" And indeed there were not.\n\nThen did the Bozo know fear, for he was approached by the one known as Kidd: another Guardian of the Backstage Passes, but stronger and crueler than the first. He was whipcord muscled like a steroidal mustang and smelled of amyl nitrate; his anger was the stuff of legend, and he sneered as he spoke. \"Stupid Bozo, you have fallen into the trap of the Outer Backstage. We keep this room here just to keep those like yourself from entering the True Backstage. But here I have the True Pass, which I will give to you now if we can strike a bargain.\" And he held up the Pass, and it was a thing of beauty indeed: an intricate design, tangled with detail and insignia of obscure but plainly weighty significance; a talisman of great power, and worth any price to a Bozo.\n\n\"What do you want?\" Though in his heart he knew. \"I gave much to Dan, but still I have tryptamines of great purity, and phenethylamines of great obscurity, and cocaine of the highest potency and most desirable provenance.\" He allowed himself hope, knowing how highly the last of these substances was valued by the Guardians.\n\nBut his hopes were shattered; Kidd would only accept one thing. \"I need your cute girlfriend, you stupid Bozo.\" And to the Bozo's chagrin his cute girlfriend accepted before he could speak. Like many of the sweet ladies of the sunshine she had a taste for outlaw leather in the dark, and made the choice many had made before her. \n\nOf course, Kidd being Kidd, he also took the cocaine.\n\nSo then the young Bozo did find himself in the True Backstage, bedecked in his ornate signifier of access and eyes gleaming with hard won victory. And at first he was triumphant. True Backstage seemed like everything one would imagine, a dazzling seraglio of infinite excess: there were a harem's worth of sleazy but beautiful women with dilated pupils and thousand-yard stares, and drug dealers slumped behind sunglasses and briefcases of the most suspicious type, and catering of great decadence and variety, and jaded folk of every ilk passing vampiric, supercilious judgment upon each other from under heavy lidded eyes stained by years of indulgence. The air reeked of mediocre red wine and excellent ganja with a tickling hint of freebase.\n\nBut the only band member was a nearly comatose keyboard player, his attention chaotically cycling between a bottle of whiskey and a pile of white powder on the table before him, fingers wandering through his tangled beard as if of their own volition. This wouldn't do; he had come too far, given up too much. He gathered his courage and took the boldest step of his life, a step which had ended in disaster for scores if not hundreds of Bozos before him: he approached Parish, the greatest and most terrifying of all the Guardians of Backstage.\n\n\"Parish,\" he said, \"I want to meet Jerry. I need to meet Jerry. Where is he?\"\n\nParish loomed over him, an overhanging crag of muscle, an avalanche of amused potential violence. \"You,\" he said, eyes slowly swimming into focus; \"you want to meet Jerry.\" He looked at the young Bozo so long he began to feel as if his very soul were being weighed and found wanting. Just as the Bozo's spirit was about to break, the words came - \"I can do that for you. But I need something from you.\" The young Bozo was ecstatic! \"Of course! But what do you need?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time the Bozo realized that Parish was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten him again! \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" he yelled as he ran off into the distance. \n\nHe never did get to meet Jerry.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400824139", "subreddit": "gratefuldead", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

We had decided to let my batshit crazy friend streak and help him anonymously. We swore an oath if any of us was caught we wouldn't snitch. \n\nThere was 6 of us in this. So we decided he'd wear a horse mask to conceal his identity. Our first order or business was to cause a scene by the snackshack fake fight or whatever. So like a bunch of the teachers would come and leave the sidelines of the football field. 4 of us would be causing a scene. 1 ensured and helped him get to the sidelines which he then ran onto the field with a bathrobe on which he then stripped while he had a horse mask on and ran around in circles for a good 2 minutes before security realized what was happened and ran back to the field.\n\nMy friends and I that caused a scene bolted and ran to my friends car and met with all my co-conspirators.

{"body": "So, it was a dark and stormy night... Well, not really. It was actually about three in the afternoon, mid July, only a few days after my birthday. I work in construction, so I've spent all day hauling about wood, concrete, drywall, and whatever else is on site. It was hotter than any other day so far, nearing a hundred degrees Farenheit. The boss had forced us to work anyway, so I got home chafed, sweaty, tired, and sore as all fuck.  \nI immediately grab a beer from the fridge, pop it open and guzzle half of it down. It was then I noticed a rhythmic tapping, I had attributed it earlier to a heavy heart beat from hard work, or maybe a loose something or other in the laundry room. As I head towards the room, I hear a muffled moaning.  \nI don't know how, but my brain immediately recognized that moaning, it wasn't my SO in pain, it was her nearing finish. For a moment, I grabbed the door knob and rested my head on the door, not knowing what was about to happen.  \nI slowly turned the knob and inched the door open. The image was permanently ingrained in my brain after that. The girl I thought the love of my life, riding this... I don't even know who he is. But she was riding him like a broken in stallion, letting him grab her tits and having him talk dirty.  \nI stood in the doorway for a while, trying to formulate some witty response to everything. I didn't need to though, he opened his eyes from his bliss and saw me, standing there. I remember his scream, so utterly girly. A moment ago he was sounding like some of those porn stars, gravelly voiced and suave.  \n\"Honey... \" I began, but she only screamed.  \n\"Honey, how have I always described my job?\" I asked, several times infact. I gradually got louder and louder until she stopped screaming.\n\"I believe my words were digging ditches and swinging sledges. \" It sounded so much more menacing in my head. I walked towards the bed slowly, and the guy tried to stand up and to run out. He became tangled in the sheets and fell on his face, breaking his nose.  \nHe moaned on the ground, slowly crawling towards the door. I may or may not have kicked him hard enough to speed his crawl along. Next to OUR bed was a nightstand, on which was set an overturned picture frame. I sat on the bed next to my naked girl and grabbed the picture. She grabbed my shoulders and began saying sweet nothings to me.  \nI looked at the picture, us at her 25th birthday party, hugging and smiling, almost cliched. I smashed the picture on the nightstand and pulled out the photo. I turned to her, pushed her down, undid my pants, and fucked her. I fucked her hard. There was no love, not any more, just me causing her as much pain while giving me as much pleasure as possible. After that ended, some amount of anal-then-oral-then-rough-vaginal-now-rinse/repeat later, I tore my face out of the photo, and handed her what remained.  \n\"I want you to remember this. The joy we had, that you ruined.\" I said. \" I want you to move out. Pack your bags, and go. I don't care where, just go.\" I stood up and went to take a shower. Before I left the room I turned one last time to her, for one final statement, and final fuck you for all the time wasted on you.\n\"And, you owe me about tree fiddy.\" Then I shed my skin and animorphed into a large grasshopper and hopped around the city, destroying buildings and eating people.  \nTL;DR: Found Ex cheating, had rough angry revenge sex, destroyed city.

{"body": "Dad used to drink a lot, so every fall my mom would take me and my brothers to the coast so dad could enjoy his weekend benders by himself.  So the fall of 1997 came around and we were so excited for our annual trip.  My youngest brother (we'll call William Howard Taft) was starting to bleed a lot more after the beatings and we were worried the police would start getting involved.  Daddy always said \"if you call the police I'll lock you in the freezer\", so we just let it happen.\n\nFirst came the rain, and we started getting worried that we wouldn't make it to the highway in time (grew up on a ranch, so the dirt roads were prone to flooding).  We packed that car as fast as our bruised little fingers could and started looking for mom.  \"Where is she?\" William Howard Taft blurted, and immediately we all started to fear the worst.  I checked out back in the chicken coop, nothing there.  William Howard Taft ran upstairs to the bedroom, but all he could find was a pile of broken whiskey bottles.\n\nBut just when we thought all was lost, mom came running out of the kitchen, with a meat cleaver in her hand.  \"Get in the fucking car NOW!\" she screamed, tiny specks of blood could be seen falling from her fingertips as she made her way towards us.  She fumbled with the keys and finally got the car started, but as soon as she put it into drive our dad had jumped on the hood of the car, blood shot eyes starring right at us and reeking of whiskey.  We all began to cry as he shattered the windshield with his bare hands and grabbed mom by the throat.   She let out a terrifying scream \"WHAT DO YOU WANT!!!!\" and my dad shouted back........\"Uhhh, I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was about that time that I realized that my dad was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic era! ﻿ Goddamn lochness monster!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400871598", "subreddit": "surfing", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "“Done?”\n\n“Yeah. Done with that shit.”\n\n\"Am I done? No... but I've been there and done that before, if that's what you're getting at.\" \nThat’s what always endeared me to Phil. When it got down to it, at least when I knew him, in spite of his pained wisdom, the man brightened up the room. Talking about feeling “washed out and done” was nothing special for either of us by this point in our lives. After seeing what he and various women had already done to ruin his life at 36, I knew I’d never make it like he did. He was jaded and yearning for hope at the same time. Phil had this way about him that made you feel comfortable, even if he was himself entirely uncomfortable. His earnestness was not lost on all of us, “Teflon.” That was the most commonly used descriptive adjective amongst all of us at the house for Phil. After having his heart torn out, and then restored and shown kindness so quickly, each one of us were hoping the best for him. But here, right now in this half of a second. This is where I realized that Phil is some manifestation of my future. The reality hit me, that this was a guy who existed to serve his own whims while still being an overall nice guy. But, little did he know, that somehow this was the most important self-actualization moment in my 20 years leading up to that point. Luckily, Phil knew how to tout some bullshit just like the rest of us. \n\n“Every little let down and failure we have endured in our pasts had its part in making ourselves who we are today.” He felt satisfied with the picture he painted; could see it in his eyes. Searching for good will.\n\n“No.”\n\n“What? I can’t hear you.” He was hard of hearing. Years of rock shows and ambivalence to personal welfare had had their effect on Phil. \n\n“That’s not what I meant.” I didn’t realize I was sure of what I meant, even now after having said it.\n\n“Huh? I’m not sure what you’re getting at, man.” He was equally confused.\n\n“I realized that I’m truly, finally….. done.” The gravity of my words sunk in quickly after a breath or two.\n\nSaying this was going to be the first day of a new life wasn't quite as initially satisfying as I had thought it would be. I’d hoped it’d be half as remarkable of a feeling as my old life was exciting yet simple. After making it out alive, I realized I was so much better for it. Tame existence is actually perfect for someone as non-committal as I. I never thought that I’d be happy without feeling out of control ever again in my life. The old way brought money, sycophants and what felt like good times, albeit destructive and toxic, but luckily… \n\n“I don’t gotta live like that anymore.”'\n\nThinking back, this particular moment in time is no more special than any other realization I’d had up to that point in my life. I was astounded at my own inability to truly gauge just how ridiculously lucky I was. I wasn’t an orphan. I was born to an NPR liberal District Attorney father who whupped my ass five nights a week, making my alcoholic mother run into the bottle over and over again. Hilariously, we grew to love each other more after inflicting so much pain on each other. Nothing’s better then overcoming unnecessary adversity you happened to have placed before yourself. Beating my own handicap was all I would ever aspire to do.  The world was stacked in my favor. I couldn’t imagine it being the other way around.\n\nPhil only met his father on his death bed and would’ve killed to have someone like my tough love dad around. His mother raised him the best she could. Promiscuous, drug addled, single-mother Mexican women with little ginger Irish Catholic children are not highly regarded in Tucson. This kid had to raise his little brothers and sisters from age 8 to 22, only abdicating his role as head of the household so that he too could run away, play with fire. \n\nWe were different, but I knew I was fated for the same pain that he’d seen. Hardest feature I faced was dropping out of high school and still going to college with great SAT scores. He knew this too. As soon as he saw my face, he understood what I was saying finally.\n\n“I wish I could’ve stopped at 20, never having a legal drink.” He seemed desperate at this point. Not truly giving himself to feeling vulnerable, almost if he were still holding out on the situation at hand. Just so he could say he didn’t try his hardest to live a better life, he wasn’t even trying.\n\n“No, it’s not about the drink or the drugs. It’s about freedom from the bondage of self.” Looking back now, this words flew through me with no real understanding. Once truly actualized, my words rang truer than ever before in my life. I didn’t hate myself from that point on. \n\nIt hit me looking at Phil and realizing how much I loved this guy, and yet how much I pitied him. It wasn’t so much that Phil was pathetic, because no. Phil was not pathetic at all. Just sorrowful and lonesome. Even now, as a newly-wed to a beautiful girl almost half his age just for the insurance benefits. He’s here to get better, to go back and fuck her until some kids pop out. That’s all she asks from the situation. He gets another chance at life and at the world in exchange. Yet still, as fortune is shining on the sad fellow, his anhedonia is entirely frustrating.\n\nI can’t tell him that I’ve been sneaking drinks and sex with that girl Casey down at the park for the past 4 months. He respects me for being a 20 year old “sober” heroin, crack, and speed addict. I was stupid to think that I could call myself sober. I realized that all I was, all I had ever been, was a former junkie with a taste for blunts and malt liquor. I looked at him, and then realized that he was staring at me. He looked different. That’s when he stood up, looked me straight in the eye, and asked if I could help him with something….\n\n“Lemme borrow ‘bout tree fiddy.” That’s when I realized that Phil was actually 350ft tall and destroying the Scottish Highlands.\n\n“Goddamnit Loch Ness Monsta, I aint gonna give you no tree fiddy. Get you own damn money.”\nI never saw Phil again. Some say its better that way.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400906705", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Vinsneezel woke up and groggily read the note scrawled on the desk. \"Don't worry, You're better off.\" it read. *Better off than what? Where am I? What was I doing here?* He looked around, saw a pile of trash in the corner. Needles and wrinkled papers, fast food takeout mostly, littered the floor. Dingy light shone through dirty windows. His chest hurt, his head hurt. He rubbed his eyes, and felt something slightly wet on his hands. \n\n*Is this.... Is this BLOOD?* he wondered to himself. *Where did this come from?* He looks around, sees drips on the floor leading out the door. He wanders out slowly, standing on weak legs. Opening the door he sees a woman lying face down on the floor, a small pool of blood around her chest. \"Oh my god\" vinsneezel mutters to himself. *Do I know this woman? Is this her blood on my hands?* He finally breaks his gaze away from the grotesque scene in front of him, and sees the rest of the room is a mess. Shattered glass was all over the floor, a couch was overturned and torn apart, the table tilted at an awkward angle, missing half a leg. \n\nVinsneezel finds a picture of him and a woman, a woman with the same brown hair, happily standing on a boat. As he grabs the photo to look closer, he sees a wedding band on his finger. *Should I know this woman? It seems I should, but I just... I can't.* He looks at the note in his hand again. \"You're better off.\" *Better off than what?* \n\nSuddenly, there was a knock on the door, crisp and booming agianst the silence in the room. \"Police, open up!\" came a shout. \n\nVinsneezel panics, thinking *Why am I here! I don't know what happened! Im going to get blamed for this, for sure. Who is this woman? Who am I?*\n\n\"POLICE, OPEN UP!\" came the shout again, followed by more banging. *Well, there's nothing I can do now. Maybe they can explain what happened to me.* He shuffles over to the door, noticing a pain in his chest. \n\nHe opens the door, to hear the policeman say \"Vinsneezel, you're under arrest for the murder of _e_m_i_l_y_, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say...\" \n\n\"Vinsneezel? _e_m_i_l_y_? Who are they?\"\n\nThe police officer stops his rant, \"Um... you are. And your wife.\"\n\n\"But... I have never seen this woman before, that I can remember. In fact, I can't remember anything past maybe.... say, do you have about three fiddy? I need about three fiddy.\"\n\nThe police officer's eyes widened as he realized he had just handcuffed the giant, green monster known as Nessie. \"No! I will not give you no three fiddy! Get out of here, monster!\"\n\nAnd with that, Vinsneezel took the police officer's head clean off with one bite, dug through his pockets finding enough change, dove out the door into a lake, and swam away.\n\n*The note was right, I am better off this way.

{"body": "\"Always a pleasure doing business with you, sir,\" said a man's voice as he rubbed his android against his rich client's iPhone. With technology so integrated in everyone's everyday life, a new etiquette emerged which allowed people to greet each other by rubbing their phones against each other. It was a high form of respect, especially for Xerbob who just closed a multi-million dollar deal with a well-respected astronaut lawyer. \n\n*I can't believe it* Xerbob thought to himself. *I can check this off my bucket list now*\n\n\"Just check in with my assistant here for the suitcase full of money, my good sir,\" said the lawyer. The assistant, a short freckled girl who stood beside him extended her arms outward indicating that she wanted the phone-rub greet. \n\nXerbob looked at her then at her phone. Her phone was an old metropcs plebian-status flip-phone with jagged edges and wear on the cover. There were also a couple of cracks and fractures extruding outward that looked pretty sharp.\n\n*Shit* Xerbob thought. *I can't screw anything up on this deal, it's too important for me, no hesitation! Just rub your phone on hers and you're good to go*\n\nXerbob meekly extended his arms forward, gripping his android and slowly rubbing it against the horrifying phone. As he rubbed, he could hear small crackling sound, as if the jagged edge scratched against his glassy screen. Each crackling sound caused stinging pain in his heart because he knew his beloved phone would need replacing. He could not shed tears, he was a big guy, he had to take it like a man and close this deal.\n\nAfter the 10-second rub which felt like hours, Xerbob was finally handed the suitcase full of cash. He quickly inspected his phone for damage and was quite surprised that there were none. The screen was intact, and the crackling sound must have been caused by the fracture on the assistant's phone shifting position.\n\nHe breath a sigh of relief but something was amiss. The suitcase full of cash felt... lighter than what he expected. He opened it only to find nothing more than a few dollars and coins amounting to $3.50 in there. \n\nXerbob felt hot with rage. He was ripped off and he did not like to be ripped off, especially not with the deal deciding the trajectory of his career. \n\n\"TREE FIDDY,\" he roared. \"I AINT GUNNA TAKE NO TREE FIDDY.\" His blood boiled with anger and suddenly he realized he wasn't a human being. He was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era, a goddamn loch ness monster. He gargled some incoherent sounds as he dove into a body of water, dropping his phone to the ground. He swam away into the distance never to be heard from again.\n\nBut it appears that his phone was salvaged because the one in this picture looks exactly like Xerbob's.

Also no Loch Ness Monster or treefiddy I swear. \n\nGood thing Subys have strong doors, when you open it to safely get inside, the POS Mercedes owner's car might jump into your door. It would be tragic that the 50 dollar repair bill you MIGHT get depending on hos hard it hits. But the 1500 dollar repair bill to his door (at least) will suck. \n\nOkay parking lot vigilante aside, call a redneck friend with an old beat up POS truck and pay him 20 bucks to park an inch away from the assholes car. THEN both of you have a picnik lunch on the grassy area by the cars, take HOURS. When the POS shows up, make him wait until you have a nice nap. I made a guy wait 4 hours one time. \n\nSome friends were in your cars position, but the asshat parker parked diagonally across the last two slots, and blocked my friends' door. I showed up where we were going to have lunch, saw what was up, I had a Ford f350 extended cab/bed truck. I parked in the only available slot, right next to the guy, I am proud to say that I was 1 1/2 inches away from his car. He could not move it if he greased it up. With the way he parked he could not move forward at all or risk hitting their car (less than a foot from his car to their door. \n\nThen the asshat walked out as I climbed across my truck and hopped down. He started to say something, then he made a realization. He 5'7\" and a skinny wormy prick that would park diagonally knowingly block someone in. Me 6'2\"  (I was young, muscled and while I was an engineer, my hobby was bouncing at a rock bar.) I was pretty well built. The male friend, tattooed, 5'10\" did a few yeas in prison for assault when he was younger and stupider and looked it. The female friend 5'2\" and cute as a button with purple and orange hair. The asshat guy stopped and looked at us. I walked up to him and looked down on him and smiled, I said \"Can you believe some asshole parked his car like that in a crowded parking lot. Hell what kid of piece of shit would do that. Hell probably the kind of small dicked piece of shit that would buy that car anyway right. Well we are going to eat and shop so if you see the shit for brains, tell him if there is a scratch on either of our cars we will be very disappointed. He just stood there. We went and ordered out food, watching him the whole time, he leaned against the back of his car. After 30 minutes he ate his take out on his trunk. We ordered food. sat by the window watching him, he stared at us the entire meal. We took almost 2 hours to eat. Then we went into a few of the stores. Then went back to the vehicles. His face fell when I lowered my tailgate and we sat on it while the friends smoked cigarettes. They loudly complained about some asshole parking like that and how rude it was to park like that and thank goodness they were off today and could hang out waiting for him to move his sorry ass. After a bit (total time about 4 hours) \n\nYeah it was rude of me as well, yes it was juvenile, yes I should be ashamed, (I am not cause um still a bit juvenile) would I do it now, no probably not, the Lady would not let me if I wanted to, sigh. \n\nWhen I backed out, he was profusely apologizing to my friends. They smiled, he looked horribly shocked when the girl hugged him, cause she is THAT kind of smart ass. I was waiting to follow them to where we were going next. He pulled out and left. Maybe never to park like a douche again, or maybe to go home and beat his wife, children, and dog. \n\n(There was another time I trapped a similar asshat between a dumpster and my truck, I loved that truck)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401082983", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Most of my friends were female but never really had the courage or the motivation to take the \"next step\", and I was pretty much afraid of relationships anyway. I never really got to experience intimacy or heartbreak or \"love\" or any of that other stuff. Hanging out with straight guys felt unnatural, or watching/talking about sports or other guy stuff felt weird or forced. It's like I couldn't relate to anyone unless they were female.\n\nThis continued all the way up til college. Seriously. Parties were spent gossiping with the girls. I was constantly asked out to shop with my girlfriends and it felt natural. I had a great sense of style - always commenting on how the boys *and* girls looked. I'd always masturbated to straight/lesbian porn but always had this curious side of me. One day I figured I'd give gay porn a shot. Nothing crazy - just a solo amateur video of a hot young guy jerking off. Next it was guy-to-guy blowjob. It was different.. and arousing. Then it was guy-to-guy anal cowboy style. I loved it, and soon it was all I watched. \n\nTalking about it with my closest friend - we'll call her Christina - wasn't a huge deal. She was almost *happy* to hear that I was coming out of the closet to her, but I assured her that it was only bi-curiosity, nothing more. She must have picked up on this, because lots of her other friends from her sorority were LGBT, and she wanted to introduce me to them. Reluctantly - partially out of fear of discovering I *was* gay - I agreed. \n\nHer sorority was throwing a big end-of-semester party and I got nice and dressed up. I wore a powder blue argyle button-down tucked into chinos, brown leather belt with brass buckle and my favorite boots. I got a haircut and shaved. I looked *nice*. The night went well and I hung out with lots of people. Then Christina introduced me to (we'll call him) **Ryan**.\n\nRyan was a vision of perfection. He was gay, and took a liking to me right away. He wore a black button down tucked into stonewash jeans and black Oxfords. His skin was clear as day, and his hair was silky, with just the right amount of facial stubble. He was like a fucking movie star. We got to talking, and before you know it I was all liquored up holding his hand.\n\nChristina drove us home. With Ryan's hand practically down my chinos, we stumbled into my bedroom. It wasn't long before I was on top of him with his shirt off, kissing gently at first but got more into it. My heart throbbed. Was I really doing this? I hadn't even been with a *girl* before, much less a guy. His hands fumbled at my belt and the buttons on my shirt. I helped him undress me.\n\nWe giggled. It felt good. But the doubt remained in my mind, somehow. It was partially due to the liquor, and partially due to my general curiosity. I was scared, but horny. Ryan must have sensed the hesitation in my kisses. He stopped and looked at me, and asked \"This is your first time, isn't it?\" I was silent for a moment and nodded. He smiled, his eyes saying 'well then, allow me', and got on top, straddling me. His large fingers began undoing the buttons on my shirt.\n\nHe stopped again, smirking, playfully, and said, \"I'll need something from you first.\"\n\nWith expectant and anticipating breath, I replied, \"What is it?\"\n\nHe said, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that moment that I realized Ryan was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Palezoic era. I said, \"Damnit monsta! I aint giving you no tree fiddy!\" He then swam away into the distance.

They'll sit there and think about how they just got owned by a Rioter because their clever troll post idea wasn't all that clever. They'll sit there in their pile of cheetos dust with their milk jugs full off piss, realize how dirty their desk is and then shrug it off. They'll make another troll post thinking \"MAN I'LL GET HIM THIS TIME\",  only to get owned again. They'll sit there, sad about it happening a 2nd time. They'll pick up their bong and smoke some weed. Play a few games on League and queue ranked, they'll feed because they're high and tilted from recent events. Their teammates will rage at them, calling them trash and just making them want to kill themselves. They'll get hungry and smoke some more kush. \n\nThey decide to call up the local Pizza place and place an order for a delicious Pizza with every topping they can think of on it. They sit there during the 45minute wait time still sad. They end up going back to the forums to troll once more thinking \"the third time is the charm!\" This time the community falls for their clever post about how OP Urgot is and the forums are in an uproar talking about the nerfs. Thinking he has finally succeeded, he calls out Zileas and says \"I got you this time, motherfucker!\" Zileas does not respond, he's busy doing his work stuff but he's actually hanging out with Guinsoo in the shadows. Mr. Troll decides to queue up for league once more with his morale restored and Zileas admitting defeat by not responding. He's playing really well this game, no feeding or anything. They're pushing down mid and take an inhib, the game is close 20-15 score. They all recall, Troll playing jungle this game and makes a call for baron. He hears a knock on the door \"Oh shit! My Pizza is here!\". He afks to answer the door. His teams loses the baron fight and they almost get aced. Troll is in the fountain so they don't actually get aced. Enemy team is pushing up mid and take the inhib and they're about to win! Troll answers his door to quickly get the pizza and hope to make it back to win the game.

{"body": "It was Valentine’s Day. I decided to treat her to a night out to dinner, dancing and then a romantic shoulder rub. She was wearing a dress that she knew drove me wild. It was tan in color and hugged her beautiful figure in ways that would drive a guy like myself wild with desire. We went to dinner and were sitting across the table from each other.\n\nShe took her foot and lightly rubbed it on my leg while gazing into my eyes teasing me and flirting. We discussed our life and everything we could think of. Including what our future babies might look like and what we might name them. After dinner we danced and as I watched her twirl and rock her hips I became aroused by the innocent yet highly erotic moves she was performing.\n\nAfter dancing we went home for her surprise shoulder rub. As I rubbed her shoulders I moved the straps that held up her dress so as to make sure she received the best shoulder rub she could get. The more I rubbed her shoulders the more aroused we had both become. She was a sweet and very innocent woman, hardly even been kissed. In fact ours was the only serious relationship she had ever had.\n\nThis was a night of a steamy mixture of passion, mutual desire, and the hormones of two twenty two year olds deeply and madly in love. After her shoulder rub we began to make out starting off with little kisses leading into deep passionate kissing while I ran my fingers lightly touching behind her neck onto her cheeks then brushing her hair out of her face and tucking it behind her ear. After several minutes of that I slid the straps of her dress to the side and began kissing her chest pulling the cups of her dress down and kissing all around her bra. As the passion deepened I lay her down and kissing my way down her dress slowly running my hands down her sides. As I got to her silky smooth legs I kiss them up and down enjoying the feel of her smooth skin against my lips. With each kiss and each caress the passion became more and more overwhelming. As I slowly kissed my way back up her legs I lifted her dress up exposing her blue panties with little white bows. Which by now were starting to become wet with the juices flowing from her tight pussy.\n\nI kissed my way to the inside of her thighs just mere inches away from her private area that no other man had ever seen. Now kissing her panties all over I could hear her let out little moans from the pleasure she was experiencing. I then took off her dress and reached behind her unhooking her bra exposing her breasts which were perky and supple. By then my manhood was beyond fully erect poking through my pants so I removed them and my shirt and lay next to her kissing her breasts slowly teasing her nipples while teasing her pussy with my hand.\n\nShe grew more and more aroused and began stroking my rock hard penis through my boxers. She then reached into them touching me, stroking my penis and balls. Pushing them down and removing them as she got up to remove her now soaked panties. She lay down and I climbed over her kissing her soft sweet lips as I began to slowly place the tip of my hard cock just inside her wet tight pussy. Slowly gliding just the tip in and out as she moaned with pleasure, she then wrapped her legs around me pulling me deep inside her. The feeling of her warmth and the silky inside of her pussy led me to moan loudly just as she lets out a loud moan and I could feel her contract around me. The passion was in full effect. I began thrusting in and out vigorously. Rocking my hips side to side. Switching between deep thrusts and slow shallow ones. Both of us coming closer to orgasm. With one final thrust I felt her orgasm as her vagina contracted around my hard penis buried deep inside her. Over and over and over again it contracted as she screamed in ecstasy. Each contraction pushed me closer to my own orgasm which was coming. As the first spurts of my warm semen squirted out I pulled out of her leaving sperm just on the inside of her and on the lips of her now pleased pussy. “That was amazing…” she sighed. “Yes.” I responded. Both of us were out of breath and we smiled tenderly at each other. “Let’s cuddle.” she said contentedly. \"We can cuddle, but first I want you to give me something,\" I said. \"What?\" she replied, smiling seductively. I whispered into her ear \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was then that I realized that I was, in fact, a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy, you goddamn Loch Ness monster!\" she yelled in disgust as she sat up. I then proceeded to tip my fedora with an obligatory \"M'lady\" before closing my prehistoric jaws on her soft flesh and ripping the head off of her body, causing blood to spew out everywhere like a fountain.

{"body": "It's really hard to get in touch with some of these people to really find out their rates. I once really wanted to book Vader to do an autograph signing at my family's general store down in Oldwick, New Jersey. I hunted high and low for a contact for the former world champ, scouring the internet. Many websites that claim they can book wrestlers are actually scams, so you need to really check them out. This one guy I got a hold, Fran Strumpet out of Minnetonka claimed one price, but every time we spoke he kept upping it a little. I didn't believe him, but he put me on the phone with whom he said was Big Van Vader, and it did sound exactly like him.\n\nAfter fierce negotations, I asked to speak to Vader again, in which case I was able to figure out this guy was a fraud. I read an article on a website claiming he has no real connections, and was able to cut off communications before I lost any real money. Thank god - it would have been an ugly scene if we had advertised a real, live, wrestler, only to receive a fake. Our customers would have not been happy.\n\nEventually, I was able to get in touch with a real agent, Bil Behrens, who handles lots of indy bookings. He has clients like AJ Styles, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and more. He's not exactly the easiest man to get a hold of, as they say in the biz, but I hustled and tried my best. Google was a big help, as I searched and searched. Finally, I found an e-mail address and asked him how much it would cost to get Vader at my store, and he told me it'd be about tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401204629", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "score": -1, "controversiality": 1}
{"body": "I think this is the answer.  A genre isn't a singular thing, its a category of things that bear similarity to one another.  There can be games that perhaps establish a genre, much like musical artists who establish a musical genre, but I don't think there is such a concept as \"pure-genre\".\n\nIf Musical Artist A has elements of X, Y, Z and calls himself \"metal\" what happens when artist B has elements of W, X and calls himself \"pop-punk\"?  Does that mean having shared element X makes artist A no longer \"metal\"?\n\nI feel that with the way genres form and evolve, Call of Duty IS a \"pure FPS\".  Because its the modern way of doing things.  Sure it has RPG elements in leveling, but that is what modern gamers seem to enjoy.  Walk down the metaphorical street of everyone who has played a video game ever (even including casual gamers), ask them what is the first shooter that pops into their head, and if CoD isn't way up there, then I'm totally wrong and I'll go die in a cave alone.\n\nSo maybe what you are looking for is a more simplistic shooter.  I don't mean this in terms of skill simplistic, but in feature simplistic.  A game with less.\n\nAnd that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Less can easily be more.  Less scatter brained features, but each feature that is there can be more developed.  That's where CS shines.\n\nEDIT: random side thought - you often get games that I'd describe \"as vast as the pacific ocean, as deep as a rain puddle.\"  You may be looking for games that are akin to Lake Baikal, not a lot of surface area but deep enough hold a dozen Loch Ness monsters.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401204803", "subreddit": "truegaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is all going to return to masticate you in the gluteals!\n\nA few random things: \n\n - The guys have some fun with Marshall's superstitious nature at the start of the episode. Jason Segel totally sells it with his little dance-and-spin routine before calling the guys jerks and running off. \n\n - Marshall gets mad at Lily for writing such a long thank-you note to his third cousin when she wrote him such a short \"death letter\". In the final season, we learn Marshall and Ted have a long-running passive-aggressive feud on a similar topic: Ted's upset he didn't get a thank-you note for his wedding gift, while Marshall thinks Ted didn't get them a gift at all. \n\n - I love Teddy Westside playing it cool, trying to be supportive of Robin's new relationship. Whoa, is Robin topless in those pictures? \"*Seen 'em*.\" Been There Five! \n\n - As a former Brooklynite, Ted's attitude about 'real New Yorkers' is a totally real thing, as I've been on both sides of it. I met girls in NYC who clearly thought anyone who didn't live in NYC wasn't in their league, and if I'm being honest, there were times I'd be disappointed when a girl would tell you she was from East Landfill, NJ. Ted's speech at the end (especially Josh Radnor's delivery) totally cracked me up. \n\n - For all the series' flashbacks, I think the ending scene in November 2029 (where Marshall finally opens Lily's letter) is the first true flash-forward of the series into the 2020s. A few episodes later, we'd get another in the form of the gang's 20th college reunion in 2020. \n\n - On the dresser behind Marshall's desk in the 2029 flashback, there's a framed newspaper clipping that very clearly says \"NYC Lawyer Captures 'Nessie'\", with a photo of what looks like the Loch Ness monster sticking its head out of a lake. Did Marshall actually photograph Nessie? The series never tells us for sure. \n\nThe best quote: \n\n - \"Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that? Saying you're a New Yorker when you're not. Because this is the greatest city in the world, and you have to earn the right to call yourself a New Yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to 'pretty-much-New-York.' Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am NOT going to New Jersey!\"\n\nBonus randomness: \n \nI'll be honest: I didn't have much to say about this episode. I didn't hate it, although I did think it started a string of underwhelming Robin subplots. For all the show's strengths writing about single guys in NYC, whether looking for a relationship or just trying to get laid, I thought it had a bit of a weak spot with Single Robin. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401217338", "subreddit": "HIMYM", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I have one. She's been my weakness for a long time, and I only recently just conquered her power over me. I met her in 2006; I was her boss at a little ice cream store. She asked me to be her pretend boyfriend to deter a man who was pursuing her. I was in a bad relationship, and low on self esteem, so I did, and I also found myself crushing. The two of us became friends, and hung out often. She was always happy to talk to me, and I sensed she was into me as well. On one of our many nights, awake until 4 am talking into the early morning, I confessed my attraction, and when prompted if she liked me as well, her response was, \"maybe.\" Young, insecure me had no clue what to do with that information. She wouldn't talk more about it, but was still the same flirty girl despite now having a boyfriend. We became closer over the next passing year, me trying my hardest to get over my feelings. I couldn't; I was too overly concerned with if there was something on her end or not. If she had been into me, we would have been a better couple then our respective partners. So I asked again. She dodged the question, saying, \"we have significant others, it doesn't matter\". I initially took this as her saying no, until we were both out of our relationships around a year later. I had a gathering and she came over, and without any influence of alcohol or drugs, she was wrestling with me and physical things of that nature. My friends told me to go for it. I did, and she became upset, asking why I had to go there. I was flabbergasted; I thought she was clearly into me at this point. She wasn't. \n\nWe didn't talk more than once every six or so months for three years. We both moved on and found new relationships. Mine ended last summer, and a mutual friend was determined to rekindle my friendship with my old object of affection. I was hesitant, as I did not want to fall back into any feelings, but I proceeded. We talked, and she commented on my newly found confidences and how much happier I seem. Which was true, so it was nice to hear. I was actually not feeling my interest in her spiking. Then we began to talk for 8-12 hours a day through text and facebook messaging. I asked her one day, hoping our newly found maturity would inspire honesty. She told me she had a glimmer of interest back when we originally hung out, but it dwindled quickly due to my low esteem shining through. \n\nWe continued to talk and occasionally see each other. She was still with her boyfriend, and things weren't going so well. I had a birthday gathering, and we had an especially good time that night, playing mini golf and goofing around. I was developing my feelings again. We were still talking every day, but now she was acting strange. I said I wanted to drink with her, and she said she couldn't; she didn't want anything to go down. I didn't understand, we weren't into each other, so what would happen? She changed the subject. Later on, while she was drunk, she mentioned wanting to drink with me, but that she couldn't in fears of \"pouncing\" me. I started putting two and two together. She was now into me. This was confirmed one night about a week later. What came next was a whirlwind of weirdness.  She readily explained to me that nothing physical could happen between us, but she said often how I was much better for her than her boyfriend. I believed it, and stuck around as what was essentially an emotional boyfriend for two and a half months. She had trouble with the guilt, and would occasionally be very emotionally abusive to me through silent treatments and diminishing of my feelings on pretty much anything. One night, I stayed at her house while she poured her heart out to me about how horrible her boyfriend really was, and the violence he is capable of. After that night, she felt too guilty and suggested that since she couldn't decide, she couldn't talk to me for a week. During this week, I received a call from her; she was drunk and she had been drinking with my first girlfriend, who was also quite drunk. I asked her what she needed, and she asked me to come pick up my ex. I obliged, but when I got there, her door was open; weird for her. So I entered. My ex was passed out, and she was passed out as well. I tried to clean up a bit and help her into bed, but they both woke up and began horsing around. She kept whispering in my ex's ear. My ex later told me she was saying she was in love with me and to not tell me. I figured this was a good sign for me. Bad boyfriend, in love with me... Meant to be, right? \n\nWe got into an argument about her stances on our situation. She never wanted it to be brought up, but I was drowning. It had been a long time. She did not care about how I was suffering, so I made an effort to stop talking to her. In the time that I stopped, I began working out every day, and was a happy man. About two months later, I had a vivid dream about her that re-sparked it all. I contacted her, and she told me about how she had been feeling closer to me than her man, but now she was happy and we could not even once talk about things. I was okay with this, I viewed her as a bad choice for a relationship now due to the emotional abuse. That abuse continued through our friendship. She would assume everything I said was an attack on her, and would react accordingly. Harsh, stinging words were her specialty, topped off with silence after. I stopped working out. I stopped caring about life. I didn't really know why I was so unhappy; just that I was. I gained lots of weight. \n\nOne day we spoke about engagements, and she mentioned that she wasn't entirely ready for such a thing with her man. I realized after the conversation that night that I was stuck in a rut. Two friends on the same day explained that every time I spoke to her, I changed in very visible ways. My posture, my tone of voice, everything. I didn't sleep more than an hour, knowing what I had to do. I sent her a message in the morning when I knew she'd see it, explaining that our relationship was bad for me, and I could no longer be a part of it. I explained how she could be hurtful, and I explained that it was changing me as a person. She understood, and that was that. \n\nShe got engaged a week later. I laughed, but was refreshed. I actually dodged a bullet. A friend told me she had a status talking about how happy she's been. I decided to read the status. At the end of it was a sentence that must have been aimed at me, it was an inside joke only the two of us would understand, but not conspicuous enough that anyone would question. She wanted my attention. I did not give it to her, and I found two days later that she had removed me from facebook. So is the end of my little story. I still feel a pull to her like a black hole to anything. It's hard to move past, but I'm doing alright, all things considered. I don't look at her old messages, and I deleted all her old texts, which is tough for me. Step by step, I suppose.

She starts spreading that news around. Half the group thinks you're a creep because you made her upset. Half the group tries to get you two together which is just fucking awkward for the both of you.\nYou could normally hang out and just watch a movie, but now it's weird when your friends just-so-happen to fill up every seat except for two right next to each other. She doesn't want to sit next to you because she thinks you put her friends up to this and doesn't want to lead you on. So she asks someone else to switch seats. Now you think she hates you or is purposely avoiding you, and you were once such close friends.\nSo you try to get over the girl by hanging out with the rest of your mutual friends. \"No\" the girls insist, half teasing \"You belong with her, right?\". The other half think you're a creep or a jerk. \"You were such an asshole when you wouldn't sit next to her at that restaurant.\"\nIf you were friends with the girl and you ignore her, you're an asshole. If you try to hang out with her a little more, you're an obsessed psycho. Mutual friends can't offer any support because then they'd have to pick a side, or maybe they already picked a side and it wasn't in your favor.\nSo you end up burning bridges not just with her but with all your mutual friends. You started just by feeling rejection from the girl, talking with your friends just makes you constantly repeat those feelings of rejection every time you hang out.\nSo you start spending less time with them, less time with anyone, and that's when the depression kicks in, and then you look at the clock and it's tree fiddy.\n\nFTFY", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401220802", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "One time I was in California to play some golf with my dad and we played this really awesome course called Shadow Ridge. It's designed by a pretty well-known golfer named Sir Nick Faldo, who won a couple of British Opens and was obviously knighted by the queen of England.\n\nNow normally, you don't really get to play this kind of course unless you're actually staying at the resort that the course went around or you're really rich. Now that I think about it they go hand-in-hand, but it's not really important. However, my dad is PGA-certified teaching professional, so he got to play there for free because these courses want pros to play there in hopes that they'll tell their clients to come there.\n\nAnyway, we drive up to the golf course. I was really excited because I hadn't played golf in forever and I might come out really hot or really rusty. We were pulling our golf bags out of my dad's SUV when my driver snapped in half. Apparently it was stuck between the second row of seats and when I yanked it out sideways, it bended a lot and it eventually snapped.\n\nThis really didn't matter to me a whole lot, because I was already too happy that I was playing golf and my tee shot was never a focal point of my game anyway. My dad says whatever, it was old and needed to be replaced anyway, and when we get back home he'll get me a nice new Taylormade R11 out of the pro shop at the golf course where he works.\n\nMy dad went into the clubhouse to check in, and he told me to go to the driving range to get warmed up. This is where my day started to go downhill. The driving range was REALLY nice, they had the futuristic ball pyramid contraptions that boggled my young mind at how it worked. Considering I had never played anything other than executive courses before, this was like entering an alien world, but instead of showing up in a super stellar starship I pulled up in the shitty Kia version of spacecraft.\n\nI put on my glove and tell myself, \"Today is going to be a good day.\" It, however was not going to be. I start off with my lobwedge, and as I follow through, I don't place it right and I send a haselrocket 90 degrees right. I was only able to say \"Son of a Bitch\" in my head until it hit a poor soul left in the babymaker 3 slots down.\n\nI run over to check and see if he's okay and/or needs medical attention when I realize it's fucking Nick Faldo! I just hit the designer of the golf course and one of the all time greats right in the nuts! I helped him up, but he just groaned at me and said something along the lines of, \"Bloody amateurs, learn how to play the game of golf, will ya?\"\n\nMy dad was coming back from the clubhouse to get warmed up himself when he saw this all happen. Fortunately he realized it wasn't my fault and I'm just a shitty golfer. \"Son\", he said, \"I think we should just go to the course right away and stay as far away from him as possible. Also me and your mother are signing you up for lessons when we get back home.\" I gladly obliged.\n\nHowever, I had no idea how shitty this round was gonna be. I first noticed when I whiffed my tee shot on the first hole. I just kinda brushed it off, but I whiffed AGAIN! I actually scored a 12 on that hole! I figured it was just a bad hole, but believe it or not that was my best one-hole score of the day.\n\nThe whole entire round I was sending shots left and right until eventually we got the last hole, a par 5. My dad had been playing decent all day and parred the hole to finish at 67, or 5 under par. Now it's my turn. I tee it up, swing back as hard as I can and unleash all the days anger into this shot.\n\nMotherfucker that shot flew like a bird! That shit almost entered ORBIT, I'm telling you, Houston almost had a problem. However when it came down, it hit the fucking pin.\n\nNow, I wouldn't normally be mad at something like this, but this was an island green where it's all surrounded by water. Because it was going so fast and flying so hard, it ricocheted like a bitch. It flew off, and rolls right into the drink.\n\nI'm pissed. I run, screaming, 300-save-Sparta-from-destruction-style, all the way down the 500-something long hole until I get to the water. I swing violently and aimlessly into the water, but I somehow got the ball! I had such a high lofted club that it almost went straight into the air. And guess where it came down?\n\nThe cup.\n\nMeanwhile, my old man comes rolling up to me in the golf cart. He asks, \"Was that a two?\" I slowly nod my head in disbelief. He then says, \"Son, in all my days, I've never seen a round this bad. However, on the bright side, with that shot you managed to shoot tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401231805", "subreddit": "nba", "score": -1, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Actually I want to say something to you.... about my friend Jacob.\n\nJacob was my friend, but he died yesterday. It was kinda sad, he wasn't killed by someone or anything, he just has a brain tumor that finally put him to sleep. Jacob found out about it eight of days ago, when he passed out during a game of hockey with me and my friends. We though he might have just taken one too many hits and had a concussion. The doctor however, knew otherwise. Within three hours our stop to make sure our friend was going to be okay was met with crippling realization that it was most certainly not. The doctor gave him two weeks, but he didn't even last that much. Two days ago it was just me and him, on what would be his death bed. We were talking about all the great times we had. My favorite was when he finally pressured me into going on the Top Thrill Dragster in Cedar Point, it took hours and hours for me to even get in line. His favorite was a time that we both had gone to get pizza after the 2010 superbowl, and the waitress had bet us that if we could eat a whole pizza each and then chug a half gallon of milk within an hour, then the meal was free. I don't think I've ever thrown up that much in my life. Through the years, I've known him as my very best friend. But as I watched him fade away in what felt like a blink of an eye, all the time I wouldn't be able to see him became what would I know is going to hurt the most now that he's gone. Yesterday he died. I'll never, ever forget his last words. He talked about how glad he was I stayed with him until the end. He never had a family, and was an orphan all his life. I was all he considered his family. I nearly broke down, but kept talking to him, trying to tell him how much of a friend he has been all these years. He was never mean, never ungrateful, and had never even asked for anything from me. He was just glad that I was a part of his world. I could tell he was about to go, he started to flatline, then recover, then fade, then recover. I called for the nurse. \"I don't need a nurse anymore, NikolaTesla1.\" He said. \"I only need a fr...\" He faded again. \"What do you need Jacob?\" I was sobbing at this point. \"I'm right here buddy, anything you need, I'm right here.\" Jacob faded in once more and said' \"I.. Imma need about tree fiddy.\" I stared, mouth agape, as I realized my lifelong friend had actually been a dinosaur from the Messesoic Era. \"God dammit, Nessie!\" I yelled as he finally flatlined. He was dead.

{"body": "This story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago.\n\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\n\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty. Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\n\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\n\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\n\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\n\ntl;dr: Haha..

{"body": "A comparison of what? Science demands observable proof. Religion requires faith, which by definition is choosing to believe something is true without any proof. \n\nAnother way to phrase this is that argument that you don't need faith to understand gravity, because its existence is provable, so no faith needed. For example, my wife exists and I can prove we're married and whatnot; I have faith that she isn't / won't cheat on me, but can't prove it. Not a fantastic example but there you go.\n\nAnother example: before the existence of the colossal squid, there were rumors and urban legends about a gigantic sea monster with tentacles and suckers. But science didn't dismiss these like fables about unicorns or fairies, because there was some indirect evidence that hinted at its existence: partial carcasses washed ashore, and enormous sucker-cup-wounds on whales that battled giant and colossal squids. So there was some reason to assume there might be something down there, it wasn't \"faith\" as such, as people do when it comes to the existence of god, or ghosts, or fairies, or unicorns, the Loch Ness Monster, or astrology, where there's simply zero evidence.

Their 2 regular wooden coasters, Thunder Road and Hurler, are pretty decent and neither has very high main hills (maybe around 100ft tops) but are definitely bumpy like most wooden coasters.

Why do you need someone else to tell you what you saw?\n\nI didn't know I saw a ghost, I thought that what I saw might have been a ghost or at least considered a ghost.  It's not about other people telling me what it was that I saw, it's me critically thinking it through.

Is that drawing named Santa, yup. I'm convinced that's really Santa; a marketing image associated with Xmas that appears in the winter season.\n\nYou're confusing a fictional representation of a popular culture icon with the actual icon itself.  I agree that there are representations that we would call Santa, doesn't mean I believe Santa actually exists as a person.  Jesus and God also exist in various art representations, I gladly admit that, but that doesn't mean those characters actually exist in real life.  If you avoid it again and try to push it off like that I'll label you as too dishonest to deal with.\n\n&gt; Are you telling me those characters aren't real? I don't mean based on anything, I mean can I open a book and read about those characters?\n\nThe stories exist, the characters don't exist as actual people.  You don't really know the difference between something that exists and something that doesn't do you?  If you say otherwise you should read your responses regarding Santa and fairy tales again.\n\n&gt; Well, asking a Jew if Santa exists is just as stupid a question. Just saying...\n\nNot really, because a Jew can believe that Santa exists but realizes they don't celebrate his holiday, they're separate.  If I would have said the loch ness monster or big foot I'm sure you would say those are stupid as well, but if those would work better we can go with those.  I don't believe those exist either, and I can't choose to believe that they do.\n\n&gt; Just because another culture in the same area testifies to the same event doesn't mean we borrowed each others culture, however you can easily trace the history of Santa Claus and see where all the crossovers happened.\n\nDo you know how long before Noah the Epic of Gilgamesh was written?  How in the world can they be the same event if the story of Gilgamesh was written well over a thousand years before the story of Noah in Genesis?\n\n&gt; Well, ask me in 6 months if I believe in Santa and I'll hold up my Coke can to make my argument.\n\nNo you won't, you'll only be showing your ignorance.

{"body": "Since nobody has actually answered your question:\n\nOne of the ways that a GIF's filesize is kept down is by reducing the entire thing to a restricted palette of just a few colors, which are then arranged in patterns to \"blend\" those colors so they look like all the intermediate colors. This is called \"dithering\". It's hard to tell in some of the more detailed/animated portions of the image, but you can see this effect very clearly in the [sky](http://i.imgur.com/jMENTEB.png), which is using 3 or 4 colors dithered together to imitate a final color.\n\nAs the exporter goes frame by frame and tries to snap each pixel in the GIF to the closest match on the restricted palette, sometimes a color is *right* smack dab in the middle of the two closest colors, which means it can flicker between those two colors frame by frame. You can notice the exact same thing happening over on the right side of the image, with the yellow shirt and the hair that's cut off at the edge of the image.\n\nThis effect gets exaggerated every time the GIF gets imported, modified, and then saved back out. The first time the GIF is saved, it might toggle back and forth between a dark purple and a light purple. But the next time it's processed, that light purple might actually snap to a *very* light purple or even a yellow. This effect accumulates with each export until the snapped colors no longer resemble the original/intended color at all.\n\nJudging by the massive amount of artifacts and the watermark, I'm guessing this GIF has been re-exported at least two or three times. Just for fun, here's what it looks like after a few more import/exports:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1xLQLhu.gif\n\nIf you look closely, you can actually see how the effect is now starting to show up in the trees on the left side. And if you're really paying attention, you might even notice that the woman on the left is actually 8 stories tall and comes from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "Somehow, this reminded me of a story about my teacher in college.\n\nIt was my senior year, and we had the fucking hottest professor in the college. Miss Patricia had this petite, hourglass figure going on, but I didn't mind her too much; I was pretty sure I was going to pass, I was doing pretty well for myself in her class and it was an easy subject. That one time she asked me to meet her in the faculty office was a bit sketchy, but yeah okay, it's not like a teacher shouldn't talk to her student, right? So after class I head off to the floor of the usually-busy-office.\n\nIt turns out there wasn't anyone in there but her, which was weird for that time of day. She tells me to sit down in a chair opposite of her. I go along with it and she starts to ask why I make up strange rumors of me and her having a sexual relationship, and hot inappropriate it would be. Me being confused as fuck thinks that I was being accused of something I didn't do and didn't get the hint at first. It wasn't until she was going on and on about how \"forcing myself unto her was the filthiest thing she could imagine doing\" did I get it.\n\nI got up and locked the door to the office and ripped off her blouse. Didn't even bother with the bra strap, I just ripped that fucker right off too. buried my face in those soft, firm breasts and had my tongue fondle her nipples. She kept moaning about how she's been giving me As all semester and how I'd be giving her a D soon. I told her to shut up as I hurriedly unbuttoned my pants.\n\nShe hopped up on her table and hiked her skirt up. She wasn't wearing any panties so I knelt down and gave her wet cunt a short 15-minute french kiss. I was rock hard by then and I got up and started to enter her with my raging donger. Even after getting lubed up with my spit and her precum, she was still so tight. There was something weird about it though, her skin didn't feel as soft as it should have. A guttural roar escaped her lips, and she started to claw at my back in ecstasy, and begged me to say her name. I whispered in her ear \"Patricia!\" and looked at her as she came, but all I could see were bright, green eyes and sharp teeth. I suddenly noticed she was 500 feet tall and looked like she was from the paleolithic era. I thrust harder and harder, and finished in that scaly pussy. We dress up and I walk back out the door. Went to class the following day, awkwardly stared at the floor the whole time and avoided all contact with Miss Ness.\n\n10/10 would study again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401376270", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Anyways, they were getting married because she had gotten pregnant, but nobody was supposed to know that.  The dress she was wearing hid her baby bump pretty well, and everyone was blissfully unaware until the moment of the photo.  I was so proud of myself for catching the looks of horror on everyone's face as the bride went in for the \"you may kiss the bride\" and tripped over the preacher's foot.  She fell down the stairs of the altar, leaving everyone speechless as she cried and cried and my cousin looked down with pure terror.

{"body": "I met her in 1st grade, even then I knew she was beautiful. I was sitting in the lunchroom, alone, and she sat next to me and with those big blue eyes she looked at me and said \"Hi.\" I was flustered, because such a pretty girl had never talked to me before. With my mouth already half full with a bite of pizza, I mustered out a \"Hello.\" Fast forward two months, she is my best friend. Kids tease us all the time, but I didn't care and neither did she. We did everything together, and eventually, we would visit each others houses on the regularly. I still remember the first time I went to her house, I tripped and broke her mother's vase. It was all alright though. Fast forward to second grade, I was so happy that we had the same teacher, Mrs. Morgan. We happened to end up on Mrs. Morgan's good side which was all luck in itself because Mrs. Morgan was a cranky old lady who hated everything and was only a few years from retiring. Again, fast forward to 3rd grade, by some sort of miracle we both ended up in Mrs. Johns' class. We were moving up in the elementary school ladder. Mrs. Johns was a very young teacher and I still think to this day that she knew that I had a crush on my friend. But I was a stupid third grader, I didn't know what to do. I had never felt this way about anyone before. But I thought that maybe I wouldn't be as lucky to be in her class the next year and that I should do something. But do what? I thought about writing a note, but that seemed weird even back then. In the last few months of school I figured the it was time. I was gonna be a man for the first time in my short life. So, on a warm april day, I kissed her on the cheek and asked her to be my girlfriend. She said yes. To this day, this is still one of my fondest memories.\n\n4th grade. 5th grade. 6th grade. 7th grade. 8th grade\n\nThere are too many memories and events that happened in this time. We were going strong with no signs of slowing down. We had matured. No one teased us anymore. Things were great. After promotion, we spent the entire summer together. Almost everyday, I went to her house. I actually got to know her parents pretty well after all these years. They loved me. And soon enough we were freshman in highschool. It was rough, her father was in a wreck and he didn't make it. She was never quite the same after this. She was distant. She hardly talked to me anymore. It went from me going to her house almost everyday to seeing her maybe two times a week. On the day before christmas break. She broke it to me, she didn't want to be together anymore. I was devastated. I was a mess. I thought about her every second of everyday. I guess it really is true, you never know what you have until it's all gone. Fast forward to sophomore year. I still wasnt ready to start dating. But boy did she move on. One particular day when I was at home, depressed, a friend got me to go to a party with him. We got there at about 10. The music was loud, and alcohol was plentiful. An hour or so after, I see her. She is completely obliterated. I start to walk up to her. But I soon watch her make out with some douche from the football team. I wanted to leave but my friend was no where to be found. I sat around and tried drinking for the first time. I got a little drunk and decided to go look for my buddy once again. But what do I see? I see her going down on three football players in the middle of a crowd? How could she? How could they? I was furious. I walked up there and proceeded to get the living shit beat out of me by three football players. What had she become? The girl I fell in love with was no more. She looks at me and spits on me. and crouches down to say something into my ear. What she told me, I will never forget. She said, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" And thats when I noticed that she was actually a three story loch ness monster from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "Yes, yes I have.\n\nAbout 2 years ago I was set up on a blind date by one of my friends. I've never been on a blind date before so I was excited, but also terrified because of all the horrible blind date stories I heard on Reddit. I decided to still go through with it.\n\nI arrived about 5 min early, and got a table for the 2 of us. I waited for about 8 min, and I all ready had the fear of being stood up. I sat and waited patiently staring at the door for what seemed like forever(I get nervous). Then an extremely beautiful older women walks in, long brown hair, bright blue eyes, you could tell she worked out she was in great shape, anyways she was attractive. I instantly hoped that was my date even though I was told before that my date was in her 20's. \n\nSurprisingly this beautiful older women sat down across with me. I instantly greeted her, and asked if she was my date Katie? \"Ha no, no, Katie's my daughter she should be here soon. My names Kathy.\" \n\nInstantly I was kinda weirded out, and a thick aurora of uncomfortableness covered the air. Why was Katie's mother here? Then Kathy's phone rang. \"Hello? Oh good you here! I'll come out and get you. Your date is quite the attractive man!\" Kathy Smiled at me and then left the restaurant  to \"bring in Katie.\"\n\nKatie was rolled in a wheel chair by her mother. I thought Ohhh the mother was just here to help Katie inside, she will probably leave now. Nope. Kathy put Katie right next to me, and Kathy sat across from me. I introduced myself to Katie. Katie was a really shy, timid girl, the opposite personality of her mother.\n\nKatie and I started some awkward small talk when Kathy interrupted saying \"Lets get some drinks!\" Katie then asked her mom to politely go, Kathy replied \"Honey you know I like to monitor these kind of things.\" Katie's cheeks got a little red, and all I could thing was this situation was fucking insane.\n\nThe waiter brought us all drinks, and Katie started to speak up a little to Kathy. \"Mom you know I don't like to drink...\" Kathy replied with her all ready emptied glass in her hand \"Lighten up Katie! Just have fun!\"\n\nKatie then gave Kathy the most pissed off look a shy girl in a wheel chair could. \"I can't have fun with you here!\" Then Katie started rolling out the doors.\n\nI then sat there quiet, alone with Kathy. I told her I should probably go. Kathy wouldn't let that happen. \"No, no-stay awhile! Have some fun! At least finish your drink before you go.\" I had nothing better to do that night, so I decided to stay and have just \"one\" drink.\n\nTo this day I swear that first drink was drugged. I ended up having ALOT more then just one drink. Kathy, and I actually really connected. We talked for hours about our favorite films, and literature. We shared many passions. Though she was super controlling to her 23 year old daughter a couple hours ago I forgot all about it. We drank, and we laughed, and we talked for hours. It honestly ended up being one of the best dates I've ever had. It was just so fun and a good experience.\n\nIt was getting late and I asked Kathy if she wanted to go back to my place to watch one of the movies we were discussing. Kathy agreed. I then went to go pay the Bill when Kathy interrupted politely \"Evil Dran I got the bill, you gave me a fun night!\" \n\nAfter a short back, and forth over the bill she got out her purse to pay. Kathy payed in all cash, and was counting her money on the counter. She stops counting for a second and looks at me. \"I'm a bit short, can you lend me about Three Fifty\" Well it was about that time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. I yelled \"God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\" \n\nTl;Dr: 23 year old girl in a wheel chair's mother comes on date with us. Girl leaves, and I end up having a date with the crazy mother.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401430052", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think you're doing everyone in this thread a disservice by not talking about the other insectivorous countermeasures you ad your wife have attempted in dealing with your bedbug problem.

Diatomaceous earth and been oil helped reduce bites by 20%. Cool.\n4. Steam cleaning, double-drying, etc. reduced by 35%. Great.\n5. But we hit a plateau of getting bit still.\n6. So she suggested we get some praying mantids: those fuckers hunt stuff. Okay, local garden store sells them; at $60 for 10 mantids, we felt it was a little pricey but worth a shot. Problem with praying mantids is you don't really like waking up to them on your knee or shoulder, it's a little freaky. Especially for our four-year-old D:\n7. Eventually we stopped seeing the mantids around. So next we got some wolf spider egg sacks; wolf spiders are pretty good little hunters, and lots of fun to watch hopping around as they hunt for things. \n8. But they're a little too profligate,  and once we wiped out our bedbugs we had a wolf spider infestation.\n9. House centipedes are pretty common here in the city, as are cockroaches. Less common are scorpions. My wife suggested we start with house centipedes to eat the wolf spiders; then cockroaches for the house centipedes; and now we just have a filthy home in order to keep the cockroaches happy.\n10.

Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.\n\nQuote taken from Men in Black, but still applicable in this situation.\nYou KNOW you're the Christ? That's great. Wonderful even. I sincerely hope your life reflects such a statement.\n\nThe funny thing is, I agree with OP. I think the \"Christ\" reference in Christian Mythology is a metaphor for a state of mind which can be awakened in nearly anyone.\n\nSadly however, we live in a society in which claims to divinity and the like are openly shunned and placed into the same category as people who claim to have seen a UFO or the Loch Ness Monster, or Bigfoot or whatever else. The mainsteam will think you're a lunatic if you openly wander around blandly stating \"I'm the Christ\", so even if you had something important to say, no one's gonna listen to you so long as you insist on having such a meaningless and mystical sounding title as \"Christ\"\n\nI think if you really want to make change and/or spread a message, you're gonna have to rethink your strategy from a marketing point-of-view. Unless this is about having an ego and wanting to be worshiped as the head of some cult, I'm sure there would be no objections to keeping the fact that you \"know\" you're Christ a secret... for the sake of the world you wish to save... right?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401467741", "subreddit": "DigitalCartel", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "One of the best ways to reduce \"slog\", I think, is to trim anything that doesn't move the plot forward. For instance, I have a scene in my book where the goal of this scene is to reveal a certain bit of information during dinner. If my characters spend too much time bickering over the color of the tablecloth, then it gets to be a slogfest really fast. Instead, anything that doesn't move the conversation toward that bit of information should probably be removed.\n\n&gt; \"So what is it you do, really?\" asked Joe.\n\n&gt; \"Dinner's ready!\" chimed Sally. She carefully placed a platter of turkey on the table with one hand and a boat of gravy with the other. As the gravy container tapped the ground, it splashed over, spilling delicious brown goodness all over the brand new tablecloth.\n\n&gt; \"That's my grandmother's tablecloth!\" cried Betty, Sally's younger sister. \"You've ruined it!\"\n\n&gt; \"Oh, nonsense,\" said Sally. \"I'll wash it after dinner.\"\n\n&gt; \"If there's a big brown stain there, I'm going to kill you!\"\n\n&gt; \"Ahem,\" coughed David. \"I'm a paleolithic monster that lives in Loch Ness, and you owe me about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnyway, it's a contrived example, but all that crap about the tablecloth can be just cut.\n\n&gt; \"So what is it you do, really?\" asked Joe.\n\n&gt; \"Funny you ask,\" answered Dave. \"I'm actually an astronaut.\"\n\nNow, that's not to say that you can't have descriptive things and things that improve the atmosphere, because you totally can. But as a general rule, each chapter should have a goal, and each scene should have a goal, and maybe even each \"beat\" should have a goal. If you're not moving toward that goal, then you should re-evaluate that section and say \"Ok, if I'm trying to get from Point A to Point C, do I really need to stop at Point B, or can I just cut that out entirely? Or rewrite it so that I briefly stop at B but quickly move on to C?\"\n\nJust as another real-world example, let's look at the *Lord of the Rings* movie trilogy by Peter Jackson, et al. (For the sake of argument and simplicity, let's ignore the quality of the movies and just focus on how they were made.)\n\nWhen Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh wrote the *Lord of the Rings* screenplay, they cut a lot of things that really enhance the story. Things like Tom Bombadil. These kinds of cuts really upset the fan base, because we all love Tom Bomadil and we all want to see as much of the Lord of the Rings universe as possible on the big screen. The problem is that if they did a scene-by-scene recreation on the silver screen, the movie would be like 30 hours long.\n\nThere were other plot lines that got cut, too. The trio decided that they wanted to focus on two major plots: The Fellowship Gets the One Ring to Mordor plot, and the Aragorn becomes King plot. Pretty much anything else got cut.\n\nTheir goal was to tell Lord of the Rings in three 3-hour movies. Anything that prevented that had to go.\n\nNow, you're not writing a screenplay, but you are writing a book. If you find that you're getting bogged down in melodrama and minutia, it might pay off to adopt a similar approach. What are the most essential plotlines? Does each and every scene get you closer to the end-goal there? If not, cut it.\n\nHope that helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401469806", "subreddit": "writing", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "By far the most overrated thing is having a kid. My wife got pregnant in 2011 and we were ecstatic, like most people would be. The pregnancy went fine and everything was nice and dandy, but, on the day she was due, chaos struck. \n\nThe day started like pretty much every other day. We woke up, ate, watched T.V. and around noon we started getting ready to go have this kid. My wife looked beautiful sitting next to me in the car while we were on our way to the hospital and I could tell she was super nervous. We got on the highway and it was smooth sailing. Until... this big motherfucking truck cuts me off and I swerve out of the way and into the side railing. My wife starts freaking out and I'm just glad that she was okay. I get out of the car to check out the damage and discover that somehow, I now had two flat tires. Great.\n\nAn hour later, a tow truck arrives and my wife is starting to have contractions. The tow truck driver couldn't transport us back to town so my wife and I waited on the side of the fucking highway in 80 degree heat for almost an hour until my buddy could get us. He drives us the rest of the way to the hospital and I'm relieved that it's almost over.\n\nMy wife goes into labor and she's on all sorts of pain meds. 5 hours in and it's still not over. 10. 11. 12. 13 motherfucking hours after we got to the hospital and finally this baby is out of my wife. I couldn't be happier. My wife was absolutely wrecked. I'm surprised she didn't fall asleep instantly. The doctors are checking out the baby and I'm staring at my gorgeous, strong, perfect wife. We're smiling at each other and holding hands when she asks me, \"Babe, can you get me something?\"\n\"Of course, what do you need?\" I respond.\n\"About tree fiddy.\"\nIt was then I realized that my wife was a giant crab beast from the depths of the ocean. Her claws swiped at the doctors, instantly beheading them. My baby started to scream so I dove for him but it was too late, my wife had swallowed him whole. I ran out of that hospital and left my barnacle encrusted crustacean of a wife to rot in that hospital room. Never have kids, but if you do, make sure you know who your partner is.

The house is upper middle class, pretty bland.\n\nShe swears there is a ghost inside. The only reason we didn't disregard the call is because she claimed there was screaming in her attic. She claimed the ghost was doing it, I was supposed to make sure an animal wasn't stuck up there or something.

So, of course, the logical explanation is a ghost.\n\nShe was far too afraid to check the attic, so I head up there. It was full of cobwebs and musty, and of course the only lightbulb didn't work.

{"body": "There's a lot you have to work into the math for a thing like this.  Let's go through it (using my flair to it's full purpose I dare say).\n\nFirst you have to think about how many people don't have compendiums or have low level compendiums that may be enticed by immortal rewards.  I would estimate about 3 out of every 5 active players don't have compendiums, and that 1 in 5 of them would be enticed by the possible rewards.  Also, out of the 40% of players that I'm estimating have compendiums at this moment, I would say about 35% would be enticed by good immortals to buy more compendium points.\n\nNext, let's look at how many people there are in the pool left and how much money they would spend on average.  If you estimate that there's 1.75 million people in the group of compendium owners, and that 35% of them would be enticed, that's roughly 0.5 million users.\n\nOf these half of a million users, let's add up how much money they would spend roughly.  If they all spent the same amount of only one of the most expensive sets of points (10USD) then the prize pool would increase by 1.25 million United States dollars, or by about 17.3%.  Now, if you add in a more conservative amount of 6 USD paid per enticed buyer, you could get a more reasonable amount added of .75 million dollars added in, which would be around 12%.  Now note, this is all estimated as absolute max for this alone.

{"body": "I suddenly woke up, gasping for air. The light was filtering in through the blinds, the harsh sunlight assaulting the soft blue glow coming off of my computer's monitor. My heart gradually slowed down as I took longer, deeper, slower breaths. I closed my eyes shut, calmed down, and pushed those memories away into the dark recesses of my mind. I would never forget what they did, I would never forgive them either. I slowly put my feet down on the rough carpet, and gradually stood up, wincing as I did so. All the running and fighting from the past few days was really beginning to catch up with my body, but it wasn't too bad. Yet. Nevertheless, I put on my shoes, my black cap, my trench coat - slightly muddied after such hard use but still lovely, kind of like the one you can get for John Marston in Red Dead Redemption - and pocketed my most valuable possession: my phone.  \n\nAs I stepped out into the harsh sunlight, I had to slightly shield my eyes as they adjusted to the change in brightness, even though I was wearing a cap. I felt a grumble in my stomach and realized that I had not eaten for the past day. I checked my bank account and saw that I had no money left. Keeping a lookout with the corner of my eye, I quickly tapped the screen of my phone a few times. Identifying a target, I hacked into their bank account, stealing their information and I subsequently used it at an ATM to take some cash. A bumblebee buzzed nearby on some flowers. Upon taking the money, I went off to the supermarket with its pristine floors and near-sterilized feel. I have always thought that these supermarkets look and are too much like hospitals. They are just too pristine, too neat, too clean. Of course I needed something to eat and so I chose to have some of my favorite food: ricotta cheese. Like a whole, big box of it. Nothing else. Very healthy and tasty stuff I tell you, though it was a bit hard eating through my scarf that usually covers my face. In addition, the whole outfit does get a bit cumbersome in the summer, with me feeling rather warm underneath, but I need to do what needs to be done. I paid and as I was leaving, eating away on my ricotta, I saw the man. I could not believe it: this was the man who ruined my life. I took out my phone and began to silently stalk him.\n \nAs we reached the intersection, he suddenly stopped and looked around, and so I had to quickly merge into the shadows. But I peered out through the darkness, paying attention to his every move, analyzing any potential weakness that may have arisen. I watched while eating away on my ricotta cheese. I followed while eating my ricotta cheese. It helped me concentrate, calm my nerves. I felt like a dog on the lookout. A watchdog if you will. But I am fairly advanced from dogs in the field of technology, so maybe a more appropriate title for myself would include an underscore between \"watch\" and \"dog,\" making it end up looking like watch_dog. Yeah, that seems more edgy and appropriate for myself. Back to the story, as I quietly stalked the man, the one responsible for the murder of my family, I finally found my opportunity: he walked into a dark alley. Perfect, I thought, for I was the master of the silent kill. I took out my baton from the inside of my trench coat and followed him down the alley.\n \nIt was silent in the alleyway, cool as well. It provided a respite from the harsh constant eye of the sun. The man must have suddenly heard my footsteps as he suddenly turned around. One look in his eyes and I instantly saw it: fear. He could tell who I was without actually having to see my face. He could tell from these vengeful eyes that I was out for blood, and would not settle for anything else other than his death. I slowly began to saunter up to him, powerfully, in control. I planned to brutally beat him down with my baton, beat him to a pulp like he did to my wife and child. He was only 5 years old. My boy did not deserve that. But one unexpected thing suddenly happened. My illusion of power was suddenly broken. This pawn under my control began to run. He ran like a coward, away from me and towards the street, preventing me from killing him then and there. So I took out my silenced pistol, and shot him in his right knee. To be safe, I then took out his left knee. And then his elbows. I walked up to him and with my baton, I began the beatdown. A good amount of time later, after beating him to a bloody pulp, I looked up and saw a horrified woman standing right there. She had begun calling someone, and any fool could guess that it was probably 911 and so I fled the scene, stealing a person's car in the process. As it started up, I could begin to hear police sirens in the background.\n \nI was sprinting across Chicago in this little Golf of mine, chugging away with its engine which was nowhere near as powerful as those of the cops' cars. I needed to think fast and find a Plan B. Quickly. Knowing I could not outrun these cops, I saw my opportunity. I pulled into a Forever 21, right on the riverside, like literally on top of the river, with one clear goal in mind: I would escape in plain sight. I found myself a pair of tight jeans, a t-shirt, and a few accessories to truly sell the tomboy look. I sadly had to leave my trench coat behind, but my life was more important than anything else. Even my ancient trench coat which had been handed down through the family. A few bracelets, a bright pink shirt, and a necklace later, I looked a bit like a girl, but needed something to totally sell the look. I realized what the issue was: I needed some makeup. But what could I use for makeup? Maybe some eyeliner, some blush, but my lips were too pale. And there it was, I saw it from the corner of my eyes: lip gloss. I snatched it up and ran to the register with it. I had planned all my clothes out very carefully, to ensure that they did not fully deplete my bank account. Even then, I only had a very specific amount of money left. Slightly panting, I asked the clerk as to how much the lip gloss would cost. And the clerk replied, \"Tree fiddy.\" \n \nMy name is Aiden Pearce, and that was my story.\n \nUPlay: ultragroudon  \n[Steam Profile](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075703486/)\n \nOh, and I nearly forgot, Thanks for the giveaway OP!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401506429", "subreddit": "GiftofGames", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, I've told this story before, but here it goes.  So back when I was still in college, university for all you Non-Americans, I was very introverted except for a very exclusive group of friends that I would hang out with. We all tended to be shy and introverted, except for one of my friends who was slightly more outgoing, and tended to get the group to do more social and adventurous things; lets call him tom.  Well one night tom informs the group that his cousin will be performing as a DJ for a local club in town and convinced us to join him. Now this wasn't some huge rave club, or some strange kinky place, just a fairly normal place with a bar and a dance floor.  Being in a frivolous mood, my friend decided to order a bottle of champagne.  Having just recently turned 21, it was my first time ever drinking champagne, and oddly enough it kind of tasted like cherry cola, so I then proceeded to binge drink the rest of the bottle.  The rest of the night was then coated in a thick glean of drunkenness, but I was sober enough to remember what happened.  I remember sitting at the table watching some of my other drunk friends dancing, and thinking how lucky they were, but then a beautiful girl walked over to me.  Lets just call her Lola.  Now she was no mere girl, no, she was a woman.  This was the first time any girl had actually taken the initiative to actually come and hit on me, so when she asked to dance, of course I said yes.  After a night of dancing and drinking champagne, she eventually asked me if I wanted to go home with her, and being a college-aged virgin male, of course I said yes.  Once at her apartment she laid me on the bed and started undressing, looking back with that sexy fire in her eyes that just seemed to penetrate deep into my genitals. With her shirt off, and bra loosely hanging on she crawled over to the bed on all fours and came up next to my head.  She leaned over and whispered, \"Can I have about tree fiddy?\"  I got up from the bed and looked her in the eyes and said, \"Well I'm not the world's most masculine man, but I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man,\" but so was Lola. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401509806", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Events like toilets flushing, things you put down being moved somewhere else, voices, footsteps, doors opening and closing etc. when no one else was in the building. No one ever saw ghostly apparitions or witnessed things move, but things moved. \n\nThe Pastor of the church decided to perform an exorcism to rid the building of whatever spirits. A number of the parishioners met one night and we basically roamed the place quoting scriptures (couldn't tell you what) and sprinkling holy water.

You get some pretty crazy stories.\n\nOne of the people i picked up was this African guy, with a nice tuxedo, who was getting a ride to an event that was happening in the park. I picked him up on Fifth Ave. (really nice part of Manhattan, for all you non New Yorkers) and we drove down. Traffic was pretty bad that day, so we started chatting.\n\nHe was an executive for a really nice law firm. I don't remember what it was called, all i remember is that he was really well off. He was meeting for a celebration for some milestone that the company had achieved. All the executives were there. This is where it gets interesting.\n\nThe guy starts talking about how the firm has been around for a very long time, and was co-ordinating with certain \"groups\". I pestered him a bit about it, and finally he said the firm had been assisting the **Al-Qaeda** with financial gains. I couldn't believe it. From there he started talking how the firm may have helped fund the Al-Qaeda in the 9-11 attack.\n\nSo, he finally stopped talking about all the terrorist activity that the firm was supposedly into. I drove around, mostly in silence, as i was so shocked. I wanted to not believe what he said, but it just seemed so real. So finally, I asked if he could tell me or say anything else. He asked if he could ask me a question. I said yes, but right then i realized that he was a fifty foot tall, grey leviathan from the paleolithic era. He said \"Well, could I have about tree fiddy?\" I responded, 'I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy, Loch Ness Monstah!

{"body": "First of all, Bucka Bucka and hello, something stupid like that.  But back to the issue at hand; ok, it's pretty well-known that ten years ago, the Blackhawks had no fans left, none, after Dollar Bill managed to kill the fanbase, after gutting the early 90s Cup finals team and leaving the franchise to bleed out on the ice for fifteen years.  No home games on tv until 2007.  Shit, I had to listen to the 91 Cup finals on the radio, because Dollar Bill made the games closed-circuit television-only, to squeeze every last cent out of his fans, and I wasn't old enough to get into bars then.  He actively hated his fans, true evil sports owner personified.  The Chicago Wolves led the AHL in attendance for a lot of those dark years, so there were still hockey fans in Chicago, but they couldn't give Hawks tickets away.  So, though the team was founded in 1926, as of 2006, they might as well have been an expansion team, because from 94-ish to 06, Chicago didn't have an NHL hockey team.\n\nThat's the setup.  Then, in 2006, the Hawks signed Marty Havlat.  It might not seem like that big of a deal from today, but in 06, that was the first sign of life from the franchise in over ten years.  People's ears pricked up, mine did at least.  Then of course, drafting Toews and Kane in back to back drafts, success, continued success, a couple of Cup wins, to the present day.\n\nSo, yeah, Chicago had hockey fans, sorta lying dormant, and when the Hawks showed life again after death, the fans came back in droves.  But we lost an entire generation of fans.  Guys who were teenagers during the late 90s-early aughts, the prime sports-watching and following demographic, didn't watch or follow the Hawks, because there was nothing to watch or follow, and shit, half their games weren't even on tv, even if you did want to see terrible hockey.  But, why would you waste your time anyway?  And no one did.\n\nSo, yeah, there was Bobby Hull, and Stashu Mikita, and Pierre Pilote, but those were ghosts, urban legends, fading into the memories of guys getting up into their 50s and 60s.  It might as well have been the Yeti, the Loch Ness Monster, and Bigfoot.\n\nAll of which is a long way of saying, yeah, that stuff that GaryARefuge was saying, it can happen.  It happened with the might-as-well-be-an-expansion-team Blackhawks of 06 to today.\n\nBut yeah, I made a couple jokes, easy jokes, which really were in response to the every excuse in the book (We were stuck in traffic!  an old friend came in from out of town!  My Kings sweater didn't come back from the cleaners!) made by LA fans in this thread, as to why the rate of hockey-watchin' in Chicago was five times that of LA in a potentially Cup finals-appearance-clenching game this past Wednesday.  I couldn't resist.  Maybe I should have.  Because really, I see what you're saying.

Besides the physical therapy after the incident I would say the worst thing was the medical bills. Now these were the days before universal healthcare and being so young I didn't think it necessary. After a long back and forth with the hospital and the makes of red line (sued, settled out of court for $60,000) I was able to only pay a little out of pocket. I remember being so relieved when the representative at the hospital handed me my final bill. I asked the representative about how much damage I was looking at and she said, \"About tree-fiddy.\" It was at this time that I noticed the hospital representative was none other than the 6 story tall monster from the Paleozoic era. \"Damn it Loch Ness monster I ain't givin you no tree-fiddy!\" I screamed and the monster swam away once more. \n\nTL;DR Stay away from energy drinks", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401569233", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -6, "controversiality": 1}
{"body": "By analogy, empathy has been programmed into our genes as well, but psychopaths exist. Seeing that empathy is a default trait of humans, does that imply that psychopaths must explain their own existence? It seems like the wrong question. Similarly, to suggest that atheists must explain their departure from standard mysticism is also the wrong question. Whether you are a mystic or a skeptic, you must only defend the position you hold. Skeptics bear a burden to show that their skepticism in the God question is valid; we typically do this by pointing to [the God question not being particularly special](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading), and the wide variety of *more reasonable* claims that we are *also* skeptical of, like Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and Elvis' faked death.\n\nAlso please note that not all **atheists** are skeptics, nor are **explicit atheists** atheists for reasons related to skepticism; some are **ignostics** and think that even the word \"God\" is laden with so many connotations that it makes clear discussion impossible.

{"body": "Oh, I remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nNow, I'll begin my story by admitting that I never was the greatest driver. I had never run a red light or anything, but I had slipped up slightly in various instances. I never thought that I would do something as serious as what happened on one fateful day.\n\nOn this certain day, about 6 years ago, I was cruising down a local highway like I would on any normal day. After about 15 minutes of monotonous highway driving, I headed toward my usual exit near my home. However, as I drove up the ramp, I felt suddenly lightheaded, and my vision became fussy around the edges. (I later found out that I was dehydrated, although I couldn't tell at the time.) My disorientation caused me to hit the back of a stopped vehicle at about 65 mph, and as I flew out of the front of my windshield I faded into unconsciousness.\n\nI opened my eyes seconds later to find myself in a large white room. It appeared to be some sort of Greek temple, or at least what I imagined one would look like. I was at the far end of it, and it seemed to reach about half a football field in length.\n\nAt the opposite end of the room sat a woman on a throne. However, I could tell this was no ordinary woman. She had long, sleek blonde hair, and her skin shined with an inhuman glow. It was clear she was something special.\n\nI walked over to her and asked, \"Where am I?\"\n\nShe replied, \"These are the gates of heaven. Your time has come to see if you can enter the kingdom.\"\n\nI thought I had lived a pretty good life. I had lots of friends, was kind to my family, never intentionally hurt anybody. I had even gone to church and one my dues, so if that's what it took, I had done that too. Granted, I had died a little early, but at least I figured I was set, and I would be able to spend eternity in this beautiful place.\n\n\"You are correct, my son, you have spread kindness and cheer throughout your life. However, there is one more thing that I need from you to let you through the gates.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" I pleaded. \"I'll give you anything. Anything. Just name it, and it's done.\"\n\nShe smirked and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAfter she said this, I realized that she was 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamn loch ness monster had tricked me again!\n\nShe swam away into the distance, and was never seen again.\n\nTL;DR: My heavenly experience was ruined by Nessie.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401570180", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 60, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Monsters are real. Rhino, Giant Squid, Gorrila, Blue Whale. All giant beasties that we can be in awe of if we ever see one up close. \nI think the last of the undiscovered monsters are likely deep in the ocean. \nThings like the Loch Ness Monster are restricted to a smaller area, we have the tech to scan everything there and turn up with nothing. It was likely a giant eel that wanders in every few years. \nBigfoot might be some large bear with a minor mutation that effects breathing or it's face. For as large as the area is, people have been searching for so long that if there ever was anything primate like there, it may have died out by now. \n\nThe world is getting smaller. I would love to hear about them being discovered and studied. It would be amazing. I would really love them to be real.
