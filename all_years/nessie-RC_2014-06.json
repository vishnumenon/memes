It so happened mine weren't, and I had a relatively large house. So I told him if he set everything up, I would let him throw it at my house.\n\nHe gathers up a bunch of his friends who get the booze and whatnot, someone sets up their beast of a sound system, and everything seems to be going smoothly.\n\nCome Ten, there's at least fifty people here; some in the house, some in the backyard. This is in the country, having a 50 acre lot, so plenty of room for people, and no one is disturbed. We're all having a good time, getting drunk and whatnot. Then *she* shows up.\n\nMy crush since the sixth grade, let's call her Amber, cause she was a ginger, absolutely stunning. She knew of me, smiled at times, but I hadn't thought she was interested until she came up to me. \"Cool party.\"\n\n\"Uh, thanks, but it's really Hank's.\"\n\n\"Well this isn't Hank's house, is it?\"\n\n\"Nah, but these are Hank's friends and stuff.\"\n\n\"Not your friends?\" I shook my head. \"Well am I your friend?\"\n\nShe gave me a cute smile, and I just melted. But being tipsy, I didn't really think when I said \"I guess, but I'd like to be better than friends.\"\n\nShe blushed, and took my hand. We went inside to my bedroom, and started making out. Another couple (I guess you could call us one now) barged in, but quickly left as they saw what we were doing. She got up and locked the door, and before making her was back to me, started to strip. I almost dies then and there, but her words brought me back.\n\n\"Do you want me?\" She beckoned.\n\n\"Yes. God yes. Do you...want me?\" I asked.\n\n\"You know what I want.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said, feeling dizzy, \"but could you clarify for me?\"\n\n\"Well...about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAt this point I noticed my crush was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic Era. Her head went in and out of my ceiling, while her long red hair crushed across my face.\n\nShe saw my confusion, and quickly jumped and ran across our pasture, crushing about ten people outside.\n\nI never heard from her again.\n\nTl;dr: don't make out drunkenly with your crush.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401580957", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Tim then sat next to his friend Tyrone*.\n\n**Tyrone**: Dude, what happened in there?\n\n**Tim:** Mrs. Brown told me she was a man.\n\n**Tyrone**: What?  This is insane! How did you know?\n\n**Tim**: Well at first she just flat out told me and said that I already knew.  Then she went on about how nobody would accept her when she was a man.  Then she mumbled something that I could hardly hear.\n\n**Tyrone:** What was it man?\n\n**Tim:** Mrs. Brown said \"I'll need about tree-fiddy\".  I should have known then that this was not Mrs. Brown and actually a five hundred foot tall monster from the Paleolithic Era.\"\n\n**Tyrone:** Well, what happened next?\n\n**Tim:** Then I told the Monster from lake lochness, \"Hey, I'm not giving you no money!\"  Then I stormed off to the door, slipped on some dino fluid and hit my hip on the table.  That's why I was waddling to my desk just a few seconds ago.\n\n...\n\nIn all seriousness though, I really do use this strategy to get out of answering questions in class.

{"body": "Okay so this is when I had just gotten outta college. My degree hadn't gotten me anywhere so far so I was still working some minimum wage job at the local fast food joint living paycheck to paycheck in my shitty little one room apartment. I finished my shift one day and my friend called me up and said he found a dealer that sold weed for dirt fucking cheap. He told me the locations the dude sold at but that he didn't have a phone because he didn't like being badgered with calls from potential customers. He hung up and I started daydreaming about the weed until I had the realization I was completely fucking broke. Then as I'm driving home I see a penny fallen between the crack of my seat and the door and it hits me, I can fucking pay the entire thing off in loose change I find. So I get home and trash my apartment trying to find some change, like flipping my couch over and taking the cushions off, moving my refrigerator off of the wall, tipping over and moving everything in sight for some spare change for some weed. I found about 4.30 in total (Including the 3 dollars I had left in my pocket that I had forgotten about in my excitement. So I got a bar where this guy supposedly sells not really knowing what he looks like. I go into the bar and I instantly know who the dealer is. This dude in the back with like 5 people crowded around him giving him money and walking away with little baggies. So I walk over and ask how much the weed is and he says to me \"Tree fiddy\". It was about this time that I realized the dealer was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. \"Damn monstah I ain't giving you no tree fiddy\" I screamed as I left the bar.\n\nTL;DR: fuck you that took forever to type", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401638856", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, not many people seem to be taking this seriously. Ah, what the heck, I’ll give it a shot. Got too much time to procrastinate with, anyway. I'd love to try the game because I went through hell trying to get the sequel.\n\nWhen I was 17, I was visiting family in New York. I had decided to get some fresh air and take a walk with my beagle, who had whined and bayed ever since arriving in the metropolis. Before we’d gone on the trip, a friend of mine recommended buying the newest videogame by some guy named Sid: “Civilization IV”. Videogames weren’t really my thing at the time. However, I’d been a history jock since I came out of the womb, so I decided to try it out. I left the apartment, heading for a small game store I had seen several blocks away the day before. Pretty sure it was EB Games. \n\nHaving never been to New York before, I was not aware that the city is…*different* during the night. Naturally, I lost my way within the first 10 minutes. In retrospect, I’m pretty sure that I actually past the store *on my side*; I pretty tired and dazed that night. Once it became obvious I was lost, I figured the best course of action was to follow my footsteps and just head back to the apartment. As night began to close in, the little country boy I was had started to get the creeps from the big-city aura. Unfortunately, Jerry the beagle had other…urgent ideas. Of course, just letting a dog do its business in the middle of a major sidewalk isn’t the best way to keep a low profile, so I tried the next best thing. I had never seen Central Park before. However, I remembered my grandfather saying it lied about a mile west from the apartment. “Aw, what the heck, another hour won’t hurt”. I had embarked past the point of no return. At that time, I had spent an hour on the streets when I had told my father that I’d only be out for 30 minutes max. My slightly paranoid (albeit soon to be justified) parents phone up the police at about an hour and thirty, just as I arrive at the park. The NYPD surely had bigger fish to fry, but I’ve been told they still had an officer looking for me the entire duration of the night. \n\n\nAs you probably guessed, I got completely and utterly lost in that monster of a park. I’ve never been good with direction, and I’m even more of a klutz when there aren’t any structures to use as landmarks. By midnight, I’d given up finding the store (or a way out), and Jerry is whimpering non-stop. The Boy Scout in me decided to stop panicking and find shelter for what was left of the night. I settled down on a secluded bench near a little creek and tied Jerry’s leash to the leg of it. Though the “bed” I made was full  of damp leaves, the isolation probably kept me safe from any shady character roaming the park at that hour. That dog slept better than me that night: I was a complete basket-case. \n\nAround 4:00 am, I groggily woke up and grabbed Jerry's leash to continue on my trek. I found a payphone about fifteen minutes later, only a few hundred yards away from where I’d slept. I rang up 911 immediately, as I didn’t know the number to call the apartment. They sent an officer in, and I met them on the corner of 97th and 5th. The cop pulled up, clearly not happy about having to put up with these shenanigans. “Are you GreenEggs?” I told him I was, pretty overjoyed that I’d been found. I showed him my license, and I told him my story. The officer seemed a bit surprised that I survived the night, but he held his stone-cold composure pretty well. The conversation puttered out pretty quick-like. Even Jerry was shivering like a white boy at a disco. I pulled at the door handle, but the car was locked. “Umm…sir? Do you think my dog and I could-“ He held up a hand, looked me in the eye and said “Yeah, course. But I do need you to do something for me.” Now this thoroughly confused me: I just wanted out of that god forsaken forest. “What do you need, officer?” He stared at me expectantly and replied “I need about tree fiddy.” Now it was around this time that I realized this officer was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again! \n\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\n\n**TL:DR**-Got lost in an unfamiliar city looking to buy the newest Civ installment and was saved by an unexpected hero.

In my head, I was kinda jealous after seeing the pic of Vanessa who was seemingly bangin' as far as I could tell. After running some cons by him, he said it was fool proof so long as I would never tell his parents about it, or else they would most likely disown him (they spoiled him, but they would never allow such a thing, especially his dad). \n\nOn gameday, the twat makes me go with him, saying he was nervous that it might be a scam. We take the bus to an apartment building 20min. away from me and Lauch's neighborhood. He tells me to wait in the lobby till, in his own words, \"the deed is done\" (what a twat, I know). Now the only reason I come along is because Lauch, being the spoiled rich kid he is, promised to pay me for my troubles, and I being the greedy best friend, accepted. Anyways, Lauch takes the elevator while I wish him good luck, contemplating if I should save up for what Lauch was about to do. \n\nAround 10 minutes later, I hear loud steps from the fire escape which was across from the couch I was sitting in the lobby. I looked up for a second, then continued to fantasize over the sexy celebrity bikini bodies in the tabloid I was reading. Seconds later, Lauch comes bursting through the door, frantically repeating the phrase, \"No one can know about this, don't look back!\". Pretty baffled at the situation, I ask him what the fuck happened...he wouldn't answer as we book it up the road into the nearest McDonalds to recoup. As we grab a table, I ask continue to ask him what happened...he continued to ignore me, staring at the table with a frightened look on his face. Pissed off, I begin to berate him, calling him an idiot and assuming that he put my life in danger, all because he was desperate to lose his virginity. Then I remember that he promised me a lump sum of money for the trouble of coming with him. \n\n\"You better pay me for this stressful shit that I just had to go through\", I say. \n\n\"Yea, yea...no worries\", he mumbles. \n\n\"What the fuck does that mean. Well, how much do I get? It better be worth it, or else everyones gonna know about this! How much! (I know, sounds pretty greedy)\"\n\nAnd that's when he finally lifted his head and said, \n\n\"Tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401665646", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Is there seriously nobody else here who has seen it?  I have!\n\nNo shit... No tree fiddy or any other dumb bait and switch story here... When I was in about 6th grade (1988) my parents hired a babysitter to come to our house every day during the summer to watch my sisters.  When she would take them to the pool or to the park, I usually stayed home alone or with a friend of mine that was usually hanging around the house.  We were always digging around trying to find something interesting.  We had already discovered my dad's meager hustler mag stash and memorized them.  \n\nI found a VHS tape in my dad's top dresser drawer.  he kept all sorts of things in that drawer besides socks and undies, so it wasn't really out of place.  I popped it in one day when I was home alone to see what was on it and it was just an episode of Saturday Night Live so I put it back.  I was telling my buddy about it and he had the brilliant idea that it was only placed there to keep us from figuring out what it really was.  So we looked and sure enough, the tape was at the end, so we hit rewind.  It was an exciting few minutes waiting for it to rewind all the way back to the beginning.  When we hit play, we knew almost immediately that we'd hit paydirt.  \n\nWe only watched it through one time, and we had to be careful because we always had to make sure we knew we were clear of anyone coming home and catching us.  We lived in a small town and my parents would often come home through out the day for various reasons, so we never dared to watch it all in one go.  We'd watch it, for a little bit, then put it back to be safe. There were a few close calls, but we never got caught. After we'd seen it all, we sorta forgot about it.  I went to look for it one day a while later and it was no longer in the drawer.  \n\nI don't think my parents ever knew I watched it because when we'd put it back, we always left it in the same spot in the video.  We didn't bother to wind and rewind it every time.  We just didn't have the time for that! But when we were done, we left it stuck somewhere in the middle of the SNL episode.  In all honestly, I don't think it ever actually belonged to my parents.  I think was a \"loaner\" and just eventually was given back.  \n\nAnyway, what I do remember of it was that there were three distinct \"parts\" of it.  The first part I remember the least of... I think they were in a living room and it wasn't really all that exciting.  But when they took it to the bedroom, then it got heated up pretty quickly.  It was obviously not an edited piece of work.  They bang for a bit, then he'd stop, go move the camera to a different angle or what not and then go back to her.  I remember there was an angle where you could see them both in front of the camera and one where you could see them and the camera in the mirror closet door.  And then in part three, she went out to the garage and did some weight lifting in various stages of undress.  \n\nAs exciting as it may not sound now, it was pretty god damn cool back then!

{"body": "Oh wow, this reminds me of back when I was in college.\n\nI was a freshman, and I was just settling in with my new roommate, let's call her Kylie because that was her name. She seemed like a nice person, but obviously I didn't know her all too well. We ended up getting closer later on, but I digress.\n\nAnyway, Kylie's older sister was a senior at the school and was going to a frat party and asked if Kylie wanted to attend. Naturally, she planned on going because she wanted to expand her circle of friends as rapidly as she could. I was taken a little off guard when Kylie asked if I wanted to go with her, but I recovered and accepted.\n\nSo we get to the party, and it is out of control. People were *everywhere*. It was packed, like you had to push people out of the way to get to the other side of the house. It was really loud, too. So, Kylie and I go to look for her sister and we end up getting separated. I don't know anyone here, and I was just looking for my friend. The partygoers started getting even more rowdy and I ended up getting knocked down. I was really scared, I thought I was gonna get trampled.\n\nBefore anything bad could happen, this hand grabs my arm and pulls me to my feet. I thought it was Kylie, but it was a guy that I didn't recognize. He was really tall, but very cute. He seemed older than me, but I was just happy that I didn't get hurt. I thanked him and we got to talking.\n\nSkip ahead a little bit, and we are outside the frat house talking. He was pretty sweet. I was leaning against a wall and he pulls out a pack of smokes. He opens it, and it's empty. He was kinda disappointed, and I wanted to impress him, so I offered him a little cash to buy a new pack from a gas station or something. He tried to be modest and refuse, but I insisted and he finally relented. We drive to the nearest drug store and I ask him how much he needed. He turns to me, looks right into my eyes. It was really romantic.

{"body": "I was an introvert mostly throughout High School. I didn't go to many parties, nor did I have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked.\nUnfortunately, I had 0 skills on picking up girls even though I was trying really hard to get a girl.\nIn 11th grade there was a party around my school's christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it. I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where. I still remembered her name though, Vanessa. She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me. I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible. She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back. I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of. Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\"\nI started saying more things.\nShe laughed even more.\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl. But then it dawned on me. I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where. A strip club. Vanessa was a stripper. Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously. My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once. I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house. This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue. I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself.\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone. A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms. I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside.\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off Vanessa's clothes. Finally, she was fully naked, as was I. She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\". Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\" I couldn't believe it. This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin. I still can't believe it. I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock. She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to. I told her I was a virgin too and she said good. As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\" \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life.

{"body": "In another comment in this post, you stated emphatically that monsters aren't real.  Where did you get the evidence/experience that disproves the existence of monsters?\n\nYou don't have any of course, becasue the *default* state of any claim is non-belief.  It's called the null hypothesis.  If someone makes a positive claim ('X is true' or 'Y is a thing/phenomena that exists'), the *default* belief by everyone is to disbelieve.  There are two things that can change that default from disbelief to belief:\n\n1) Prior Probability.  If your neighbor knocks on your door and explains that his dog ran away, you might immediately jump past the null hypothesis and believe him.  This is because there is a high prior probability of this claim being true.  This is based on 1) You have personally seen your neighbor walking his dog many times, so you know that he has one.  2) He has been trustworthy for as long as you have known him, and you can't come up with a reason why he would be lying to you.  If it was, instead, a neighbor who was a pathological lair, who you knew for a fact didn't have a dog yesterday, you wouldn't change over from the default, skeptical position without asking for more evidence.\n\n2)  New Evidence.  After examining the prior probability of something (how likely is it to be true based on all my old knowledge?), gathering new evidence that contradicts or explains your current knowledge can also change your belief.\n\n\nNow: Back to the soul.  The prior probability of a completely unknown entity is extremely low.  The prior probability of a completely unknown and completely untestable concept is infinitely low.  If you accept *any* level of prior probability on the soul, you are essentially allowing any made up, untestable entity the same prior probability.  By saying \"the soul could be real\" you are also making the argument for unicorns, bigfoot, the loch ness monster, little green men from mars, flying spagettii monsters, etc.  I could literally make up anything I wanted, including a purple floating dragon that can't be seen or touched or measured in any way.  If that untestable dragon is to be given any prior probability, than any other made up entity will get the same amount.\n\nIt's the same with the soul.  You, yourself described it as completely unkonwn and unknowable (we can't know what happens after we die).  If it's unknown, then it has no prior probability.  And if it's untestable, then you cannot gather any evidence.  Thus, the only logical, rational position after careful examination, is to remain with the null hypothesis.  That the claim is to be considered untrue until evidence can be presented.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401747398", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "...Crustacean? I'm pretty sure Nessie's a reptile. Plesiosaur, judging by the most common depictions. That's not even the right phylum, is it? Crustacea is a subphylum of Arthropoda, whereas Chordata is its own phylum.\n\nAlso, 8 stories is implausible-sounding. The Monster of Aramberri was about 15 m in length total, noticeably smaller than the 8-story colossus cited above, and it was, as the name implies, a particularly large specimen.\n\nAlso, Plesiosaurs date from the late Jurassic to the early Cretaceous, well before the Paleolithic.\n\nTL;DR Nessie is neither 8 stories, crustaceous, nor from the Paleolithic. She does, however, still hit people up for tree fiddy.\n\nEDIT: It occurs to me that Nessie may also be a [chasmfiend](http://coppermind.net/wiki/Chasmfiend) if we take the \"eight-story-tall crustacean\" thing at face value, but how the hell she got from Roshar to Earth is beyond me, let alone how she survived Earth's lower-oxygen, higher-gravity environment. All of this is of course ignoring entirely the fact that chasmfiends are completely fictitious.\n\nAn explanation: Chasmfiends are fucking huge and also crustaceans. This is only possible because a) Roshar has somewhat lower gravity and a higher concentration of oxygen than Earth and b) they have spren (essentially manifest ideas, tiny splinters of a shard of the power of Creation itself) bonded to them that allow them to grow to such prodigious sizes.

{"body": "This happened to me a few years ago. I had just moved to a less than desirable neighborhood because rent was cheap and I was poor. It was a one bedroom, one bath with the bedroom right off from the living room. I lived there for about 2 months before I was awoken one night to the sound of my front door's glass pane being smashed. I could hear a hand fiddling with the knob. \n\nIt seemed like an eternity passed by before I heard the handle stop jiggling and turn. I don't know why I couldn't move. I'd grown up in the country and knew how to swing an axe and machete, both of which I had in my bedroom closet. I knew how to shoot and I had a damn 12 gauge in my closet with a half of a box of shells also. I just couldn't bring myself to move; I was terrified.\n\nI heard the robber's feet cross the floor of the living room, especially the creaking floor boards that were about halfway between the front door and my room. I even heard him mutter \"fuck,\" as he paused for a few moments. I finally heard him cross the rest of my living room to my bedroom. It is important to note that I didn't keep anything in the living room because I didn't own a couch or chair yet, so no real reason to put anything there except a few unopened boxes of books. My room was the only place that might have valuables. I still kick myself in the ass because if I had set the television up in the living room with my Xbox, he might not have came to my room.\n\nAs the door knob to my room started to turn, I finally snapped out of my fearful state. I grabbed around for the sharpest thing I could find and came up with a somewhat dull 3\" knife that'd I had used to cut my food from my dinner and leaped from the bed. I reached the door just as it began to open and I tackled the guy. My heart was racing a mile a minute at this point as we sort of wrestled and rumbled on the ground. \n\nI don't know how long we fought. It was just a blur. I know at one point I was on top and I stabbed at the fucker's face, but missed. He didn't though when he stabbed up at me. He caught me in the left side, about a half inch above my kidney. The pain of that stab, the burn and just unpleasant feeling of the knife in my side, and the feel of it being ripped back out still haunt me to this day.\n\nI remember rolling off of him and just clutching my side and screaming in pain. The bastard got up and just sort of stood over me with this smug grin on his face. I don't know why I thought he'd care or help, but in my panicked state, I shouted at him that I needed an ambulance. I'll always remember the look on his face as he knelt down beside me and said, \"Before I do that, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy...\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401788967", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

He caught my eye after I saw him wearing a purple tuxedo (I shit you not) on the way to our high school prom. I strike up conversation with him, and he ends up dumping this girl on the spot just to take me with him to the dance. So we're walking to the dance, and I just turn and look at him. He was so handsome, I couldn't help but stare at his face. \n\nWe've been married for about 22 years now, and we have two kids. Our first child, Carla, is a normal teen girl. But our second child, George... He's something else. He was born a male, but he was born with a surgical defect, and he had to be operated on less than a week after being born. He was a strong baby, albeit without a penis.\n\nFast forward 14 years (2 years ago, he's 12 now) and he's a lazy, stupid motherfucker. He's a slob, lazy, and generally is a bully to the other kids. Well one day, there's a fire across the street, a house of 5 kids and a single mom (no idea how she put up with that). I go and tell my husband, and our family goes outside and calls 911. In the middle of our call, I realize George is fucking missing. I check inside to see if the lazy motherfucker is anywhere in the house, but he's nowhere to be seen.\n\nI run outside to tell Mel (my husband), and I notice George, fucking running into the house.\n\n\"George! Do not go in there!\" I remember yelling after him. But a few moments later, an explosion rings from the house, and George walks out carrying the remaining two kids who hadn't been able to find their mom and make it out!\n\nShedding a tear of joy, I remember saying \"Now I know, some men can really, truly change.\" My perspective on boys had changed.

You can continue to believe the racial differences in IQ scores are genetic. I mean, any idiot is free to believe any idiot thing they want I suppose. But don't try to give this irrational nonsense the pretense of being supported by science, because it ain't.\n\n&gt;The conclusion reached on page 17 is contrary to the scientific consensus. \n\nBy \"scientific consensus,\" I assume you mean that wikipedia link you farted out there at the end of your post.

If you quoted the article honestly, you would have also quoted the fact that fully 79 of the 131 scientists invited to sign the statement did not, and those who did sign were not given the opportunity to revise the statement. This means that a) we have good reason to doubt if the claims made in that statement generally really do represent mainstream science on the issue, and b) we have even more reason to doubt that your particular claim, that genetics explains racial differences in IQ scores, is mainstream science.

Campbell, a former president of the American Psychological Association, included his own analysis of the Wall Street Journal statement, previously drafted as a letter to that newspaper.[7][8] Campbell first remarked that:\n&gt;\n&gt;    \"Of the 52 signatories, there were 10 whom I would regard as measurement experts. I do not have a list of those who were asked to sign and refused, but I know they included Lee Cronbach, Robert Sternberg, and myself.\"\n\nSo not only do we have no idea if the claims made in that statement really do represent mainstream science because more than half of those invited didn't sign the statement, but we also have good reason to doubt whether those who did sign have the necessary expertise to represent science on this matter. There's much, much more in the Criticism section of the article, but I think these points are enough to say that your evidence doesn't support your claim.\n\nThird, this is merely a list of opinions. I don't give a shit if a scientist says a thing. I give a shit if a scientist says a thing *and can back it up with evidence.* As it turns out, in 1997, and again in 2012, when Nessier et. al. went looking for the evidence to substantiate the opinion that genetics explains racial differences in IQ scores, they didn't find any. Remember that thing I said about any idiot can believe any idiot thing they want? Yeah, that goes for scientists too.\n\nMoving on...\n\n&gt;You are also stating racists are less intelligent\n\nWhat?

IE- in Iran several decades ago, women did not cover their heads, now they are arrested if they don't.  There was a report last ramadan of a woman who was arrested for selling food during the time of fasting.  There is a lot of unrest in many countries.  Of course there is if people are controlled like this. And the Quran clearly states that Islam is meant to be a religion of ease!  \n\n The Prophet (peace be upon him) says: “This religion is easy.”\n'Do those deeds which you can do easily, as Allah will not get tired [of giving rewards] till you get bored and tired [of performing good deeds! ... and the most beloved deed to Allah is the one which is done regularly even if it is little' (Bukhari).\n\nExtremists are also either doing things as terrorists or they are even beginning to control the governments.

Islam is the religion of the Bismillah...God's Love and Mercy...and God's directions to us to be a loving and merciful people.\n\nIf you watch what North Korean children are taught about us in America, its no wonder they hate the USA.

But Muslims who have been taught that apostates are the worst sinners because they have \"turned against God\" will have very little sympathy for them.  Just like we had to educate people that you can't get AIDS from casual contact with people with AIDS, we have to teach people the difference between apostates who committed  treason and apostates who used free will (or according to the Quran who were led by God) to turn away from Islam because there is no compulsion in religion.

There's much, much more in the Criticism section of the article, but I think these points are enough to say that your evidence doesn't support your claim.\n\nAll the signers of the statement are top professors at top universities who all are famous enough to have their own Wikipedia article, as noted here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_Science_on_Intelligence#Signatories\n\n&gt;In a posthumous article in 1996, Donald T. Campbell, a former president of the American Psychological Association, included his own analysis of the Wall Street Journal statement, previously drafted as a letter to that newspaper.[7][8] Campbell first remarked that:\n\"Of the 52 signatories, there were 10 whom I would regard as measurement experts. I do not have a list of those who were asked to sign and refused, but I know they included Lee Cronbach, Robert Sternberg, and myself.\"\n\nYou do understand that this remark isn't a criticism itself but is a precursor to his actual criticism right? His criticism being:\n\n&gt;He remarked that the rhetorical organization of points in the statement, inadvertently or deliberately, seemed to him to build up to the conclusion that the black-white racial gap had a genetic cause. He pointed out that already at point 5, no provision had been allowed for differences in educational opportunity. Later on in point 14, he judged that the statements on heritability had been made without mentioning that it was based on twin studies, where environmental opportunities had been excluded as possible factors. In point 23, he pointed out that it was not possible to compare children of black and white parents that were \"equally\" educated, because in these circumstances the opportunities in the quality of education, both before and at college, would differ. On point 25, Campbell remarked that Jensen had himself published policy recommendations concerning rote learning.[8][9]\n\nThose criticisms are very minor and don't disagree with the main points in the statement...considering it's from the APA president it can be viewed as giving support to the statement as the main point remains.\n\n&gt;There's much, much more in the Criticism section of the article, but I think these points are enough to say that your evidence doesn't support your claim.\n\nThe first criticism is the lack of defining what intelligence is, which is besides the point as (which the statement which was signed also states) is that whatever is measured correlates strongly with educational achievement, performance on scholastic, military and job related tests, and a wealth of other indicators such as lower crime rate, lower divorce rate, lower welfare dependency rate etc etc. It's a very important measure of intelligence and what is measured strongly correlates to higher intelligence.\n\nThe second paper linked is by Schlinger which just notes:\n\n&gt;Schlinger claims that, \"With a few exceptions, the list of cosigners reads like a Who's Who of those theorists (e.g., Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr., John B. Carroll, Raymond B. Cattell, Hans Eysenck, Linda S. Gottfredson, Seymour W. Itzkoff, Arthur R. Jensen, Robert Plomin, J. Philippe Rushton and Vincent Sarich) who have continued Spearman's tradition of factor analyzing intelligence test scores to generate a theory of general intelligence — g — and some of whom (e.g., Thomas J. Bouchard, Robert Plomin) believe that behavior genetic research supports the conclusion that g is highly heritable, and others of whom (e.g., Arthur Jensen, J. Philippe Rushton, Seymour Itzkoff) have written highly emotionally charged articles arguing that the research supports the conclusion that group differences on intelligence tests reflect genetic differences.\"\n\nAnd isn't actual criticism.\n\nArmour-Thomas (2003) states the tests are biased which has been shown to be a possibility but doesn't show up in the real world, especially with East-Asians scoring higher on the tests. Culture 'free' tests are also in widespread use, these tests like the Raven Progressive Matrices are diagram puzzles which have to be solved.\n\nHarrington (1997) shows some minor issues a geneticist has with the statement. Nothing major.\n\nAlderfer (2003) criticizes the effects of publishing the statement and The Bell Curve on race relations in the US, nothing else.\n\n&gt;So not only do we have no idea if the claims made in that statement really do represent mainstream science because more than half of those invited didn't sign the statement\n\nThe invitation to sign was sent to 131 researchers, of whom 100 responded by the deadline. The signature form asked whether the respondent would sign the statement, and if not, why. 52 respondents agreed to sign, while 48 did not. 38 supplied an explanation for their refusal, **with 11 explicitly disagreeing that it represented the mainstream (or at least disagreeing with some of the claims in it)**, another 11 saying they did not know whether it did, and the rest citing various other reasons, including the fear of jeopardizing their position or project.[3]\n\n&gt;As it turns out, in 1997, and again in 2012, when Nessier et. al. went looking for the evidence to substantiate the opinion that genetics explains racial differences in IQ scores, they didn't find any. \n\nI assume you mean 1996 instead of 1997? The 1996 paper states that the IQ score co-relationship for MZ twins is 0.68-.78 while for unrelated adopted siblings it's essentially zero. The 1996 paper's section of race difference in IQ scores is extremely apologetic and intellectually dishonest by e.g. implying American Indians have lower performance on verbal sections of the IQ score as a result of ear infections (!). The paper **states that IQ scores is a good predictor of educational performance for US blacks and that the tests aren't culturally biased against US blacks in light of this information**. It is also stated that socio-economic factors explain little of the variance in white-black IQ score.\n\nIn 1996 the conclusion that there are no large genetic differences in intelligence among races are two studies, one which was able to find genetic differences based on blood group type testing of blacks and another study from Germany with mixed race children with an American black servicemen father **after** WW2 when a lot of Germans were still poor and German teens grew up poor. Those are just two studies while Jensen and Rushton cite about 100 in their paper on race differences in the last 30 years of intelligence testing. The overwhelming amount of studies show a genetic racial component, even ones which didn't study twins or adoption. For example educational and IQ performance are correlated for blacks where the children of extremely rich black parents score lower or at the same level of extreme poor white children:\n\n[Racial SAT score gap between races: a black pupil whose family makes $200,000+ a year scores at the same level of a white child whose family makes $20,000 a year](http://isteve.blogspot.nl/2014/03/2008-sat-scores-by-race-by-income.html)\n\n[Relationship of race &amp; socioeconomic status to undergraduate GPA &amp; LSAT score] (http://i.imgur.com/bUzN9vV.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n[30 Years of Research on Race Differences In Cognitive Ability by Rushton and Jensen, affirming amongst other things the huge IQ gap between blacks and whites and how IQ is correlated with scholastic and real life (socio-economic) performance [PDF, 50 pages]](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf)\n\nHere's the 1996 paper I'm reading: http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/research/correlation/intelligence.pdf\n\nPost continues below...hitting the max post character limit..\n\n**It's very intellectually dishonest to state that the Mainstream Science on Intelligence statement doesn't represent the mainstream science on intelligence, as it does just that and no inherent faults have been found.** Nessier et al (2012) quotes the 0.4-0.8 herability estimation from the statement in addition to citing the research from signers of the state considerably, e.g. Lynn, Jensen and Rushton.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401817507", "subreddit": "GreatApes", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

My friends and I thought it would be a fun way to end our day, and it was going to a good cause, so we went for it, not really expecting much.\n\nFast forward to the Friday afternoon of they performance, we got there around the time it started, looking forward to seeing which classmates this hypnotist would get to do some silly things, hoping someone would blurt out something secret, you know the usually high school mindset. My friend, lets call him Chip, Chip had told us that he was far to intelligent to get hypnotized, and he was going to prove that this guy was a fake. We laughed it off, you know the usual \"Sure Chip whatever you say man\" and didn't think much of it.\n\nThe performance is beginning, and the hypnotist says to the audience that he needs some volunteers. At this moment Chip says, \"Alright guys here is where I prove my point.\" He raises his hand and sure enough is picked to go up and get hypnotized. By this time all of us are sitting on pins and needles, waiting to see if our friend is capable of being hypnotized. The hypnotist starts his act, of course with the usual \"Listen to the sound of my voice\" mumbo jumbo, and after about 5 min of this slow soft talking, all of the participants are out cold, including Chip. My friends and I are dying of laughter, because he was so sure he wouldn't be able to get hypnotized. We all sit back and watch the show. The hypnotist asks them to do all sorts of things, simple stuff like pretend to eat a banana (which was hilarious being at an all boys school) and then moving to more complex things like pretend to watch the most scary movie in the world, which resulted in most of the participants cowering under the chairs or crying, classic right? The one my friends and I thought was the best was when he asked each participant to act out what he wanted to be when he grew up, and when it was Chip's turn, he started to dance around like a ballerina! We all were dying.\n\nWe could tell the act was coming to a close, the hypnotist got them all back into their seats, and said \"Alright I am going to bring them out of the hypnosis, but before I do, i need one thing from all of you.\" All of us, fully focused on the show dumbly ask \"What?\" He looks at us and says \"About tree fiddy.\" And that's when i realized the hypnotist was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era, the damn loch ness monster had tricked me again! So I said, \"Damn you Monstah, I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!

It was most of the senior class plus a lot of juniors and a bunch of people from a couple other schools. Now, I went to a school in one of those closed off rich neighborhoods, so basically everybody had a ton of extra cash from their parents. Being teenagers with nothing better to do, they all smoked weed pretty much all the time. Everyone at the party ended up completely stoned, in addition to being drunk as hell. At about two in the morning, still three hundred people there, we were all starving and decided to get some food. Since the host - his name was Dave - had jack shit at his house, he ordered a few pizzas. And - get this - motherfucking Dave orders two hundred pizzas. I shit you not, he purchases two hundred large pepperoni pizzas. He had to call a dozen different places because most of them wouldn't deliver more than ten or twenty at once. Over the next hour, we had pizza trucks driving to and from the house constantly. By the end of it, Dave had kept true to his word; we had two hundred pizzas sitting in front of us by three in the morning. Only problem was that most of us soon fell asleep or passed out. Only about thirty of the pizzas were actually eaten, the remaining one hundred seventy just sat on the floor while almost everyone was asleep.\n\nBut not Fred. See, Fred was always that weird motherfucker who always had these crazy ideas and shit like that. Fred stayed up the whole damn night working furiously. The next morning, I woke up to see the product of Fred's work. I can't believe what I'm seeing, and I'm a little hungover too, so I wake up a couple friends to show them. It wasn't just my imagination; they see the same thing too. It's a giant sculpture made out of all the remaining pizzas, all one hundred and seventy or so of them. It was about eight feet tall, looked sort of like a person. It had a head, and tiny arms sticking out - all made out of pepperoni pizza. I hear a muffled voice coming from the sculpture, sounds just like Fred, telling us to come closer. So we take a few steps forward, now only about two feet from the pizza sculpture. Fred pipes up again, but this time, he's asking us for help. It seems like he's standing under the sculpture of pizza; the shit is covering his whole body a couple times over. I try to make out the words he's saying, and it sounds like he needs something. That motherfucker probably just wanted more pizza for his sculpture/costume or whatever the fuck he was making. Anyways, I ask him what he needs. He replies, \"about tree fiddy.\" I then realize it wasn't Fred at all who was under the pizza!

{"body": "&gt; You are implying that 79 scientists didn't sign it because it isn't a true statement. That's a large lie you crafted considering only 11 of the 100 professors who replied thought the statement was scientifically untrue, meaning 89 or 89% did.\n\nNo, this is you being illiterate again. My point is simply that in order to say that we know the scientific consensus on an issue is *x*, we must have *at least* a simple majority of scientists state that *x* is true. Since 79 of the 131 scientists declined to say *x* is true (here, *x* is the statement in question), we can't say that the scientific consensus is that *x* is true. You can speculate about why these 79 people didn't sign, but it's not going to give you any traction in your argument because *it's just speculation.*\n\n&gt;I'm not sure what the issue is with using Wikipedia and citing a simplistic statement written and signed by top scientists in the intelligence research community. Maybe you could explain.\n\nBecause *selectively* citing Wikipedia is a hallmark of the internet pseudo-intellectual, and internet pseudo-intellectuals are a fucking joke. Hence, you are a fucking joke.\n\n&gt;All the signers of the statement are top professors at top universities who all are famous enough to have their own Wikipedia article, as noted here:\n\nNot sure what this proves.\n\n&gt;You do understand that this remark isn't a criticism itself but is a precursor to his actual criticism right?\n\nNo, to say that of the 52 signatories only 10 had the relevant expertise is definitely a criticism. Not sure why you're interpreting it as anything but (jk, it's because you're an intellectually dishonest boob).\n\n&gt;Those criticisms are very minor and don't disagree with the main points in the statement...considering it's from the APA president it can be viewed as giving support to the statement as the main point remains.\n\nI have no idea what you mean by \"main points\" in the statement; there doesn't seem to be a \"main point,\" and if you think there is you don't understand what the purpose of the statement was. The \"main point\" relevant to your pseudoscience might be 14, the one regarding the heritability of IQ; problem for you is he criticized that one specifically, and in such a way that calls into question the truth of the claim:\n\n&gt;Later on in point 14, he judged that the statements on heritability had been made without mentioning that it was based on twin studies, where environmental opportunities had been excluded as possible factors.\n\nBasically he's saying that because the studies didn't control for environmental opportunities, you can't draw strong conclusions about the heritability of IQ from them.\n\n&gt;The invitation to sign was sent to 131 researchers, of whom 100 responded by the deadline. The signature form asked whether the respondent would sign the statement, and if not, why. 52 respondents agreed to sign, while 48 did not. 38 supplied an explanation for their refusal, with 11 explicitly disagreeing that it represented the mainstream (or at least disagreeing with some of the claims in it), another 11 saying they did not know whether it did, and the rest citing various other reasons, including the fear of jeopardizing their position or project.[3]\n\nAnd? This seems to agree with my argument.\n\n&gt;I assume you mean 1996 instead of 1997? The 1996 paper states that the IQ score co-relationship for MZ twins is 0.68-.78 while for unrelated adopted siblings it's essentially zero. The 1996 paper's section of race difference in IQ scores is extremely apologetic and intellectually dishonest by e.g. implying American Indians have lower performance on verbal sections of the IQ score as a result of ear infections (!).\n\n&gt;I assume you mean 1996 instead of 1997? The 1996 paper states that the IQ score co-relationship for MZ twins is 0.68-.78 while for unrelated adopted siblings it's essentially zero.\n\nAnd as Campbell pointed out in his comments, those studies didn't control for environmental opportunities.\n\n&gt;The paper states that IQ scores is a good predictor of educational performance for US blacks and that the tests aren't culturally biased against US blacks in light of this information. It is also stated that socio-economic factors explain little of the variance in white-black IQ score.\n\nYes, these are trivially obvious facts (except the last one I suppose). What's not obvious is that genetics explains a significant amount of the differences in racial IQ scores. That's the claim you're making, so that's the claim you need to prove.\n\n&gt;The 1996 paper's section of race difference in IQ scores is extremely apologetic and intellectually dishonest by e.g. implying American Indians have lower performance on verbal sections of the IQ score as a result of ear infections (!).\n\nWhich page? You can't just say some shit without giving me a proper cite.\n\n&gt;In 1996 the conclusion that there are no large genetic differences in intelligence among races are two studies, one which was able to find genetic differences based on blood group type testing of blacks and another study from Germany with mixed race children with an American black servicemen father after WW2 when a lot of Germans were still poor and German teens grew up poor.\n\nAnd so? Make a real argument.\n\n&gt;Those are just two studies while Jensen and Rushton cite about 100 in their paper on race differences in the last 30 years of intelligence testing. The overwhelming amount of studies show a genetic racial component, even ones which didn't study twins or adoption.\n\nOh please. Jensen is the original architect of this pseudoscience, and there was even less evidence for that theory in his day than there is now (which is none). Rushton chaired the Pioneer Fund, a pretty well-known racial eugenicist movement. The objectivity of their conclusions is doubtful to say the least. \n\n&gt;It's very intellectually dishonest to state that the Mainstream Science on Intelligence statement doesn't represent the mainstream science on intelligence, as it does just that and no inherent faults have been found.\n\nIt neither does that, nor does it have no significant faults, and one of the many faults it does have is extremely pertinent to your central claim, which is that genetics explains racial differences in IQ. You simply have not demonstrated otherwise.\n\n&gt;Nessier et al (2012) quotes the 0.4-0.8 herability estimation from the statement in addition to citing the research from signers of the state considerably, e.g. Lynn, Jensen and Rushton.\n\nSigh. More dishonest selective quoting. Here's the full quote:\n\n&gt;Most studies estimate that the heritability of IQ is somewhere between .4 and .8 (and generally less for children), but it really makes no sense to talk about a single value for the heritability of intelligence. The heritability of a trait depends on the relative variances of the predictors, in this case genotype and environment. The concept of heritability has its origins in animal breeding, where variation in genotype and environment is under the control of the experimenter, and under these conditions the concept has some real-world applications. In free-ranging humans, however, variability is uncontrolled, there is no “true” degree of variation to estimate, and heritability can take practically any value for any trait depending on the relative variability of genetic endowment and environment in the population being studied. In any naturally occurring population, the heritability of intelligence is not zero (if\ngenotype varies at all, it will be reflected in IQ scores) and it is not one (if environment varies at all, it will be reflected in IQ scores). That the heritability of intelligence is between zero and one has one important consequence: Without additional evidence, correlations between biologically related parents and children cannot be unambiguously interpreted as either genetic or (as is more frequently attempted) environmental.\n\n--\n\n&gt;In terms of the 'closing of the black-white IQ gap'. The issue is that the gap is only closing for children, it remains for 18-year-olds:\n\nI don't know what your point is here. Make an argument.\n\n&gt;Can you give me some quotes from the 2012 study?

Since 79 of the 131 scientists declined to say x is true (here, x is the statement in question), we can't say that the scientific consensus is that x is true. You can speculate about why these 79 people didn't sign, but it's not going to give you any traction in your argument because it's just speculation.\n\nI've already responded to this, 100 out of 131 professors responded and 11 refused explictly as in their view the statement doesn't accurately represent the science behind intelligence testing (which also allows for the possibility the statement is too conservative in regards to the genetic component). The 11 who refused might have also been to scared to sign or the statement didn't agree with their political/religious/social views. Same with the 11 professors who weren't sure. There is quite an overwhelming majority of professors who agree with the statement, including (as one response to the statement said) the 'who is who' of the intelligence research community.\n\n&gt;Because selectively citing Wikipedia is a hallmark of the internet pseudo-intellectual, and internet pseudo-intellectuals are a fucking joke. Hence, you are a fucking joke.\n\nYou're the one selectively quoting Wikipedia (e.g. stating that 79 out of 131 refused to sign which is plainly false and stating that there is much more legitimate criticism to the statement...which there wasn't). Then to top it you cite Niesser et al (1996) and Niesser et al (2012) to state that there is no genetic component to IQ heritability. You don't even bother to quote from either of the two papers..\n\n&gt;Yes, these are trivially obvious facts (except the last one I suppose). What's not obvious is that genetics explains a significant amount of the differences in racial IQ scores. That's the claim you're making, so that's the claim you need to prove.\n\nI linked a statement signed by 52 professors stating specifically that herability of IQ is .4-.8 and that the average black IQ is 85 compared to 103 for whites. You're supposed to give me studies to refute this claims, Niesser et al 1996 certainly doesn't and you need to cite some quotes from Niesser et al 2012. Jensen and Rushton responded to Niesser et al 1996 and other critiques in the paper I linked (the 50 page PDF file), which as I already mentioned cites a lot of studies which use different useful proxies for genetic influence (e.g. adoption studies and twin studies) and studies which show that the ~1.1 SD difference between whites and blacks remain after controlling for cultural and socio-economic factors, while affirming socio-economic differences within a racial group affects IQ score (which also is mainstream intelligence research science).\n\nCulture doesn't explain it, socio-economics doesn't explain it...what does explain it if environment doesn't other than genetics? Show some recent studies of black teenagers with the same socio-economic background scoring the same as whites or something, I suggest citing a study where both teenager groups have very rich parents.\n\n&gt;Which page? You can't just say some shit without giving me a proper cite.\n\nPage 93 second paragraph from this PDF file (http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/research/correlation/intelligence.pdf)\n\n&gt;Oh please. Jensen is the original architect of this pseudoscience, and there was even less evidence for that theory in his day than there is now (which is none). Rushton chaired the Pioneer Fund, a pretty well-known racial eugenicist movement. The objectivity of their conclusions is doubtful to say the least.\n\nAnd 80%+ of professors are left-wing, with lots of Marxist historians and sociologists. Yet I never see anyone arguing their work is *a priori* faulty or discredited. Jensen's 'pseudo-science' isn't discredited, and Nessier et al cite it a lot of his work in their papers. \n\n&gt;And so? Make a real argument.\n\nI'm making the argument that using two studies out of hundreds is pretty disingeniously inhonest, especially as I see at least 8 mentions of possibly poor quality studies and a variety of studies getting different results in the whole complete paper. Like I said, Jensen and Rushton cite ~100 studies which argue for a genetic component.\n\n&gt; Oh please. Jensen is the original architect of this pseudoscience, and there was even less evidence for that theory in his day than there is now (which is none). Rushton chaired the Pioneer Fund, a pretty well-known racial eugenicist movement. The objectivity of their conclusions is doubtful to say the least.\n\nThen why did no one discredit his ideas?\n\n&gt;I don't know what your point is here. Make an argument.\n\nThat....is the argument. There is no closing of the IQ gap in 18-year-olds. It doesn't exactly matter if the IQ gap closes for children.\n\n&gt;Sigh. More dishonest selective quoting. Here's the full quote:\n\nNiesser et al's statement on heritability is semantic and very ridiculous, it's something that comes out of the blue in both 1996 and 2012 whenever the topic of race differences or heritability comes up and it's very painfully noticeable (e.g. the ear infection comment to explain for lacking verbal scores for Indian Americans).\n\n&gt;Of what?\n\nWhatever argument you were making to cite 2012? You cited 2012 without making an argument other than just stating that study showed no genetic influence, which would be a huge landmark study and directly contradicting the scientific mainstream on intelligence, as an overwhelming majority at least accept .4 heritability.\n\n&gt;And as Campbell pointed out in his comments, those studies didn't control for environmental opportunities.\n\nThat's not stated in Niesser et al (1996) itself, so now I need to find whatever your Campbel paper you're quoting.\n\n&gt;Basically he's saying that because the studies didn't control for environmental opportunities, you can't draw strong conclusions about the heritability of IQ from them.\n\nHe is only stating that 'the studies didn't control for environmental opportunities', nowhere does he state 'you can't draw strong conclusions about the heritability of IQ from them'. That's just something you're concluding. And the lack of control for environmental opportunities very reasonable might indeed ACTUALLY LOWER (as opposed to HIGHER it) the calculated genetic influence, as the heritability is never claimed to be 80%+.\n\n&gt;It neither does that, nor does it have no significant faults, and one of the many faults it does have is extremely pertinent to your central claim, which is that genetics explains racial differences in IQ. **You simply have not demonstrated otherwise.**\n\nThe Mainstream Science on Intelligence, signed by 52 top intelligence researchers, all professors, the 'who is who' of intelligence testing, explicitly states this. Then I also quoted a 50 page paper by Rushton and Jensen which you didn't read, which cites ~100 studies showing a genetic component (e.g. twin studies and adoption studies) and completely discrediting the culture and socio-economic argument to explain for race differences in intelligence.\n\nThe Rushton and Jensen paper criticizes the German WW2 servicemen's children study with:\n\n&gt;Three studies of racially mixed individuals at ﬁrst appear to support the\n&gt;culture-only hypothesis against the genetic hypothesis. Eyferth (1961; Eyferth,\n&gt;Brandt, &amp; Hawel, 1960) reported IQ data for out-of-wedlock children fathered by\n&gt;soldiers stationed in Germany after World War II and then reared by White\n&gt;German mothers. The mean IQs for 83 White children and for 98 racially mixed\n&gt;children were both about 97 (97.2 for the Whites, 96.5 for the racially mixed). As\n&gt;Loehlin et al. (1975, pp. 126–128) noted, however, these results are ambiguous\n&gt;for three reasons. First, the children were still very young when tested. One third\n&gt;of the children were between 5 and 10 years of age, and two thirds were between\n&gt;10 and 13 years. As discussed in Section 5 (see Figure 3), behavior genetic studies\n&gt;show that while family socialization effects on IQ are often strong before puberty,\n&gt;after puberty they dwindle, sometimes to zero. Second, 20% to 25% of the\n&gt;“Black” fathers were not African Americans but French North Africans (i.e.,\n&gt;largely Caucasian or “Whites” as we have deﬁned the terms here). Third, there\n&gt;was rigorous selection based on IQ score in the U.S. Army at the time, with a\n&gt;rejection rate for Blacks on the preinduction Army General Classiﬁcation Test of\n&gt;about 30%, compared with 3% for Whites (see Davenport, 1946, Tables I and III).\n&gt;The second study reports a 9-point IQ advantage for the 4-year-old offspring\n&gt;of couples with a White mother and a Black father (mean IQ \u0001 102, N \u0001 101)\n&gt;compared with those from the offspring of a Black mother and a White father\n&gt;(mean IQ \u0001 93, N \u0001 28). Willerman, Naylor, and Myrianthopoulos (1974),\n&gt;assuming White mothers provide better pre- or postnatal environments for their\n&gt;children than do Black mothers, interpreted their data as more consistent with a\n&gt;cultural than a genetic hypothesis (see also Nisbett, 1998). However, Loehlin et\n&gt;al. (1975, p. 126) noted that the mixed-race pairs with White mothers averaged\n&gt;almost a year more schooling than did the pairs with Black mothers. Thus the\n&gt;White mothers may have had a higher average IQ than the Black ones. The\n&gt;mid-parent IQs have to be the same for the results to be interpretable. Also, the\n&gt;two sets of mixed-race children averaged an IQ of 98, intermediate to the White\n&gt;and Black children in the sample from whom the mixed-race children had been\n&gt;drawn (IQs \u0001 105 and 91, respectively; Broman, Nichols, &amp; Kennedy, 1975,\n&gt;p. 43).\nThe th", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401828320", "subreddit": "GreatApes", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Finally it's my time to shine... I have a perfect story for this.\n\nSo one of my friends was always into magic tricks and that sort of stuff. I knew him a long time and as a kid he used to watch all sorts of shows and all that... Later he started trying to do them himself, in his teens he was already good at it, people and friends were genuinely impressed by his tricks. However that wasn't enough for him, so he soon got into hypnosis and such... I mean people consider this like a magic trick too, right? \n\nSoooooo fast forward a few years and we didn't really spend much time together, I was studying in another city, while he was in another. I finally met up with him again after some time and jokingly asked him how  was he at those cheap tricks... He said he could attempt hypnosis on me and that It could work... I called it bullshit, told him there ain't no way he would fool me. So 2 hours later we had a bet going on, but he warned me it would be awkward. \n\nIt began like all hypnosis tricks, the guy goes into a soothing tune starts talking a bunch of mumbo jumbo that sounds REALLY awkward... So the final words are the typical \"when I snap my fingers you will be in a state of awareness in which you will see things I tell you to see, and hear things I tell you to hear\"\n\nThe funny thing was I don't really remember much of what I did while being hypnotized... There were a few other friends around who were witness, they told me my friend convinced me that I won a million $, told me we smoked weed and I had to go home because my parents were expecting me... and knew I was high(I wasn't even living with my parents anymore) there were even more random things he tried to tell me were happening but I didn't fall for all of them... When he had his fun he basically chanted the words \"You will now come out of this hypnosis with the count of 1, 2, 3 *SNAP* \". When I snapped out of it, I thought they slipped me acid or something... It felt like I was dreaming a very lucid dream. My hypnotist friend then turned around and said:\n\"The bet is settled then... I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\nIt was only then that I realized that my friend was actually a monster that was 500 ft tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era...  \"I'm not givin' you three fiddy, you damn monster!\" I shouted, as the lochness monster was swimming away... \n\nTL;DR Being hypnotized sort of feels like being on drugs, or being in a very lucid dream, you go to \"Sleep\" then you wake up.

Anyway, if I was straight I might have been scared but that gun was so pretty in his shaky white knuckled hands that I couldn't get over it. When he/she finally realized I was the pizza guy he/she laughed, which sounded like the laugh track to a Disney show too me, and asked me to come in and they'd get the money. He/She left and went down the hallway. A person I was pretty sure was a girl was sitting on the couch stoned out of her gourd and told me to bring my pretty white ass over there and she'd suck my dick. Maybe she was mistaking me for the he/she that pulled the gun on me but I didn't care. Well, a minute or two later I'm standing at the couch with my pants around my ankles and mentally drifting to other parts of this world. About then the he/she comes back into the room with a wad of cash. He/she hands it to me as he/she opens up the pizza. I was still holding the pizza box in my hands but it was sitting on the head of the girl giving me head. He/she dives into that slice of pizza like he/she hadn't eaten in days while I watch the pepperonis dancing around in the box. After a little bit he/she says something to the effect of, \"So, how is it?\" I replied back, \"I don't know, I'm not eating the pizza.\" \"No, not that, the blowjob.\" \"Really good.

He brought it from back from some foreign country and it's always asking to suck my dick but I've never been stoned enough to give it a try.\" I lift up the pizza box and look down to see this long necked slimy skinned animal going for broke on my manhood. I freak out, slam the pizza box in the head of the green thing, reach for my pants and head for the door. I only got a couple of blocks down the street before I stopped to calm down.

{"body": "&gt; I've already responded to this, 100 out of 131 professors responded and 11 refused explictly as in their view the statement doesn't accurately represent the science behind intelligence testing (which also allows for the possibility the statement is too conservative in regards to the genetic component). The 11 who refused might have also been to scared to sign or the statement didn't agree with their political/religious/social views. Same with the 11 professors who weren't sure. There is quite an overwhelming majority of professors who agree with the statement, including (as one response to the statement said) the 'who is who' of the intelligence research community.\n\nThis is just baseless speculation. And you're twisting the meaning of the \"who's who\" criticism (surprise surprise); the point of that criticism was to show that the signatories were almost all supporters of just one of the three major paradigms of intelligence theory, a \"who's who\" of that particular paradigm. That does not support your claim about consensus in any way. More dishonest bullshit.\n\n&gt;You're the one selectively quoting Wikipedia (e.g. stating that 79 out of 131 refused to sign which is plainly false and stating that there is much more legitimate criticism to the statement...which there wasn't).\n\nYour illiteracy is showing again; I only said that 79 of the 131 *did not* sign, not that all 79 refused to sign. And there was extensive criticism in the criticism section despite your poor attempts to explain it away. I'm simply ignoring them because they're a) dumb as shit and b) irrelevant to the original question, which was whether or not there is a scientific consensus that genes explain the differences in racial IQ disparity.\n\n&gt;Then to top it you cite Niesser et al (1996) and Niesser et al (2012) to state that there is no genetic component to IQ heritability. You don't even bother to quote from either of the two papers..\n\n[what are you talking about moron](http://www.reddit.com/r/GreatApes/comments/273x9w/for_our_new_readers_and_subscribers_the_role_of/chxrnzl)\n\n&gt;I linked a statement signed by 52 professors\n\n...out of 131...\n\n&gt;stating specifically that herability of IQ is .4-.8 and that the average black IQ is 85 compared to 103 for whites.\n\nThe latter is trivially true. The former is fraught, refer to the cite from Nisbett et. al. at the end of my previous post.\n\n&gt;You're supposed to give me studies to refute this claims, Niesser et al 1996 certainly doesn't and you need to cite some quotes from Niesser et al 2012.\n\nNo, this is you trying to shift the burden of proof. *You* need to show me the science which links the supposed heritability of IQ to the average IQ difference of whites and blacks. Nisbett et. al. say this science doesn't exist. I look forward to your attempts to prove them wrong!\n\n&gt;Jensen and Rushton responded to Niesser et al 1996 and other critiques in the paper I linked (the 50 page PDF file)\n\nAnd I feel more than comfortable hand waving Jensen and Rushton since their objectivity is in serious doubt on this matter. Show me some science from people who aren't closely associated with racial eugenics movements.\n\n&gt;Culture doesn't explain it, socio-economics doesn't explain it...what does explain it if environment doesn't other than genetics? Show some recent studies of black teenagers with the same socio-economic background scoring the same as whites or something, I suggest citing a study where both teenager groups have very rich parents.\n\nNo no no, that's not how this works. Even if your claims that culture and SES doesn't explain it (which is expressly contradicted in Nisbett et. al., but irrelevant) are true, it's still up to you to prove that it's genetics which is the cause. I haven't proved that gravity is really God holding us all down by disproving that gravity is Buddha pushing us up off the earth.\n\n&gt;Page 93 second paragraph from this PDF file (http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/research/correlation/intelligence.pdf)\n\nOh, this is awesome...so you gave me this cite because I requested substantiation for your claim that Nessier et. al. posited hearing loss from ear infections to explain differences in intelligence testing. And it looks like they did...but the specific intelligence tests they were referring to are *verbal tests*, and it is entirely plausible that hearing loss from ear infections could affect performance on verbal tests (in fact, they even provide a cite!). I'm not sure if it was idiocy or disingenuousness which caused you to gloss over this very relevant detail, but I'm starting to realize that I'm not going to get an honest argument out of you.\n\n&gt;And 80%+ of professors are left-wing, with lots of Marxist historians and sociologists. Yet I never see anyone arguing their work is a priori faulty or discredited. Jensen's 'pseudo-science' isn't discredited, and Nessier et al cite it a lot of his work in their papers. \n\nReally? I see it all the time. And you're ignoring the distinctions here; Jensen created this theory of genetic differences long before any evidence whatsoever for his argument existed, and Rushton, having headed a racial eugenics movement, is far from objective on this issue. Once again, give me some neutral academics supporting these clowns or fuck off.\n\n&gt;I'm making the argument that using two studies out of hundreds is pretty disingeniously inhonest, especially as I see at least 8 mentions of possibly poor quality studies and a variety of studies getting different results in the whole complete paper. Like I said, Jensen and Rushton cite ~100 studies which argue for a genetic component.\n\nNo, they cite studies which argue against *some* non-genetic explanations, and then posit genetic explanations. But that leap is unfounded; if you're making a scientific argument for genetic explanations for *x*, then at least one of your empirical premises must contain some information about genes themselves. But not a single study they cite does this. The reason why Nessier only cited two studies was because those were the only two studies at the time which contained data about the genes themselves. And guess what...\n\n&gt;Then why did no one discredit his ideas?\n\nThey...did? Constantly? For like, the past 6 decades? Academics have been arguing against Jensen and his intellectual descendants (Murray etc.) this whole time. Shit, Nessier et. al. and Nisbett et. al. are direct refutations of Jensen's theories. Back to reality kid.\n\n&gt;That....is the argument. There is no closing of the IQ gap in 18-year-olds. It doesn't exactly matter if the IQ gap closes for children.\n\nThis is a premise, not an argument. I don't know what to make of this premise until you place it in the context of a conclusion, thereby forming an argument. It's not surprising to me that an idiot racist doesn't know how to properly organize his thoughts.\n\n&gt;Niesser et al's statement on heritability is semantic and very ridiculous, it's something that comes out of the blue in both 1996 and 2012 whenever the topic of race differences or heritability comes up and it's very painfully noticeable (e.g. the ear infection comment to explain for lacking verbal scores for Indian Americans).\n\nThis seems suspiciously like a dumbfuck opinion from an idiot who has no idea what he's talking about. What credentials do you have which would lend your evaluation of Nessier et. al.'s argument any weight here?\n\n&gt;Whatever argument you were making to cite 2012? You cited 2012 without making an argument other than just stating that study showed no genetic influence, which would be a huge landmark study and directly contradicting the scientific mainstream on intelligence, as an overwhelming majority at least accept .4 heritability.\n\nOh jesus. You do realize that Nisbett et. al. 2012 is a review of the literature, right? So when I quote Nisbett et. al. saying there's no evidence to support the genetic hypothesis for an explanation of the intelligence differences between races, that's me quoting experts on the measuring of intelligence saying that in the literature at large there's no evidence which supports the genetic hypothesis. I'm pretty sure that's all I need to do here.\n\n&gt;That's not stated in Niesser et al (1996) itself, so now I need to find whatever your Campbel paper you're quoting.\n\nIt's not a paper, it's Campbell's comments on the Statement from the wikipedia article you posted. Try to keep up here.\n\n&gt;He is only stating that 'the studies didn't control for environmental opportunities', nowhere does he state 'you can't draw strong conclusions about the heritability of IQ from them'. That's just something you're concluding.\n\nhaha, ok, yes, you're right that very reasonable conclusion cannot be easily inferred from him pointing this failure out as an important nuance of the twin studies used to substantiate the claims made in the Statement about heritability of intelligence, that's totally not a bad faith argument you're making bro\n\n(con't)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401835556", "subreddit": "GreatApes", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. As a black man and as a gay man and as a woman, black people suck, gay people are gross and women are bitches. You must be new to Reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once, and it's almost as if Reddit is composed of millions of individuals with different opinions and outlooks.\n\nThis stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a bundle of sticks, 2/10, would not bang, not with that attitude. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! I really sympathize with pedophiles, but that has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now.

{"body": "Well it all began when I finished my manuscript. I had been working on it for maybe a year or so. I was really proud of it, and very happy with what I had accomplished. The story was a fantasy novel about demon hunting men in an alternate Middle Ages. It was a little over the top, but I was sure those young adult readers would love it. \n\nSo, I sent it off to a ton of publishers, every one I could. After 21 declines, I got accepted to come meet with the editor of \"Sapphire Books\". I was ecstatic. Finally, I had a chance. It looked like the hard work might pay off. So I headed to New York. The publishing company held a part of a skyscraper and used that part for offices. It was very nice, clean, and polished.\n\nI was taken back to the editors office for my appointment. The editor sat there at his desk with a smile on his face, and greeted me. He told me how interested he was in the book and how he really believes it could do great with that \"teen fantasy\" crowd. I told him that was what I was going for. We shared a few laughs, and soon actually got into business talk. I couldn't believe it. This was going to work.\n\nWe started talking about how the percentages work, where the money goes, etc. It was a pretty fair deal for me, if the book sold well I'd get a nice cut. I took a lunch break to read through the contract, make sure my rights weren't violated or anything, etc. Once I thought it seemed crystal clear, I headed back to the office to tell him that I accept. \n\nThe editor was very happy about my decision, and told me there were just two more things to do. First, just sign a few more papers, which I did, and then he said he needed one more thing.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about now that I noticed that the editor was actually a 8 story tall creature from the Paleozoic era.\n\nI said \"Goddammit Loch Ness Monster I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\", and I walked out of that office.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401849340", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 1}

There were many disgusting things I had to do, here are some.\n\nKeep in mind our hospital was only a few minutes away from Loch Ness, and we got many calls from people getting hurt there.\n\nOne lady, she was a complete hambeast. I think her records showed 470 pounds at her last physical, and she had clearly grown at least another hundred since. We asked her what was wrong, and she said when she was swimming, she got a sharp pain in her back. We attempted, without success, to roll her over, for at least an hour until we brought in the hydraulic lift. While we were waiting for the lift, she told us, in more detail, what exactly happened. \n\nShe was swimming in the lake with her newlywed husband (just as big I'd presume) and they started to see weird things, ripples in the water, etc. \n\nBefore she could finish, the lift came and we rolled her over. As all the other assistants left the room to puke, I stared in shock at this lady's back. There were rolls and rolls of fat, plus a weird, dark scab hidden beneath two rolls. \n\nWe called a surgeon as quickly as possible to remove the scab, and we moved her to the OR just as quick. I had to stay in the room to oversee the operation, and what I saw stays with me today.\n\nThe scab was more than just a scab, and as the surgeon pulled it out, it gave way to more more and more scab. After a good 3 minutes, the thing was completely pulled out of this woman's back fat.

{"body": "The argument that you're making to bypass the issue that there is no cultural and socio-economic explanation for the difference and that adoption, twin, reaction time studies etc all show large differences only explainable by genetic differences. That you are arguing that genes have to be discovered for the genetic explanation to hold is ridiculous and completely unscientific and no intelligence researcher holds that view.\n\n&gt;And I feel more than comfortable hand waving Jensen and Rushton since their objectivity is in serious doubt on this matter. Show me some science from people who aren't closely associated with racial eugenics movements.\n\nThen why does everyone in the intelligence research community conduct studies with them and cite their papers, even their 'opponents' cite their studies for their general arguments (NOT to refute them). If their research is biased it would be riddled with flaws and their studies or conclusions would be seriously discredited, yet their opinions aren't far from the scientific mainstream on intelligence, e.g. .6-.8 heritability compared to the 1996 mainstream of .4-.8.\n\n&gt;Oh, this is awesome...so you gave me this cite because I requested substantiation for your claim that Nessier et. al. posited hearing loss from ear infections to explain differences in intelligence testing. And it looks like they did...but the specific intelligence tests they were referring to are verbal tests, and it is entirely plausible that hearing loss from ear infections could affect performance on verbal tests (in fact, they even provide a cite!). I'm not sure if it was idiocy or disingenuousness which caused you to gloss over this very relevant detail, but I'm starting to realize that I'm not going to get an honest argument out of you.\n\nI explicitly stated they use it as citation for the lower verbal scores...please for the love of God stop misquoting me, Wikipedia and the studies you cite. Ear infections won't show a widespread lower score on the verbal part. Also note that Niesser et al' same paper doesn't even address the higher verbal score for Ashkenazi Jews and higher visio-spatial scores for East-Asians.\n\n&gt;This is just baseless speculation. And you're twisting the meaning of the \"who's who\" criticism (surprise surprise); \n\nNisbett's ideas in general (which Nisbett 2012 conclusions come from) are severely criticized by the scientific community at large. For example here's Lee (2010) showing that Nisbett muddles the water with his conclusions:\n\nhttp://laplab.ucsd.edu/articles2/Lee2010.pdf\n\nThe 50 page Rushton and Jensen paper I linked also discredit Nisbett's ideas, it wa published before Nisbett 2012 but that paper doesn't bring in any fundamentally new ideas. \n\n[30 Years of Research on Race Differences In Cognitive Ability by Rushton and Jensen, affirming amongst other things the huge IQ gap between blacks and whites and how IQ is correlated with scholastic and real life (socio-economic) performance [PDF, 50 pages]](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf)\n\nNiesser 1996 also is ideological as it's the paper published by the APA task force as a response to the publication of the Bell Curve, hence why it has such a large ideological slant (the APA would have been discredited if it were to state there are large genetic racial differences) and why the section of race differences in Niesser 1996 is so poorly argumented and supported by citations of papers and studies.\n\n&gt;Oh jesus. You do realize that Nisbett et. al. 2012 is a review of the literature, right? So when I quote Nisbett et. al. saying there's no evidence to support the genetic hypothesis for an explanation of the intelligence differences between races, that's me quoting experts on the measuring of intelligence saying that in the literature at large there's no evidence which supports the genetic hypothesis. I'm pretty sure that's all I need to do here.\n\nYou don't quote Nisbett et al., you're citing it and aren't making an actual argument by quoting from the paper, other than the quote that heritability doesn't make sense in the context of IQ tests, which is a semantic argument and not accepted by the scientific mainstream.\n\n&gt;haha, ok, yes, you're right that very reasonable conclusion cannot be easily inferred from him pointing this failure out as an important nuance of the twin studies used to substantiate the claims made in the Statement about heritability of intelligence, that's totally not a bad faith argument you're making bro\n\nIt isn't, you need to give me citations on studies which show this is the case and you quoted the APA president as explicitly stating the conclusion YOU made. You're yet again misquoting and in this instance putting word's in the APA president's mouth.\n\n&gt;This is a premise, not an argument. I don't know what to make of this premise until you place it in the context of a conclusion, thereby forming an argument. It's not surprising to me that an idiot racist doesn't know how to properly organize his thoughts.\n\nNo, it's the argument for the closing of the black-white IQ gap thereby implying this gap is non-genetic. The problem with this completely disingenuous argument is that it's closing in children and for 18-year-olds it actually higher in recent years.\n\n&gt;No, they cite studies which argue against some non-genetic explanations, and then posit genetic explanations. But that leap is unfounded; if you're making a scientific argument for genetic explanations for x, **then at least one of your empirical premises must contain some information about genes themselves**. But not a single study they cite does this. The reason why Nessier only cited two studies was because those were the only two studies at the time which contained data about the genes themselves. And guess what...\n\n**It really doesn't and I don't think even Nisbett or Nessier make this claim, AFAIK as I know they only state no genes have been found. Using behavioral genetics ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_genetics ) is a perfectly valid way to measure genetic differences.**\n\nConsidering the mountains of evidence for a substantial ( 0.6-0.8) genetic factor I cited, can you at least cite one paper which directly refutes a large genetic factor without resorting to semantic arguments, the lack of identified genes related to intelligence, and a minicule amount of (old) studies? A paper which cites only 50 papers to directly argue for a significant cultural and/or socio-economic component to IQ?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401871009", "subreddit": "GreatApes", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I found a good movie on Netflix and thought that it'd be a nice way for us to get to better know each other\". Of course I accepted, because who would turn down such an offer? I arrived to her house in around 25 minutes and we talked, before eventually cuddling up on her couch and watching \"Pain And Gain\".\n\nWhile cuddling, she poked her butt out on my lap, basically teasing me and I gave her a kiss on the cheek. About 20 minutes later, after everything had been done, and we were laying on the floor, she laid her head on my chest and told me there was something that needed to be said. Hesitantly, I asked what was on her mind, and upon finishing that sentence she broke into tears. I was so scared. She then stood above me, and looked down with her big red eyes and said \"I need about tree fiddy\".\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401878829", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Like wise the Constitution of Medina was not perfect, but it was not about forcing Islam on others.  \n\nIt allowed religious minorities (Christians, Jews, pagans were all part of the community during the life of the Prophet, peace be upon him) to live amongst the Muslims. In the Charter of Medina, dhimmi were exempt from fighting battles, but promised protection from the Muslims.  They were promised freedom of religion and they could renovate buildings into houses of worship. They also could practice the laws of their religion if they chose.  \n\nThere is a hadith that shows how serious Muhammad, peace be upon him was, about the dhimmi:\n\nThe Prophet, upon him be peace, said, \"Whoever killed a Mu'ahid (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years of traveling.\" (Muhammad)\n\nThe zakat (obligatory tax / purifying tax / charity tax) is one of the pillars of Islam. It is obligatory because wealth is considered something God loans us; it doesn't belong to us. It is purifying because human beings typically do not want to give up their wealth, especially when it means they will deny themselves something they want.  In Islam it is obligatory to give charity because it polishes the heart. \n\nThe relationship a Muslim has with money is very different (or should be very different) than the relationship a non-muslim has with money.  \n\nAll this being said, the jizya tax is misunderstood because of those who take the ayat in Quran and don't realize all that is necessary to know what the ayat is actually about.

{"body": "&gt; The argument that you're making to bypass the issue that there is no cultural and socio-economic explanation for the difference and that adoption, twin, reaction time studies etc all show large differences only explainable by genetic differences. That you are arguing that genes have to be discovered for the genetic explanation to hold is ridiculous and completely unscientific and no intelligence researcher holds that view.\n\nFalse, I've given you two comprehensive literature reviews which explicitly say the genetic hypothesis is not supported by the data.\n\n&gt;Then why does everyone in the intelligence research community conduct studies with them and cite their papers, even their 'opponents' cite their studies for their general arguments (NOT to refute them). If their research is biased it would be riddled with flaws and their studies or conclusions would be seriously discredited, yet their opinions aren't far from the scientific mainstream on intelligence, e.g. .6-.8 heritability compared to the 1996 mainstream of .4-.8.\n\nWho is this \"everyone\" you speak of? Jensen and Rushton have plenty of critics. And the \"heritability\" of IQ isn't in question; what *is* in question is whether or not this heritability can be reduced to genetic influence. According to two literature reviews from unbiased academics, that hypothesis is not supported. Not much else to say here.\n\n&gt;Nisbett's ideas in general (which Nisbett 2012 conclusions come from) are severely criticized by the scientific community at large. For example here's Lee (2010) showing that Nisbett muddles the water with his conclusions:\n\nAh, so one psychologist represents the scientific community at large. Back to reality kid. Also, what \"water muddying\" are you referring to? All Lee is saying is  Nisbett's skepticism toward genetic tech's ability to define the genes associated with intelligence is unfounded. That doesn't change the fact that the genetic hypothesis is not supported. It's also worth noting that Lee is not a geneticist, so Nisbett could simply say Lee is overconfident. This book review doesn't give you any traction whatsoever. Why are your sources complete shit, always? Seriously, Wikipedia articles, shoddy interpretations of the literature from pseudoscientist racists, and now bloviations about genetics from non-geneticists. Up your game.\n\nOh, and this amused me (Lee, page 8):\n\n&gt;The ultimate test of the hereditarian hypothesis is of course the identification of the genetic variants affecting IQ and a tally of their frequencies in the two populations. \n\nHe's basically agreeing with me that the genetic hypothesis ain't true until the IQ genes have been identified and counted in the population. Eat shit.\n\n&gt;The 50 page Rushton and Jensen paper I linked also discredit Nisbett's ideas, it wa published before Nisbett 2012 but that paper doesn't bring in any fundamentally new ideas. \n\nWhere? And if Nisbett is still getting published in the premier psychology journal in the US after his ideas have been \"discredited\" then his ideas have not been \"discredited\" you simpering idiot.\n\n&gt;Niesser 1996 also is ideological as it's the paper published by the APA task force as a response to the publication of the Bell Curve, hence why it has such a large ideological slant (the APA would have been discredited if it were to state there are large genetic racial differences) and why the section of race differences in Niesser 1996 is so poorly argumented and supported by citations of papers and studies.\n\nWrong. Nessier et. al. (please learn names moron) was published as an objective rebuttal to the ideological Bell Curve. And poorly \"argumented\"? Who says Nessier et. al. was poorly *argued*? You? You're an idiot, I can't trust your evaluations here. Jensen and his intellectual descendants? Why should I trust the opinions of pseduoscientists?\n\n&gt;You don't quote Nisbett et al., you're citing it\n\nlmao look at those semantics, truly a master of good faith arguing right hurr\n\n&gt;and aren't making an actual argument by quoting from the paper, other than the quote that heritability doesn't make sense in the context of IQ tests, which is a semantic argument and not accepted by the scientific mainstream.\n\nWrong. I'm citing Nisbett twice, for two reasons; first in the race and intelligence section where he says there's no evidence which supports the genetic hypothesis, in order to refute your claim that the genetic hypothesis is true. Second, where he discusses the problems with applying the concept of heritability to a complex trait like intelligence in a complex animal like humans, in order to undermine the hereditarian view of intelligence generally. The former is supported by even your boy Lee who admits genetic science has not identified the IQ genes. The latter doesn't seem like \"semantics\" to me, nor can I trust your evaluation of Nisbett's argument as such because, again, you're a moron.\n\n&gt;It isn't, you need to give me citations on studies which show this is the case and you quoted the APA president as explicitly stating the conclusion YOU made. You're yet again misquoting and in this instance putting word's in the APA president's mouth.\n\nWrong again. The quote came from the Wikipedia article you linked in your first post. The quote was him pointing out that the twin studies point 14., the point about heritability, was supported by didn't control for environmental opportunities. The very reasonable inference here is that he was criticizing proponents of point 14. for supporting their claims with shoddy science; after all, without controlling for environmental opportunities you actually don't know if the results you're seeing are from genetic heritability or environmental differences. If you *still* think I'm just putting words in people's mouths then I don't know what to say, you have the intellect of a child.\n\n&gt;No, it's the argument for the closing of the black-white IQ gap thereby implying this gap is non-genetic. The problem with this completely disingenuous argument is that it's closing in children and for 18-year-olds it actually higher in recent years.\n\nSo first, learn what disingenuous means. Watching you misuse that word over and over is grating as fuck. Second, the quote you posted in support of this claim doesn't actually support it; it seems that Flynn and Murray are in a stalemate over which way to measure IQ gaps over time. If Flynn's method is the right one, then the gap is closing and you're wrong. If Murray's method is the right one, then the gap is not closing and you're right. Problem is, not even Murray, the guy with whom you're ideologically aligned here, knows if he's right about this, so the *absolute most* you can say here is \"I don't know,\" definitely not that Flynn's argument is \"disingenuous.\" You're either incredibly stupid or profoundly dishonest.\n\n&gt;It really doesn't\n\nIt really does, refer to Lee, page 8.\n\n&gt;Using behavioral genetics ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_genetics ) is a perfectly valid way to measure genetic differences.\n\nThis seems like yet another dumbfuck opinion from a dumbfuck. Behavioral genetics is just what they used to call evopsych, the fad pseudoscience of our time.\n\n&gt;Considering the mountains of evidence for a substantial ( 0.6-0.8) genetic factor I cited,\n\nYou mean that one paper by those two racist pseudoscientists?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401902806", "subreddit": "GreatApes", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Totally something I would do (I don't have a sister so I say that but IRL I might react differently)\n\nIt's 7:30 PM on a Thursday, and I'm just getting home from a long day working construction.

{"body": "Finally a story I can share.\n\nThis was time, I was dining at a restaurant that had a name so exotic I can't even remember. \n\nIt had red flags all over from the moment I sat down. There was a waiter sitting in the bar on his lunch break, I guess, this guy was eating food from a Chinese food restaurant, which is not a good signal, because if you work at a restaurant why wouldn't you eat right there? \n\nAs I was waiting there (I waited about 13 minutes for a waiter to take my order) a guy started to yell at this waiter, but really using very respective language and smacking him in the back of the head, the other guy didn't even flinch. Everyone in the restaurant was just staring, but for some reason nobody left. But this was not not enough red for what was coming.\n\nI ordered some french fries, when they finally got to my table, there was a tantrum going on in the kitchen. I started to eat so I could get the hell out of there as fast as I could. \nMidway through my french fries I felt something that was raw, cold and something between cold and hot. I looked down and saw this raw chicken head right in the middle of the fries. At this moment I was feeling sick to my stomach, trying not to lose it, and because it was obvious the restaurant was about to close (honestly it was a hell hole) I called the manager, explained the situation and demanded a refund, since those fries were about 9 dollars and I was really far away from any atm. \n\nTo my surprise, even thought the manager saw the raw chicken head right in the middle of my fries, he didn't even looked like he cared. Almost as this was common on the restaurant. He then proceded to tell me that there was no refunds, but he could give me a discount coupon for my next visit. \n\nI was tired, hungry and I'm making this story short, because really I fought with the manager for about 12 minutes about this. I ended up accepting the goddamn coupon. The manager seemed pleased. I spent 9 dollars on the fries, so I ask the manager...\n\n\"How much will the coupon be worth?\"\n\n\"About tree fiddy\" he answers.\n\nThats when I noticed the manager was a 500 feet tall monster from the palaeolithic era directly descended from dinosaurs.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401965263", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Yeah, it was weird.\n\nThis guy was my best friend all the way through college and for several years after that. We knew each others deepest, darkest secrets. We dropped MDMA and acid together. He cried on my shoulder at his grandfather's funeral. He was going to be Best Man at my wedding.\n\nOne day, we were at the pub and a mutual friend of ours came over and we got talking. At one point he said to my friend, \"Hey, weren't you going to ask *redefine19* something?\"\n\n\"I can't\", replied my friend and walked away.\n\nHe went straight home without explanation.\n\nThat was 4 years ago and I have spoken to him exactly once since then, at a party. He seemed quite friendly and warm towards me until I asked him what had happened that day he left me in the pub. As soon as I mentioned it he walked away and refused to talk to me again.\n\nHe won't accept my friend requests on Facebook or respond to my texts and our mutual friends have no idea what's going on.\n\nI've moved on now. If he doesn't want to talk to me then fair enough. I'll stop trying to figure it out. I would just like to know what happened because it's a total mystery to me. Even our mutual friend who was also there at pub that day says he doesn't remember what the conversation was about or why he reacted that way.\n\nEdit: Okay, most of you seem to think he was either screwing my girlfriend or he was totally gay for me. The more I think about it, the easier it is to believe that either one of these scenarios could be true. In any case, it doesn't really matter now. It was years ago. I have a new best friend now and I'm married to the girl of my dreams. (Additional edit: I married a different girl to the one I was seeing 4 years ago) Thanks for your input, guys!\n\nTo whoever bought me Gold, [thank you!](http://img.pandawhale.com/91997-I-love-gold-gif-Goldmember-Mik-o3Xn.gif)\n\n**Okay, guys. You've worn me down.** I'm going to try speak to my friend and the mutual friend and get to the bottom of this. I'll post the results. Please be aware that I may not get instant results (or indeed any results at all) so watch this space.\n\n**Update 1)** I tried contacting the mutual friend but he appears to be unreachable. According to a couple of my friends he moved to Wales to study at university a couple of years ago and kind of lost touch with everyone here in England. Also, he isn't on Facebook or Twitter or anything and no-one seems to know what he is doing. \n\nMy mysterious friend (the guy who ditched me at the pub) has either deleted his Facebook or has blocked me. I'm currently in the process of getting his phone number. I've also asked a couple of friends to let him know that I would really like to speak to him. I found out that he's currently engaged *to a girl!* Hopefully I'll get closer to talking to him tonight but it's getting kind of late here and don't think it polite to bother him this late. Perhaps more to follow in the morning.\n\n**Update 1a)** I got my friend's number from another friend. I sent him a Whatsapp message asking him to call me or text me back and that I know it's been a while since we spoke but I'd really love to speak to him and maybe catch up. My phone tells me that he last checked his Whatsapp messages this afternoon. Like I said earlier, it's getting pretty late now so I'm going to assume that he's asleep. And on that note, I'm going to bed (I've got to wake up at 5am). Fingers crossed I have some news in the morning. Night night :)\n\n**Update 2)** Good news, everyone! My friend (who, to avoid confusion, from here forward we'll call **R**. The mutual friend can be **N**) replied to my message. He said he was working until 3.30pm today and will give me a call this afternoon. The message sounded pretty friendly too. It started with \"Hey man!\" and he added a smiley, which I think makes it look promising. It's been over two years since I last spoke to him so I'll have to be careful how I approach the conversation later on. Obviously, I'll update you later on how that goes. Getting a bit nervous now.\n\n**2:04pm GMT** - Starting to get really nervous about talking to my friend when he calls in a while. You guys have no idea how close I came to not texting **R** and just pulling off the longest, most elaborate and most suspenseful \"tree fiddy\" gag in reddit history instead. Don't worry, I wouldn't do that to you, reddit. I just hope he does call me like he said.\n\n###WARNING! BIG ASS WALL OF TEXT AHEAD!\n\n**Update 3) (or 4 or 5 or whatever)** I just had a very illuminating conversation with **R**. We had a lovely catch up. He's getting married in September and asked if I wanted to come along. He now runs his own business and DJ's at the weekend... But you don't want to hear about that!\n\nHere we go:\n\nSo, collectively, Reddit decided that he was either banging my girlfriend or he was in love with me. Well, the truth is actually a mixture of both.\n\n**He wasn't banging my girlfriend. He was in love with her!** I think one or two of you actually suggested this but weren't taken very seriously. Give yourselves a round of applause. You were spot on!\n\nYou see, what happened is this. Before I started dating my ex (let's call her **P**), **R** had a huge crush on her. We were all at school together but we didn't really know each other then. The problem was, he never said anything about it to anyone. So when I started dating her after college, he felt really envious towards me. I mean, this guy was seriously head-over-heels in love with her but he never did anything about it. I got to know him in college and we became best friends and then when **P** came back on the scene and me and her started dating after **R** and I left college he started to slowly resent me.\n\nWhen we all started hanging out together, it got incredibly hard for him to watch me and her together as a couple. He kept it all bottled up inside.\n\n**N**, the mutual friend never actually knew about this but he did know \"something\" was wrong and that **R** really wanted to tell me about it. He said \"ask\" but \"tell\" would have been more accurate.\n\nThe day **R** met me in the pub, he thought he was ready to tell me but he lost his nerve at the last minute and just couldn't do it. He didn't want to risk splitting us up and making his best friend unhappy. **Even though he wanted so much to be with her, he just couldn't betray his best friend.** I do think he should have told me that day instead of just cutting me out of his life altogether, but he was obviously hurting so much that he felt that it was his only option left at the time. I kinda feel bad putting it on the internet but this is reddit and I'm just an anonymous stranger so I suppose that makes it a bit better. I just hope he isn't a redditor.\n\nAfter he left me in the pub that day, I sent him a few texts and facebook messages over a few months but then kind of gave up.\n\nOn the phone, he said if I had sent him a friend request or a text in the last year or so, he would have responded. The reason he hasn't been in touch lately is because he assumed I was mad at him. He was so relieved to finally get all of this off his chest.\n\nMy ex did end up cheating on me with a different guy, but that's a whole other story.\n\nSo, we're friends again thanks to you guys. Now we can start building bridges. Am I mad at him for totally ditching me for years? Hell no! He handled it the only way that made sense to him at the time. I respect that and any hurt or confusion he may have caused is long gone. Was I mad at him for being in love with my girlfriend? Please. What, I'm going to be mad at someone for having feelings for another person? Come on. Besides, the way I see it: he saw her first, he just didn't do anything about it.\n\nThanks for pestering me to resolve this with your *OP pls!*'s and the like. Thanks, Reddit. You're awesome.\n\nI'm sorry this story didn't have a more exciting ending but that's life. Stories in real life usually have boring endings. Thanks for sticking with me for this long.\n\n**TL;DR** Friend was totally gay for my girlfriend, not me.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, it's Friday; I just finished work and now I'm going to get very, very drunk.", "gilded": 2, "created_utc": "1401966787", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4699, "controversiality": 0}

We had drifted some times before, and there would be weeks to months we wouldn't speak because we were busy, which was normal maybe 1 month out of the year. It wasn't till later when he ended up fucking up stuff with another close friend of mine that I ended up questioning everything. The more he came around the more I ended up distancing from him, and just not wanting to associate with the fucked up stuff he'd done, especially to people he called \"friends\". He removed me from games, social media, everything I could think of eventually because I just never wanted to speak with him again.

Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Taken from elsewhere\n\nWhen I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms. She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet. His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name. Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.\nJoe didn't give a shit. He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either. Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom. His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\". His name was now legally Adam Adams. Why? All so he could be first in the lunch line.\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe, my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it. He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember. But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage. The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me. Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son. This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on. She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does. My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story. She does. Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words). While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out.\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved. After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad. I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story. When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her. She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy\"\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again. But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one.\n\ntl;dr: Friend's mom is an overprotective bitch, I get mad at her for being an overprotective bitch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402012957", "subreddit": "teenagers", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Miss Patricia had this petite, hourglass figure going on, but I didn't mind her too much; I was pretty sure I was going to pass, I was doing pretty well for myself in her class and it was an easy subject. That one time she asked me to meet her in the faculty office was a bit sketchy, but yeah okay, it's not like a teacher shouldn't talk to her student, right? So after class I head off to the floor of the usually-busy-office.\n\nIt turns out there wasn't anyone in there but her, which was weird for that time of day. She tells me to sit down in a chair opposite of her. I go along with it and she starts to ask why I make up strange rumors of me and her having a sexual relationship, and how inappropriate it would be. Me being confused as fuck thinks that I was being accused of something I didn't do and didn't get the hint at first. It wasn't until she was going on and on about how \"forcing myself unto her was the filthiest thing she could imagine doing\" did I get it.\n\nI got up and locked the door to the office and ripped off her blouse. Didn't even bother with the bra strap, I just ripped that fucker right off too. buried my face in those soft, firm breasts and had my tongue fondle her nipples. She kept moaning about how she's been giving me As all semester and how I'd be giving her a D soon. I told her to shut up as I hurriedly unbuttoned my pants.\n\nShe hopped up on her table and hiked her skirt up. She wasn't wearing any panties so I knelt down and gave her wet cunt a short 15-minute french kiss. I was rock hard by then and I got up and started to enter her with my raging donger. Even after getting lubed up with my spit and her precum, she was still so tight. There was something weird about it though, her skin didn't feel as soft as it should have. A guttural roar escaped her lips, and she started to claw at my back in ecstasy, and begged me to say her name. I whispered in her ear \"Patricia!\" and looked at her as she came, but all I could see were bright, green eyes and sharp teeth. I suddenly noticed she was 500 feet tall and looked like she was from the paleolithic era. I thrust harder and harder, and finished in that scaly pussy. We dress up and I walk back out the door.

{"body": "This sounds like part of an old joke I know.\n\nA man from Detroit, down on his luck decided to pick up his life and move to New York. Through his work he made many new friends and decided to host a party to celebrate his new found workforce family. The only issue he had was deciding on a theme. Rock stars has been done, so has favorite celebrity's. Finally after much deliberation he decided on hosting a party where all entrants had to come dressed as an emotion.\n\nThe big night finally came and going all out to impress his new friends he even hired a butler to work the door. As the invitees slowly arrived he was dismayed with the lack of initiative in the outfits. Several people arrived dressed all in red portraying the emotion of love, and several more dressed in green saying they were dressed as envy.\n\nLate in the evening the butler was faced by three moderately intoxicated men wishing to enter the party who appeared to be of middle eastern decent. Much to the butlers surprise the first two men were almost naked. One had a pear hanging of his manhood, and the other had his dick laying in a bowl of custard. The butler looked at the group with apprehension and while fairly bemused by the sight, politely insinuated that they were in the wrong place. \n\nNo no no! Came the response. We are here for the emotions party! You see, I am deep in dispair, and my friend is fucking disgusted.\n\nThe third member of the group who was unusually tall and dressed modestly compared to the other two  had remained silent until this point. Suddenly he spoke addressing the butler directly.  Hey, do you have tree fiddy?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402051557", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not sure why, but that reminded me of the first time I flew. I was around twenty at the time.\n\nI was in my seat for some time, minding my own business when I noticed that the flight attendant was staring at me again. I've noticed her ever since I boarded the plane, she was the one greeting people as they entered. The flight attendants wore the same uniform, but this one had her skirt hitched up a little higher than the rest, the blouse a little bit tighter than usual. She actually looked a little flushed now that I think about it.\n\nShe came over and asked me if I wanted anything to drink, a coffee please. She's sorry but if it were alright, would I accompany her into the back to pick out what to put in my coffee? She gives me this little smile and the fuck me look already. I oblige, squeezing past the row of seats. I ask if the coffee is hot, and she replies \"Yes, very.\"\n\nShe shuts the curtain and clips it into it's frame. She gets up onto the counter and pull me in close for a deep kiss. She's not even wearing any panties and the hem of her skirt is up around her waist already, her tight little pussy just dripping with precum. I kneel down and give it a quick 15-minute kiss. There were entire minutes I didn't come back up for air, and her legs were wrapped around my neck keeping me in a pussy-eating headlock.\n\nShe quietly moans and writhes and pulls her blouse open, fondling her nipples which were hard in the cool cabin air. Take off your pants, she says. I do so and take out my cock, hard from the minute I got up from my chair. She pushes me onto one of the seats there and gets on top of me. I enter her with a quick slide, and I don't know how but she got even more wet.\n\nShe puts her tongue down my throat while bouncing up and down on my cock. She bites playfully hard while ramming that pussy down. It wasn't that hard, but I wondered why I tasted a little blood. I didn't care though, her cunt was so tight it felt as if my dick had some sort of fleshlight noose around it that was cutting off bloodflow, but that just made it more sensitive and more erect.\n\nI push her face off mine, and immediately see something's wrong. She's reaching back, and putting her hair down, but she doesn't have hands. She's got claws. I don't even know how, but I never noticed that she was a 500-foot monster from the paleolithic era. She fucked me harder and harder, we both came. I went awkwardly back to my seat and pretended to sleep for the rest of the flight. I guess it was okay.\n\n10/10 would fly again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402057100", "subreddit": "Unexpected", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was born and raised in North Dakota. Back when I was in HS, a group of us would research murders that occurred out in the county. We would then go out to find the scenes and film the exploration at night (this was about two years before Blair Witch) It was something to do while we got wasted on shitty beer and teenage bullshit. Eventually we ran out of places to go (ND = few people, few murders) and got really good at finding abandoned rural farmsteads by driving dirt roads and looking for the signs. Rut roads, deliberate tree groves, and old mailbox posts were common markers. We were out looking when we spotted a tree grove that was out of place (sure sign) and drove through the field and discovered an old (but not too old) house. It had padlocks on the outside doors that were knocked off pretty easily, we dispatched of them and entered the kitchen. There were six of us, all with flashlights, and we lit up the kitchen/dining area fairly easily. The table was the initial thing you noticed and it was strange because of how normal it looked. It was set for a meal and not a bowl was out of place. Only thing was, we'd been in dozens of these houses and place setttings were a first. Especially unbroken ones. As we investigated the area we found the fridge had the disgusting remnants of a full stock, and the cupboards were full of canned and dry foods. This was also a first. One guy found mail on the counter from early June 1978 and another found a creepy ass TV guide in the living room with UFO's on the cover. All the family photos were hanging up. Mom, Dad, Bro and Sis in their 1970's glory. Furniture was dusty, but in good condition. Closets were full. Everything was totally normal. Which was super abnormal. As we dug around the house, we all started to realize that this house had not been moved out of, it had been straight up abandoned. Imagine locking the door to your house and never coming back. That's the state this house was in. Complete unplanned departure. We went upstairs and split into three pairs to check out the three rooms. Ours was the closest and obviously it was the younger boys room, I can't describe what it looked like too well because almost right away from the hall, we heard the most fucking terrifying scream I've ever had the misfortune of hearing. We went running into the hallway and were all yelling questions at each other at the same time. After a few (really long) seconds the two screamers caught their breath and said \"you have to go in and see.\" Walking down the hall and through the doorway, I prayed I wouldn't act like a pussy in front of my friends. I shouldn't have been concerned because the others were as scared as I was. The room itself opened up to the left of the doorframe and centered on the right side of the room was a queenish sized bed. Propped up on pillows, with the blanket drawn to the waist, arms on top of the blanket, and worst of all, head turned slightly so it was looking you straight in the eyes when you entered the room was a life sized porcelain doll. Snow white skin, jet black hair, cold dead eyes. The dead eyes lit up with our flashlights. Like she was waiting for us. If the head hadn't been turned I could excuse it, but it was turned. Ready for when we walked in. Ready for 20 years. Still not sure why but I said \"What do you want from us??\"  Just trying to be funny I guess.  And then as if by magic the doll spoke to us and said \"I need about tree fitty.\"  It wasn't a doll at all.  It was the god damn loch ness monster!  I shouted \"I ain't givin you no tree fitty monster!\" Hasty fucking exits were made down the stairs and into the car.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402059804", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well i can finally share something from my years. This happened when i decided to spend the night at my friends house for the first time in about a year since i met him.   \nI went over to my friends house and for most of the afternoon we did yard work(he lived in a country area). Finally it got to about 10 at night and everyone decide to get off to bed and we got the bright idea to sleep in the shed. The shed was not in bad shape but it was not in the best shape either. We were playing halo for a couple of hours until we heard something at around 2. We waited a few minutes for the noise again but the sound never came so we went back to halo. About 2 minutes after we started playing halo something slammed into the side of the shed and we were scared shitless. We tried to keep playing and telling ourselves we were tired but then it hit again. This time it knocked the window out and shattered it. We turned off the xbox and tried to find a place to hide because the house was to far from the shed to avoid whatever was out there. My friend always kept a knife on him that was very very sharp so we tried to find that because there  was nothing to hide behind and we could not find it(later found out that it was behind the TV) so we just covered up in blankets and tried to keep quiet. The next time it hit the shed is when the power to the shed completely fried and we were scared and trying to accept that we might die. We waited in silence for what seem like forever but nothing happened for a while. That was when the door was ripped open and we screamed for help. His parents ran out to see what was wrong with all the noise and to our surprise(and relief) there was nothing there. We were walking back to the house when both me and my friend turned behind us and saw the glint of something in the dark. Above that glint was eyes the pierce into your soul and when we look into those, they disappeared. We went to his room to sleep the night safely in the house when we walk into his room and see the same eyes staring at us from the bedroom window. We just try and ignore it as being very tired and we never saw them again. We still don't know what attacked the shed and what was making those eyes but all i know is that i am never going to that piece of land again.  \nAlternate ending: We try and ignore it as being very tired but then suddenly the eyes move inside the room and some type of creature whispers into my ear \"i need bout tree fiddy\".  \nNot the best at writing stores so please excuse any errors.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402066688", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

(was interested in the nessie but it wasn't available)\n\n\nWhat I'm considering: \n\n\n1) Churchill crystal - I'm kinda interested in trying drop decks since I already have my topmount ripple ridge. I'm open to other topmounts still though.\n\n\n2) Original freerides - it's in their name so I guess so.\n\n \n3) Arbiter 36 - a lot of you guys are saying it's good.\n\n4) baffle - seems good.\n\n\n5) Commet greasehammer - again, i've seen it's name \ncome up in the subreddit.\n\n\n6) max dubler - I'm not sure about the other madrid boards that I've listed down. Kinda sure on this one I guess.\n\nI was also interested in earthwing boards but sadly they were out of stock from where i'm buying. Nelson boards are not available as well. \nHave anything to say about these? Am I leaving a board out? I am a beginner. I just know how to balance, push, and foot break. I'm trying to learn \nto do 180's on my ripple ridge on flat ground as of the moment. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, some rayne decks and jet decks are available as well. \n\nfor rayne - fortune, piranha, vendetta, future killer, vandal, darkside (they look promising but they cost a lot compared to the others.) \n\nJet - I know that the seller sells jet decks but i'm not sure which ones are in stock. These are the list of boards on their page. syndicate, soul shredder, machine, potato, hot potato, banshee, vulcan, tomahawk, ozan, youth brigade, revolver, sergio, wrath, AFB, fernando, shred sled, step sister, solution, and cool kick.\n\nI recently found out that landyachtz and bustin decks are also being sold.

At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward. And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.    \nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward. So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, Thehealeroftri, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\"    \nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"    \nEveryone in the hall heard. The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.  \nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.  \nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"  \nWat.    \nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying.  \nA few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.  \nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.  \nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered. I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.  \n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her. Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"  \nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her. She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"  \nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\" I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.  \nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear. This is great.  \nIt slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time. After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life.  \nWe're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\"  \nI personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time. Then she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\" The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\"  \nShe says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.  \nI stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.  \nAs for my psychology project, I never did get it done, and instead dropped the class because of the terrible memories it had given me. To this day I hate reading about Psychology in general.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402071202", "subreddit": "Austin", "score": -6, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Went on a date with a friend's cousin. We had made plans to meet at an outdoor mall to walk around and see a movie after dinner. It got awkward for me the moment she arrived, with another lady. I saw the both of them walking up to me and just got that strange feeling in your gut when you're trying to figure out what the fuck could be going on. So we all say hi to one another and she introduces the apparent third wheel, her mother. *Oh god are you fucking kidding me right now?* We get to talking, me and her mother, having the standard back and forth conversation one would have with some one after just meeting them. About 15 minutes pass by of us all walking together and I haven't gotten the chance to talk to the person I was having the date with, hell the only time we really even made eye contact was when we said our hello's. Then the mother finally spoke some words I wanted to hear, and I quote, \"Well I'm going to take off, it was really nice meeting you SinaSyndrome. You two have fun on your date now!\". *Thank you my lord and fucking savior.* Then she continues, \"But SinaSyndrome just make sure you watch yourself around my daughter. My husband is a police officer and if anything happens to her, your ass is on the line. I'll be doing some shopping here so I'll be around, oh and the movie starts at 7:30 so don't be late!\" *Holy fuck do I really even want to date this chick?* \n\nSo she leaves us and we go on our way and begin our so called date. My  date doesn't even make a comment about what just happened so I didn't even bring it up just to make it seem like it didn't bother me. Oh but it bothered me, it bothered me real good. The entire time I was looking over my shoulder to see if we were being watched or followed. \n\nThe date itself wasn't to bad though. She was a pretty cool chick and we had a lot in common. We looked through some shops, went on a Ferris wheel ride, and got dinner. Then we go to the movie. Can you take a guess as to who's standing next to the entrance? *This is bullshit.* The moment I made I contact with her she gave me the strangest look, it gave me the most uneasy feeling. We walked up to her and she asks how the date was going, and if we enjoyed riding the Ferris wheel. *Damn was she really watching the entire date?!* Me being the polite man that I am tell her that everything about the date has been great and that her daughter is very fun to be around. She then says, \"I'm glad to hear that! Well the movie is about to start so lets head in, my husband saved us seats.\" *Okay my friend has to be in on this, I mean we always play pranks on each other but this is just ridiculous!* \n\nWe walk into theater and find our saved seats. Once again I introduce myself and start to chat a bit before the movie started. We were watching The Dark Knight which is already a long movie but it felt so much longer. Half way through the movie my date leans her head on my shoulder... *Oh god, her father is right there!* He instantly notices it and turns to me, which I noticed, making me turn to him. He gave me that same look his wife gave me when we walked up to her in front of the theater. *I need to get the fuck out of here.* \n\nAfter the movie ended we all started walking to the parking lot towards our cars. I don't even recall the conversation we had at this point because all I was thinking about was how bad I wanted to get to my car and bolt out of there. We get to her mom's car first and we all start saying our goodbye's. I shake both her parents hands and turn to my date awkwardly. She sort of stands there for a second smiling in a way that made it seem like she was expecting something. So I decided to give her a hug. Not a bad idea, right? Well she didn't really let go when I did, she actually held on to my waste as I began to pull away. Then we made eye contact, with her arms still around me, and she gives me that big smile again. *What the hell is going on here? Her parents are right there!* She starts to pucker up a bit and closes her eyes. *Shit do I kiss her? Is this normal for her family?!* I decided to say fuck it and wen't for it thinking to myself I would never see this chick again anyways. Man was that a bad idea. I turned back to her parents one last time to say goodbye before walking away. Her father then started to walk up to me, leaned into my ear and whispered, \"Do what it would cost me to put you away?\". I then whispered even softer into his ear, \"About tree fiddy.\" \n\nNo but for reals, they seemed unusually cool with what just happened.

It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402200624", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 35, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The only fight I was ever in was back in 2002, I remember it was in late January because it was right after my birthday; I had just turned 19 years old and I guess you could say I was quite temperamental when I was younger. \n\nAt the time I was working in a factory in Colorado, everyday when you arrived at work you went past the front desk, through the main office hallway, down the stairs, and into the locker room. The lockers were for our lunches, safety glasses, gloves, coats (it was either blistering hot or freezing in that damn factory, the gloves were for protection purposes though.), supplies, etc. \n\nI really hated some of the people at that factory, but the pay was more than worth staying. There were many illegals there, but I didn't mind most of them. There was this one dude that hated me from day 1#, and I honestly don't know why. He tried to fuck with me a lot, we'll call him Eddy. I didn't usually let it get to me, he'd talk shit, I'd talk shit back, and then one of us would just walk away.. That's how it usually would go down.\n\nFor my birthday I bought myself an iPod, this was the original iPod 10gb, it costed me $500.00 without tax. (About ~$670.00 today if you adjust inflation.) I really loved that thing, anyone who can remember that time period knows that A LOT of people wanted one; it could hold roughly ~2000 songs! It really was a big deal at the time before everyone had a minicomputer in their pocket. \n\nI wasn't allowed to use it at work, it was considered too much of a danger because of all the heavy machinery around, I could understand that, so I always left it at home. \n\nOne night before work I got really drunk with some buddies I knew from high school, I woke up at around 6:45am, I had to be at work every morning at 7:00am so I usually woke up around 5:30am to get my day started.. I remember I didn't even change my clothes, let alone eat breakfast. I jumped out of bed and started driving to work, when I got there and into my locker to put on my work shirt and safety equipment, I realized I still had my iPod in my pocket! \n\nStupidly, I decided to put it in my locker instead of keeping it in my pocket.. When I went back to get my lunch later in the day it was gone. I started asking around work at my lunch break, luckily one person told me he saw Eddy with an iPod earlier in the day.. I knew it had to be mine. \n\nAfter work when 1st shift was leaving, I stood in front of Eddy's car waiting for him. When he walked up he looked a little surprised, that's when I said, \"I know you stole my iPod fuckhead.\" He asked me, \"What proof do you have?\" I was too pissed at that time to even care about my job, I just ran up and punched him. \n\nNow Eddy was quite bigger than me, I was actually surprised I punched him. I knew I had to keep hitting him to make sure he didn't get me. I remember I ran up again in the face, and then started going for his abdomen. I just kept hitting him because of how pissed off I was, and to my surprise, I was winning. After hitting him roughly ~30 times, and him hitting me roughly ~10 times, he was down. I went through his pockets, and there it was, my iPod. \n\nI was so happy I got it back, I could tell it was mine because of the songs on it, unless he happened to get one and put the same exact ones on it, haha. I started walking away to go back to my car, and then, *BAM!* I underestimated his strength.. He got back up and bashed me in the back of the head.\n\nI fell to the ground... I tried to get back up on all-fours, but he kicked me in the stomach and I was back down.. I quickly tried to turned over onto my stomach and put my arms up to protect myself, but that's when I saw it..... \n\nMy coworker was this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era, and it was standing right in front of me, looking down on me with these big red eyes. It was the Loch Ness Monster! I yelled, \"I got my iPod back, and you got the ass beating you deserved, what do you want from me Monster!\" And the monster bent down and said, \"I need about tree fiddy\" I yelled, \"I ain't giving you no goddamn tree fiddy you Loch Ness Monster! Get your own damn money!\" \n\nAfter that, he ran to the nearest lake and swam away, I never saw him after that.. I will never understand why he needed that damn tree fiddy.

{"body": "It's pretty simple.  Back in the day the lochness monster, we'll call him Nessy, had a good friend.  His friend was the typical rebellious type of teenager, always trying to get Nessy to skip class, or take a pug of the grown-up juice.\n\nEveryday his friend would say \"C'mon Nessy let's go steal candy from the store,\" or \"let's go find some pot.\"\n\n\"No thanks, man,\" Nessy would say, \"I gotta go do homework.\"\n\nNessy was a smart monster.  He knew his friend was on a bad path, but he was his childhood pal.  Nessy couldn't just abandon him because he was going through a rough phase, so he stayed friends and avoided trouble... Until one day.\n\nIt was a warm spring day when Nessy took the phone call that would change his life forever.  He had finished all his homework, and was getting bored with his games.  Video games aren't fun when there's nothing you haven't found.  As he dug through his game crates his cell phone rang.\n\n\"Yo,\" his rebellious friend said, \"I just got some weed.  Come out and we'll smoke it.\"\n\nNessy knew he shouldn't , but his boredom got the best of him.  They both got high for the first time, thus beginning the downfall.\n\nSome people will tell you weed is not a gateway drug.  Those people are wrong, at least when it comes to giant Paleozoic era monsters.  Within no time at all Nessy was smoking all day, every day.  His grades began to slip.  Weed helped him forget the troubles of growing up as a monster in a humans world.\n\nEventually the weed wasn't enough.  Nessy turned to harder things.  First alcohol, then pills and any hallucinogen he could get his hands on, then the one that eventually kills anybody dumb enough to try it.  He was hooked on Heroin.\n\nRelationships crumbled around him as the drug became his world.  Every waking moment was devoted to scoring enough dope to take reality away.\n\nEverywhere he went he'd disguise himself.  Humans were more likely to give some change to a beggar of their own kind, rather than a beggar that's a giant monster.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy,\" he'd say.  They only rarely handed it over, though.  They never said anything but , \"no\", followed by anger at the realization that he was a giant Paleozoic area breast.\n\nNobody ever asked \"why?\"  Why do you need tree fiddy?  Nessy wanted help, he really did, if only someone was attentive enough to notice.   Then he met someone new.\n\nIt was an elderly man, not the type you'd expect to help a monster as big as a two story house.\n\nThe jig would go as it always did.  Nessy would disguise himself as a human and put himself in just the right position to ask it.\n\n\"I'll need about tree fiddy,\" he'd say.\n\nThe old man went to say sure, then realized who it was.  \"Goddamn Loch Ness monsta, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nNessy hung his head in despair.  Then the man's mood shifted and he said something Nessy didn't expect.\n\n\"But, son, are you ok?\"\n\nIt was the first time Nessy had heard that question.  The shock hung with him.  Did someone actually care about him?  Would this man be the one to help him straighten out his life?  He clung to that hope, unsure of how to respond.\n\n\"I.... I need...\" Nessy said, trying to hold back his tears.  \"Please, help me.\"\n\nThe old man took pity, extending his hand to help.  \"We need to get you all cleaned up.\"\n\nAs they trudged towards the old man's house the old man kept asking him things.\n\n\"What drugs?  The rehab is gonna need to know.\n\nI'll need to know your birthday.\n\nI'll need to know your name.\n\nI'll need...\"\n\nHe stopped, and turned towards Nessy.  His eyes shone with sympathy but his lips cracked a smile.\n\n\"about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it was about that time Nessy noticed the old man wasn't an old man at all! It was a 6 foot tall human from the modern area who had fronted Nessy some cash.\n\n\"Well goddamn it, Mark!  Can't you see I'm trying to get you your tree fiddy!\"\n\nAnd that's why Nessy is always looking for tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402206700", "subreddit": "AskScienceFiction", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I remember back then, me and a couple classmates were talking about what it would be like if trees could talk, or if somebody had the ability to talk to trees. We meticulously tried to simulate a scenario where a fellow schooler would be walking through the campus and come across one of the various trees we had at the school, and the exchange they would have. \nWe imagined ourselves inside the geometry class learning on how to stab your notebook with a compass, while the open door permitted all the sounds of outside: the birds chirping, the occasional student walking or running, the staff having a chat, or the squirrels fucking around in the trees. And then we hear random, context-less chatter emanate form the door. Foreign as it was, it did not immediately peak our interest until it grew louder, more aggressive, more hateful, more politically incorrect.\nAs the arguing grew more intense, our class began to shuffle in our seats, occasionally glancing at the door, as if trying to find the source of the bickering. Even our teacher would stutter and pause a bit, mostly from the insults and pervasive language blessing her ears. It would grow to the point to where we wanted it to end, to stop the forced ear lobotomy that was the battle between plant and man. We prayed for it to stop, for the student to walk off or for both of them to shut their mouth(s?).\nWell, it soon did. But instead of the stomping of feet, or rustle of leaves we heard the sound of a match striking, and burning, but the burning could not hide the screams. The tree was burning, screaming as the leaves became  ambers, and its hide darkened to a jet black. We did not need to see to know of the tree's fate. To know of its suffering and its cries for mercy and water. It went on for hours and hours. Even beyond school hours, noone dared made a move out of their chairs. Then the scream became a distraught whimper, and soon a dead silence. When we finally grew the ill founded courage to go outside and look, all we saw was a boy standing in front of a black, jagged pole. With embers still dotting the inside of the burnt, lifeless husk, we could only hear  one sentence muttered by the boy. \n\"I needed tree fiddy, cheap asshole.\"\n\nAnd that's why me and my friends think it's a bad idea if trees could talk. Besides , they would bitch about pollution all the time and yell at humans like a homeless Vietnam War-vet would against Asians.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402224131", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

The woman from Malaysia was initially scheduled to speak but cancelled her speech for unknown reasons (probably the inevitable barrage of questions). \n\nSo, even though the speech was cancelled a few of us were still interested in picking their brains on the subject. After the second day of speeches a big group of us all went down to the \"5 O'Clock Somewhere\" bar inside the Casino for some drinks and sure enough they were both there. A good friend and I got a table next to theirs and naturally they were already lecturing on the craziness surround MH370 and their colleagues at KLIA. \n\nApparently, what they were being told first-hand by their colleagues out of KLIA  took a complete 180 after 24 hours into the disappearance. I guess it was some corrupt gag order that forced a couple controllers to stop answering calls/texts/emails. Of course, the Malaysian woman saved everything that was communicated to her right off the bat.

I need to continue reading and finish that book finally. As a last minute question before going to the registers I asked if I should get it and I remember the friend I was with at the time said, almost jokingly, but she's a pretty honest into metaphysical kind of things also (we made Ouija work!), said, \"Oh, yeah get it and read it so you can know everything.\" That's pretty much what that book is about, as well as your story. Another theme in it is how this search is not isolated in its desire to be solved, nor isolated from others that influence the story or yourself influencing others in their search. Sorry if that is convoluted. But the objective and subjective realities blending are what drive that synchronistic experiences.\n\nAnd this story seems only half told and I know I would love to hear more of your explanations!

So I'm just sitting there by myself checking out all of the decor on the walls. There's a bunch of pictures of the old Chinese man, and who I assume is his wife, in different parts of the world. I see pictures of him and his wife in All kinds of places like Colorado, Ireland, Scotland and a ton of other places. Then His wife from the pictures comes out from the kitchen and asks for my order. I eat a great meal, Mongolian beef and some chow mein. Since I'm the only one in the place I start up a conversation with the old couple. I ask them about all of their travels and they tell me all about it and some of the craziest stories I've ever heard. So after about two hours of great chats and a delicious lunch, I ask for the check. The wife then goes to the register and comes back with my check. I look at it and all it says is that I owe tree fiddy. I knew there was something off about his wife and that's when it hit me, she was 3 stories tall and of the Paleolithic era.

So anyway, it was a muggy night in winter, and me, my brother and my pa were sitting on our porch looking out over the countryside, bored as all fuck. I'm the only one in the family with an education past high school, so the rest of my family aren't exactly intelligent. I decided to walk inside and turn on our TV with shitty reception, and watch some cartoons (I was 7 at the time, my brother was 16), and then I heard some ruckus on the porch. I walked quietly back and my brother and pa were nowhere to be found! I'm horrified, being a 7 year old I thought they were eaten by coyotes (they can get pretty vicious) or koalas or whatever. Instinctively I ran over to our barn where all the animals slept, and lo and behold my brother is curled up into a ball and sobbing his eyes out. \"What's wrong Eddie?\" I ask. In his thick bogan accent he replied: \"they dun got im' MentalBlanc, they *dun* got im'...\" I'm as intrigued as I am horrified now, and open the gates to the animal pen, I look, in shock, as these coyotes are playing with my pa's slumping body. I can't even scream, but after what seemed like an eternity, my pa shot up, clutching his shotgun and *BANG, BANG, BANG!* he killed the three coyotes in quick succession. I yelped, and embraced him. \"Oh my god, pa I was so scared ... I really was... Please is there anything I can do for you?\" It was at about this time I realised that my pa was a 100 foot crustacean from the Triassic era. \"Uh yeah, could I have about tree fiddy?\" I looked him dead in the eye and yelled: \"DAMNIT MONSTER, I AIN'T GIVIN YOU MY TREE FIDDY!\"\n\nEdit: grammar", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402297399", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "September 18, 2028, a mass virus was sent all over the world. People were flooding into hospitals left and right. The virus hijacked the victims' brains and affected them in the same way a stroke would. If untreated, caused complete shutdown of the brain.\n\nSeptember 20 was my first day on the job. 8 years of med school plus the 4 for viral training, and I was just happy to be out.\nHospitals wouldn't take just any doctors anymore, because normal injuries were little to none. The only reason anyone came in was because of the viruses. In early June, Syrian software developers created a virus of the brain, malware if you will, that could be manipulated to do just about anything to a person's body. \n\nMy first patient was a small girl, 4 years old, and had just begun preschool. She was watching TV when the signal was transmitted, and lost all forms of speech, including her hands, as she had been paralyzed waist down. \n\nWe performed a few scans, to see where the virus had made its home in her brain. We started off with the two basic tests, MRI and VBS (Viral Brain Scan), and noticed that the virus was in two different places in each scan, which was highly unusual. We ran more and more tests, and each time, the virus had moved. There was only one option, and that was attempting the procedure on the one spot the virus had shown itself in multiple times.\n\n\nWe put her to sleep (as if she wasn't basically already) and wheeled her to the OR.  I began the procedure, by drilling a hole in the skull ( it was unreachable any other way) and stuck in the tube. We watched on the monitor as the tube passed into the outer tissue of her brain into almost the very center, where it stopped. We began inserting antivirus through the tube, and began playing the waiting game. 10 minutes went past, and we began testing her again. The virus was still showing up in various parts of her brain. \n\n30 minutes later, we woke her up and brought her family in to see her. She had begun to talk again, but was not going to live long. She talked to her parents, told them the things she was hearing, the lights she saw. Her parents turned to me and said, \"How long does she have?\" \n\nI replied, \" A-a.......about.........\" I mumbled, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tree fitty.\"\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402302319", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Telling her that she was worthless and would never amount to anything. He also told her that she would be nothing without him and that her life wouldn't even be worth living.

Some customers actually got up and left the restaurant in disgust.\n\nWe finish making their sandwiches, but when it came time to pay, he didn't have enough money. He then told her to give the remaining amount, but she told him she had forgotten her purse at home. He got really upset and started shouting profanities at her and telling her how he would beat her if she didn't give him the rest of the money needed for the sandwiches.\n\nAnother guy in line walked up to him in defense for the woman and they got into a fist fight. Unfortunately, the abusive guy got the upper hand and beat up the guy pretty hard. At this time, one of my co-workers hit the switch to call the police to get in. Other people tried to intervene, but the abusive guy ended up being able to fend for himself and fled before the police got there.\n\nThe woman was crying and we felt bad for her so we decided to give her the sandwiches for free, but she refused saying she wouldn't feel right about it and should at least pay for it.\n\nAnother customer felt bad for her and decided to pay for the rest.

{"body": "Yesterday was my 19th birthday, so me and my buddies decided to celebrate by going to the bars at my college campus (minimum age is 19). I usually don't drink too much, but, since it was a special occasion, I decided to get really *******\t wasted. We pregramed a lot before the bar, since it's difficult to obtain alcohol in a bar when none of us are 21, plus it's really expensive so I wasn't trying too hard to get my friends with fake IDs to buy me some. I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my *******\t mind.\n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this really sexy chick dancing by herself. Being drunk as ****\t , I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance sexy? Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up grinding hard/making out a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes.\n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated. We were making out a lot on my bed, and we took off each others shirts and things were really escalating. I had her panties off, and I was starting to think me losing my virginity was a sure thing. I could tell she was really into it. She said \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". I figured she meant me going down on her, and me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\". Then the question came: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"I aint givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!

I would go over to my best friend's house everyday after school. Lets call him Tony. Tony was from Italy and moved to the United States in 2004. But every single day since we met we would hang out after school. I would love going over because his mom cooked amazing real Italian meals that has forever ruined my palate for any Italian cuisine not made by her. \n\nThe World Cup was just beginning and we had both been cheering on our respective countries. I was rooting for Germany because that's where my mother was from, and he was obviously rooting for Italy. Both of our countries seemed to be unstoppable so we made a friendly wager for who would go further in the World Cup.\n\nThen came the tragic day when Italy and Germany played each other. Italy had won and I was devastated. I told Tony I would go double or nothing on the final match and he agreed. \n\nWell, the final did not go any better due to Zinedine Zidane's famous headbutt and Italy had won the World Cup. It was time for me to pay up so I reached for my wallet, but alas it was no where to be found. I shrugged it off hoping Tony would forget until later. \n\nImpatiently, Tony exclaimed, \"Lets go, I need something.\" I played dumb and asked, \"What do you need?\" Tony looks at me dumbfounded and exclaims, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Tony was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam away into the distance.\n\nTo this day I am bitter about Germany losing to Italy. It only made it worst that Italy won the World Cup that year and then eliminated Germany again the next World Cup.\n\ntl;dr: Never bet on Germany versus Italy because Italy always seems to find a way to beat Germany.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402424227", "subreddit": "secretsanta", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was in the tenth grade when a new girl moved to my school. I remember when I first saw her, as I went to a small school and getting a new student was kind of big deal. I was walking into school like usual, when I saw her at the office. She looked pretty normal to me in every way possible. Completely average in every way possible, absolutely nothing to set her apart.\n\nLater that day we had out first class together. We were in the same math class. She sat beind me a few seats and slightly to the left I think. The whole class I kind of felt someone staring at me, and when I turned around I thought I caught her a few times. After class my friend who also noticed confirmed it, the new girl was starring at me for almost the whole class.\n\nAfter that day and the next, I noticed that we had 4 out of 7 classes together. Not unusual for a small school like mine, but by the end of the week she had transferred to every one of my classes. Where ever I went it seemed as if she was there starring at me. She even started to hang out around my locker, even though her's was in another hallway altogether. My friends said she would be around my locked even when I was nowhere around the area.\n\nIt was soon that I started to notice some of my things go missing. Nothing major, just some pencils and notebooks, and a few other small things like that. My notebooks were pretty common, but my pencils i bought on a shopping trip in another state so they were the only ones i knew of in the school. One day in class i noticed the new girl using one of my pencils. I'm a reasonable guy. I figured that since she had to steal my supplies, maybe she couldn't afford her own, so I let her be. But I did start locking my locker at all times, where as i usually only locked it at the end of the day.\n\nThe missing supplies then stopped, and the girl kept using the same pencils and notebooks that she took from me. Everything was the same as it was before, except for the girl starring at me in class. Then one day I got a phone call. At first I thought no one was on the other end, until I heard breathing. I asked a few times who it was, and then hung up. This happened a few more times throughout the day, and even more the next day. One the third day, I was in the cafeteria eating with my friends by the window like usual, when my phone rang. Once, again no one was answering me on the other end. I was yelling at the person when I happened to look out the window and notice the new girl, with her cellphone to her ear starring at me from next to a tree by the street outside. At the same time a car drove past and beeped their horn at a kid on a bike riding on the road right next to the girl. I heard the beep loud and clear though my phone.\n\nI ran outside and shouted at the girl \"What do you want from me?\". She looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my not-so-secret admirer was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed. \nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that.

We were planning on getting some tail, obviously. We went pre-gaming at my bros apartment and got hella buzzed. I put on some more Axe bodyspray and went out the door feeling like a fucking champ. \n\nWe got to the club and the honeys were all over the place. Solids 9s and 10s everywhere. So there me and my bros were, spitting game like fucking bosses. 7 of us went, and within an hour 4 of us were gone home with hotties. It was me, my best bro, and our friend who no one really likes that much and is honestly the ugliest one. But his dad has an Escalade and he borrows it sometimes and we drive around with him so we keep him around.\n\nWe keep sweet talking girls for another 2 hours before one of us gets a catch. My bro that i actually like takes home a solid 6.5. Not what i would have settled for personally, but the place was full of stuck up bitches so he took what he could get I guess. Then i realized I was stuck her with this massive douchbag so I told him I had to unleash a wicked dump that only my home toilet could handle and I went for the door. \nI was about to get a taxi home when i noticed the strip club down the road. The testosterone was still pumping so I figured i would go in for a little bit. I went in and I saw the most beautiful looking creature I had ever seen. I looked at her, she looked at me and we knew it was on. She came up and asked me if I wanted a dance, I said fuck yeah, take me to a private room.\n\nSo there we are in a back room, her grinding all over me. I knew I wasn't supposed to but I was copping a feel and she seemed to be liking it. She danced on me for what seemed to be a long ass time, and I was loving every second of it. Eventually, the song was over so I asked her what I owe her since she didn't ask for payment beforehand. \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that the stripper of my dreams was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed. \nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that.

Big foot? Nakinakigragra, the purple slime beast for the out reaches of the galaxy? nope because though i cant prove it, i'm pretty sure these things don't exist and i generally dont fear things that dont exist.\n\n&gt;Is it completely illogical that the earth was created mature? ie tree created with rings... adam created as an adult...  \n\nNot illogical no, though it does require you to prove that a god does exist, that he is capable of doing such a thing, that he would do such a thing, and that its a moral thing to lie to people like that and a lot of effort to go to do it as well. A lot of things can be logical, if you accept the premises that lead to it, the problem you have though is that i dont accept them, so while logical, to me at least it seems delusional and special pleading.\n\n&gt;Does not the second law of thermodynamics disprove evolution?\n\nNo, earth isn't an isolated system, the sun is bombarding us with vast amounts of energy.  \n&gt;How do you explain a sunset if their is no god?\n\nSee above  \n&gt;Where do you derive objective meaning in life?\n\nThis question has no meaning, simply put, i dont. Its entirely subjective.  \n&gt;If god did not create everything, how did the first single celled organism originate? by chance?  \n\nThats certainly one of the hypothesis put forward for abiogenisis, but at this time, to put it simply, We as a species do not know how life started. Yet.\n&gt;If Evolution is a Theory (like creationism or the Bible) why then is Evolution taught as fact.  \n\nFirstly, Creationism isn't a theory, its a dis-proven hypothesis, the bible at best can be considered historical fiction, which means it too, is not a theory. Evolution is considered fact because, quite frankly its about as close to a fact as science will let anything go. Its not only met its burden of proof it has done so with overwhelming amount of it, coming from numerous different fields, confirmed by all but a very small part of the scientific community which consists almost entirely of ken ham's answers from genesis people who have an agenda.  \n\n&gt;Because Science by defintion is a 'Theory' - Not testable, observable, nor repeatable' Why do you object to creationism or intelligent design being taught in school?  \n\nI wonder where you got your definition from, science isn't a theory, its a process, one which has been used repeatedly for all of recorded history, and its the only method known to actually give accurate accounting of the actual processes it is researching. Its the only way we have of of discovering truth, and we know it works because we have repeatedly tested it, used it to create predictive models, which in some cases are reduncuously accurate. That said, i personnaly only object to creationism and the poorly named intelligent design being taught as if its as valid as science for doing anything, both have a place in the school curriculum. In the Religious studies section.  \n\n&gt;What purpose do you think you are here for if you do not believe in salvation? If there is a purpose to life, i dont know it.  \nI like existing though, so i'm going to keep doing it. for as long as i can.  \n\n&gt;Can you believe in \"the Big bang\" without \"faith\"?\n\nwell no, but thats because of the wording of your question. You dont believe in the big bang, you accept it as the preveliant explanation of the origin of the universe based upon our current scientific knowledge. It is supported by a number of pieces of evidence, and they have not yet reported to have found anything which disproves it.   \n\n&gt;How can you look at the world and not beleive someone created / thought of it? its amazing!!!  \n\nI agree it is amazing, but i wonder how you can look at it and think it has been created, how you can look at some of the parasitic organisms and the way they work and at the almost tortuous way some species kill and think it is the work of some kind of kind supreme being.  \n\n&gt;If we come from monkeys then why are there still monkeys?   \n\nWe didn't come from monkeys, we had a common ancestor, so to put your question into a easier to understand context, If you are descended from your grandfather, how come your cousin still lives?   \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402444152", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

A strong redwood piercing through the stone and hardship that mother mountain gave. I became king of a mountain all my own, soon I was sculpting the mountain instead of it sculpting me. I soon left the mountain, for it was mine and I thirsted for more than that. I headed into the closest town, seeing for the first time a pair of intelligent glimmering eyes other than my own in a pond formed in a bowl of rock on a steep cliff of the mountain. I looked at her, I had never seen a woman before but I knew and even looking back know she was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen. I reached out to her and talked with my eyes, I'd only learned a few words by the time I'd seen her but my message was strong and clear. She approached me and pulled me into a tight embrace. Ripping her shirt so slightly, harming her beauty was beyond anything I could fathom implicating. It was some form of miracle that I managed to ask her \"How much to fix?\" She looked into my eyes with those bright emerald gems and she said \"about tree fiddy\" and that's when I realized that I was hugging a 10 story tall crustacean from the loch ness. \"YOU GODDAMN MONSTER YOU GET YOUR OWN TREE FIDDY\".

{"body": " &gt;&gt;over a belief in its falseness, not over a lack of belief.\n\n&gt;Well,for one could you give me a scenario in which believing something's falseness doesn't translate to a lack of belief? If I believe the Loch Ness monster is not real ,in the common sense,I lack belief in him.\n\nSuppose a coin is flipped and you know it has landed on a face (heads or tails), but don't necessarily know which face.  My believing that it hasn't landed heads up is different than a lack of belief that it has landed heads up.  Given the first case, I would also believe that it has landed on tails.  I could have no belief about it being tails in the second case, though.\n\n&gt;&gt;proof is required to convince someone of something at alll, not that something is better assumed than its falseness.\n&gt;\n&gt;Could you please point to the part where I said that something is more likely then it being false.\n\nI admit that you didn't.  I was trying to interpret the conclusion to be had from your argument as I reconstructed it.  I thought you were trying to say that something is more likely false than true because there are more cases that the thing can be false than true.  Burden would then be on the person to show that in fact that something is more likely true than false by some extra proof.  This is what I thought you were trying to conclude.\n\nAn even larger burden would be to convince someone that something is true when they are uncertain, which is the case for what the burden of proof usually refers to.  But I don't see how your argument addresses that.  I believe that the burden of proof rests on the person making the assertion almost by definition: if the person to be convinced is undecided before hand, then they have no reason to believe the thing is true without further evidence *basically by definition of their being uncertain*.\n\n&gt;&gt;But for many other things the reverse should hold, e.g. a die coming up with a number besides three.\n\n&gt;Assuming your die is six sided, I can think of either it falling on 3 naturally or I could posit 7 other hypothetical cenarios where either the die does not ever land or where all numbers magically turn to 3.Which is why I made reference in my first paragraph to hypothetical scenarios not being bound by laws of logic,causality or physics. \n\nOkay, how about a new example.  Suppose I say that the universe contains an infinite number of atoms.  Its falseness would imply that only a finite number of atoms existed.  Besides the arrangement of atoms, both scenarios should be equally numerous in cases.  But the case of infinite atoms must be more numerous because the number of arrangements of an infinite number of things seems to be far more numerous than the arrangement of a finite number of things.  So by your argument, the burden of proof would lie on the person who asserts that the claim is false.\n\n&gt;&gt;Also, why should we assume all outcomes are roughly equally likely? A coin flip is far more likely to land on its head than on its side.\n&gt;\n&gt;I didn't say all outcomes are equally likely, I said in a situation with a lack of evidence for a posited positive claim then it is more likely this claim is false unless of course evidence is brought forward that validates it.Knowing the mass distribution of average coin it is more likely that it won't fall on it's side,this is evidence.\n\nRight, sorry.  I assumed that an implicit part of your argument relied on all specific cases being roughly equally likely.  Without this though, I don't see how you can argue that a statement is more likely false than true just because it can be false in far more cases.  For example, if only one case existed for a way that something can be true, but it was more than fifty-percent likely, than it would be more likely for the statement to be true.  Without prior probabilities (prior to any evidence), almost nothing can be said about what is likely (prior to any evidence).  If this isn't important to your argument, then I'm afraid I don't understand it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402456048", "subreddit": "philosophy", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

He has always been so optimistic about life and genuinely tries to help support his siblings. \n\nJuan shows me many lessons that I, in my 31 years of wisdom, have had yet to truly understand.

Hearing this story from his mother brought tears to my eyes. \n\nThe reason why Juan makes me so sad is not for a bad reason; rather, Juan saddens me because even with his illness, and even with his hardships, this child puts his family before all else. I vividly remember a time that I experienced Juan's compassion firsthand. Working on a house for a neighboring family, the wall fell over me. My legs caught underneath, I cried for help. Juan sprinted to my aid, throwing the stones off of me with determination I had never seen before. Weeping, I grasped Juan closely to my chest, thanking him for saving me.

{"body": "Yea well back when I was in the 5th grade YU GI OH WAS THE SHIT. Everbody on the playground was dueling, except for a few (myself included). We were the broke kids had not even enough for a booster pack. yea man times were so tough I thought I would draw the cards myself and play like that. Kids in the playground were tossing away there \"shit cards\" saying that it had no value. being me I scooped that shit up, and hell atlest I can play right? Wrong these kids tore me apart ever time, laughed at me too. After walking around the playground I noticed a person who was also too broke for them cards. I gave him his first card it was a kuro (that little fluffy thing that is a boss). The kid, lets call him Trevor and I soon became close friends. After a few days of playing 3 card yugioh Trevor had the most brilliant idea ever. He told me that we should go to the kindergartens and try and trade cards with em hustle out some good ones for the scraps we manage to find. I was hesitate at first but then greed kicked down the door. We saw our first target, little John Lewis who's mom had just gotten him a starter pack. We watched and waited for the teacher to leave, then Trevor made his move, at first it looked like he wasn't getting anywhere, but then I see this guy give a 2star  monster for none other than the dark magician! After seeing his success I wanted a bit of my own. Over the next few months we started caking in the cards, the stupid kindergartens didn't know what hit em. Trevor legally changed his name to Tfuzz. Things were going great we were champions at the game the girls loved us, even the teachers feared out yugioh might, we couldn't be stopped. Until that day that greed got to me I want more and more that I lost sight of the original goal to play a fun card game with my new friend, he and I argued a lot more and eventually we split up. The next few weeks was all out war. By now the playground looked more like a war zone with wooden forts all around. People flocked to me for I had the talent of a leader, needless to say so did Tfuzz. The war took its toll on the school classes shut down, no one was safe if you looked at someone funny you were asking for trouble. I was sick of it. I wanted to end it. Then, an idea so sinister to this day I feel shame thinking of it. I ratted out my enemy to the teacher, telling them he \"traded cards\" with the kindergartens and treated them badly. I saw him as the teacher demand he returned all the cards that he \"traded\" to there rightful owners. He gave all but one. It was the fucking kuro card that I had given him, when I saw it I asked \"why..... Why didn't you trade it for a better card?\" he said \"there was no better card to trade it for.\" I fucking wept right there my best friend Trevor despite all the things I did to him was still there for me. I asked if I could do anything for him anything at all. He said there was one thing I could do. Anything for a friend. Trevor put his hand on me and asked I need about three fiddy. That's when I realized that Trevor was a 8 foot tall crustacean from the paleozic era, and God dammit Loch Ness monster you ain't  getting no three fiddy!

I had wanted a Nintendo 64 for more than a year and I couldn't believe I was finally going to have one. My parents, after much convincing, agreed that they would take me there before we left Florida. I enjoyed the rest of my time at Disney World and was looking forward to playing my new N64 when I got back home, pondering if the system would come with free games as well.  \n  \nThe next day had arrived, I was more excited than I had been in as long as I could remember. My dad worked out how to get to the ladies house on a map (this was the days before GPS) and we got everything packed ready to leave Florida, after dropping by her house to pick up my reward of course. A few hours later, we had finally arrived at her house. I got out of the car and nervously walked up to her door, afraid she may not be home.  \n  \nThe door opens, she looks at me with a big smile on her face and she welcomes me into her home for some snacks. I graciously declined and told them that my family is waiting, secretly just trying to get my N64 as fast as possible. She looked at me for a few seconds, as though intense in thought, and then said she would be right back with it. A few minutes later she arrives, but without my console, and I immediately ask her if she lost it or if anything happened to it. I felt selfish, but I really couldn't stop thinking about it.  \n  \nShe proceeded to tell me that she left it in a small safe which requires some money to open. This seemed a little strange to me, and I was starting to get worried, but I asked her how much she needed anyway and hoped my parents had it in the car.

{"body": "One sunny summer day I was was walking to the library listening to \"Where the streets have no name\" on Zune (yes, Zune; and I actually liked the device up until the moment where I dropped it in a lake while eating ice cream, but that's a different story).\n\nAnyway, I'm almost sure I was singing along to Bono at audible levels and was so into it that I haven't noticed that I was crossing a bicycle path. Bicycles are quite silent, especially when one listens to music, so suddenly BANG, this girl tries to swerve around me, loses her balance on the bike and drives straight into bushes. I seemed to be more shocked than she was, she just kept saying \"Owwww, my ass\" while wiping the blood from her face. Turns out the bushes were quite thorny and all. I was expecting she would be really angry with me, but she smiled with all that blood on her face and asked what I was listening to. The smile was the most disarming and most joyful smile I've ever seen. I admitted my weakness for \"The Joshua Tree\" and apologized like ten times stuttering a little and being infatuated by that amazing smile.\n\nI ended up walking her home, she lived 2 minutes from the accident site. She didn't seem to mind at all that I'm the reason her face was all scratched. Her name was Emily. I had to gather all my courage. I asked her out. She said yes, smiled again (oh my God, that smile) and asked me what I want her to wear. I was so stunned by the question that I said \"A Godzilla t-shirt would be cool\", I don't know where I got this ridiculous idea from, I don't even like Godzilla! Stupid, stupid. But she only laughed, promised to do her best and left me there on the porch standing like a retarded Godzilla nerd.\n\nThe time came. Friday. I meet Emily at a restaurant. And the best thing is, she actually has Godzilla t-shirt with this plastic Godzilla. Turns out she visited a hundred second hands in the city to find it. Wow. She's great. We talk and laugh. I can't remember when was the last time I felt so happy. I stare at the boobs a few times and I'm quite excused, because Godzilla is there. I apologize a few times, because her face is all scratched (but it doesn't ruin her amazing smile). She says she doesn't mind. I say that I'm so embarassed, I hate myself for making her crash into the bushes. I ask \"Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?\". This mysterious smile appears and she says nothing. \"What is it?\", I ask. Emily says \"It's nothing, it's just, there is this one thing I need\". I'm all ears. \"Yeees?\" She smiles her beautiful smile again and says \"I need about three fiddy.\" At that very moment I noticed Emily was not a girl, but a giant crustacean from Paleolithic era. \"I ain't givin' you no treefiddy, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!\", I yelled, but she was not listening any more.

{"body": "So just a few weeks ago, school got out. My buddy and I are all excited to be done with high school forever and to enjoy the summer.

So we get all of our fishing gear and we decided to try a new lake. \n\nWe drive for about an hour and when we get to this place, I'm immediately uncomfortable.

Two minutes or so after throwing out his line, my buddy hooks something. I could tell right away that it was something big by the way he struggled.

{"body": "Ok, story time. When I was 18 I decided that I would go work for some distant relatives in the shrimping industry. They offered to pay me $2500 for a couple months worth of work provided that business was good, and being 18 and hearing that someone was willing to pay me for what I thought was going to be easy work I gladly accepted the invitation. \n\nMy first trip was aboard my third cousin's boat it was called \" The Lady Beulah\", because apparently when he purchased the boat back in the late 90's he had a thing for [Beualh Mcgillicutty](http://www.thewrestlingrevolution.com/images/wrestlers/beulahMcgillicutty.jpg) of ECW fame. But anyways, that first trip out was memorable, I got to watch a beautiful sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean, the ocean was calm and there was a nice cool breeze that day. After spending all day with the nets lowered into the water and not catching anything I heard my cousin say \"Shrimps ain't comin' yet\" so we sailed back to port. \n\nAfter getting back to port we (my cousin) decided to wait it out a couple weeks before returning back out into the ocean and I decided to stay with him during this two weeks since none of my other friends back home were doing much that summer. Most nights were spent around a campfire, drinking cheap beer, (My first ever beer was drank during that two weeks, and still to this very day the taste of Natural Light takes me right back to that summer.), so two weeks come and go in an endless cycle of drunk days and hungover days. \n\nSo two weeks later we once again board The Lady Beulah, her hardwood deck seemed to creak underneath my steps in an appreciative manner for some reason this time. I asked my cousin about why the deck was so creaky, and he said something to the effect of needing to be re-treated and something to do with the salt and humidity. Whatever, I was just glad to be back out on the water, we go approximately 5 miles out and let out the trawler nets, after a few hours of trawling the water the nets come up and release an ungodly rain of slimy fishy shrimp. I was instructed that we first have to sort through the load and remove every creature except for shrimp, a task I was not prepared for, I spent my time puking, slipping, falling, and getting pinched by blue crabs. This process pretty much repeats itself  for the next 11 hours, reel in nets, release shrimp on deck, puke, reset nets, repeat. \n\nSo after a long day of absolute misery close to sundown my cousin decided to reel the nets in one last time, except for this time it was different, there was long lizard like tail sticking out of the net, my cousin being the fearless fisherman he is let this creature out on the deck where it landed with a large thump on the deck, it extended it's long neck and stared my cousin straight in the eye and said \"Imma need about tree fiddy for my troubles.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402513496", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

He had actually graduated from high school when he was 17 and moved to the States to go to college.  We decided that for an 18th birthday party we were going to give him the American treatment and take him to a strip club.  Now here's where the trouble starts.  We decided to go with about 5 dudes AND 7 girls to the club...big mistake.  We get to the club and immediately we start getting the \"how can you guys like this stuff\" from the girls that came along.  Well while this is going on, the hottest stripper I've ever seen rolls up to us and we tell her it is our friends birthday.  She lets him motorboat her after dropping a few singles and we pay to get him a lap-dance.  The girls we were with think we're disgusting as we cheer him on and they leave.  Right before he gets to the room he backs out, and I was like \"fuck it, I'll go\".  We get in the room and this chick starts doing her thing, grinding, getting really into it and asks me if I want the \"special\" service. I say hell yea and ask her what it'll cost, because you know...\"special\". She rubbed up against me in the most sensual way possible, her tits gently gliding across my face and she bent over to whisper in my ear \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\".  Now it was around this time that I realized this stripper was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. That Loch Ness Monster had got me, even after I had heard the stories from countless other men.

{"body": "So me and my father were always out fishing, it was our own sort of bonding time, away from my mother and siblings. We lived next to the ocean and we had our own little jetty with an old wood dinghy that grandpa made in his youth when he worked at the dry docks. My father would row and I would sit in the back with my line trailing behind, and we would match the speed of the mackerel. There was never a need for words, we could speak without moving our lips. We understood each other out there on the sheltered archipelago-fishing together. We often caught fish, but we respected the ocean and only took what we needed. This was when I was younger. But as I grew up, the fishing became less frequent, and we drifted apart. When I was old enough to leave home to go get my tertiary education it happened only about twice a year. But we had to go fishing one more time before I left. And we did. Just like in my youth, father would row the boat and I had the line. It was a perfect evening, the sun making the water gleam golden. The gold rippled as father gently swept the oars back and forth, tiny specks of water dripping off the ends, reuniting with their mother-the ocean. I was only just beginning to let out the line, and I already had a bite. Something big. I could feel it, not struggling, but swimming back and forth, not fazed by the new restraint. I looked at father, said nothing, but he understood. He felt it through the boat. He slowed his pace, to lighten my load. I reeled in for an eternity and finally a giant eel broke the surface. I pulled it up to the boat. I spoke to father; do we even need all this fish? But instead the eel answered \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my catch was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

As expected, he didnt return after 10 minutes, so I set out to see where he was. However, when I was walking thought the woods trying to get back to the car, I stumped upon a camp with a tent. I went up to the tent, and asked if anyone was there. A drop-dead sexy girl (She looked around 15 or 16 my age) came out. I tried to ask her if she had saw my dad, but her beauty stunned me. Noticing my shocked expression, she knew what was up and she invited me inside her tent(I think you know where this is going).

{"body": "When I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students. There was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip. She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't. Everyone could hear her, including me. Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about. She gossiped most days but one day was different. I heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom. I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not? It could be fun.\nAnyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with.\nMr. MakeMeASteak..\nI was shocked when I heard this.\nBut stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young. She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess. If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress. After class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work. It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head. As soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, \"Hey Kathy. I heard you talking about me in class...\" she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, \"Oh my god! You heard me say that? I'm so sorry! And-\" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, \"I want to have sex with you too.\"\nShe stopped her sentence and smiled. Then she said, \"Do you know what my rates are?\"\nConfused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in. It turns out she mentioned that she would have sex with me... if I paid that is.\nI decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her.\n\"Alright,\" I told her. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"I'll do it, but I need some money of course. That's just how it works.\" she said. I replied, \"Okay, what do you need?\"\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\nIt was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had tricked me again! \"GODDAMNIT MONSTAH, I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" I said to her as she swam away.\nClass was really weird after that with Kathy gone. I never told any of the students about our encounter but I sure as hell would never mention it to anyway. Ever. Of course I'm telling Reddit, but isn't that what the internet is for?

What's your name?\"\n\nI figured it was a friend/acquaintance who had a new phone and was bored on a friday night but they kept texting me stupid shit. After a bit longer I called the number which they rejected. I called twice more and eventually they answered and it was a kid who sounded about 10 years old. He told me that he couldn't talk and it was his dad's phone and he was going to get in trouble for using it. I asked what his name was and he wouldn't tell me and said he had to go. \n\nClearly some kids fucking around so I wasn't really worried about and I went back to bed. The weird part started the next day. About 11am on the saturday I get this call from the same number which I had saved in my phone under \"fucking kids\" or something similar. I answer it and it's a man asking me who I was and why my number was in his phone. I asked him who he was and why I kept getting messages from him. Apparently his name was \"Frutus\", and he was a reporter for the \"Chump Change News\". Incredulous I asked him to repeat it a few times but he seemed to be dead serious. I was pretty skeptical at this point but I definitely didn't recognise the voice and he sounded like he was in his 40's at least. He wanted to know if I had anything to do with the paper he worked for, had I ever run ad's with them, been involved with a news story they had reported on etc. I told him I had no idea what he was talking about and had no idea why my number would be in his phone other than his son randomly dialling it. I told him about the text conversation and he was really apologetic and seemed very annoyed at his son and said he would be disciplining him after the phone call. \n\nI spoke to him for nearly 10 mins I'd say and the whole time there was never any hint that it could be a joke or anything other than the weirdest fucking conversation I've had. After I hung up I thought for sure that someone was having fun at my expense and there would be some big joke payoff on facebook or something but to this day nothing more has come of it. \n\nI feel like I need to include something about tree fitty, but sadly it's actually a true story.\n\nTL;DR - Got random text messages from a kid.

Owen has found a girl who accepts him for his sloth wielding self, and they have married and have a young child. \n\nWhen I finally reach Owens shoulder, I whisper sweeter nothings into his ear. Until one day, I say my poem, my anthem, my creed, the message I have been waiting to deliver my whole life as a sloth.\n\n\"Prepare yourself,\nPrepare your wife,\nPrepare your children,\nDon't put up a fight,\nPrepare your anus,\nBecause sloth is gonna need about tree fiddy from y'all tonight.\"\n\nAmen.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402548561", "subreddit": "secretsanta", "score": 1, "controversiality": 1}

I usually would be asleep by 8.p.m. nightly because I had to be at work by 5:30 a.m. every morning so I made sure to get my sleep. Anyway. One night I was woken up by a bunch of dogs barking loudly. I was  confused when I woke up because I wasn't in my bed when I woke up. I was actually in the middle of my street, walking. I found out the dogs were barking at me.\nWhile I was walking I realized that I had no control of myself. All I could move were my eyes. I was walking to this wooded bike trail area a block from my house. When I crossed the little bridge on the path to the trail I knelt down on one knee. With two hands on my bent knee I peeked through some trees and bushes and saw a craft of some type. It was ball shaped with no lights but glowed and it landed under these huge power lines that ran the length of my street. As I looked at it a fuzzy opening opened up and two humanoids smaller than me came out.\nThen I was boarding the craft. As I walked into it the two beings followed behind me into it. The craft was kind of cramped and dark. It was dark but you could see like a neon kind of darkness. I bent down and asked where we are going. They \"said\" they are taking me behind the moon. I asked why.\nThey said they couldn't be detected from earth from there. I said OK then we took off. I looked out of some kind of window and saw us leaving the earth. We passed the moon. This took less than 10 seconds. For some reason I wasn't scared at all. I actually acted like I knew them. The next thing that happened was the only time I was really scared. They walked me to a funnel shaped pool filled with a greenish black gel type liquid. The pool had to be 20 yards wide all around. It was set into the floor which was made of some kind of shiny metal. The surface near it was slippery. When we got there I saw something moving in the pool. I inched closer to look into the pool and there in the gel was a loch ness monster.

{"body": "Absolute certainty is an illusion. I am not absolutely certain about nearly anything - perhaps nothing. I am simply a degree of certain about any claim, and once past a certain point I allow myself to believe the claim and to make decisions based on the claim being true or likely true.\n\n-------\n\n* Unconvinced\n\nI remain unconvinced of claims of others about deities.\n\nJust as I remain unconvinced of claims of others about String Theory.\n\nBut at least string theory has some intriguing mathematics that tend to point to it. Theism, for me, has nothing but rather insignificant coincidences (and my incredulity about these coincidences is warranted given that other coincidences have been proven natural in the past).\n\n* True or Likely True\n\nIn contrast, I am convinced of the claims of others about Evolution. I am not absolutely certain, but the evidence, to me, merits belief. And I live my life and make decisions as though it were true.\n\n* Un-Definitive negative\n\nIn contrast to the contrast, there are questions that are unanswerable. Russell's Teapot is the best example. I could search the entire solar system, but I can never be absolutely convinced of its non-existence. All I can be is unconvinced of its existence because of my lack of evidence. Part of this lack is my knowledge that Russell would have been unable to launch a teapot, that he most probably made it up to make a point and that he said he made it up. But can I ever be absolutely certain? I can not. And due to the nature of the claim and the evidence available to us, you can't be absolutely certain either. You could only be convinced of its NOT non-existence - that is to say if you actually found it, you could be convinced that it existed, and convinced that it didn't *not* exist.\n\n* Unknowable\n\nAnd then there are true unknowables. Nonsense things. Asymptotes, Divide-by-zeros, paradoxes, 'nothing', 'infinity', etc. These are consequences of mathematics and philosophy. Mathematicians do have a proclivity to try to delve into the answers of nonsense, and [think they come out with answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCu_BNNI5x4), but when you start with nonsense, you tend to bring nonsense back out with you... Some 'agnostics' seem to claim that deities are one of these unknowable nonsense things.\n\n------------\n\nHowever, completely separate about the claim of the existence of a deity is whether or not it deserves respect, worship, or even admiration. Say a deity with which I have yet been presented existed, and it proved its existence to me so I was convinced of its existence.\n\nI would still need quite a bit of information before I gave it respect. I would require yet more information before I gave it admiration. But I can't imagine what I would have to be presented (other than a threat of torture) that would cause me to worship it. But I would 'worship' any being that had in its power to torture me if my worship would prevent that torture. This says nothing as to whether the being is worthy of this worship.\n\nNo positive trait conceivable is worthy of worship. Only negative traits will ever elicit worship.\n\nI would suggest that any being that used threats of torture to garner a response of worship is absolutely evil. Even if the reward for worship were euphoria (or perhaps especially if the reward were euphoria).\n\n-------------\n\nIf I met an omni-knowledgeable being, I would only use it to bounce ideas off of so I could help myself and other limited beings learn about reality. I wouldn't want the answer. And I wouldn't want any euphoria that I couldn't obtain myself through actual productive work.\n\nAnything else would render life boring, meaningless, and depressing.

{"body": "Oh shit. Time to break out this story.\n\nSo, when I was about five or six, we went on a road trip to Miami (We live in Michigan.) My parents took me and my 12 year old brother.\n\nMy mom and dad had been kinda fighting lately, but I was a bit too young to really understand it. I think it was about money more times than not. My mom would always buy these dumb little knick knacks at random times and I guess it pissed my dad off. \n\nWe stopped at a hotel after a few hours of driving, my parents still bickering. We were exhausted from sitting in the car all day, but my brother and I tried to find something to watch on TV in the other room. It was a little while when he said he was thirsty and went to go find mom. He came back in and said he couldn't find her, just dad asleep. He threatened me to go get him something to drink. My brother was REALLY fuckin' scary sometimes, so I went out into the hallway since I was afraid he'd hurt me if I didn't. I kinda wandered around for a bit, I didn't really know where to look. I looked in the lobby and no one was there, but there was a vending machine. I decided mom would probably have money to buy something out of it, but she wasn't in the room. I went outside to see if maybe she was smoking. I rounded the corner of the building and came across the pool. She was sitting on the edge. It was actually kind of strange, she was just sitting there not really doing anything, and it was pretty quiet outside. I went over to her and asked for some money for the vending machine.\n\nThat's when I noticed something was not right. I took a look at her head, but it rose probably fifty feet over me. Her body was a large mass, and she had two sets of flippers. She asked me how much money I needed. All I needed was tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402595953", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

Karmanaut, as his first piece of evidence in his defense, posted a link to a picture of Bill Murray with a caption stating \"No one will ever believe you.\" As any good Redditor knows, this is a direct reference to that time when Bill Murray allegedly walked up to some people at a diner, stole a french fry off the diner's plate, and locked eyes stating those exact words - nobody would ever believe that Bill Murray stole your fry.\n\nThis rapidly developed into a shitstorm and resulted in Karmanaut losing his mod spot for a while and Bill being barred from doing an AMA for like six months or some shit. Upset about this because he had a movie coming out, Bill started talking to the remaining mods, trying to see if there was some loophole he could use to get around the sentencing. Unfortunately, the laws were air tight. Bill had one choice left: the time-honored tradition of swaying authority figures to your perspective through the use of financial incentives. Also known as bribery. So Bill went to the mods and asked how much money he'd have to pay them to get a fucking AMA on so he could promote his new movie *Rampart*, and out of the shadows steps Karmanaut, who utters three words.\n\n\"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time that Bill realized he was face to ankle with an eight-story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era! He shouted to the sky (because that's where Karamanaut's ears were, being eight stories tall and all) \"GODDAMMIT LOCH NESS MONSTAH I AINT GIVIN YOU NO TREE FIDDY\" and stormed out, leaving Woody Harrelson to take over Bill's role in *Rampart* as well as do the AMA which was a resounding success.\n\nThe end.\n\n**TL;DR you knew what was fucking coming.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402606363", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The temptation is to leave this at \"there is no evidence and review corroborating claims for gods\".\n\nBut I think I will go a bit further. People are often wrong about most things. Big things. Important things. Large groups of people. They think they know things they don't, and can't. We all do this every day in tiny little doses that can't matter. Your brain does not faithfully represent the world. It works hard to build a model of the world and update it every moment as best it can. And it is very good at finding danger, food, sex, and other necessary things for any organism to survive.\n\nBut it gets a ton of things wrong. This is well documented, and I suggest you take a psychology course at some point if you doubt this. I am including myself here. I get a lot of things wrong all the time. I know this. I have seen it in action. It's disturbing.\n\nThe best way we have found as a species to get around this problem - and it is a problem: racism, sexism, nationalism,rejection of scientific ideas... - is by using evidence and review. These are the foundational aspects of the scientific method, but they also lay beneath any important discovery process.\n\nThe evidence aspect is the collection of data, the observations, tests, philosophies, literature and so forth. This is the crap we can point to and say \"This is. It is right there. Look at it. Mull it over. Work with it. Hit someone with it and watch them bruise or bleed. It is just the shit that is. We all agree.\"\n\nThe review aspect is the most important thing humans have ever invented, though, because it is not ever dependent on one person's experience. Because, again, experience can be ridiculously unlike the external world being experienced. Review is the art of taking an experience and reproducing it, questioning it, attacking it, defending it and reporting the results by everyone who is interested enough to go through the process. This is how flawed experiences are exposed. This is how we reduce grand claims to their most fundamental pieces and see if they work. And it is where we ask the next \"why?\"\n\nGods do not hold up to this. At least not right now. Gods fail in exactly the same way ghosts, alien abductions, past life experiences, loch ness monsters et al fail. Tons of people believe in this shit, but not one of them can offer any evidence that passes real review. Only personal testimony.\n\nAbout personal testimony: it is never good. At best it is necessary for an arbitrarily set point of conclusion, but it sucks. But, and this is critical, it often doesn't matter. Take whether Jesus existed. I have read posts that say \"well, how do you know Julius Caesar existed?\" I don't. But if he didn't, nothing changes. Someone built those ruins. Someone's name is scrawled all over the place on them. If it wasn't Julius, then it was someone else. Or some group. It really doesn't matter because he was just a man. Mortal. A leader. He did nothing miraculous or impossible. He was not the son of any gods or monsters. He was a guy, like you and I, that people followed, as millions of people still follow guys (and gals) right this minute.\n\nJesus may have existed like Ceasar. But to believe he was divine means I have to first believe in the divine, which means there must be evidence and review for the divine. And there isn't. If Jesus was the Joseph Smith of his time and place, then I suppose I can accept his existence, because if he didn't exist, so what? But if Jesus was a son of a deity, then he might as well not have existed because I can't believe the shit that made him important.\n\nIn short: Julius Ceasar - just a politician.\nJesus Christ - just a cult founder.\n = AOK\nJulius Ceasar - product of will of gods and ordained to be leader of an Empire.\nJesus Christ - Son of a god.\n = Bullshit.\n\nFinally, all this rests on the data we have now. Unlike courts and elections, reality doesn't have a finish line. If someone ever does present evidence and review for gods, I will no longer be an atheist. I can't be. You would have to be a fucking asshole to be an atheist. Like creationists are assholes. Like sexists are assholes. And racists. You get the idea. Atheism exists only because theism exists, and is wrong. It doesn't make the world a better place. It doesn't solve any problems that aren't derived from believing in gods. It might be cold and scary and lead to people being absolute cunts. But it is accurate. And, in the face of so much faith in the world, it is humble. Humble before the facts.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402632563", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt;Aliens exist. We know this because science has concluded that they should based on the near infinite amount of universe that exists\n\nThis is completely false. There are not not an infinite number of planets and \"near infinite\" doesn't mean anything. Finite and infinite are mutually exclusive terms. A very large number isn't infinite. \n\nTo say that aliens must exist is to say that there are so many planets and the odds of life existing on any given planet are sufficiently high that, statistically, there must be life on at least one other planet. Of course, we simply don't know what the odds are of life developing on any given planet and therefore we don't know what the probability is of aliens existing. \n\nAs for Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, etc, the invention of digital camera-phones has effectively given us enough data to show that they don't exist. At the very least, they don't currently exist in the form that has been previously claimed. \n\nAs for ghosts, your logic seems rather unscientific. If we define ghosts as ethereal beings that was previously alive as a human with a continued consciousness that can physically interact with the observable world, then we can indeed make certain testable hypotheses. Firstly, through the scientific method, we know that human consciousness is tied to the physical brain. This means that ghosts, as defined above, do not exist and yes, science can in fact prove this (it's a lot easier to prove a negative with the scientific method than it is to prove a positive). Of course, if something else is meant by \"ghosts\" then we may or may not have enough evidence to show that they exist.

{"body": "Didn't happen to me, but I was on a family vacation in Acapulco about 15 years ago - there was me, my mom and dad, and my brother, then two sets of aunts/uncles/cousins etc. Stayed at La Princesa resort (spelling might be wrong, don't speak Spanish). Super nice hotel and this was all before the narco wars got really out of hand so we didn't expect anything like this to happen. One day we left the hotel to go do some sightseeing and shopping. \n\nMy brother, cousins and I were all young and obviously being young and stupid start running around, playing hide and seek, that sort of thing. Parents get pissed and wrangle all of us except my cousin John* (fake name, obviously). John was about 6 or 7 at the time and we can't find him. My aunt and uncle are freaking out, none of us speaks Spanish, only some of the merchants in the area speak broken English. Finally, we get the police to come by, and they say that if he was kidnapped, which wasn't definite yet, then the best thing to do would be for one person to go to the police station and everyone else to go to the hotel and wait for instructions.\n\nNow, obviously my aunt and uncle are beside themselves and the rest of us are pretty shook up too. People crying, screaming. Really, really horrifying day. So anyway, we go back to the hotel and eventually the front desk gets a phone call from a guy claiming to have John. He spoke to my Aunt (uncle went to the station with the police) and gave the usual gist - money for the kid, no cops, no BS. Obviously she calls the cops and they recommend she go to the meeting spot and make the drop, that kidnappings are very common and usually the people are professionals, don't want to kill anyone, etc. Pretty disconcerting in retrospect given how casual they are about it, but I guess cops can get pretty cynical if they have to deal with this all the time.\n\nSo my Aunt goes to the drop and we go with, hanging out in the back of a police van watching the whole thing. Guy comes out to meet my Aunt and discuss the terms of the deal once he's sure there are no cops around (he obviously didn't look very hard). Aunt asks to talk to John, gets rebuffed, etc. etc. Finally she says \"OK, so how much?\" And the guy goes \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNOW IT WAS ABOUT THAT TIME", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402675485", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It was a tree fiddy ending.\n\nEdit 2: /u/niceboyludo caught it\n\nHere is is for those who missed it:\n\nHere's the way it ended: My inbox has been flooded with an outpouring of support. One person especially, down in Georgia stayed up with me and texted most of the night. I'm thankful for your support.\n\nThe wisdom of your 65 years on this earth, and the challenges you've faced as a 67 year old woman have given me the strength to see this through. A deal is a deal, and I can only hope that one day, we meet. This has been a humbling experience to say the least.\n\nFrom people offering a kind word, to people being funny to take my mind off of everything, to people showing solidarity... thank you.\n\nAfter the shit that happened late last night / this morning- I've decided to give you guys a final update of where we ended up, and then take a break from this shit. I've got a lot of issues personally I need to deal with- and I need to buckle down and lay the foundation for my new life. I'm forever grateful to you people. Mental Health Resources If you or anyone you know is in crisis, GET HELP.\n\nIf you are in immediate need, the suicide prevention hotline in the US is 1-800-273-8255. There are subreddits full of people who are ready to listen, and help you. /r/suicidewatch and /r/depression are fantastic communities. If you're a man and want to remain child free for life, get a vasectomy. I think we can all agree that this entire shit show has been a cautionary tale.\n\nTake charge of your reproductive rights. I bolted upright at about 3am after splitting 2 bottles of Crown Royal with my friend and his amazing wife. His wife is about 5'1, country as cornbread, and was pissed. She and my wife have been friends for a very long time. \"D-I-V-O-R-C-E, Paulie.. That's the only thing you should be singin'. I think it's time to torch this sonofabitch. Burn the motherfucker to the foundation and call it a marriage.\" ... It was easier getting used to the idea of a divorce than I'm ready to admit. All of the posts yesterday were right...\n\nThe trust is gone, if it was ever there to begin with. The person I married was long gone. I'm angry, and I'm going to be angry for a long time. Before I went to bedI briefly turned on my phone, and it immediately exploded with messages from her, and a few members of her family. They didn't know what was going on, but that something was. A message from her MIL was pretty telling. \"I'm glad you won't be in my child's life, or my grand child's life. She always deserved better.\" ... I thought we had always been pretty close, but at the end of the day... Well fuck you too, Carol.\n\nThat's about the only thing that needs to be said, I guess. If you need to cool down after a domestic situation, don't fucking tell the other party where you're staying. Seriously. What woke me up was the sound of shouting coming from entry way. I heard my friend and his wife shouting, \"YOU NEED TO LEAVE. YOU NEED TO LEAVE, PLEASE. NOW. NOW.\" just over and over.\n\nStill drunk, I shambled out to the foyer, and, you guessed it, my wife was standing there. She kept trying to peek around them to see me, shouting at the top of her lungs, \"PAUL! PAUL I'M SORRY- PLEASE, I'VE MADE A MISTAKE WE NEED TO TALK.\"\n\nI don't know if I should have talked to her or not... also, if you're having domestic issues- don't try to address them with half a fucking load on. I told my friends that I was fine, and if we could talk here in the foyer. Reluctantly, they decided to let her in, and my friends wife went to go put on coffee and breakfast.\n\nI decided to take my phone out and record the conversation because.. I don't know, it seemed smart at the time, I guess.\n\n\"Can we talk?\" She seemed calmed down when our friends.. my friends, left us. \"I'm here. What do you want?\" She took a deep breath. \"I didn't like the way we left things.\"\n\n I belted a laugh, \"You're not happy with the way we left things?\"\n\nShe waved me off dismissively. \"Look, I just need to know if this is the end. Is this the way this ends? Is this how a decade of marriage ends?\"\n\nI just stared at her... and there we stood for what seemed like a very, very long time. \"Yes, Katherine. It ended when you fucked one of your students. It ended when you got pregnant. Actually saying the words.. actually making them a real thing, gave me strength. \"Jesus christ. A student.\"\n\n\"When you're finished nailing me to a cross, could you answer my question?\"\n\nI took two steps closer and with the calm, even tone I heard my father use so many times with me, I said, \"Yes, Katherine. This marriage is dead.\"\n\nWe never know how we're going to act when the rubber meets the road. We like to think we know what's going to happen. We plan it out, and think how we're going to handle the situation when it comes up. More often than not, it turns out completely different. We don't account for the X factor. I sure didn't.\n\nShe nodded. \"That's all I needed to know.\" She calmly pulled out my 9mm. The ugly thing was level with my chest. \"You know, I only ever wanted one thing. The one thing that any woman wants, Paul. And you couldn't give that to me.\"\n\nFear had wrapped its icy fingers around my throat. I couldn't speak, but She took care of that for me.

I had no experience trying to fix anything like this so I went and got the phone book and called the first plumbing service I could find. I told them about my situation and they informed me that a gentleman was on his way. \n\nWhen I answered the door, I was immediately taken aback by how attractive this guy was, even in his work pants and t-shirt I could tell he had an amazing body. I led him over to my sink and showed him the clog and he went to work. As soon as he bent over, I couldn't help checking out that ass. It was summertime and really hot and there was no air conditioning, so I decided to offer him a cold drink. He accepted and we started chatting while he was drinking his lemonade. \n\nWe were making small polite talk and I guess he noticed me checking out his tan muscular arms and his gorgeous hint of a six pack I could see outlined under his tight shirt. He smiled, and I couldn't believe my ears when he asked me whether I had any other \"clogs\" I would be needing his help with. I was shocked at how forward he was being but damn, was he hot so I told him yes, I had one I could use his assistance with. He pulled me into him and kissed me hard, slipping his strong hands into my shorts and squeezing my ass. I could feel my nipples getting hard against his chest, and I guess so could he because at that moment, he ripped my tank top off and started gently flicking my nipples with his tongue. It felt amazing to have this gorgeous stranger exploring my body like that so I took his hand and guided it between my legs so he could feel how wet I was getting for him...and he pushed his cock up against my thigh so I could feel how excited I was making him. After we made out for a while, he took my shorts off and sat me down on the kitchen table...he teased his tongue all along my thighs, finally getting to my pussy and making me gasp. He was amazing and I came almost immediately. I needed to have him right then, so I told him to get his pants off and bent over the kitchen table, exposing my ass and pussy for him. He slid his enormous cock into me and fucked me like I've never been fucked before.

{"body": "It all started when I was 6 (back in the 80s), as I recall it.\n\nI used to flip the pages of 3 books of an encyclopaedia we had in our small home library. One of those books was about animals - which I've always been fond of – with a big chapter dedicated to prehistoric creatures. They were the dinosaurs. Huge fierce-looking creatures, so incredible, and which I so much wanted to see someday.\n\nI also used to read comics, and one of the characters of those comics – from a Brazilian publication called Turma da Mônica - was a prehistoric man from a tribe contemporary to the dinosaurs. I, too, used to watch The Flintstones on TV, and see them using dinos as tools and having them as pets.\n\nNow, being a child, those things actually had me thinking that dinos and humans once lived together. What the hell?! There were even documentaries on TV about the Loch Ness Monster, so that must be true! And if they really died, it was not long ago! Probably they were killed during the flood and the only species to survive were the aquatic ones! It all makes sense!\n\nAt home, we used to have a family prayer session once a week, especially when my grandparents were visiting. Each one of us had to read a passage from (what I thought were) funny looking individuals who died some time ago, and we also repeated together a claim to a woman called Maria, who would pray for \"us sinners\". It was all very nice and calm. Not quite like this, but almost. Then, for some reason, I realized that in none of the pictures or cartoons I’ve ever seen about the Noah's Ark, they would show dinosaurs (nor any reptiles or insects for that matter…). I found that really strange. Ok... maybe they were too big for the Ark! But they don't even show them being left behind! Not even a baby dinosaur was taken! They would’ve been small enough! But no… Nothing! Not even the nice plant-eating ones which wouldn’t eat the other animals…\n\nAt the age of 8 I finally understood that most dinosaurs were extinct millions of years ago following the impact of an asteroid and not because of any flood, and our species has been around since “only” 200,000 years. I also learned that those strange individuals I quoted during prayer were \"saints\" and I myself was one of those sinners Mary would pray for, which I found really disturbing (and sort of put me off praying, since I really wasn't one!). At the age of 14 I concluded that Jesus was an alien (no way a human would do all those tricks without some high-tech apparatus) and from that to calling the whole bible story a fiction was only a step. Bertrand Russell sealed the coffin and good old science helped bury the defunct theism I still had left until the age of 18.\n\nToday, at the age of 30, I’m the only atheist in my entire family. And it all started with dinosaurs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402696232", "subreddit": "magicskyfairy", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Science is ever finding out more than it knew before, this is true and it is also true that nothing can be proven to a 100% certainty. But there are scientific concepts that have been verified beyond reasonable doubt. The idea that the reason things fall down instead of up is due to a gravitational force that pulls things toward the centre of the earth will never be 100% provable, but we're certain enough that it answers all relevant questions in a manner congruent with the rest of known science, and technology based on the presumption that gravity exists works perfectly. This includes everything from building houses to flying airplanes. This is a scientific concept that is very very unlikely to change and may as well be taken as proved. \n\nSimilarly, we may never be able to 100% prove the existence or non-existence of ghosts, Bigfoot, Nessie etc. But to borrow from Harris, we have a fairly good basic understanding of how our brain works. We know that certain sections of the brain are responsible for certain functions, such as memory, emotion, instinct, lying etc. Everything that is the sum of our personality resides in our brain (the soul notwithstanding. As you have pointed out, it has neither been proved nor disproved, so basically a non-issue for the purpose of this conversation). We also know that damaging certain areas of the brain reduces or eliminates the function that section is responsible for. This is why we have Alzheimer's disease and why getting hit on the head can make you go blind or deaf or forget language. And yet, for a ghost to exist, it must be possible for memories, character and personality somehow survive the *complete* destruction of the *entire* brain. This does not fit with what we know of neuroscience, and this there is no reason to believe that ghosts exist or at the least, no more reason than to believe that unicorns, leprechauns etc exist. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402703173", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The first woman I ever really fell in love with was a swimmer I met in college.  I was playing in a number of bands at the time, and I noticed her at a couple of separate shows.  One was a thrash metal band, the other was a jazz ensemble--I figured she wasn't there for the music since she just gave me \"the look\" the whole time.  After the third time I saw her in the audience, she stuck around after the show and started chatting me up as we were packing our gear.\n\n\nAt first, I thought, \"Wow, my first groupie.\"  Major ego boost.  But as we started talking, she turned out to be much more than your typical airhead or even music junkie.  It turns out she had been in one of my  classics courses and had been really impressed with a paper I wrote on Greek drama.  (I was a science major, but tried to get a well-rounded education.)\n\nAs I got to know her over the next few weeks, I was amazed at her deep thoughts on everything from archaeology and paleontology to the history--especially European history--and all sorts of varied subjects.  She was an \"old soul\" in so many senses.\n\nLike so many young men at that age, I fell into a mix of infatuation and lust.  I'm sure that blinded me to any flaws in her appearance (she had a swimmer's body, but certainly not a typical beauty) or personality.\n\nShe was very generous with her time, working with all sorts of charities like Habitat for Humanity and others I can't recall offhand.\n\nAfter a few months, I think it's safe to say I fell in genuine love.  I was seriously considering asking her to move in with me for the next semester.  We went on a weekend trip to the beach and watched the sunset over the ocean.  She nestled in my arms, leaned in close and whispered in my ear, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nThat's when I noticed she was a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era.

I admitted my weakness for \"The Joshua Tree\" and apologized like ten times stuttering a little and being infatuated by that amazing smile.\n\nI ended up walking her home, she lived 2 minutes from the accident site. She didn't seem to mind at all that I'm the reason her face was all scratched. Her name was Emily. I had to gather all my courage. I asked her out. She said yes, smiled again (oh my God, that smile) and asked me what I want her to wear. I was so stunned by the question that I said \"A Godzilla t-shirt would be cool\", I don't know where I got this ridiculous idea from, I don't even like Godzilla! Stupid, stupid. But she only laughed, promised to do her best and left me there on the porch standing like a retarded Godzilla nerd.\n\nThe time came. Friday. I meet Emily at a restaurant. And the best thing is, she actually has Godzilla t-shirt with this plastic Godzilla. Turns out she visited a hundred second hands in the city to find it. Wow. She's great. We talk and laugh. I can't remember when was the last time I felt so happy. I stare at the boobs a few times and I'm quite excused, because Godzilla is there. I apologize a few times, because her face is all scratched (but it doesn't ruin her amazing smile). She says she doesn't mind. I say that I'm so embarassed, I hate myself for making her crash into the bushes. I ask \"Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?\". This mysterious smile appears and she says nothing. \"What is it?\", I ask. Emily says \"It's nothing, it's just, there is this one thing I need\". I'm all ears. \"Yeees?\" She smiles her beautiful smile again and says \"I need about three fiddy.\" At that very moment I noticed Emily was not a girl, but a giant crustacean from Paleolithic era. \"I ain't givin' you no treefiddy, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!\", I yelled, but she was not listening any more.

{"body": "I could probably rag on everything...\n\n**4. Buy more vegetables. – Every time you go to the store make it a habit to load up on vegetables. Veggies are the key to making Paleo work, and not eating enough of them is the main reason people don’t see results. There’s a fair share of meat eaten on Paleo, but the magic is in getting enough vegetables.**\n\nThe magic is getting rid of processed junk food.  Keto can be paleo.\n\n**5. Don’t go it alone. – Cavemen lived in tight knit communities, hunting and gathering in groups and migrating together to find better resources. It’s best to do Paleo with another person, and at the very least you’ll want to get the support of your family and friends.**\n\nIt's better to do paleo than not do it.  You earn support.  You don't ask for it.\n\n**13. Buy organic. – Whenever possible, opt for organic produce. This essentially brings food back to a time when pesticides and herbicides weren’t used to grow food, and saves your body from these toxic chemicals.**\n\nIt's more important to eat more veggies than eat organic veggies.\n\n**31. Drink plenty of water. – Don’t forget to drink your water while on Paleo. Make sure it’s well-purified and resist the temptation to add in liquid sweeteners that have become popular in recent years.**\n\nI rarely drink a drop of water.  There is plenty of water in meat &amp; veggies\n\n**33. Line yourself up. – Make sure that your body is inline so that it’s properly functioning. This may entail doing daily exercises or seeing a chiropractor if you’re out of whack, but it will make a huge difference if you’re currently dysfunctional in your movements.**\n\nOr you know just fix your posture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yYJ4hEYudE\n\n**41. Get savvy about food labels. – Learn how to read food labels and get familiar with the different names for things like MSG and the different artificial sweeteners. Or make it super simple and eat food that doesn’t come with “Nutrition” labels.**\n\nOr just don't eat food with nutrition labels.  Meat and veggies don't come with labels.\n\n**44. When the weather permits, spark up the grill. – Next to a Crock Pot your barbecue grill is the next closest cooking apparatus to mimic the caveman way of cooking. Try a grilled chicken breast or salmon filled with grilled asparagus spears and portobello mushroom caps.**\n\nBecause it's less healthy than cooking on the stove.  Charred anything is bad for you and grills char your food.\n\n**54. Never be without a recipe. – Surround yourself with plenty of resources for Paleo recipes. You’ll want them all at your fingertips so you’re not spinning your wheels when it comes time to decide what to eat. These days you’re in luck, because there are plenty of Paleo recipe blogs and books to choose from with loads of delicious recipes.**\n\nI've looked up 2 recipes in 2 years on paleo.\n\n**59. Convert some of your favorite recipes. – If you’re partial to mom’s apple pie, or grandma’s enchiladas you don’t have to give them up forever. Figure out how to replace the offensive ingredients with Paleo friendly items and you’ll have healthier versions of your favorites.**\n\nNo!  Stop trying to reproduce SAD food!\n\n**65. Ignore fads. – Fads come and go but Paleo is based on 10,000 years of success. Next week some new weight loss trend will come up and a week later it will be gone. Stay the course and go with a way of eating that is time tested and works.**\n\nErrr...non-Paleo is based on 10,000 years of success.  Paleo is based on 4 million years of success.\n\n**89. Absorb the start-up costs. – It may be a little pricey to opt for organic produce, grass-fed meats, and high quality oils. But you’re worth it, and you’ll recoup these costs by not eating fast food or junk food, and by avoiding future medical bills from an improper diet.**\n\nAgain, it's more important not to eat SAD foods.  This is not an all or nothing diet.\n\n**106. Give up the alcohol. – It’s best to give up the alcohol for at least the first month of Paleo. You’ll see the best results if you do, and if after the first month you want to have the occasional drink it won’t mess up your progress. The Paleolithic Era predates alcohol by several thousands of years.**\n\nLOL!  No.  Moderation.\n\nLet's simply this:\n\n   1.  No grains (corn, wheat, rice, barley, etc.)\n\n   2.  No legumes (beans, peanuts)\n\n   3.  No dairy (cheese, yogurt, milk)\n\n   4.  No added sugar (soda, ice cream)\n\n   5.  No vegetable oil\n\n   6.  Eat meat, veggies, fruit, nuts, seeds, organ meat, fish, shellfish, and tubers (potatoes, sweet potatoes)\n\n   7.

{"body": "Not a tree fiddy story but Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied.\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.\nThey were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.\ntl;dr: Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402781952", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Jamming with him and hearing that part before the studio recording was released fucking sold it for me.\n\nIt was funny, We had a laugh because he was actually still in the process of re-learning all of the songs. He said he had some dry guitar tracks that he would play along with on the bus. \n\nAs it turns out, Brent wrote virtually all of CtS. Troy Brent and Brann wrote the Hunter. Remission is all Bill and Brann stuff from Lethargy (Brent had some of his jams in there Elephant Man, ol nessie, Trilobite) Leviathan was a lot of Bill and Brent. Blood Mountain was the most the band collaborated ever, he said. After that its been a \"everyone bring their own thing to the table\" kind of deal. Bill has been absent in quite a bit of the writing process since BM.\n\nGod, theres so much he told me. We also talked about the bands beginnings, writing logistics, label stuff, studio gear, chicken-pickin technique and his playing style, touring, the future for the band, the winter EP, drugs, and a hell of a lot more. good times!!\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402812336", "subreddit": "progmetal", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No, I'm sure it's just a coincidence that in my area, for example, Verizon just HAPPENS to be skipping competing in areas that Cableone controls and that Cableone just HAPPENS to not be competing in areas that Verizon is using for it's FIOS service.\n\n\nAnd i wasn't joking. You were talking shit about local governments giving state sanctioned monopolies yes? Well how is it the local governments fault that when those contracts come up the ONLY name on the list is CableOne?\n\n\nEDIT: Ok, it's storytime. Here is why this particular issue is so vexing to me. A few years back when FIOS was taking off and expanding, me and a bunch of my buddies said we'd really like to have that service. There was a contacts section on Verizons site that would allow you to submit a request that they expand in your direction. We got a response very quickly. \"No, we have no intentions of expanding our network to that location at this time. We have to prioritize our expansions into other areas first.\"\n\nOk, we're cool with that. We're all IT industry guys, we know what it costs to build that shit out and run it. No big deal. So we get on board. Send back a response that basically says hey, we're willing to get out and get people to sign up or whatever to guarantee you have a customer base when you get here. How many people do you need for an install base to be profitable enough to build out in our area? And the response was \"Number of potential customers is not at issue. We have no intentions, now or in the foreseeable future, to establish a network in your city.\"\n\nSo we think, ok. Infrastructure must be more difficult than we know. It is what it is. Then, a local college, working through grants provided by state and federal government, started laying fiber throughout our city. The college and public school district gets to use it exclusively for 5 years, but then access is open to whatever providers wish to provide service. AWESOME! They still weren't interested, when the infrastructure was paid for and maintained out of someone else's pocket. Neither was Time Warner, or Comcast. COX Cable would have only had to run a feeder line a FEW MILES to tie into this fiber infrastructure, and they refused as well, despite the fact that their service would have easily captured a large market share almost immediately.\n\nAnd that type of thing is going on all over the damn country. So yeah, I'm SURE it's \"just coincidence\".

I was sitting on a bench in front of a huge open lake, one of those picturesque reflective lakes with mountains in the background. I then could see a shadow come out of the water and come towards me.

{"body": "Hey guys, my name is Dan, and I've been lurking around the subreddit for a long long time. After seeing this post, i decided to finally comment here as I know the secret of the move that is F*** Physics\n\nFirstly, how do I know this move? In case you have not heard of me, I helped Jaspas filmed various video including 'Smoke Screen' and 'Our Space'. The first time I saw Jaspas do the move, I was as mindblown as all of you are right now, and I pestered him for the whole day to share with him the secret to F**** Physics. After much pestering and a jug of beer later, Jaspas finally relented and told me his story on how he created F*** Physics. \n\nBefore I start, I would have to establish some background context. There is a well-known contact juggler that busks around areas such as Bugis, Dhoby Ghaut and Clarke Quay. One day, while hanging around the Bugis region, he noticed the contact juggler busking as per usual. He hung around watching his performance, which I would add was spectacular and amazing. Jaspas had seen him around a few times and always stopped to see his performance. The way his handled the glass balls was always stunning and mesmerizing. However on that day, he had a new routine to show.\n\nThe contact juggler proceeded to take his juggling ball out from his case, unleashing the transparent, clean ball. He moved it around, as though he was hypnotizing the crowd, and with one toss, he threw it to the side and the ball flew out of his hands. For a split second, Jaspas thought the ball was going to fall to ground and break into a million glass shreds. However it didn't. Similar to an Australian Boomerang, the ball flew back into his hands, and the crowd erupted into applause. Jaspas was stunned. He had never seen anything like this before. He imagined the uproar he could create in the cardistry community if he could create something an inkling similar to that move. He then sat down at a coffee shop, and worked on replicating that move. \n\nAfter exhausting all possible ideas, he decided to confront the contact juggler on the secret behind the move. While the juggler was taking a break. Jaspas went up and introduced himself and the thing that was bugging him. With a grin, the contact juggler said: \"Its very simple! I'll tell you how its done...\"\n\n\"But first, can I have tree fiddy?\" Jaspas then realised that this was no man. It was a plesiosaur from the Scottish Highlands. Jaspas bellowed \"Go away you money-grabbing monster! Go back to the lake where you belong!\" Dismayed by his unsuccessful attempt to extort tree fiddy from this blue-haired man, the creature slowly stumbled away, disappearing into the river near Bugis.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402938694", "subreddit": "cardistry", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's time to go over the story of cup size names at Starbucks again for all of you that do not know.\n\nIn 1971, a little coffee wholesaler was founded, and we named it Starbucks. (And yes, it WAS after Starbuck from Moby Dick, idk what the guy in the video was talking about. As a Seattle company, we wanted to theme our company on \"the romance of the sea\" which is also the reason the Siren is our logo.) When we first started serving coffee, and soon after, espresso beverages, we did it in the Italian tradition, with small portions. The two sizes we served were the **short** and the **tall**. That was it. Makes sense right?\n\nAs we began expanding into the coffee shop we are today, known for espresso beverages, there was large demand by the American audience for a larger size to be available. Once we released it, we called it a **grande**, which is *Italian* for large (no, its not Spanish as many claim for some reason, though it means the same thing in both languages). Again, this was keeping in mind our roots in the Italian tradition. People wanted a bigger size as well, so the **venti** was introduced, with venti meaning twenty in Italian, the idea being that this is even bigger than a large, at a whopping 20oz (originally 24 for iced beverages, now 26).\n\nAt this point, Italians would think us ridiculous, as their espresso beverages are still in the 1-8oz range. \n\nNow we have the **trenta** (Italian for 30 as it is 30oz). It is indeed larger than the average unexpanded human stomach. It's ridiculous.\n\nLater this year, Starbucks will be unveiling the **dodeciochenta** size exclusively for our Frappuccino Blended Coffees and Cremes. At an extraordinary size of 128oz, it will be our largest coffee yet. In a private interview last month I got to ask Howard Schultz himself how much that beverage would cost. He replied that it would not be available as an MSR reward, but at launch will be at a special price of about tree fiddy. That's when I realized it wasn't Howard Schultz at all. It was the god damn loch ness monster again. I told him to get out, but I was pretty frightened. I promptly left Seattle never to return again.

{"body": "It was actually one of those awkward first experiences for me...this girl who was in my class at middle school lived next door to me. I didn't really know her all that well, but one night she had a dozen friends over for a party. Her parents were very strict and wouldn't let any boys over, but then they had a fight that the whole neighborhood could hear. Dad went out, mom hit the wine and fell asleep in her room, and the girls decided the best way to take advantage of the situation was to invite a boy over any way they could.\n\nI was nothing special, mind you, so the first thing they did was come over and ask if I had any friends over (there goes my ego). Then they asked me if I could call \"that one cute boy you hang out with\" to ride his bike over here (ouch). He's not home. Hell, there's a lot of girls bored and eager to break *the rules*, and I was 13, so my ego took a back seat to my hormones and I went over there myself. Awkwardness be damned.\n\nSo I went over and there was this one girl that seemed to like me but was shy, I guess the other girls somehow picked up on it (I didn't) and kept alternating between trying to get me to kiss her and trying to make her jealous. After a couple rounds of Spin the Bottle that just involved me watching girls kiss each other - no complaints, someone broke out the Ouija board. I immediately started laughing and talking about how \"all that shit's fake\" and making fun of the girl who lived next door to me for owning one, and of course if I could go back in time and kick myself in the balls I would because clearly the point of the game is an excuse for physical contact. \n\nSomehow it worked out though, they got me to give it a try and sure enough they paired me up with the shy girl who liked me. When we put our hands together she blushed and there was a lot of giggling between the girls...yeah, they knew what the real point of it was...but I just tried to relax and enjoyed what was sadly my first experience holding hands with a girl. I was certain she was just moving randomly but they started calling out letters.\n\nM...\n\nA...\n\nR...\n\nY...\n\nThe house we were in had previously belong to the Hutchinson family - he was a prominent doctor in our small town. His daughter Mary had leukemia, and when we moved in next door she had already gone home on hospice. She had died about 6 months prior to this, but I was certain I was the only person in the room who knew about this. \n\nG\n\nI\n\nM\n\nM\n\nE\n\nOkay, that was weird. The last time I had seen her, I brought my mother's chicken casserole over for their family. Mary was about 8 but she looked much younger because the chemo had caused her to lose so much weight. The only thing she said the whole time was \"Gimme!\" when I brought the food and she devoured it - they told me she hadn't had any appetite in three days, so apparently she was starving. In fact it was the only word I ever remembered hearing her say, \"Gimme\".\n\nThis was freaking me out. Maybe one or two people in the room knew that the girl who had died in the house was named Mary, but no one could have known about this. It wasn't that long ago so it was still fresh in my memory, but I hadn't told anyone...just didn't seem important. There was no way that the girl I was sitting with or anyone else in the room knew about that.\n\nWe were all sitting in a bedroom with the lights out and the nightlight was on, so it was pretty dark. At first I thought she was one of the girls that had come over for a party, but as I looked up I realized that this girl was standing in the doorway, much smaller than anyone else present. She was in this white dress, the kind that you'd expect a girl to wear to church (or to be buried in if they died young), but this was tattered.\n\nShe simply held out her hand and said \"Gimme!\"\n\nYou hear about this shit in ghost stories, they're always behind some fog or materializing out of the darkness as a barely-discernible shape. This was nothing like that. She wasn't cloaked in some sort of shadowy translucent barrier, I saw her as plain as you're seeing your computer screen right now. She was *right there*.\n\n\"Gimme!\"\n\nAll the girls I was with screamed, but then a couple of them started laughing hysterically. They looked at me thinking it was some sort of joke I'd set up, but I was as white as a sheet. When they realized it wasn't a joke they started screaming again, this time more out of terror than surprise. They all went into panic mode and huddled together in a corner, with me still sitting on the floor in shock with my hands on the Ouija board.\n\n\"GIMME!\"\n\nSomehow I started to think rationally through my panic, but no rational thoughts were coming. I mean, this was definitely Mary, with per pale sunken face, but the person in front of me was clearly not alive. You never know how you're going to act in that situation, but I guess survival instinct kicked in and I did my best to reason with the spirit or whatever was staring me in the fact.\n\n\"Give you what?\"\n\n\"GIMME!\" she took a step closer, her hand still reaching out.\n\n\"I brought food to you one time, is that it? You were hungry then, but you can't eat now!\"\n\n\"GIMME!\"\n\n\"Food won't sustain you. I'm so sorry but there's nothing I can give you.\"\n\n\"**GIMME!**\"\n\n\"Please just tell me what you want! Spirit, what is it you want me to give you?\"\n\n\"...I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402985573", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

My classes usually aren't too large, because most kids would rather learn German or French.\n\nOne year my crop of new students was only ten kids. This was just big enough that they didn't cancel the class for that year. But since it *did* go ahead, that was great. I had more time to spend with each kid. After Christmas the flu hit the school hard, and second class after the break a grand total of one kid showed up for class. I was fairly fresh out of uni at this point, and I think this boy had a bit of a crush on me. This will become relevant soon. I suppose I didn't think about it because I'm a bit self conscious about being slightly big.\n\nI obviously could not hold classes with only one kid, because I would have to repeat everything when the other kids started coming back to school. So I figured I would just cancel the class and let him go on his merry way. Except... I had several boxes of books (I also taught some English) to move for one of my other classes, and those things get pretty heavy when you stack them up. So I figured I would ask him to help me carry them and then give him the rest of the class off. I asked him to help me with something, and brought him to the locked old storage room where the books were kept. I went in first, and he followed.

{"body": "It was...interesting to say the least.  My girlfriend and I had just arrived in Guatemala the day before.  We decided that we wanted to walk through the forest by the ocean to see all the exotic animals.  We walked around for a while and noticed that nobody really traveled through here, it was perfect for some quick oral.\nShe starts to pull down my pants, then looks at me, smiles and says \"Are you ready?\".\nOh yes I was ready.  She liked to tease me so she started giving me a hand job first, every so often making a move like she was going to blow me, but pulling away at the last second.  Eventually she started the blow job.\nSo there I was getting head right by the coast in the middle of the forest thinking to myself \"Well I can check this off of the bucket list!\".  It was amazing, the best blow job I had ever had.  We were about five minutes into the oral, she's really going at it and I'm almost ready to bust a nut.  Then I looked to my right and noticed an elephant just standing there, watching.  I jumped a little and my gf said \"What is it?\".  She followed my eyes and saw it.\nAt first she wanted to stop because she was pretty frightened by the elephant, but I told her to keep going, so she kept on blowing me while the elephant moved closer.  \nPretty soon the elephant was standing right over me.  He started to speak in a language that I have never heard.  His chanting became louder and louder until the gf and I had to stop the oral and cover our ears.  Then the ground started to violently shake.  I thought at this point that I was going to die here, in the middle of nowhere with my dick out, so I decided before my death I might as well take my last wank.  \nSo while I'm standing there sobbing with my dick in hand, I look out to the ocean so that I can see it's beauty and vastness just one last time.  It was so beautiful, the rich ocean blue and the sound of the waves crashing.  At least I would die in peace.\nI then noticed that my gf was frantically trying to get my attention.  \"What do want?!?\" I yelled.  \n\"About tree fiddy!\" She said.\nAnd that point I realized she was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic period.  That damn Loch Ness monster got me again!!\nI screamed \"Damnit monstah!  I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!!\"\nAnd the rest is history.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403025652", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 41, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's what happened.\n\nThe Revolutionary War came about because of the bitter feuds between the America and Great Britain.  It was later revealed that King George III was actually the father of our beloved president, George Washington, who was the father of George Washington Carver.  George Washington Carver used his knowledge of peanuts to aid his father in the Revolutionary War, also known as World War Zero.\n\nThen Russia valiantly entered the battle by launching Sputnik, which was the prototype of the Death Star.  Luckily, Washington and his son were able to overcome the communists and vampires and save our race from extinction.  Bombing Hiroshima was the final blow dealt to Great Britain, and King George died of Carpal Tunnel syndrome.\n\nUlysses S. Grant (Washington's vice president) turned out to be a double-crosser, as he betrayed Washington, by cutting the brakes on his horse.  Washington died in the resulting explosion, and George Washington Carver avenged his father by using the first atom bomb on Ulysses S. Grants house, and was then appointed to President.  And justice was restored until the rise of Winston Churchill and his Canadian Empire.\n\nOn November 27th, 1537, Winston Churchill and George Washington Carver met in Hawaii to discuss a peace treaty between Canada and the United States of America, in hopes of ending the largest arms race the world has ever seen.  Just after Carver signed the treaty, Churchill pulled the pen away from Carver, and proceeded to stab Carver in the jugular vein with it.\n\nAs the bloodied Carver fell, the maniacal Churchill spoke, Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo? It'll be spring soon. And the orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket. And they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields... and eating the first of the strawberries with cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?  After Churchill recited this bizarre passage, he pulled off his shirt to reveal a swastika tattooed across his chest.\n\nChurchill then used the pen, still wet with Carvers blood, and stabbed himself to death with it.  There was then an emergency election held, and the newly appointed President Ford was the victor.  President Ford had great political dreams, and his image was further strengthened after his role of Han Solo in Star Wars, as well as Indiana Jones.  Harrison Ford, on the day he was appointed President, gave one of the most heartfelt speeches of the 1500s.\n\nIt is as follows:  A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away.  [President Ford then sneezed].  My fellow Americanananananans.  I gratefully accept this honor to lead one of the greatest planets on this continent:  The United States of America.  I promise to mold this country to my own twisted vision of freedom and prosperity, and I can promise that I will ultimately destroy anyone who stands in my path. [There was much Applause].  Harrison Fords presidency lasted from 1537 until 1954, when he was put in prison for using a tank to get through rush hour, and jaywalking.\n\nThe next president to take over was that Japanese guy who eats all those hot dogs.  He was impeached for conspiracy to kill the president.  He was the last president America had ever known, because Johnny McFakeName brought the country to its knees in a ruthless dictatorship from 1956 until 1492, with periods of anarchy in between.  Luckily, that same year the empire of Lord McFakeName fell, and an acrobat named Christopher Columbus built the Statue of Liberty, and stood on top of its head as she marched across the ocean, where they stumbled upon America.\n\nThey made peace with the natives, although soon after, Christopher Columbus was chased out of America for illegal cookie dealings, and went back to his home country of Scotland, and became the Loch Ness Monster.  The Native Americans were experienced warriors, having a 1337 clan on Counter-Strike and being nationally recognized for skills in Frolf.\n\nHowever, this did not deter Hitler from striking down on them with all of his hatred.  Hitler had always held a grudge against the Native Americans, ever since he lost a Rock-Paper-Scissors match against Squanto.  Hitler declared war as well as bankruptcy on the Native Americans, but the Native Americans launched a surprise attack on Hitlers army.\n\nOn October 22, 1489, the Native Americans crashed the Nazi party.  Hitler refused to surrender however, but, being diagnosed as a hypochondriac, died of his illness 2 minutes and 51 seconds later.  Unbeknownst to the members inside the Nazi frat party, the world was undergoing major changes.  Andre the Giant sneezed, breaking Pangaea into 7 continents (and 9 planets).  The dinosaurs had nowhere to go, so they found work in movies, such as Jurassic Park, Barney, and the special edition of Gone With the Wind: Dino A Go-Go!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403042130", "subreddit": "explainlikeIAmA", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Other than the new album, we talked about the bands beginnings, writing logistics, label stuff, studio gear, chicken-pickin technique and his playing style, touring, the future for the band, the winter EP (Nov-Dec, darker heavier, contrasts OMRtS), drugs, and a lot more. Anyway, for some of those bits:\n\nAunt Lisa was written entirely by Brent (a lot of the songs were written by brent on this one). He said Brann really liked it and asked if he could put some of his lyrics to it and change the name in memory of his aunt who had recently passed. The original name name escapes me at the moment. Melody and lyrics changed but Brent wanted to keep all the parts at 2:50 and on (from what he played). Brann is apparently going through some really tough shit with his mom.\n\n**EDIT: oh yeah and in aunt lisa theres a editing boof&gt;&gt;&gt;listen to the drums at 2:48ish-2:50ish theres some kind of little nuance/overlap/someonefuckedupamastodonedit :x\n\nBrent doesn't like High Road... at all...  He thinks its way to repetitive and overall boring. He did mention (he got a little mushy) that yeah he doesn't like playing it but its Bill's jam, he loves the guy like a brother and respects the emotion he put in it. The reason why mastodon works so well together is the respect for ideas. He actually recounted crack the sky, and how he would show bill something but Bill would try and change it or put his mark on it which drew some tension.\n\nMotherload is obviously a Brann melodic and lyrical creation.\n\nHe described Haloween as a \"a good old fashioned rock song\" he had some quirky 'fucked up' lyrics too it at first but ended up changing them. \n\n*I should also mentioned he played all this stuff for me too\n\nDiamond in the witch house was originally called \"Scott\" (scott kelly).. I'm kind of glad they changed the name. He said there was a lot of troy writing/riffing in this one.\n\nI told him about some bootleg recordings of Chimes at Midnight I had seen/heard on YouTube. He taught me the rhythm part for the intro bit and he played the lead part (thats in the recording (that they can't do live)) Jamming with him and hearing that part before the studio recording was released fucking sold it for me.\n\nWe had a laugh because he was actually still in the process of re-learning all of the songs. He said he had some dry guitar tracks that he would play along with on the bus.\n\nAs it turns out, Brent wrote virtually all of CtS. Troy Brent and Brann wrote the Hunter. Remission is all Bill and Brann stuff from Lethargy (Brent had some of his jams in there Elephant Man, ol nessie, Trilobite) Leviathan was a lot of Bill and Brent. Blood Mountain was the most the band collaborated ever, he said. Bill has been absent in quite a bit of the writing process since BM. there was a ton of surprising internal stuff mentioned too..\n\nI realize this is somewhat brief now that i look at it...

{"body": "**TL;DR -- Almost had sex, but my love for Yugioh overcame (pun intended)**  \n\n  \nI was at regionals earlier last year. I was playing Chain Beat and going undefeated so far. Then comes lunch time. So me and my buddy I was there with walked over to the nearby mall to hit up the food court.  \n While there I see this SMOKING hot girl across the way. 10/10 would oggle again. So me being my dumb self, I grab my card binder out of my bag and decide to go hit on her the geekiest and least effective way I can-- Yugioh pickup lines.  \nSo I walk over and smooth as hell sit in the seat across from her (she was alone). I'm about to open my binder and start the magic love engine when, shit you not, she says \"Oh cool! Yugioh! Can I see your deck?\" So me being the casa nova I am says \"Errrr...uhh yeah. I think. I guess you could.\" She goes on to explain that her younger brother plays the game and is actually participating in the same tournament I am but is too young to stay by himself which is why she is here and knows about the game (even has her own cards and plays with her brother occasionally.)  \nSo she's looking through my deck and keeps doing that thing where she looks up, giggles, and looks back down. So I ask what's up. \"Oh nothing. You're just a lot cuter than those other guys that play, that's all.\" I smile and say thanks and blush like my name is Tom Ato. She looks up again, this time biting her lip. \"Wanna see MY deck?\"  \n\nI say \"Sure, what do you play?\"  \n\"Oh, I'll just have to show you. Its back at my house. Wanna come?\"  \nAt this point I'm freaking out. Goddess Jane just asked me back to her place. \"But what about your brother?\" I ask.  \n\"Don't worry about him, he'll be in the tournament all day.\"  \n\nCrap. Regionals.  \n\nBoobs or regionals? Titties or Yugioh? Sexy time or Joey time?  \nAnd you damn well know the answer.\nSo we get to her place and we're barely even inside before we start making out. Hot and heavy. Clothes start coming off one by one. My shirt. Hers. She's \"wearing\" this small red bra. Less wearing and more spilling out. HNNNNNGGGGG. My pants come off. Her hand goes straight to my raging Weevil. Oh. God.  \nHer pants slowly come down and dear Ra, this is the skimpiest thong I've ever seen. I could floss my teeth with the thing. I try to keep the vibe going.  \n\"You ready for my Boneheimer?\"  \n\"I don't think your Boneheimer is ready for my Dark Hole.\"  \nHer hand is on my junk and oh my god am I ready. Bra comes off. Even IGN would give these boobs a 10/10. I go for it (nothing like sand for the record.)   \"I guess we'll have to trade then. My Boneheimer for your Dark Hole?\"  \nHer grip tightens slightly. \"Gonna have to do better than that.\" She winks.  \n\"How about a pair of Mystical Shine Balls to go with it?\"  \n\"Better. But not quite there yet.\" She starts stroking.  \nI can't take it anymore. This has to happen. NOW. \"How much more do you want?\"  \nShe slowly pulls me in by my Tour Bus From the Underworld. One arm wraps around my waste, hand on my ass.  \nThe other arm pulls my head in for her to whisper in my ear. I can feel her breathe on me. This is so freaking hot, I think to myself.\nThen she whispers, so sexily I just about let go then and there...  \n...  \n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"  \nIt was about this time I realized this girl was a 500 foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era.  \nI said \"GOD DAMMIT LOCH NESS MONSTER! I AIN'T GIVING YOU NO TREE FIDDY.\"  \nShe pulled back slightly and looked me in the eyes. \"Well how about two fiddy?\"  \nTwo fiddy sounded good to me.

{"body": "I had a similiar thing happen to me house, It was about 2 years ago junior year in highschool. My girlfriends parents had gone on a trip for their anniversary or whatever and my girlfriend was home alone for the weekend. Her parents didnt like me for a personal reason (Id rather not go into details about it ) anyway I saw this as the perfect opportunity to get some \"alone time\" with my girlfriend.\n\n I told my parents i was going to stay the night at my friend erics house. Me and eric had been really close friends for a while now so my parents didnt even question me. I got in my car and headed to her house after she texted me her parents were gone. I was about halfway there when i just had a weird feeling inside?( i know everyone has had an experience where they just didnt feel right about something) but besides my gut i still went to her house, but I made sure to park my car a little down the street just in case something was to happen. \n\nAnyway we hung out for a while and my horny 17 year old mind took over. We started making out and cuddling and it was just amazing. Sure enough clothes started coming off then I knew \"it\" was about to happen. I told her hold on and went to get my wallet. I open it up and ... No condom. \n\nI told her about how I didnt have one and I had to go to the store. Seductively,She told me she had one, but she said I had to buy it. \"How much do you need?\" I asked. \"I need about Tree Fiddy\" It was around this time I realized that my Girlfriend was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned loch ness monster had gotten me again! I said, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy\" After that had happend I went back into my car and drove to Eric's house and we hung out.

{"body": "Woah! I think this was our old house! Across from Lakeview Public Elementary right? \n\nMy grandparents bought that house in 1955, and my family lived in it until around 2009. When we were trying to sell it we had a really hard time because the door to the basement was broken so we just took the whole thing off and covered it in thick cardboard.\n\nAs for what was inside, I don't really know. I was 13 at the time and didn't ask many questions. Before the door broke my mom would spend most of her nights down there. I know because I would wake up several times a week to sounds coming from the basement (my room was adjacent to it on the first floor).\n\nMy older sister apparently asked about it once, and my parents said \"it was a workshop.\" Before we moved out our cat Mistletoe clawed a hole in the cardboard one night and went down there. I never saw her again. My mom said she jumped out the little window that leads to the yard and escaped. The thing is, that window was bolted shut! I know because I tried to climb through it before.\n\nI loved our cat so after we packed up and moved out, I had the dad of a friend of mine drive the two of us over to the old house. It was unlocked for potential buyers since we still hadn't sold it when we had to leave. We went in and lo and behold the door was just as we left it, eerie and papered up.\n\nWe tore the cardboard off piece by piece and went  down the stairs. The electricity was turned off so it was dark, be we weren't stupid - we brought flashlights.\n\nAs we made our way down the stairs we heard heavy panting and suddenly, a shrill scream. \"Don't you fucking come down here, Alex, I'll fucking slit your throat in your god damn sleep you hear?!\" This scared me for three reasons: The sudden sound emanating from the darkness, the person knew my name, and the voice was that of my mother's.\n\nSince I knew it was her I dashed down the stairs and flashed the light in her eyes. There she lay on the floor, completely nude, fingers in her vagina, staring right back at me. My buddy quickly ran over to her and began fondling her breasts. Being 13 and sexually inexperienced, all I could say was, \"Why is your hand in there, mom?\"\n\n\"I'm looking for some loose change, Alex, want to help?\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked. She said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I realized my mom was eight stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again! I stood there screaming at her as she swam away into the distance.\n\nI never did reconcile with my parents after that.\n\nYears later, here I am reading a comment about my old house and it certainly brought back some eerie memories... I hope this story clears things up for you, mate.\n\n\nEdit: [More creepy stuff that happened to me](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/28j9nq/i_have_thin_walls/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403161470", "subreddit": "creepy", "score": 661, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I remember this guy who wrote about the time he was housesitting when a special oversized load UPS truck rolled up along with a mobile crane.  At first he assumed this had nothing to do with his friend's house, so he smoked his pipe a little and watched as the crane deployed heavy support structures for stability.  A hook on that crane looped into a harness surrounding the gargantuan wooden box on the back of that truck.  This oversized load was coming right his way.  In shock, he spilled his weed all over the carpet.\n\nThen he stood transfixed as workmen eased it down onto the front lawn.  Next, in a remarkable flurry of activity, off they went without so much as a knock on the door.  This housesitter thought about how that huge crate, if left in place long enough, might damage the grass underneath.  \"Grass!\" he thought suddenly, crouching to start cleaning up the mess he just made.  A good bit of it could be cleaned up, but some had to be vacuumed and tossed out.  He dropped a tear for it.  Nobody ever says \"don't cry over spilled weed.\"\n\nAnyway, by the time our intrepid stoner-housesitter cleaned up the carpet, put a pizza in the oven without turning it on, then microwaved and ate a Hot Pocket, the sun had gone down.  That huge box looked much more sinister when lit only by the stars and a streetlight on the corner three houses away.  He went outside to better assess the situation, but brief bursts of flickering Bic were not enough to spot any documents or labels associated with the shipment.  Just as he turned to head inside for a flashlight, a mighty trumpeting call reverberated throughout the neighborhood.  As people started stepping outside to look, a low rumble of speech emanated from inside the box, \"hey, is someone out there?\"  \n\nNow our surprised housesitter felt obligated to be brave.  It wouldn't be long before his friend's neighbors showed up to investigate, and he needed to have answers for the obvious questions.  \"Yes.  I'm Jake.  Pleased to meet you,\" the man replied, doing his best not to sound nervous.  As an afterthought, he added, \"is there anything I can do to help?\"\n\nA nervous little cough from the low voice in the box was still loud enough to echo in the still evening air.  Then the enormous crustacean from the Paleozoic era within explained, \"yeah, I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403161639", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It was the most adrenaline pumping ride I've ever been on. I push off down the hill I go. The wind against my hair, my grey sweatshirt flying in the wind along with my black Rise Against shirt. It was amazing, first mile fine, second mile,.. Scary. As I gained speed my board wobbled but I fought to gain control. Then I seen it, the last mile. I passed 3rd street then it hit me... literately. The black Grand Am bashed into me, The snap of my board was accompanied by the snap of my leg and as I flew threw the air, I fell on my back. I spit up blood over my shirt and passed out. Beep.. Beep.. Beep.. Beep. I woke up, I was alive and in the hospital. My girlfriend, Naomi was crying over me and then looked up at me and seen me just waking up. I asked her where I was and what happened and she told me what had happened, that I had been crippled by the accident and that I wont walk again.. There's not much else to the story, no happy ending, not much else. My girlfriend left me later on though for unrelated reasons. It turns out she was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

It's an exchange of money for services at the practical aspect. And what is money but an abstract concept we use to prop up the great machine of capitalism. And without this great human charade the whole machine would fall apart and crumble. Think about if people like me stopped doing jobs, society as we know it would cease to exist. It really makes you think doesn't it? \n\nSo anyway, I'm walking along the beach when a frisbee sails just above my ahead and then hurtles forward out of my reach, onto adventures unknown and perhaps indubitably unknowable. What does this really mean though? Well it means everything really. To even conceive of the frisbee itself as a thing to itself requires such a wealth of concepts that I can hardly even describe them all in this small space. First one must engender the concept of an object. What is an object actually? Is it just a figment of our imaginations we use to simplify an incomprehensibly complex world? Can any \"object\" even exist outside of our minds? I ask these questions, and yet here I stand having seen a \"frisbee\" soar over my \"head\". How is it that I possess the almost incomprehensible power to reduce the chaotic and inhuman universe into such simple human concepts. I am clearly a very powerful being indeed. \n\nBut why is it that I let the frisbee fly past me rather than catching it? What does this mean in terms of a social fabric that is no more real nay nor fake than the frisbee itself. Am I apart from the carefree and idyllic frisbee throwers? Do they even know I exist? Woah, I have to take a break all this thinking is blowing my \"mind\"...\n\nOK I'm back. I just saw a turtle which is really even more profound than the frisbee was if you really stop and think about it. I mean what would it be like to be a turtle? I don't know because I'm not a turtle. We believe that there is something it is like to be a turtle, but we cannot know this FOR WE ARE NOT TURTLES! I dreamed I was a turtle once, but is is not the same thing. I think the turtle is looking at me. It probably can't even comprehend such deep thoughts as the ones I am having. It cannot recognize the irony of being able to invoke thoughts in my mind more complex than anything in its limited turtle world. Oh well. People are better than turtles. You can quote me on that. I will stand up for my species, homo sapien sapien, when push comes to shove.\n\nFinally, a customer approaches, to help me complete my function as one of the arbiters of the modern financial system we live in. She asks me for a Klondike bar, and I reach into my cooler to provide it. It is amazing how this simple box is able to withhold the loss of entropy inevitable throughout the universe for a little while. But as I reach my hand in, I partially heat it, thereby speeding up the heat death of the entire universe. I wish I was a simple creature like that turtle, incognizant of my own inevitable demise. I hand the girl the Klondike bar, and she asks me how much it costs. I tell her that in the end, it may cost her everything, or nothing. But in the immediate practical sense, I tell her that it will only cost three dollars and fifty cents. She hears this and a sudden realization dawns across her face. She looks at my scaly green face and realizes that I am not really a human, homo sapien sapien, but am in fact a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era. She throws the Klondike bar back at me and conveys loudly that she will not be giving me three dollars and fifty sense, all simply because I am the Loch Ness Monster. Ah how cruel fate is, denying me money simply because I a monster. But what is a \"monster\" anyway? Think about it for a minute... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403231084", "subreddit": "worststory", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "EDIT: No this is not a tree fiddy story.\n\nI'm actually from Vegas, which is relatively close to this place. My friends and I stayed there one night as a dare on ourselves, but we wound up with an awesome story! Yes indeed this place is right next to a graveyard, but some other facts you may not know about Clown Motel:\n\n    It's owned by one family\n    They all work there, including the 9 year old girl (I guess she's 12 now)\n    The dad is blind but is still somehow sitting at the front desk in complete clown get up every day\n    The grave yard is still in use I think; we could see several freshly excavated graves from our window view and a few others that looked recently filled\n    The sound insulation is CRAZY, like you can't hear anyone from your adjacent rooms or outside at all. We had two adjoining rooms and pounding on the wall barely made the slightest noise in the other room.\n\nNow for the story. About three years ago a group of us stayed at the Clown Motel in Tonopah, NV. We booked two nights and two separate but adjoining rooms.\n\nWe came in and like I said, the first thing you see is the blind dad in full clown attire, and clown decorations EVERYWHERE. Like, including the ceiling.\n\nThe whole family works there, so the mom was running the computer/register. We checked in, got our keys and went to our rooms.\n\nThe rooms themselves are pretty normal motel rooms, what you'd expect from a Motel 6 or something, only with a couple weird clown portraits.\n\nDay 1 went by smoothly, we hung out, explored outside a bit, smoked some weed, ate and went to bed. Night 1 went by without any problems too.\n\nThe morning is when things got weird. First of all, our drug dealer Spencer allegedly lost all of his supplies. At first it was just the weed he brought into the hotel, but when he went to the car to grab more from his stash - it was gone. The dude lost a good half of his supply (he only deals to friends). His supply consisted of marijuana, MDMA, cocaine and shrooms. This is important so remember that.\n\nCommence him freaking out, cursing, screaming and accusing all of us. We searched everywhere but couldn't find it. During the commotion we noticed a little girl staring into our room from the window. This was the daughter (when you check in they introduce the family). She just kept staring at us and we stared at her, not sure what to do.\n\nAfter several seconds she took her finger and began writing something on the window. The glass was caked in dust so her scrawling were fairly legible. I was surprised that she wrote it backwards, too, so that the letters faced the right direction for us.\n\nIt spelled, \"Run or hide or die.\"\n\nIt was pretty fucking chilling. We went to open the door and as soon as we moved she ran away.\n\nWhatever, kids are fucking crazy, so we calmed Spencer down, promised to all pitch in for new stuff, and went on with the day.\n\nMidnight comes around and we are about to head to bed when we hear what sounds like heavy bass from downstairs. Remember, the insulation here was INSANE, so whatever was making that sound was loud as fuck.\n\nWe got dressed and went downstairs. There were eight of us so we weren't exactly scared. Just really weirded out.\n\nDownstairs the bass become louder, and it became clear it was music being blasted. It was from a room behind the front desk. Kayliegh in our group said that the family lives in there, she apparently asked what the door was for when we were checking in.\n\nWell we couldn't sleep with the bass vibrating in our rooms like that, so we decided to knock. Stupid in hindsight, they couldn't hear us.\n\nAll of a sudden Spencer starts screaming and we see him lift a chair and toss it at their window. I remember saying \"What the fuck man?!\"\n\nHe was still shouting, \"Those fuckers took my shit! Look!\" He pointed under the counter behind the front desk. Indeed, that was his bag of drugs, pills scattered about on the shelf underneath the counter. The coke bag was torn open, it looked like only a little bit of the Molly was there, and there were no shrooms at all in there.\n\nWeirdly enough, all the weed was still in the pouch, untouched.\n\nWithin a few seconds he was already running to grab another chair to toss through the window again (the glass only cracked from the first one).\n\nWe were about to stop him but were still fucking confused.\n\nKeep in mind the window had curtains behind it so we couldn't see a single thing inside.\n\nThe second chair broke the window and all the glass came crashing down. He was jumping through the hole faster than any of us could even say not to.\n\nWe followed him in, mostly to get him the hell out of there because at this point if cops got called we would be in deep shit. Tons of drugs, property damage, breaking and entering and perhaps even assault if Spencer got his hands on those creepy clown folk.\n\nThe thing is, when the window broke the music from inside blasted through the lobby. Holy. Fucking. Shit. I've gone to tons of concerts and this didn't compare. It was so damn loud. It sounded like really fucked up electronic music with an incredibly fast tempo, probably around 180 BPM. It made horrible screeching sounds too.\n\nBehind the shattered window, in the room, was the whole family, staring blankly at us and not moving. Even the blind dad, still in his clown get up mind you, was facing us and not moving. In unison they fucking began opening their jaws and pointing at Spencer. We were in shock. We just stood there like idiots, the strobe light from inside blinding us didn't help. Suddenly they began to fucking run at Spencer, fingers pointed towards him, jaws agape.\n\nAnyways we left later that night. Pretty weird trip.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403244691", "subreddit": "creepy", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Reminds me of a young cellist from Valencia I once met during a common walk I can be found taking on Ash Wednesday on the Pilgrim's route to La Iglesia de Asuncion. He had been increasingly troubled by a ligament inflammation just below his kneecap, and had stopped by the local hostel to rest for a while as his bike was being repaired in a nearby shop. You see, this particular noveau-troubadeur had until recently been feeling uninspired in his music, and had concluded the problem was the disorganization of his love life, which, though usually stimulating to the career of a young artist, had been problematic in his creative flow. Thus, he inquired with an octogenarian advisor in his hometown of Valencia, who suggested he may attract more attention untowards if he became physically fit. So as he recounted his gradual development in the cycling community and subsequent rise in both his creativity and dating acumen, I realized that I had forgotten to pay the tab on our drinks, which he had kindly offered to let me pay for. We continued chatting, and as the sky was stained with crimsons and violets, his concessions became greater and his liver fuller. I was about ready to finish my last drink myself, and perhaps escort the thoroughly sodden man back to his suite overlooking the Rio Ayotac before he collapsed over himself on the floor of the Hostel's bar, when he whispered incomprehensibly something to me. I leaned in to him, and though his breath smelled of tequila and afterdinner mints, listened to him repeat the inquiry.    \n\n*\"¿Puedo preguntarle algo de ti?\"*   \n\nThough his words are muddled by his drunken slur and thick East Iberian accent, I was able enough to understand them without need of my translator. In spanish, I asked thusly of him.\n\n*\"What do you want, señor?\"*\n\nHe coughed, his greased brown hair shaking in the chill of a brisk Mexican night. Again he leaned into me, his arm hung across my shoulder and the other swinging aside his shorn coat with an empty glass in its palm. \n\n*\"Necesito unos tres dolares y cincuenta centavos...\"*\n\nIt was about this time I realized the young cellist was in fact a 50 story tall pleiosaur from the Mesozoic Era!\n\n*\"Dios mio, Nessie, no tengo tres dolares y cincuenta centavos!\"*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403247637", "subreddit": "userbattleslounge", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I just got back from a three country hop around Europe. Scotland, Ireland, and France. \n\nIreland was semi boring. Weather was cruddy making the country side we did see covered in fog. Not much to see. \n\nFrance was nice. Paris was just weird. But the first days there we were in Normandy. Seeing the beaches of the D-Day invasion just a week and a half after the 70th anniversary of the liberation was thought provoking and insightful. I had never seen so many American flags flown proudly out side of the US. The French in general may dislike Americans but that small stretch of country side has a love for us unlike any I have seen any where. \n\nThe story I want to relate though happened in the first few days of the trip. Scotland. My ancestral country. My grandfather came over right after WWII so it was nice to see the places he lived as a boy and see \"home\". I smoked a few cigars on that leg of the trip. I posted one here. An LFD at the Falkirk wheel boat lock. Amazing smoke spot, amazing cigar.\n\nBut there was one cigar I had there, that will forever be burned in my memory. \n\nI was sitting near a small town named Drumnadrochit in the highlands of Scotland. On a bench overlooking the countryside I decided to light up a good sized Toro Undercrown. As I sit there enjoying the aroma of the stick mixed with the fresh highland air, the beautiful landscape, I couldn't help but think that I should move there. \n\nAbout halfway through the stick an older gentleman sat down near me. I guess he didn't notice my cigar at first but after a few puffs blew in his direction he looked over and spotted it. He got up and came over to say hello (in the most Scottish of accents) and we got to talking about cigars and how this was a great spot to relax and enjoy one. I offered him a cigar from my herfador, which he thought was cool, he accepted my offer and smoked a Padron 2000 with me. He produced a flask from inside his suit coat and offered me a sip of some scotch with a terribly hard to pronounce name. I can't even remember it now. We sat in silence for a while and just soaked up the bliss we were in. We conversed in spurts, him asking more questions then I. Why I was there, what I was hoping to see, any Scottish blood, that sort of thing. I had really enjoyed my time with him but we were getting down to the last bit of cigar. He asked me one last question. \"Could you spare tree fiddy?\" Well it was about that time that I notice that old man was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era! I said \"Dammit monster! Get off my bench! I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" He then scampered off back to the nearby Loch Ness and I didn't see him again.

{"body": "Mine has a little story to go along with it...\n\nSo, a few years back I lived in a semi-large city. Nothing like L.A. or New York, but of a respectable size all the same. My friends and I were out at a park in the nice part of town when we hear a loud bang and a crash from somewhere behind us. The three of us look at each other in confusion and I say, \"that sounded like an explosion.\" Scared, but also wanting to figure out what made that terrible, echoing racket, we ventured up the street. When we arrived to where we thought the origin of this sound was we just stood there in disbelief. Covering the road in front of us was a massive pile-up of at least four cars and a semi-truck, some of the cars had flipped and there was a little fire burning underneath the semi. You can't imagine the feeling that went through us, this was like something out of an action movie and we were the only ones around. So of course we tried to help in whatever way we could. One of my buddies called the cops and went looking for more people to help us get everyone we could out of the cars. (He was really squeamish and couldn't stand the sight of blood.) So my other friend and I go around the first car we see and the head straight for the big rig since it was on fire. We manage to open the door using a piece of metal we found on the ground as leverage. The truck driver seems okay, he was conscious and looking at us, so I cut his seat belt (lucky he was wearing it other wise he probably would have flown through the window) and we manage to pull him out and set him on a bus bench a little ways away from everything. By this time the friend that went looking for help came back with an older guy that looked homeless, but we were glad for the help. He helped us with the flipped car while my friend looked after the trucker. The old guy looked like he had had a few experiences like this and I knew for sure when he looked inside the flipped car and told us to move on to another one, those people were dead. I had never dealt with death before, so that took some time after everything was over to figure out. But back to the wrecks, we go for one of the other cars and this guy looks fine but is unconscious, knowing that moving him could risk paralysis we decide to do it anyway because the fire under the semi was growing and we didn't know how long we had. As we were dragging him over the the sidewalk we hear police/firetruck sirens and breath a sigh of relief, help was on it's way. The firemen arrive soon after we hear the sirens and they take over the rescue effort for the remaining cars as well as the semi fire. My friends and I get interviewed by the police, they take down all our information, and we were free to go. This whole thing was over in about twenty minutes.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, my friends and I had been called down to the Police station a few times to answer all their questions and get the story straight. After that was over we asked if we could visit the people in the hospital, the officer in charge said yes. Delighted by that we walked down to the hospital that was only a few blocks away, and who do we chance upon? The old homeless guy that helped us with the wreckage. Turns out he had been trying to see the survivors for a couple of days now but they wouldn't let him in. So naturally we vouched for him and because the police had called ahead we were all allowed to visit. The trucker was awake and sitting up, so we talked to him for a few minutes. He thanked us profusely for saving his life, and wanted to pay us as a reward, but he was broke. My friends and I turned him down point blank stating that we didn't want or need a reward for just doing what any decent person would have done. The four of us then go to the bedside of the single unconscious man. A woman, maybe mid thirties is siting with him. She's silently crying. As we approach she looks up at us, glances at the man and comes over to us. She asks us in a hushed voice if we were the people to save her husband. We nod and quietly say yes, we were. She thanks us again and again, hugging us each. Apparently he husband was the CEO of some big name company that was relocating to my city and their company was in limbo between offices so business had stopped. Luckily he had called her right before the crash telling her of a great new space that he found so their business that they started in their garage was going to live on. As she said this she looked back at him, I'm sure thinking about how he might not. She turned her attention back to us and said if there was anything we wanted she would make it happen as a thanks for saving her husbands life. My friend and I told her the same thing we told the trucker, despite being tempted for a second. But the old man had a odd look on his face, and after we told her \"no thanks\" he spoke up. He said, \"Well miss I don't mean to pry or nothin but you and your husband there are rich, ain't ya? Now I'm a simple man, but recently I've been livin on the streets and I know of one thing that would make everything easier. How about tree fiddy? He got all giggly and started shouting about his loch ness monster while twirling his hands in the air.

Science can only prove something exists which may contradict another belief. Such as proving the earth revolves around the sun, which in turn contradicts the ancient belief that the world sat atop a great turtle. When it comes to God belief science had done an excellent job of proving facts that directly contradict all sorts of variables people attribute to a deity. However, while science is good at building verifiable models of the universe, people are equally good at talking their way around them. A belief that was once considered absolute in the dark ages soon becomes figurative during the enlightenment, and then goes so far as to be mere metaphor in the modern era. \n\nAt one time people believed the world was created in six days because the Bible said so. Then science came around and told them the word was far older than the Bible could have possible understood. So people began to claim that the \"days\" were not exactly twenty-four hour periods and were instead just phrases meaning an era or period of time. Then science proved man was not made from dirt and that the entire order of the creation myth was inaccurate. So people began to claim that the entire story was just a metaphor for what their God really did when he made the universe. One by one science proves reality is one way, and one by one believers water down the definition of their God to fit just outside the limits of the known universe. \n\nThere is no difference between the rationalization methods of a theist and that of a Bigfoot hunter.

This is a serious topic and I wouldn't want no goddamn lochness monstah to trivialize it. \n\nWith that said, I'll answer anyways.\n\nI haven't even told this story to my kids (but I plan to when they're old enough to understand). To this day, it is the single biggest regret of my life.\n\nI can't get into specifics, but we were on a mission and I got an order that I knew would have killed a large number of civilians. One of the civilians that would likely have been killed was a small boy that I had grown quite fond of (Let's call him Hammed). Hammed was about 8 years old and he didn't speak a word of English. He would always come up to us with this beaten up soccer ball he had and we'd kick the ball back and forth with him.\n\nI questioned the officer about the order, but he wasn't disclosing any more information about it.\n\nSo here's the situation I was in; I knew what the order was, I knew it would kill a large amount of civilians (and likely Hammed), but I was never told exactly *why* it had to be done.\n\nNow, here's the thing; I *thought* I knew why. Even though the officer didn't tell me, I thought I knew the reason why the command was issued. And in my mind, what I *thought* the reason was, didn't justify taking the lives of those civilians.\n\nSo I ignored the order.\n\nAs a direct result, about 3 times as many people wound up losing their lives as would have, had I followed the order. Some of them were American soldiers. One of them was a good friend of mine.\n\nIt turned out that I was wrong about the reason why the order was issued.\n\nYou see, the real reason why the order was issued was because the previous day, Hammed had approached one of our officers on the field.\n\nHammed's old beaten up soccer ball was completely flat, and he presented it to the officer. As great of a guy as this officer was, he was also a bit naive. He offered to buy Hammed a new ball. \"How much do you need?\" he had asked (more to himself than to Hammed).\n\nBut to his surprise, Hammed actually responded. It turned out that he *did* speak English. \n\nHammed looked the officer dead in the eyes and said, \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was then that the officer noticed that Hammed was actually a 50 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\nAnd that's why you always use a serious tag.\n\n\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1403348439", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 412, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was walking home with a friend after a night out at town. We lived in a small village near the town, with the walk only taking half an hour or so. We were walking beside an empty road. It was raining, but we were to drunk to care about getting wet.\n\nSuddenly, bright lights emerge from behind us. A wheel round and see a car speeding towards us. It swerves to the right and falls down a bank and lands in a lake.\n\nMy friend starts laughing, he doesn't realize what's going on. My drunk-self tells me that it's a good idea to inspect the car, so I slipped down the bank and looked at the destruction. The car was half submerged in the lake and it was sinking; sinking fast.\n\n\"Help me!\" I hear a man in the car cry, \"My kids stuck in here! Help!\". I instantly take of my shirt (even though it was already wet from the heavy rain) and leap into the water. I start drowning. My drunk-self has no idea what's going on.\n\n\"Help!\" I hear the kid wail. He must have been around five or six years old. I instantly realized what was happening and I cried out to them.\n\n\"I'm coming!\". I slowly swam over to the car and opened the door. \n\n\"I can't!\" the driver said. He looked at me with a face that reeked of embarrassment. \"I can't swim\". The driver was a fourteen year old boy.\n\n\"Fucks sake\" I sigh. I quickly spot the other kid clinging onto the driver for dear life. \n\n\"My seat belt is stuck. Please can you undo it?\". I started furiously messing with the seat belt, as the car was submerged lower into the icy grips of the lake. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Holy shit\" my friend says. He has been surrounded by a police car. I stagger back onto shore, carrying the two boys. \n\n\"The hell happened?\" a police officer asked, \"I saw this car speeding through town a mile back, so me and my partner chased after it. The next thing we know it's in a lake\". I threw up on the ground and fell on my face. \n\n\"Had a lot of drink\" my friend giggled. I laughed with him. Rescuing two kids from a drowning car, whilst drunk, is a damn impressive feat.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe six year old kid was taken home and his older brother was taken to the town's police station. I later learned that he stole the car in the town and decided to drive it around. The owners of the car sued. How much did they sue him for?

{"body": "There are a few GOOD ways, I'll try to break them appart in several easy steps.\n\nFirst method :\n\nIt all depends on the reason you want to break up, determine that first.\n\nOnce you're set on the reason why (it usually is 1. Lack of affection, 2. Lack of physical desire or 3, there's someone else) then focus on that.\n\nBe truthful about it, the worst you can get is a soon-to-be-ex-SO screaming some \"WHHHYYYYY?!?!\"s in your parent's basement, so, if you look decided, frank, and not careless, the other will see you put some thoughts into it and don't want to go back a few hours later.\n\nNext, don't be a pussy about it, don't let yourself get caught in an in-and-out relationship, even if the sex was good or your mother is so sad that you broke up with the nicest girl you could ever get. If you have a lot of friends in common, stay close, it doesn't matter since the line is clearly drawn on both sides.\n\nSecond method :\n\nAsk a good friend to do it for you. If it was good for highschool bitches, why wouldn't it be good for you? You're the Alpha male, get your job done by others! (Or otters, if you're really into raising wild animals to do your boring chores).\n\nPlus, if the cunt doesn't understand why you didn't have time to lose with her anymore, tell all her friends she has a penis-like clit, they'll love it and she'll probably change school, problem solved!\n\nTurd method :\n\nBring her on a nice vacation, let's say in Scotland. Bring her to see a bagpipes concert, some kilted local folks and keep the best for the very end, the Loch Ness!\n\nThen, wait for a big sea monster (well big lake monster in that case) ask her for tree fiddy. When she refuses, use that excuse to dump her right away, you won't have to explain shit as it will be obvious. With some luck, she'll be eaten by Nessy.\n\nGood luck with those!

I smelled something off about half way through, but didn't really realize what it was at the time. We hit it off, though, so I'm totally stoked.  \n  \nA few weeks go by of us talking and hanging out and the smell is always there, but not obnoxious enough or I'm not close enough to realize it's her or maybe I'm just in denial, who knows. We're talking every day, we're really starting to get close and I finally work up the balls to ask her on a date. Dinner and a movie. Dinner is great, we're having a good time and whatnot. Then we get to the movie. Rom-com, of course and I slyly get my arm around her and she cuddles up close and we're cuddling and then the smell gets to me again. I think this about when I realized it was her, but I was too deep. I had to keep on it.  \n  \nApex scene of the movie comes. Protagonist fervently making out with the girl of his dreams on camera and she turns to me and I know this is it. I bide my breath, let her get close, but it's just too much. I stop her and I tell her the truth and she starts crying telling me she really likes me and she doesn't know what the problem is. I felt so bad. She tells me she needs to go, but she doesn't want me to drive her home because she's upset. So she asks for $3.50 for cab fare. It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

And I'm not talking about let's-all-have-a-wee-cup-of-tea Scotland; I mean stabbing-capital-of-the-world, gang violence Scotland.  This man knows his way around an ass whooping. \n\nHaving a Scottish father is a double-edged sword.  On one hand, I was generally allowed to drink and have parties with little to no recourse.  On the other hand, having had many friends end up in prison (or worse, dead) from drugs, my dad was not so cool with illicit substances.  And, when I say \"not so cool with,\" what I really mean is \"really, really, really not fucking cool with.\"\n\nWell, senior year came along and the inevitable happened: a trusted friend of mine started smoking weed and turned me on to the joys of getting stoned, eating Eggo waffles and listening to Pink Floyd.\n\nMy old man does not fuck around with finding contraband. He found a cap gun hidden in my room when I was very young.  Took me outside and made me watch as he reduced it to dust with a sledgehammer.  Suffice it to say, I was going to need to get creative with where to hide my goods. \n\nThis is what I came up with:\n\nI had a metal garbage can in my room with a self-closing lid.  I never really used it.  I had also recently purchased a Game Boy Advance.  So, I had my mean green in a sealed zip-lock bag, which I then wrapped in aluminum foil to make sure the smell wasn't likely to get out. I then put that aluminum foil inside the GBA packaging, which was then placed inside a GameStop bag.  I put it at the bottom of my trash can which I then covered in some non-gross, authentic-looking garbage.  \n\nSuffice it to say, my dad never found my stash.  I smoked infrequently enough that the ordeal of getting it out wasn't too much of a hassle.\n\nHe also never asked if he could borrow about tree fiddy. \n\nTL;DR:  Hid my stash in a ziplock bag wrapped in aluminum foil which was then placed inside a Game Boy Advance box, wrapped in a Gamestop bag and placed at the bottom of my rarely-used self-closing bedroom garbage can.

{"body": "It was was my 19th birthday, so me and my buddies decided to celebrate by going to the bars at my college campus (minimum age is 19). I usually don't drink too much, but, since it was a special occasion, I decided to get really fucking wasted. We pregramed a lot before the bar, since it's difficult to obtain alcohol in a bar when none of us are 21, plus it's really expensive so I wasn't trying too hard to get my friends with fake IDs to buy me some. I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my fucking\t mind.\n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this really sexy chick dancing by herself. Being drunk as fuck , I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance sexy? Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up grinding hard/making out a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes.\n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated. We were making out a lot on my bed, and we took off each others shirts and things were really escalating. I had her panties off, and I was starting to think me losing my virginity was a sure thing. I could tell she was really into it. She said \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". I figured she meant me going down on her, and me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\". Then the question came: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"I aint givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!

{"body": "My number is 3. My game is Hammerwatch. Just wanted to say, thanks for the giveaway!\n\nI'll tell you a story.\n\nA couple years ago, I knew a guy, let's call him John, who was a kinda cool guy. He was into gaming and whatnot, and we used to hang out, along with my other friends. We talked about games and the like, but we never really talked about platforms. \n\nAfter a couple months, we were talking, and I mentioned that I played on Steam. He told me that he thought that playing on PC was stupid and that console was clearly better. I asked him why, and he spouted the usual BS about ease of use and whatnot. I provided counterexamples, but he would have none of it.  I skirted around the topic, and went forward.\n\nWe continued to hang out, and around this time he started spouting more nonsense about how useless PC's are and how consoles are truly great. It was difficult to hear one of my friends talk like this, and so irrationally at that, but I bore with it. \n\nAfter about three months of this, I decided that enough was enough. I invited him over to my house to play, and he agreed (because I told him I had a PS3). When he came over, I told him that he would have to try the PC at least once. He was very gracious, but remained adamant that consoles were better, and complained about mouse and keyboard and not playing on a big TV. I decided to let it go. \n\nHowever, near the end of the school year (this was the end of 8th grade), he came to me and said that he had been researching recently, and saw that he had been wrong in all his ways. He apologized for all of the things he had said wrong, and particularly for the rude tone he had used. \n\nHe told me he was saving up for his build, and was near his goal. Unfortunately, his neighbors did not too many more chores for him to do, and thus he didn't think he could muster quite enough for the build. I promised that I would help him out  if he would need it, and he was very thankful grateful.\n\nAfter the summer, he contacted me and told me that he was almost at his goal, and he was planning to use his soon-to-be rig to start learning programming and do some other useful things. I told him that I was quite happy, and if he needed any more money to finally finish up the fund for his rig.\n\nHe said that he did, and I asked him how much. He looked at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my newly converted friend was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed.

One day, a couple came in, but you could immediately tell that the woman was in an abusive relationship. The customers around them felt uneasy because you could visibly see bruises and scars.\n\nThe entire time they were in line, the man was verbally abusing her. Telling her that she was worthless and would never amount to anything. He also told her that she would be nothing without him and that her life wouldn't even be worth living. The woman just stood there with a defeated look on her face. Some customers actually got up and left the restaurant in disgust.\n\nWe finish making their sandwiches, but when it came time to pay, he didn't have enough money. He then told her to give the remaining amount, but she told him she had forgotten her purse at home. He got really upset and started shouting profanities at her and telling her how he would beat her if she didn't give him the rest of the money needed for the sandwiches.\n\nAnother guy in line walked up to him in defense for the woman and they got into a fist fight. Unfortunately, the abusive guy got the upper hand and beat up the guy pretty hard. At this time, one of my co-workers hit the switch to call the police to get in. Other people tried to intervene, but the abusive guy ended up being able to fend for himself and fled before the police got there.\n\nThe woman was crying and we felt bad for her so we decided to give her the sandwiches for free, but she refused saying she wouldn't feel right about it and should at least pay for it.\n\nAnother customer felt bad for her and decided to pay for the rest. She came up and asked the woman, \"How much did you need?\"\n\nThe abused woman replied, \"It looks like I'm short about tree fiddy.\"\n\nThen everyone in the store realized that the woman was actually a 500 foot tall Loch Ness monster.

Everybody was hammered and having a great time playing drinking games and rocking out to music. At the peak of that party, there were so many people that no one could really move, but everyone was too drunk to care. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the one girl that got away. Her name was Suzy, and I had a serious crush on her in middle and high school. Back then, I was pretty shy around girls and was too scared to tell her how I felt, so naturally we went our separate ways. I stumbled over to her at the party and she immediately recognized me. We started catching up and she told  me she had a confession to make. She told me that back in middle school she was infatuated with me and had wanted to me to ask her out. I had no idea back then and told her how I felt too. I leaned in to kiss her and we sloppily made out for like 15 minutes. We went in the bathroom together to continue to make out and one thing led to another. She got up afterwards with a huge smile on her face and leaned in really close to ask me something. Quietly she said, \"Ima need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time I realized she was an eight story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said, \"NO goddam it, monsta.

If I moved out from under it, a few seconds later, BAM! After about an hour it started to subside and I carefully got back into bed. Woke up just a few mins later with it happening again.

We are well aware of the homeless problems that can be seen in large cities such as this one. Anyway we were on our way to see a broadway show late at night. It was to see the play \"Rent\" now usually I am not a man to go see theater shows but I was in New York so why not? On our way there we meet a seemingly homeless man that is having a sidewalk sale. We decide to see what he had to offer. It turns out he was homeless, but he was extremely smart and I felt like I was talking to my grandfather when I spoke to him ( I felt like he had a lot to share with his experiences on the street). So I decide to ditch my friends and listen to this guy talk for hours. You could only imagine the things that this man had to say! I asked him if he wanted to get coffee across the street and continue to tell me his life story, it was just then when he told me the most prolific thing I have heard to date. He whispered something faint. I nearly had to lean over his table to listen. He said that he had no money and\"can you spare tree fiddy\" Well it was about this time that I noticed that the homeless man  was actually 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. Once I realized that I told him \"goddamn lochness monster, I ain't givin' you no three fiddy!\".\n\nTL;DR Never trust a homeless mans advice..\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403620110", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have looked to other sources A LOT. People don't just become atheists because they \"don't want to believe\" or \"are angry at God\" or \"want to sin\" or any of that nonsense. The only way to jump to a conclusion on the matter at this point is to \"believe\". There is literally NO evidence to support any god. Not one single shred. Everything that has ever been attempted to be explained by a magical being caused it, outside the start of everything of course, has been literally trounced - undeniably proven incorrect. And it's just a matter of time on that last one.\n\nWe don't need a god to explain the start of everything either. With time, like everything else, answers come. It's up to you as a believer (assuming you want others to believe) to bring evidence to the table. Other than that, the default position is not to believe. There's no shame in saying \"I don't know\" with regards to anything. The only wrong way to do it is to try to fill the gap with \"no one knows so God did it.\" Atheists are also not as \"dead against God\" as theists are dead against anything logical. If you brought even one piece of evidence, that would immediately turn us on our heads and get us to be more open to it. Science (and scientifically minded people) don't have a position to defend, they have no interest at all in proving any \"side\" wrong, they only seek answers that are supported with evidence and testable, independently verifiable. As soon as something is shown to be wrong, it's abandoned, and admitted to be wrong.\n\nAs for God being outside the space time continuum, again, if you can't show it, you don't know it. If you don't have evidence, the default position is to not believe it. It's not up to us to disprove God anymore than it's up to you to actively disprove the Loch Ness Monster.

{"body": "Well its kinda a long story. I met her in high school, lets call her Linda. I had just gotten out of a terrible relationship and I was taking it kinda hard. That was until I met Linda.\n\nIt was summer of 11th grade and my father had just purchased a boat, so naturally being a shitty son, Me and my buddies would take the boat out during the day when he wasn't home. One day we beached it, man we were in some shit. Three of us couldn't get this boat off this dune, we needed help, and fast. We saw some girls swimming not to far away, they had already seen us and they were laughing. We asked them for help and they obliged. Before I could even tell them anything this girl had just started rocking the boat off the dune. I was amazed. I mean three of us couldn't do it, and this chick just made it look so easy. I was in love. I thanked them profusely and explained how much shit they, well, she had just gotten me out of. I asked her if I could take her out later and buy her dinner anything she wanted for helping us, I know smooth right? She said yes how about fish? I myself love fish. I felt like a had won the lottery. \n\nI ask my dad if I could take the boat out tonight to take a girl out on a date. He reluctantly said yes. So I call her up and say a bunch of stupid shit because I'm nervous but arrange to pick her up at the dock, she was taking a cad there, something about her crazy dad. I arrive and she looks beautiful. She gets in the boat. its a tight fit but we make it work. the motor struggles and off we go to my favorite sea food restaurant (franks).\n\nWe have a lovely dinner I couldn't believe how much she and I had in common. To be honest the dinner was kinda a blur at this point. I was head over heels. I didn't want the night to end but she insisted she had to get back. So I pay and off we go back to the boat. She slowly came on to me on the ride back and next thing you know we're making out. I'm in shock about how fast this day turned around for me. Her dad calls her and sounds super pissed so we haul ass back to her place. I drop her and the dock and ask her if shed like to do it again. She said of course e30jawn! I'd love too! but there's one problem she said. I don't have any money for the taxi and if i don't get home soon my dads never gonna let me back out. I quickly dove for my wallet and asked her how much she would need. She replied about tree fiddy. Right then and there I realized this was no girl at all! This was a 500 foot tall monster from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "I was at my cousin's wedding once when something close to this happened, but it was narrowly averted. My cousin's ex-boyfriend had been invited, but he showed up clearly pretty drunk. My uncle was keeping an eye on him from a distance, and he was pretty pissed about the guy being drunk already. It was a pretty clear disaster waiting to happen. \n\nAnyway, this drunk guy was milling about with the rest of the guests waiting for the wedding to start, but he was mainly sticking to one group of guys who were mutual friends with the bride and groom and this ex. They were trying to get him to cool off, but apparently he was making shitty rude comments about the groom and whining about the wedding. My uncle was getting angrier and angrier, and I was actually getting kind of worried that he might try to fight the guy or something. My uncle had paid a lot for this wedding, and this was his only kid that was getting married so he had been really stoked about it from the beginning. He *loved* the groom, too, so this dickhead ex even stirring up the slightest trouble got my uncle pretty riled up.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes before the ceremony was about to start, one of the guys from the group trying to keep control of this crazy ex came over to my uncle and told him that the ex was planning on objecting to the wedding. I was right by my uncle, so I heard everything. My uncle starting swearing and making very specific threats under his breath, and I was pretty sure he was going to possibly try to stab the guy or something, so I stepped in because I didn't want him to cause the scene he really wanted to avoid in the first place. I told him I would do what I could to handle the situation for him so he could enjoy his little girl's big day.\n\nSo I walked over to the guy and the friends around him and asked him to come with me around the side of the church. He resisted a bit, slurring and cursing, but I managed to drag him around out of sight. I'm not a fighter, so I wasn't about to try brawling with this idiot, but I had to try something. I figured I would at least try to reason with him, however drunk he was.\n\nI said, \"Look, man. This is a big day for a lot of people over there. You can't be objecting to this wedding.\"\n\nHe basically told me to fuck off and tried to push me out of the way and head back to the front of the church with his friends. I grabbed him by the arm to stop him. Knowing I had basically one chance to prevent this prick from making the huge scene he apparently desperately wanted to make, I figured maybe a bribe?\n\nI jerked his arm back and said, \"Look, dude. What's it going to take to get you to knock this shit off and go away.\"\n\nHe stood there looking at me for a second. I wasn't sure he even understood what I meant because he was so wasted, but then he finally said, \"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time I realized this ex-boyfriend was about a two hundred foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. I said, \"Goddammit, monster, I'm not giving you no damn tree fiddy!\" so he just swam away.\n\nEdit: Fixed two small errors, and thank you for supporting the reddit servers, stranger.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1403659820", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 341, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My friend and i bought one, cost us 20 GBP. Not a cheap board. \n\nWe set it up in his bedroom, ready to commune with ghosts. We'd heard that a daughter had lie in the house before my friend's family moved in about 20 years ago (we were 11 at the time) but the girl had gone missing and was never found. The family had sold the house to try and move on from the heart breaking memory. \n\nWe spoke ot neighbors and tried to learn as much as we could about the girl, so that she'd be friendly to us and we wouldn't have any paranormal activity type shit go down. Who you gonna call? Well the ghostbusters weren't real so we'd be in deep trouble. \n\nShe was 14 when she went missing, a quiet girl who kept to herself and a bit nerdy. Someone we could nearly relate to (being a bit nerdy ourselves). \n\nAs i said, we set the board up one sleepover in my friend's bedroom and lit 14 candles around the room (to try and please her). We had some of her favorite books out (we found out she was really into novels like Alice in Wonderland) and scented the room wth flowers fro mthe garden (our street has always been quite famous for roses). \n\nAs we held the cup, we began to feel it move. Of cours,e we both suspect eachother and open our eyes. One thing let to another and we got into a heated debate, until we noticed the cup was still moving. \n\nthe cup spelled out \n\nH\n\nE\n\nL\n\nL\n\nO\n\nWe were freaking out so much ,we asked her what her name was. \n\nA\n\nM\n\nA\n\nN\n\nD\n\nA\n\nWe asked her about her death, if she was happy, and it was going well. She knew a lot about the street. That is until we asked her about her books. 10 candles suddenly went out, and the books we had set up were thrown across the room. We were honestly freaked out. \n\nWe pleaded with her to tell us what's wrong, but she continued to freak out. We asked her what she wanted. \n\nT\n\nR\n\nE\n\nE\n\nF\n\nI\n\nD\n\nD\n\nY\n\nWell it was at that moment i realised there was 500ft tall, scaled monster from the paleolithic era holding some strings.

It didn't look overly dangerous, but I live in Australia, so skin cancer can be a pretty real thing down here. So, I thought I'd take a trip in to see a doctor about it just to be on the safe side. We have free primary health care in this country, I thought, why not use it, just in case this is something malicious.\n\nThe doctor took a good look, and couldn't determine from just looking whether it could be cancerous or not, though he was leaning more towards it being benign. He told me that I could have a small surgery to have it removed, but that it probably wasn't necessary. I thought that seemed a bit weird, my reasoning would have been that even a tiny chance it could be cancerous is reason to get it removed, since even if it wasn't, it's not like I'd have been losing anything.\n\nI mentioned this, and the doctor agreed, so we booked in a time for me to come back and have it removed. It would be a fairly easy procedure, I was told. A small local anesthetic to numb the area, then they'd cut it off, send the thing away for testing, then stitch me back up. Simple.\n\nI'd had a similar thing done before a few years prior to this, for a small cyst on my eyelid (called a chalazion) so I wasn't too worried, knew basically what to expect, etc.\n\nAnyway come the day, I show up to the surgery, the doctor has me lie down on his bed and props my arm up on a little table thing attached to the side of the bed, cleans off the area and disinfects it, the normal routine. Then in comes the anesthetist, to give me the needle for the local. I've had a few of those before, the one in my eyelid was the worst, so the little sting in my arm was hardly painful at all. After a few minutes, the doctor does a little prick test on my arm, and asks if I can feel it. I tell him I can't, so he gets to work, making an incision to start cutting the thing off.\n\nNow, I'm not that squeamish, but I don't really like watching someone cut into me, so I just try and study the patterns on the ceiling tiles. Like with most local anesthetics, even though it doesn't hurt, you can usually feel a little of what's happening; ie, you can feel some slight pressure as your skin is cut, but no pain. I tell the doc this when he asks if everything is going okay. A couple of minutes later, and he's still going, which surprised me a bit, since it wasn't the largest of lumps. Then I hear a soft \"hmmm.\" Then the doctor tells me that now he's cut it open, it looks like it goes a bit deeper beneath the skin than what he first thought. He's going to need to get the anesthetist back in for another shot so he can make a slightly larger incision to make sure he gets it all. \"Okay, no problem,\" I tell him, starting to worry slightly that maybe there really is something serious about the little lump.\n\nThat was when things went downhill. The anesthetist came back in, and told me that he'd been informed of the situation, but unfortunately medicare (our free medical system) could only cover the first local. For a second shot to allow the doctor to keep going, I was going to have to pay a fee. I protested then, because I thought that was pretty ridiculous. I was already halfway through the surgery, with a bit of my arm cut open, and nobody had warned me of this prior to the procedure. But the anesthetist was quite firm that was the only way I could get the second local anesthetic. So, I sighed, and asked how much it was going to be. The guy looked at me and said \"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time I realized the anesthetist was actually a two hundred foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Goddammit I 'ain't paying you no damn tree fiddy!\" I replied, so the anesthetist just swam away. The doctor had no choice but to just sew me up and that was that. I still have the scar today.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403725383", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Names and personal details have been changed to protect the innocent.\n\nLet me begin my story in elementary school. I had a thing for (lets call her) Jenny for as long as I could remember. She had flowing blond hair and always had a smile that could light up a room. Jenny and I had been friends sense the 2nd grade when I stood up for her when some other girls were making fun of her for her clothes. We spent years hanging out together with her having no idea of my love for her. I watched from the friend zone as she went through one ass-hole boyfriend after another, always thinking to myself that if she were mine I would treat her better than that. Fast forward to senior year of high school. Jenny had just broken up with her most recent ~~jerk~~ boyfriend (we'll call him) Biff. Biff was one of those overly macho jocks who's only chance in life to get anywhere was football (which he was only good at against the low level division our school was in). Jenny had broken up with him after she caught him cheating on her with one of the cheerleaders. She was especially sad as it was less than a month till prom, and she had already bought an expensive new dress for it. I of course played it off nonchalantly as I offered to take her to prom instead. This cheered her up as well as me. In the next couple weeks Jenny excitedly took me out to find a tux to match her dress. I of course was working on getting a room at one of the 3 motels in our town, and luckily had a cool older brother who put down his credit card for a room for me and Jenny. Finally the night came, Prom. After an awesome night of dancing closely with the girl I had loved for years, as well as a few nips off the flask when none of the chaperons were looking, we were getting quite touchy feelly. I decided it was a good time to let Jenny know that I had a room at the motel down the way. She seemed excited and we took off for the motel. The whole way over I was creaming my pants with excitement, the girl of my dreams was heading to a motel room with me. It was prom night, shooting fish in a barrel, or so I thought. We got there and went straight to our room. Once inside we were making out pretty hard and heavy when all of a sudden someone started pounding on our door. I got up to see who it was only to look though the peep hole and see a drunk Biff on our balcony. Someone must have seen Jenny and me come up and told him what room was ours. At this point he went from just pounding on the door to yelling for Jenny and crying. He's outside our motel room door making a huge scene, crying about how he wants her back and how wrong he was. This got Jenny crying. So finally I decide I need to go out and handle this. Now I'm not a big man, so fighting probably wouldn't have been my best bet against this behemoth. My first option was to try to reason with him. I tried convincing him first that she wasn't there, then I tried convincing him that he was making an ass of himself being drunk causing a scene and that he should go home. Then as a last case of resorting with him, I tried to reason with him in \"bro talk\". \"Bro, don't be a cock blocking hater\" and such. When none of this worked I finally decided that maybe I could bribe him into leaving us alone. So I asked him \"Bro, what's it going to take to get you to leave us alone and get out of here for the night?\" He turned to me and said \"I need about tree-fiddy\" Well it was about this time that I noticed that Biff was a giant monster from the Paleolithic era. And I said \"I ain't given you no god damn tree fiddy you damn Loch Ness Monster\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403766160", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 1}

It extends from the earliest known use of stone tools, probably by [hominins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominini) such as [australopithecines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecines), 2.6 million years ago, to the end of the [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene) around 10,000 [BP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present).  The Paleolithic era is followed by the [Mesolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic). The date of the Paleolithic—Mesolithic boundary may vary by locality as much as several thousand years. During the Paleolithic period, humans grouped together in small societies such as [bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_society), and subsisted by gathering plants and fishing, hunting or scavenging wild animals.  The Paleolithic is characterized by the use of [knapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithic_reduction) [stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone) [tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool), although at the time humans also used [wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood) and [bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone) tools. Other organic commodities were adapted for use as tools, including [leather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather) and vegetable [fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibers); however, due to their nature, these have not been preserved to any great degree. Surviving artifacts of the Paleolithic era are known as [paleoliths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolith). Humankind gradually evolved from early members of the genus *[Homo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_genus)* such as *[Homo habilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_habilis)* – who used simple stone tools – into fully behaviorally and anatomically modern humans (*[Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens_sapiens)) [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens_sapiens)*during the Paleolithic era.  During the end of the Paleolithic, specifically the Middle and or Upper Paleolithic, humans began to produce the earliest works of art and engage in religious and spiritual behavior such as burial and ritual.    The [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate) during the Paleolithic consisted of a set of glacial and [interglacial periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacial_period) in which the climate periodically fluctuated between warm and cool temperatures.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/7OaJBSe.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Homo_heidelbergensis-Cranium_-5.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Lower ^Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Paleolithic) ^| [^Art ^of ^the ^Upper ^Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_the_Upper_Paleolithic) ^| [^Paleolithic ^Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_Europe) ^| [^Japanese ^Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Paleolithic) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cihm1o9) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cihm1o9)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403794509", "subreddit": "ireland", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Anyway one day she wears these really short shorts, like against school code short, I could not stop looking. Anyway, I was talking in class and I got in a little trouble, so what happened next was she told me to stay after class. After class she paced back and forth to the board, I kept staring and she caught me, she gasped \"AW HAH!\" at this point she knew I looked at her rear end. She asked me if I liked her butt and I told her I did, as she began to slowly take off her short shorts, she seductively whispers, \"I want something from you, I need it bad\". \"Anything\" I respond, she then says \"I need about tree fiddy\" it was about this point in time that I noticed that she was not my teacher but in fact she was a five hundred foot tall monster from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "This is a story I've told so many times.\n\nHer name was Harriet and everyone made fun of her for it, but she kept her chin up. I mean, who names a kid Harriet in this day and age? We were in grade 9, and lived about a block away from each other.\n\nWe started talking on the bus and became bus buddies - you know, the people you only talk to on the school bus - and after a month or two, started to hang out at lunch. We would talk at least three hours every day, sometimes more. Eventually, the topic of kissing came up, as tends to be the case with pubescent humans. I eventually confessed that I had never kissed a girl, and she laughed at me. She said that is was way too late to have my first kiss, and that someone with so little experience at this age would have to pay to kiss a girl. I was hurt, but she gave me a shove and we kept the conversation going.\n\nFast forward a few days, and she asks if I want to help her study after school. I say sure, and agree to follow her home from the bus stop. We get off and walk, and I catch a few sly smiles and sideways glances. My heart is going a mile a minute. We spend the next few hours with open books on the kitchen table ignored, just talking. She shows me the house, ending with her room. We're silent and facing each other, and a few awkward seconds pass. We lock eyes and my heart drops into my stomach. I panic and run home.\n\nIt's now about 9 o'clock at night, and I realize my stuff is still over there. I decide to put on my big boy pants and walk over. The whole way, I'm thinking about how close I was to my first kiss, and circle the block for fifteen minutes. Finally, I walk to her house and knock on the door. She answers.\n\nI tell her I left my stuff here, and she goes to grab it. Soon enough, I'm back on her porch, and she's shutting the door as I shout at her to wait. She steps outside and I kick by balls into gear, stepping onto her porch, leaning forward, with my hands awkwardly hanging at my side (I didn't know what to do with them), and kiss her on the lips. She looks at me shocked, then smiles, blushing. I turn to leave, and she says to wait. I turn around and her hand is out, palms up. She asks me for tree fiddy. But you came for a story, so here's the real one.\n\nStill 9th grade. We're hanging out with a bunch of friends. Her name isn't Harriet. Everybody's in the basement when we hear the doorbell ring. We had ordered pizza. Everybody went upstairs but us. For some reason. We were just standing there, confused and staring at each other. I swallow my fear, like you do when you jump off a really high diving board for the first time. I kiss her, slow and soft. We pull away after what seems like an eternity. Being awkward and foolish, I decide I should say something cool. So I say \"That just happened!\" in a play-it-cool voice tinged with barely hidden excitement. We went upstairs. Nobody noticed, turns out that eternity was about a quarter second.\n\nShe comes back home in four days.

{"body": "First of all, I was sure within the first few sentences that this would end with tree fitty, so I checked. Midway through I wished for your sake it had. Holy flaming Jesus that's awful.\n\nI grew up with what I have semi-recently determined to be a severe narcissist for a mother. Even more recently I believe those narcissistic tendencies are due primarily to BPD. My older brother shares much of those issues but introduced superior size and hard drugs into the equation, resulting in much of the physical abuse you describe without the paranoia. I was blamed for living, not for actually doing anything, other than being weak and generally disappointing.\n\nBeing left alone to appease that kind of personality at a young age is so intense and damaging. To have to play the very adult version of 'don't wake daddy' with a family member's mental disorders is just too much for a child. I can't help but feel it was easier for me to just have fairly decent evidence that my brother hated me, and my mother simply loved herself (and my brother cuz narcissism things) and no one else, than to not have any sort of logic system to help me cope. There's no rules to the game you describe because you have no way of knowing what they will hear in their head that will set them off. It literally hurts my heart thinking about how much more difficult that would have been. Learning the appeasement rules was my entire survival mechanism. If there hadn't been rules I would have been lost. You, my friend, are a goddamned soldier.\n\nWe (friends and new family) often say I wasn't raised and I was always accused of having an old soul when I was a kid, because that's what kids look like that have to be completely on top of their home situation 100% of the time. I eventually went no contact with both of them and it's done me a world of good. But I didn't think to do that until I had already screwed up my life pretty good. Now I'm 30 and trying to pick my hopes and dreams back up and move on properly. I hope you were more on the ball than I was. If it helps though, it's my understanding that with Schizophrenia by the time you're 30, statistically you should be in the clear. And if you've ever regularly partaken, and that didn't trigger it, you're extra good. (For the record: yes. Sorry reddit, the studies so far look pretty good for weed triggering/accelerating an already at risk person's schizophrenic tendencies. Don't hate me, hate science.)

{"body": "All the workers were 20 - 40ish year old Asian women. I used to sit at the reception most of the time booking people in, but on occasion I'd be asked to start a massage or to take the details of the customer.  \n  \nOnly a handful of girls straight up asked for me to \"massage\" their clitoris and/or breasts. 90% of the time I'd only massage the hands, do preparations and then give the details to the actual masseuse. There's some really easy ways to imply you WANT to let this girl orgasm all over the sheets but you don't want to come across too strong as you have to remain professional, so even though I could feel she wanted me to make a move I just couldn't, in case it backfired or someone walked in.   \n  \nI've been told over half, or about 60% of the guys that come expect some kind of happy ending or imply/ask for one. There's been times when the guy would ejaculate on the girl's hands on \"accident\" or would try to \"guide\" the hands of the masseuse towards their areas. One girl in particular used to get asked a lot, but it was eventually found out she was actually giving people happy endings in exchange for quite a substantial amount of money.  \n  \nI've got plenty of stories on this but it'll probably end up buried.  \n  \nEdit:  \nAlright I give in. I'll give you a couple here.  \n  \n1) One girl was receiving her massage and was unaware she began her period moments prior. Chunks of dark period blood were left all over the white sheets, probably amongst one of the most disgusting sights I've ever seen.. \n  \n2) One girl in particular was known to become extremely sexual during a massage. She was told to refrain from it by the ladies working there but one day they told me to take her information as we had our hands full. When I walked in she was already naked lying on the bench facing upwards with her legs open, so when she saw me shut the door behind myself, she immediately covered herself up. When I told her who I was she got in position, ready for the massage. A couple minutes later I was having sex with her. I saw her every Friday afternoon for the next couple months, found out later her boyfriend was dropping her off and picking her up.  \n  \n3) Probably one of the few 10/10's that used to come in every now and then; about 5'7ish, amazing body and beautiful face. She was always professional and used to arrive in a Porsche. While I was massaging her hands and making conversation, getting the notes down etc, she asked for my number as she \"can't always come to the parlour\". She phoned me the next day telling me to bring the equipment to her house and she'll pay me privately. I arrived, set up, and she comes back down the stairs naked. I decide to stay professional (knowing the money she'll give me) and acted like I see bodies like hers all the time. I started the massage and she didn't say a word for half an hour, just the occasional moan. She got a phone call from her \"husband\" (who I found out was in his late 40's) who said he won't be back home. While she was on the phone to him she started tugging at my trousers and unzipping me. We had sex while she was on the phone to her husband. She paid to see me once every weekend.  \n  \nIf you want to know any particular stories, ask. There's plenty more but I don't want to just say things that you don't want to read.  \n  \nEdit 2: A couple more before I go to bed.\n  \n4) There was a woman aged around 25, quite a slim build but a decent body who used to work with us. About 5'3ish. She is of Chinese origin and was brought up as a dancer. On a Wednesday afternoon I decided to head to the staff room to get myself a drink, on the way I met another masseuse who told me to make tea for everyone. Doing as I was told, I decided to make it and then go back to reception. The head masseuse then went on to give the tea to everyone working. She walked in on the ex-dancer taking money from the customer (which is strictly against policy) and then questioned her. It eventually came out the woman was making over half her normal weekly wage by having sex with her clients. What makes it worse is all the workers are either related or close family friends. I text her asking her what happened, she told me the entire story. I found out she was having sex with a group of regular customers and a female customer less often.\n  \n5) One of the first girls I did something with was around 2/3 weeks into the job. I always used to see her come in and she'd give me a quick smile and carry on to her room with the masseuse. It was raining throughout the entire afternoon and I wasn't expecting to see her. As she came in I took her jacket and put it on the radiator to dry off, then offered her some tea. Her waiting time was around 20 minutes so in that time we had a long conversation about what I actually do here and how I got the job. I was then told to get her a room and take her details - I did. She undressed in front of me (not normal as there's a dressing wall on one side of the room) and told me to wrap the towel around her. I couldn't help but rub my hand against her breast as I wrapped it from the front and tied it at her back. She sat down on the bench, crossed her legs and then spoke to me as I massaged her hands. 10 minutes pass and the masseuse doesn't arrive, so she got down on the bench and I untied the towel, oiled my hands and started on her back. She just turned to be on her back around halfway through me touching her back to face me. So I touched her clitoris a little, but my heart was racing because I knew any moment the masseuse would come in. I decided to take it a little further, so I started rubbing her clit. Those 10 seconds felt like full minutes at that time. I started kissing her, as I knew this could be over any moment. I started working my way down her body.. I could hear her say \"I want it\" under her breath, so I whispered in her ear \"What do you want..?\". She licked my ear and gently whispered back \"...I'll need about tree-fiddy\". It was around this time I realised she was around 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Palaeozoic era. That damned loch-ness monster got me again! \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n  \n- Deleted the original end to 5 to replace it with the tree fiddy. It starts after \"So I touched her clitoris a little, but my heart was racing because I knew any moment the masseuse would come in\".   \nHere it is: \"I quickly told her someone's coming and helped her sit up, then quickly tied the towel around her. I left the sheet next to her and wiped my hands down with a towel just as the masseuse came in. I got out there so fast. I was questioned what happened later on during the day but I just said \"the usual\".

I'd be having a normal/mundane conversation with her, and suddenly she'd think I said or did something else, and fly off the handle. She once pulled me out of a sleepover because I had \"poured flour all over the kitchen\" (I hadn't). It was utterly random. All I could do was try to maintain composure, worrying when the shoe would drop. I walked on pins &amp; needles as a teen, because I was so goddamned worried that if I did *anything* to *anything* or made noise, she'd think I did it to spite her or say something I didn't. Even then, it usually didn't matter. After a while, her episodes were happening pretty much daily. So I tried to stay away from home as often as humanly possible.\n\nDefinitely gave me PTSD, but as an adult, I worked through it. I'm also 30, so the worrying about whether I inherited it has faded somewhat (I hear noises/voices sometimes, but try to assume it's my imagination ... I definitely never do anything to hurt myself or others). \n\nAs a benefit of how I was raised versus how you were raised -- I knew I wasn't causing her outbursts to happen, and never had to go through the regret of things I said ...

{"body": "&gt;You're right, and if Satan didn't exist, some other entity would that &gt;would be the option to not follow Christ. He doesn't have to exist, but &gt;he does and one of his biggest lies has been that he and God don't &gt;even exist. We're in spiritual warfare and this is the battle zone.\n\nIf it's a war, why is God not stepping up and fighting? Satan apparently encourages the use of logical thinking and empirical evidence to discover the world for yourself, while people who believe in God are left with nothing more that faith.\n\n&gt;The Devil is the choice to not follow God. The Bible says if you're not &gt;for God, you're against Him. You may not believe it, but by not &gt;following Christ you are following Satan by being of this world. Jesus &gt;said \"The world is going to hate you because they hated me first. You &gt;are no longer of this world\".\n\nFor many people, it is not a \"choice\" not to believe in a god, just like they can't chose to believe in the loch ness monster. For them, when they are honest with themselves, they know they cannot believe in God because they would be lying to themselves. They are not against God, they are against people who think it's okay to do horrible things in his name.\n\n&gt;Sounds like you really know your stuff and have researched this. I'm &gt;not Muslim, nor did Jesus ever say to kill anyone, like Muhammad said &gt;to do to folks who don't believe in Allah. You apparently haven't read &gt;what Jesus preached. Be selfless, give of yourself freely, spread love.\n&gt;[Matthew 22:36-40]\n\nI do like Jesus and many of his messages, but there are people who say the same things today without needing to be the son of God. And I didn't realize that we were sticking to the new testament, I feel like the Old should still be pertinent but I'll stick with the New for argument's sake.\n\nSo, Jesus. A man who was god's son, and who could perform miracles. This seems to interfere with the idea that god revealing himself would ruin our free will. One option is that God decided in this one instance that free will didn't matter. Admittedly it did seem to create a lot of new followers, so nice plan god. The question then is why not do a similar thing today? If it was so successful in the past, it should work even better today, and more souls would be saved.\n\nThe second option is that god deliberately made this happen in a time when it could not be reasonably proved to have happened, thus requiring faith to believe in it. Which again, if I was god, sounds like a sweet plan to find the true believers. In that case, it would be god himself providing the option to not believe in him by making his case seem unlikely to many people on purpose. So then, why do we need Satan?\n\nA third option is that god is incompetent or doesn't exist, but let's ignore these for now.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403900123", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, here goes mine. \n\nI worked as a masseuse for a grand total of 3 days. My last customer was a perfect 10/10. Perky tits, shaved pussy, and a face that would've killed a giant ape. As I'm massaging her, she gives me this shy smile and she bites her lip just a little bit. I already felt myself getting rock hard, that just about drove me over the edge.  I wanted her so bad but I had to remain professional. I tell her to roll over on the table and she complies. I get a view of her ass and it was the best I've ever seen. Perfectly round, tight, and not a hint of cellulite. As I'm massaging her, she lets out a few sultry moans, which is not really uncommon so I heard, and it was my job so I wasn't surprised to hear it. I finish the massage and she asks for my number. I give it to her in a shaky, but trying to hide it voice. She gives me a smile that sends me up the wall again and leaves. \n\nA few days later she sends me a text saying that she doesn't want to drive all the way out to the parlor and she wants me to perform services at her home. I go to her home and it's enormous. White stone walls around a 5 acre front yard and 3 story house with bleached white greek-style pillars in front. I'm let in by her butler and led to her own private massage room in her home. I'm tense as hell waiting for her. She walks in naked and lies face down on the table and tells me to begin. I start with her back and she starts moaning again. She starts telling me to go lower on her back then lower and lower until i'm rolling her perfect butt cheeks with my hands. I move toward the inner thigh and her scent hits me. \n\nI must have let out a small moan of my own because she rolled over and told me to start massaging her clit. She opens her legs and I start at it. Eventually she can't handle it and gets off the table and begins to suck me off. I'm in pure ecstasy. She gets back on the table and I start ramming her. She and I both come and in the afterglow she whispers that it was the best she's ever had. As I'm packing up she asks me how much I was going to charge for my services. I say about $350. It was then I realized that she was a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era! She stormed away saying I ain't payin' no $350! She complained to my manager and I was fired on the spot. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403906808", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -4, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Yes, it does get tedious. That's why we just want evidence. There's no way to argue in favor of the existence of something unless you can demonstrate it. If we exchanged God with the Loch Ness monster, you'd get very tired of me twisting and bending things, making special rules that only apply to my argument, etc. and eventually just want evidence. That's the same thing. \n\nThe best way to think of it is... If I told you I could make a pizza appear out of thin air, just \"poof\" in my hand, you wouldn't just believe it. I could bend words and make a very logical argument, a \"bullet proof\" one even, and you *still* wouldn't believe it. You'd need evidence, or you'd at best think I was crazy, or worst think I was just outright dishonest. I'd say \"What evidence do you need? But don't ask me to make a pizza appear, that I can't do right now, but what else can I do or say?\" That's how it is for us too. Whatever evidence you'd need besides me making that pizza appear, is the same evidence we need. \n\nIt gets tedious and that's why I think both sides get tired of it. One side wants evidence, the other side has the burden but no evidence, and an impasse is reached unless the first side is just willing to accept words that can't be verified with evidence. Arguments aren't evidence.

{"body": "Alright. Here goes.\n\n\nI work at Total Wine. And I would like to clarify a few things.\n\nBackground: I am 30 years old and a beer and whiskey drinker in my everyday. Have been working there for a year now. It started as a second job, just filling shelves for extra money, then eventually became full time. From there, I was asked to be a salesman. WE MAKE ZERO COMMISSION!\n\n\nI get what you guys are saying, I do. But everyone has a job, with parts of it they don't like. I enjoy filling the shelves and meeting interesting people. It feels good helping people set up for a big ass party with kegs and cases of booze. But sometimes I have to grab case after case of Grey Goose for some asshole because that's what his friends expect to see at his party.\n\nThe\"house brand\": winery and spirit direct items are what most would call house brand. Though some of these brands may be available elsewhere, most of them are exclusive to TW. Some of them are good and some of them are bad. As the store is called Total *Wine*, most of their focus and profits are in the wine. We have literally thousands of house brand wines that are very good, and some that are complete shit. The same can be said for our scotches, with much less of a selection.\n\nA n00b will want to impress management and throw WD at a customer with the \"if you like this, you'll love this\" bullshit. When I talk with customers, I ask them what they like, I make a suggestion to something WD that is similar, but not the same, that I actually like. If you say no thank you, I'll leave you be.\n\nI won't tell you I've had something if I haven't. And we don't make a lot of money. People get mad when I cannot tell them how good Macallan 21 is. Because I don't have tree fiddy to drip on a bottle of scotch! But I have some coworkers that save and buy $200 bottles of wine.\n\nIf you want to be left alone, the headphones or cell phone work great. I'm not going to interrupt you. Whether true or not, a lot of people say their SO gave them a list that they have to stick to or some shit.\n\nWith the favorites, they ask us to put our picture next to WD things we like. It helps some customers relate. As far as price is concerned, I try to put my face next to a range of items. If a customer comes in with a thirty dollar budget, and my face is next to only $100 bottles, they won't give me the time of day. Yeah Hamilton's is $19, and it is my favorite in that price range. Smokey Joe is my favorite for $30-40.\n\nMost of the house stuff we have tasted. They make us taste it to encourage the sale. Most of our spirits we have open somewhere for people to try. If we suggest an item, ask them if they have one open for you to taste.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm just trying to make it to the end of my shift.

{"body": "Used to be a roofer. Occasionally, somebody on our crew would spot a topless/naked woman waking up in the morning in an adjacent building and we'd all come running over to take a look.\n\nOne beautiful summer monday morning, I was installing flashing around the perimeter of the roof of a 21 storey apt. building we were working on.\n\nNow, this is quite boring, but also, simultaneously quite dangerous. You've gotta dangle one leg straight down, while kneeling on the edge facing along the length of the building. The idea is, if you lose your balance, you'll fall along the edge of the building rather than over the side.\n\nSo I'm drilling holes in the concrete every 18 inches so when I install the flashing I can pound concrete rivets in to attach it. Like I said, boring, but very dangerous -especially because we never used safety belts.\n\nMy eyes wander over to the building beside the one I'm working on, and what do I see? This little blond hottie getting up out of bed wearing only a thong!!! I'm about to whistle for the rest of the boys to come over and have a look, when I see that she sees me.\n\n'BUSTED!' I'm thinking.\n\nBut then the most amazing thing happens: She wiggles her finger at me giving me the 'c'mere' sign. (Must have been my overalls -get's 'em every time)\n\nWELL! ...I tell the site foreman that I left my sky hook down in the truck, and haul ass down to ground. I run over to her building, and snag the elevator up to her place. \n\nI get up there, politely knock on the door, and she answers, still only in the thong. She said something silly like 'did you bring your squeegee sharpener with you? I wore mine out last week, and these windows are getting dirty.'\n\nThat's when I knew it was ON!\n\nI whipped off those overalls quicker than a hungry hillbilly shucking corn. In seconds, we were fucking and sucking, licking and sticking, poking and stroking....... you get the idea. After about twelve hours of this, she says to me, 'hey baby, how about some doggy style?' \n\nBoom! I rolled that bitch over quicker than Paul Bunyon with a log!! I noticed that my smoke bender had fallen out of my overalls before I had taken them off, so I pushed that out of the way, and then mounted her for a majestic rogering that would have done Bill Clinton proud! \n\nI'm really pounding away. She's moaning (sounded like one of those National Geographic docs about people that speak in tongues) and screaming 'rhkjkmfgsjl', or some crazy ass shit.\n\nWell, goddamned. The fucking Lock Ness Monster sprung out of the closet with a raging hard-on, and tried to fuck me in the ass!!!\n\nQuick as a wink, I reached down to my overalls on the floor and whipped out my left handed screwdriver. SCHWAKKKK!!! I didn't kill him but I winged him enough to drive him off. BITCHES GET STITCHES!!!\n\nI get back to the task at hand. I've got a beautiful view out the window -that's why EVERYONE enjoys doggy style, finish up, and realize that I had actually fallen off the building I was working on and had died.\n\nNo problem. I whipped out my holistic lasso, and rode my eight legged pony on into eternity.\n\nTL;DR The Loch Ness Monster is a bum pirate.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403975311", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -17, "controversiality": 0}

I am unnecessarily picky about how my board looks. The bacon with the two skateboard sized kicks, it's just not for me. \n\nb) The board is too small for me. When doing freeride, I put one foot on the kick, which I don't mind, but then I have to put the other one on the nose so that I don't feel cramped. And now if accidentally shift my weight too much I'll fall. \n\nc) I'd like more wheel clearance. I would like to be able to fit some 70mm wheels with rather carry trucks. \n\nSo I'm looking for my next board. So far I really am a fan of symmetrical double kicks that are 38 inches and up to like 40. I would really like a board that has at least one kick, an ample amount of room, and wheel clearance for wheels up to a bit over 70mm  with carvy trucks. I'd also like medium aggressive concave so I can freeride well while still being able to push comfortably. It would be great if the board were rather light and had nice pop. \nMy setup would most likely be Paris 43° with Remember Hoots. \n\nSo far I have looked at (in order of liking):\n\nLoaded Tesseract: I love the shape, it has wheel clearance, it is sexy as hell in general, it is light, has medium concave, and I can dance with it if I want. \n\nEarthwing NLS: The lightest and the sturdiest of these boards. I just haven't heard of many people who have it. \n\nNelson Batray 4.8: It doesn't have enough wheel clearance. \n\nLandyachtz Tomahawk: Not sure about this board. It's definitely heavier than the Tesseract.

Much like the elusive Yeti, Loch Ness Monster, and the aliens who built the pyramids, it is nothing more than rationalization, excuse, and myth.\n\nAn alcoholic is an alcoholic.  22 years ago I was diagnosed with cancer.  Part of my treatment protocol was to get radiation therapy.  I had to go to the hospital 5 days a week and get zapped.  My cancer was relatively low grade at the time which meant I was not suffering from serious effects of the cancer.  Therefore, I was able to work my normal job during this time.  I would drive over to the hospital in my suit and tie over lunch, check in, wait, strip down, lay down, get zapped and go back to work.  The whole process took about an hour.  During my waiting time, I would sit next to people in much, much worse shape than me.  Inpatients who were laying on hospital carts waiting to be wheeled in for their same treatments.  If you looked at me at the time, you would have thought I was simply waiting for my mother or father to come out of their treatment.  \n\nI guess you could say I was a High Functioning Cancer Patient at that time.  Thank God I did not look at all of those Low Functioning Cancer Patients next to me at the Radiation Lab and say....\"well, I am not as bad as those guys.  I guess I can just put off my treatments for a few years until this disease ravages my body from the inside out and I get really desperate to survive....\"\n\nYou can keep believing you are special in terms of your alcoholism but the fact simply is your time hasn't come yet.

The series is literally called, 「学研まんが日本の歴史」 by 大石学 The books are in Japanese, but they basically are manga versions of Japanese history. They go into much detail, with full illustrations, and in the back of the book, there are pages of text, with further info, and in case you don't want to read the manga part. There are 12 books in the series, starting from the Pre-Historic Era until Post World War II. They are kinda expensive at $15 per book, but they are hardcover, and they go into much detail. I believe they are geared toward students, or children, as every single Kanji used in the book is accompanied by its furigana, which makes to be really useful when reading archaic characters. Although it is geared to children, there is so much information packed into each book. I currently have the first two.\n\nThe first one is called 「国の成り立ち」 or \"The Origin of the Country\".  Just in this volume, they cover the Paleolithic Era (how humans got to Japan), the Jomon Era (Illustrates indigenous Jomon lifestyles, what they ate, their animistic religion), the Yayoi Period (Tells of what cultural advancements were brought from the mainland, through Korea. Tells who Queen Himiko was and shows how she maintained relations with the neighboring 魏 Chinese Dynasty. It also mentions the introduction Kanji characters into Japan, and talks about the 千文字.) Lastly, it shows the Kofun Era, and how there was a struggle between Shintoist native beliefs and the Buddhism that was rather new.\n\nIn the second book, called 「飛鳥の朝廷から平城京へ」 \"From the Asuka Imperial Court, to the Nara Capital\"\nIt covers the Asuka and Nara periods. I haven't gotten too far in this one yet, but from what I've skimmed through, it's about the relations between the neighboring Tang Dynasty ans Korean Silla Kingdom, and the establishment of Buddhism throughout Japan with the help of a Chinese monk.\n\nIf there isn't a Japanese book store near you, I found it on amazon.co.jp, and rakuten which may require a forwarding service. \n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4058112999\n\nhttp://search.books.rakuten.co.jp/bksearch/nm?b=1&amp;g=001&amp;sitem=%B3%D8%B8%A6%A4%DE%A4%F3%A4%AC+new%C6%FC%CB%DC%A4%CE%CE%F2%BB%CB&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404078661", "subreddit": "japan", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had a dream. A freaking weird one and the reason why I'm going to start writing this shit in a dream book. \n\nWhen my dream started, I was chasing after this girl who I thought was pretty cute. She kept on leading me to room after room. It was very hard to keep up with her because, in almost all of my dreams, it's like I'm walking knee deep in water even though I'm in a house.  \nAfter some chasing and giggling, she finally stops in a dark room. As I catch up to her, the lights come on in the room and there's this machine. A machine that pretty much took up the entire room. It was finely crafted with complex angles and glowing lights fixated towards what looked to be a chair for two or three people. We look at each other and go sit in this chair to see what all this stuff does.  \nAll of the sudden, the glowing gets more intense. It's getting brighter and brighter and br...\n\nI'm out in the woods. The girl is nowhere to be found. She has to be close. So I start searching.  \nAs I'm walking around, I notice a light coming through. The light is now leading me through the woods. It takes me to a house made almost entirely of glass. It looks like it was made from blown glass - just absolutely incredible design and not a single flat side on the outside of this building.   \nThere is a long straight pathway on the left side of this house. It looks to not lead to anywhere. It's just a flat straight path coming from this house.  \nI turn back to the house to see these two vehicles parked inside the house. From a distance, they appeared to be very quick vehicles. Like fighter jet/hypercar kind of vehicles.  \nI'm walking closer to the house. The house is getting clearer and clearer like a mirage except everything inside is still visible. I touch the glass and my hand goes through followed by a burning sensation. My hand pulls back quickly and the glass fades to a translucent red to an opaque red to a black.\n\nShit. An alarm is going off...\n\nThere is a hill to my right as I'm running away from this weird house. Once up this hill, I go into a bunker that locks from behind.\n\nWhew! I'm safe. \n\nThe room is a theater. Except this theatre has a glass divider(like what the house wad made of) between the stage and the audience. I sit down in one of the seats and start thinking of the girl from the beginning of my dream.  \nBoom! Front and center. There she is on stage in front of me. I'm partially scared at this point because I couldn't figure out how that happened. So I go down to the stage to see if she is real.  \nI walk through the glass divider amd up to this beautiful woman. Where was she this whole time? How did she know I was here? What should we do next?  \nShe says \"hey! Calm down! I'm here! Don't worry! I need about tree fiddy.\"  \nThat's when I noticed she was no cute little girl.

The ship is eerily silent, almost as if it absorbs the ambient sound around it.

Then the seamless metal separates, and an widening column of bluish light emerges from within the space craft. A ramp descends, and through the mist and steam I catch my first glimpse of the Visitor. The Visitor is tall and slender, his skin is a pale shade of violet and completely hairless. His face is startlingly humanlike, but there is still something foreign in his appearance. I'm astonished that from the small tubelike apparatus on his nose and his compression suit, it appears he's accustomed to our atmosphere. The Visitor descends the ramp and extends his four fingered hand as a gesture of peace and friendship. I look into his eyes and say, \"I'm sorry, if you wanna park your spaceship here it's gonna cost about tree fiddy.\" It's about that time that the Visitor realizes that I'm not a human, but a fifty foot crustacean from the Paleolithic era. He says, \"I done told you I ain't givin you no damn tree fiddy, Loch Ness Monster!\" After which he returns to his spaceship and departs for stars unknown.

He was known as the orphan of organised criminals, and many thought he had picked up the family business. They were quite right. He had a crew who, from what I gather, he paid with snacks, who would do sinister favours for people in exchange for cash; things like cheating on homework or planting information in an exam room, that kind of thing. The cost for completed homework started at $3.50. However, if the kids didn't pay up, Bones himself would come forth and challenge them to a fight. If they won the fight, the debt would be cleared. If they lost, they were never seen again. Of course, Bones always won because he was the Loch Ness Monster. Why did the teachers do nothing, and why were the police also idle? It was because Bones scared them. None of them had any experience in tearing a gigantic Scottish reptilian monster from its prey. And so, they summoned the military. I was there on that very day when the sky was ignited, the heavens opened and hell rained down upon Bones. Thousands upon thousands of kamikaze pilots threw themselves into his scaly torso, leaving his body battered and mangled. The next day, I returned even though it was Saturday, and the corpse of Bones was gone. Many say that he will rise again and once again dominate the schoolyard with incessant demands for pocket change. They say that in his house at Atlantis, dead Bones waits dreaming.
