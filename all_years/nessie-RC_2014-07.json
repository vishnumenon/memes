{"body": "When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.\n\nI called out, “Mum?” and heard her sing song voice say “Yeeeeees?” from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same “Yeeeeees?” reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn’t know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother’s presence always does.\n\nJust as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call “Sweetie, are you home?” in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don’t know what it was, but it was staring at me. \n\n\"What do you want?!\" I shouted at the creature staring back at me. Finally, it replied in the most terrifying hideous voice: \"About Tree Fiddy\". It was then that I realized that this creature was a 100ft tall monster from the Paleolithic Era. \"Goddamn Loch Ness Monster\" I exclaimed, \"I ain't gonna give you no Tree Fiddy!\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404180808", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'd make a graph for you, but I'm too lazy to.\n\nTo put it simply, just use the equation log*_love_* compassion = comfort^π.  \nIf you were to write this as an exponential equation, you would get love^comfort^π = compassion.  \nWhich brings up an interesting point. What if the value of love was the mathematical constant *e*? Then, you would get log*_e_* compassion = comfort^π. Obviously, if you've passed basic trigonometry, you know that log*_e_* is just ln. So now, you have ln compassion = comfort^π. Now, what if compassion was also *e*? What's ln *e*? Well, any log to itself is always 1, so ln *e* is just 1! So that means, when love and compassion both equal *e*, comfort^π must be one!\n\nSo, comfort can be any of the three possibilities:\n\nx = 1  \nx = *e*^-2*i* = -.41615 - 0.90930*i*  \nx = *e*^2*i* = -.41615 + 0.90930*i*  \n\nNow, comfort, much like eccentricity of a curve or the number of oscars Leonardo DiCaprio will win in his lifetime, only ranges from 0 to 1. So, when x = 1, comfort is at it's maximum value! But now, what if we took the antiderivitive of said logarithm?

The Paleo theory, as I understand it, doesn't really have a scientific basis and rests on the assumption that our digestive system hasn't really evolved since the Paleolithic era. Not to get into an argument over that (I'm not trying to prove anyone wrong, but I am trying to illustrate a point). \n\nThe reality of the situation is that making huge generalizations like \"grains = bad\" doesn't help anyone's understanding of what actually constitutes healthy nutrition for a human being. Literally everything is bad for you if you consume to much of it (too much oxygen in the blood is toxic and you can die from drinking too much water). The broad generalization that grains are bad completely ignores the nuance of quantity and quality of said grains (not to mention lumping vastly different grains together into one big bad strawman), and also ignores that different people can react very differently to the same food.\n\nThe idea is that for an actual, healthy diet, you need to eat a variety of foods; grains included. Also, recent medical studies have suggested that what people refer to as \"gluten sensitivity\" is actually something completely different that has little to do with grains and more to do with a carbohydrate that is present in lots of other foods as well. Some sources below.\n\nTL;DR: It's a little more complicated than \"grains=bad\" and making generalizations like this doesn't help anyone understand the issue better. \n\n[https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/separating-wheat-chaff-gluten-sensitivity](https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/separating-wheat-chaff-gluten-sensitivity)\n\n[http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/05/gluten_sensitivity_may_not_exist.html](http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/05/gluten_sensitivity_may_not_exist.html)\n\nhttp://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(13)00702-6/abstract", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404250026", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've got a few\n\n1) Stranded teenager:\nWhen I lived in my old apartment, this kid about 15 years old was stranded after his friends abandoned him at their motel they were renting.\nHe was ringing my buzzer in hopes of finding his friends or a phone to call them. I think they gave him a fake address. So I talk to him a bit and realize they took him and some of his stuff to a motel where they were all staying and then stuck him with the bill. I drove him back to the motel, he was able to get his stuff back since his friends hadn't checked out yet (and I think the desk person realized what happened as well). I drove him across town and while driving we had a conversation that included him having a pregnant girlfriend and not wanting to be at home. He called the place I dropped him at home, but I don't think it was. He was glad to be there regardless, and I like to think he started making better life decisions after that.\n\n2)Kidnapping victim:\nI was studying at home for an exam and saw out the window a couple arguing across the street. It got heated and he eventually pinned her up against the wall of the gas station there and then picked her up and carried her off down the sidewalk. She was screaming, and yelling for help. So.. I did. I caught up with them about a block later. He wasn't happy to see me, and she ended up cowered in the corner between a bush and someone's garage crying. He basically yelled and screamed at me for 15 minutes until the cops arrived. After the cops arrived, they took him away and she said he was her fiance had kept her locked in the basement. The police said he was going directly to jail (do not pass go, do not collect $200). I never heard any follow up on that one. But being carried down the street kicking and screaming can't be a good thing. I hope she got the help she needed.\n\n3) Lost drunk girl:\nHad finished a night out drinking with co workers and was heading home, walked a co worker to her car (she was fine to drive, we were just a sketchy area) and turned to go home myself. This young girl on the sidewalk ahead of me was looking rather out of place. What made it worse is that she was headed exactly where I needed to be going, so in her mind I'm sure I was probably following her and about to do unspeakable things. Not much I could do about that however so I carried on. She turned the corner and disappeared which was still around the corner where I needed to go. So I go around the corner as well, and she was cowering in a doorway trying to hide or something to that effect.  Well, it also had the effect at startling me. So we both had an 'Oh damn!' moment. I asked her if she was ok, and she said no, she was lost and was trying to find her friends. Ah. So I flagged down the co-worker that was just leaving and borrowed her phone so she could find her friends. All was well after that. Hurray! \nP.S. Don't lose your friends in a busy bar district.\n\nThose are the only one that come to mind. I know there are more however.\n\nTL;DR Elvis captured the moon landing with communist loch ness monsters for $3.50\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404264594", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey everybody, since people seem to be complaining a lot about the grammar despite it being kind of a cool story I went ahead and gave it a quick edit. Should be a bit more readable now:\n\n********\n\n\nThis has happened to me several times. Four times to be exact. I have a critical question regarding this so I wanted to share my story with the rest of you.\n\nBack when I was 11 years old I would spend a lot of time with my family doing things like watching TV or playing games in the living room. However, unbeknownst to us, my mother got pregnant with our future little brother, and then our grandma moved in, we had to switch our rooms around in order to make room for everyone.\n\nMy old room was the second biggest, so we moved my sister into there.  My grandma moved out and so the slightly smaller room was now mine. \n\nThe first strange thing that happened was when we started to help my grandma pack and move out. We started by putting some music on and it was going fine until a loud thump noise came from the window right by the bed where we had started moving the stuff out. \n\nI pulled the white curtains out of the way to see what had hit the window so hard . A bird lay there along with at least 80 more. They were just sitting down in front of the window looking at us from the outside. \n\nI tried nearly everything to get rid of them. Yelling, screaming, throwing rocks, hitting glass windows around the house... nothing worked! They just stared at the three of us: me, my sister, and grandma. \n\nThis was the start of the \"ghost dogs\" or \"hell hounds\" that I saw. \n\nWe have three dogs. One of them is an all white dog named Ska, and we have two mostly black dogs named Bear and Lucky. We never really let Ska or Lucky walk around unattended because they would fight so we had them stay in the kitchen where we could keep an eye on them. \n\nWe always let Bear (an Australian sheep dog, mostly black with small white spots) walk around freely. He was a cowardly dog that would always whine and cry for stuff. He would still get into the things that we had left on the ground so we kept an eye on the doors to the rooms while we were packing for the move.\n \nWell, shortly after the bird hitting the window, my whole family-- including my grandma, mom and dad, and myself-- started to see a black dog with red eyes walk into the room from the small hall way to the last room: the one that we had made into *my* new room. \n\nI would call out to Bear just to find him behind the couch or in the living room and we'd see the mysterious black dog in my room turn around. When I'd try to follow him, determined to confronted it to get it out of the house, it would disappear entirely from sight! \n\nRed eyes stared back at me for a split second but never longer. Sometimes I would see it in the dark but when I turned the lights on it would vanish. So what does it mean? I wondered this until one day I waited up all night to catch one of these hell hounds in the act. I hid under the bed of my new room and around 3AM (it is just a guess, we hadn't moved my alarm clock in there yet) I spied one of the hell hounds creeping into the room and noticed that it wasn't a hell hound at all but a giant sea monster from the Cretaceous period weighing thousands of pounds. I explained the problem to my grandma the next morning and she lent me the tree fiddy that I needed in order to get it to just go away and leave us alone for a while.\n\nAnyway has anything like that happened to any of you? I am wondering if this all means something. That is my major question.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404305738", "subreddit": "creepy", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

As soon as the body scanner did a scan of his body and found it, an alarm went off, and he was immediately tackled and detained by 3 TSA Agents. Apparantly, he \"forgot it was there\".\n\nA third story... Someone attempted to bring a small can of gasoline in their checked bag. They even argued with us when we found it... Said they needed it as medicine for their illness.\n\nAh, what else? there was the time when a young girl (16?) walked through the body scan and set the detectors off. We searched her and found nothing; however, when we brought a dog over and had her sniffed, the dog detected a substance on her. We brought her to one of the rooms, strip searched her, and were almost going to give the all-clear when all of a sudden, we saw a small bit of plastic poke out from between her cheeks (lower cheeks). Turns out she had the illegal substance (heroin) in her... er.... crevasse. \n\nLast story: I wasn't there, but a coworker told me a story of a couple that checked their suitcase with their live baby inside of it. When arrested and confronted about it, they said they didn't think it was a huge deal... It was a 45 minute flight, and they didn't want to have to fiddle with keeping it quiet during the flight.\n\nA lot of people wonder what TSA Agents make, so I'll give you a ball park estimate: about tree fiddy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404334101", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 969, "controversiality": 0}

He was about 16 or 17 at the time, so he was perfectly aware of what he was doing.  I went to my parents crying and they went on to confirm that my dad wasn't in fact my biological dad.  Luckily there was nothing sleezy about it.  It turned out that my dad was infertile and my parents had to try many different procedures for my mom to get pregnant.  They explained to me that there was a sperm donor and I was actually conceived in a lab.  This was pretty new at the time.  They had actually just gotten out of the research and trial period for these procedures.  I was pretty sad about the whole things, but I understood.  To me, my dad who had raised me would always be my real dad.  I have no doubts about that.  He's loved me since I was a baby, raised me, we've had our share of father son moments and inside jokes, and he's always been here for me.  I was upset over all of this for a week, but it didn't really bother me after that.  It doesn't bother me at all now.  I only remember it when stuff like this comes around that would make me think of it.  I guess it would be interesting to meet my biological dad.  It would be more of a novelty to me.  Who knows, maybe I'll meet him one day. I could always hire someone to help me track him down.  I wouldn't do that if he didn't want to meet me of course. The whole thing would probably be pretty awkward.  I actually went to look up the prices for a private detective of that kind.  Met the guy in person actually.

My wife had said a couple of times that when she would go into the bathroom, it was like she could see something in there going back down the hole. I thought she was crazy, or maybe it was a shadow or some such. Anyway, today she went in there, and I could here her calling my name, but its like she was whispering. Eventually I get up, and go in there. Boom, I saw it, but it ducked back right away. We both noped the fuck out, and went out side to clear our heads. While we were out there, I called a coworker who has some snakes, and he gave me the number to call to get these guys out there. They said it was maybe going back down into the septic tank, and that it might be hard to catch, so I tell him that's not a fucking option, and that we'll dig the septic tank up if needed. So, finally they get there, now me or my wife hadn't been back inside since we ran out an hour or so ago, and wouldn't you know it. When we go back in you can see its head peeking out. This snake guy jumps into action, and hits the floor, and goes about elbow deep into the Hersey Highway. He comes out with this thing in his hand,but its too strong, he can't pull it out. That's when his buddy grabs in with both hands, and helps with the pull. All of a sudden, this thing decides it will come on out, and when it does, it wraps around dude #1's legs, and knocks him down. Eventually, they get it coraled into a bag.

{"body": "Well, actually that's a pretty funny story. \r\rI think I was around 10/11 so I think I was in third grade. \r\rWe had just learned about clouds this particular day. It turned out to be something that really interested me so i wanted to get home as fast as I could and learn all I could. So as soon as the bell rang I nearly ran outside to wait for my mom with the \"car riders\" and it was actually fairly gloomy out, even though it was the beginning of Summer in the fine corn state. \r\rI told a few jokes to everyone else waiting around on their parents (I went to a small private elementary school that only went from k-6, so most everyone really rode the car). I was known as the class clown back in my good old glory days so everyone was listening intently to my hysterical kid-jokes; even the 6th graders, which was big shit for me. \r\rEventually, the group of people began to dwindle down more and more, until I and one other kid (who's mom was a teacher at the school, he just wanted to be in my hilarious presence while he waited for his mom to finish) were the only ones left. I began to worry that my mom had forgotten me. It wouldn't of been the first time (she's pretty forgetful, but so am I.) So I used my best manners and politely asked if I could go down to the office and call my mom. Which of course they let me, everyone at that school loved me. \r\rWhen I arrived at the office, no one was in there so I took the liberty to use the phone myself (I trusted so it wasn't a big deal). I dialed up my moms phone and waited... No answer. So I tried again, with once again, no answer. So I tried my three more times before finally giving up. I figured my parents were probably going at it, and I was just being a mood-ruiner. \r\rThus, I decided I must voyage away from the school and walk my skinny little ass home. And so the teachers waved goodbye and I made on my way.\r\rNow I'll be honest, I was a little scared. It was my first time walking home alone. \r\rI remember walking down the street, a few blocks away from my house, singing the Spongebob theme song, when I happened to look up and see a ray of light shining from between the dark clouds. A *beacon* perhaps. (See where this is going?) The ray was shining right onto a little black mini van parked next to my next turn. \r\rAs I approached the van the windows rolled down and a man flung his arm out, resting it on the side with a cigarette in between his fingers. As I walked by he called out to me in what I remember to be a raspy voice. \r\r\"Hey kid.\" I stopped and turned to look at him. \"Need a ride?\"\r\rNow I knew better than to talk to strangers, but manners were important to so I politely declined. But he asked again. \r\rI think he said \"You sure kid?\" I stammered a bit, a little uncomfortable. \"I can give you a ride real easy.\" He paused and took a drag from his cigarette. \"But it'll cost you.\" \r\rI felt extremely uncomfortable at this time and ignored my manners for once and began to walk away. But not before he could finish. \r\r\"It'll cost ya, tree fiddy.\" \r\r---\r\rNo one actually calls me Beacon... Yet.

{"body": "I remember this story from my youth:\n\nI was having a sleepover with a female friend in my class. Her parents were a little bit like hippies, so they thought it would be cool if they locked me in her room with her. I offered to sleep on the super comfortable couch-chair she has at her desk, but she just told me \"Oh, that's alright! I wouldn't want any houseguest to feel uncomfortable when I have them sleep over here!\"\n\nSo I slide in under the covers with the girl. \"I don't want it to feel awkward, here, I'll put a pillow between us.\" We turn the lights off, and slowly doze off.\n\nIt's still dark outside when my friend gently gets up and starts to undress. She knows exactly what she's going to make me wake up to. Her pajamas slide off her hips, and takes forever to slide down her long, slender legs. She crawls under the covers, and to her delight, finds me already hard in my sleep. She puts the cock in her mouth and starts sucking hard.\n\nSo I'm stirring in his sleep, and eventually I slowly wakes up and tenses up to the sensations. I was moaning and hadn't realized it, because I first noticed his bedmate was having her way with me, and I liked it. As I got closer and closer to finishing, I started moaning louder and louder. He pulls the covers off so I can see exactly what I'm getting.\n\nI just scream, as I see a 500 foot monster from the paleolithic era chewing on my mangled penis. I passed out from blood loss and woke up in the hospital. There were flowers on the bedside table with a note. It read: \"Sorry about last night. Also, your hospital bill cost $3,500 so I'm going to need that back whenever.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404378688", "subreddit": "tifu", "score": -54, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have an amazing one.\n\nThere's a cow which loves to collect beautiful and mesmerising objects. She normally grazes and walks round the paddock and finds only small things such as one of the farmer's jacket buttons or some foreign berries which have been blown into the paddock. One day, the farmer leaves the gate open and the cow thinks that this is the opportunity to explore and find more and more majestic knick-knacks. The cow walks out of the paddock and past the treeline,  and keeps heading north for 22 minutes (only stopping for breaks and to look for objects hidden by vegetation from the trees). Eventually, there's a break from the trees and the cow finds itself next to a river. It follows it all the way down north until it reaches the sea. The cow is super annoyed. What happened?\n\nEDIT: The answer-\n\nThe cow was walking towards the sea and decided to go through her knick-knacks. She had some buttons, coins, bottle tops, foil and a variety of cans. She then hears the farmer rapidly approaching her, running from the tree-line and shouting \"Come back! Come back!\"\nThe cow was confused. How did the farmer find her? Had she been followed? What's happening?\nThe farmer then looked at the cow's collection of odds and ends and said \"Hey! Those are some nice coins! I just need about tree-fitty from your collection!\" It was about that time the cow noticed that the farmer was about five hundred feet tall and from the palaeolithic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" the cow said to the farmer as he swam away into the distance.\n\n\nWhat a great riddle.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404395105", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Besides that, you can swim in lakes, you can fish in lakes, you can pee in lakes, you can jet ski in lakes, heck- you can tell somebody to go jump in a lake!!! You can live life to the fullest ----- in lakes.Not to mention: fresh water. I mean you purify that stuff and you can drink a lake. You fish in a lake, you drink from the lake, the lake can keep you alive. So basically, lakes are all you ever need in life. It really doesn't get any better than lakes. Some are just like being at the beach and some are completely different. Lakes are so diverse, and diverse is good. So if you want to go somewhere for a family BBQ or to have a fun day out with friends or to go fishing or to go camping, go to a lake.

{"body": "I'm not bothered by this because it's not Scooby Doo but can I take a minute to say how bad *Scooby Doo: Wrestlemania Mystery* is? Ok well I'm going to, I don't need your permission. \n\nIt's not the worst Scooby Doo movie, an accolade that belongs to the abysmal *Scooby Doo and The Goblin King* which in lieu of a plot has an all star voice cast that includes Jay Leno and Jim Belushi and is a throw back to those dire 80's Scooby Doo cartoons without the gang, just Shaggy and Scooby but it's still pretty bad in my opinion. \n\nThe cartoon is written by someone who half remembers wrestling from growing up and sort of knows what Wrestlemania is (that is: a major event that involves wrestling), who kind of mixed his half-memories with the standard *What's New Scooby Doo?* plot of the gang winning something or going to visit a relative in a new and strange locale only to become embroiled in a mystery upon arrival. It works, it's not great but it works. My problem is though that this is a throwback to several years ago: *What's New Scooby Doo?* ended in **2006**. The previous few Scooby Doo films (*Scooby Doo at The Big Top*, *Scooby Doo and the Blue Falcon*, *Scooby Doo: Stage Fright*) abandoned the cheap, korean animation of *What's New Scooby Doo* for a more polished, cleaner look. Why did we go back to it for this one? The poorly drawn backgrounds, the limited color palette were gladly gone. Yet now we're back with it? I'm assuming it's because Warner Bros. didn't care about this one (indeed as of now it's the 4th lowest in the 22 direct to DVD film series) but when you consider the quality of animation and stories in the [current TV show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo!_Mystery_Incorporated), this looks even worse with it's simplistic and nonsensical plot (auto-suggestive hypnosis? And who the fuck would want to steal *that* belt? Literally only John Cena cares that much about that belt, it's awful). I mean, Shaggy and Scooby win the belt at the end - who wrote this Vince Russo? \n\nI mean OK, it's not the lowest ebb of the series, but it's in the bottom five. There are good things about it: Matthew Lillard is born to play Shaggy and his work along side Frank Welker, Grey DeLisle and Mindy Cohn has fast become the definitive version of Mystery Inc's voicework but even they struggle with the script at times (side note: The producer who wrote this also produced the Amy Adam's indie hit Junebug). Brandon Vietti's direction is perhaps the best thing about the piece, and he proves beyond doubt that he's the greatest of his generation when it comes to animation directing, but I mean with everyone else phoning it in, I wonder if it matters). The best of this series: *Scooby Doo on Zombie Island*, *Scooby Doo and The Loch Ness Monster*, *Scooby Doo and the Legend of the Phantosaur* are well animated, 90 minute films. *Scooby Doo on Zombie Island* is repeatedly listed as a classic of American animation and sold more than the second live action movie on DVD. \n\nTL;DR - no fucking read it. *Scooby Doo: Wrestlemania Mystery* sucked.

The only controls you got are the buttons \"Left\" and \"Right\". (I'm thinking of releasing it to mobile afterwards, since there's only left and right as controls, I could have one half of the screen act as \"LEFT\" when touched and one half of the screen act as \"RIGHT\". I tested that and felt good to control on mobile like that :3 no \"buttons\").\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n**The idea behind it is** that a Mad Scientist sends robots to capture Nessie, she fights as much as she can but she gets injured and ends up captured. The scientist \"fixes her\" with robot technology turning her into \"NESSIE CYBORG WITH LASERS!\". Meanwhile her \"spouse\", the loch ness monster is looking for her, and sees her through the windows on the scientist's lab.\n\nTo free his love from the scientist he throws himself against the foundations of the laboratory repeated times until the lab comes down and Nessie is free again. But by doing this he is injured and vulnerable.\n\nPlaying as nessie it's your job to fend off the robots and protect the loch ness monster (Well, not really protect, he can't get hurt, but he's resting down there XD so you can role play that you're protecting him if you want.)\n\n\n**I know the story is kind of crazy**, but I wanted to get some extra multipliers on the Jam :3 teeheehee. Going to try and make some quick cutscenes to pass the story.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- *Bonus question: What is your favorite boardgame?*\n\nDamn I love boardgames, I own several! The one I've been playing the most lately I'd have to say is **Love Letter**, if you don't know Love Letter definetly look it up! It's very well thought, it's cheap (consists of only 16 cards!), easy to learn and you can play with 2 to 4 people :D (Great to play with your loved one!)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/danielsound) | [Portfolio](http://www.danielsnd.com/) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/danielsndgamedev) | [3D Gameart Tutorial Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/danielsndgamevideos)**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404541330", "subreddit": "gamedev", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is an anecdote explaining the manner in which my way of life was rotated along a Y axis until it reached a position roughly 180 degrees from that which it started. If I could have 60 seconds of your time, simply place your posterior in the selected location, and I will relate to you the details of how I was made the male monarch of the district of the City of Los Angeles, California located at coordinates 34.08333 -118.44778.\nIn the western region of the “City of Brotherly Love” known as Philadelphia, my mother expelled me from her womb and indeed that is also where I spent my childhood, in my mother’s care. The majority of my time was spent in a recreational area containing such diversions as a jungle gym, swing set, sand box, etc. I was typically at the height of leisure while frequently at a temperature slightly below what might be considered standard room temperature. Outside of my educational institution I was engaging in a game of basketball with some of my peers, when two gentlemen who seemed to be of the disposition to cause a great deal of mischief began causing a great deal of chaos and disharmony in the area in which I lived. I was involved in one rather small bout of fisticuffs after which my mother became concerned for my general safety and well-being, and she informed me that I would be moving in with her sister and her sister’s husband in the previously mentioned community located at the previously mentioned location.\nI implored my mother to relent approximately 24-48 hours ago, yet she gathered my belongings in a somewhat flat, rectangular shaped piece of luggage and expelled me from her presence. She placed her lips upon my cheek in an affectionate manner and handed me a pre-purchased pass for public transportation. I placed the headphones for my personal music system into my ears and verbalized the idea that I may as well impact this situation with my foot. Traveling in the highest available level of comfort, this is indeed an unfortunate situation (although I make this statement with some irony). Consuming the juices obtained by the squeezing of the fruit of a Citrus sinensis from a piece of glass stemware commonly reserved for the sipping of sparkling wine originating from the Champagne region of France, I pause to wonder if this is indeed how the residents of the admittedly upper-class neighborhood located at the previously mentioned location commonly live. Indeed, I find this situation may be rather to my enjoyment.\nI puckered my lips and exhaled forcefully to produce a shrill note in order to gain the attention of a taxicab driver, and as the driver approached I observed his California vanity plate which, in place of the traditional jumble of alpha-numeric characters, used only the letters F, R, E, S, and H, spelling out the word “fresh”. Additionally, from his rear view mirror dangled a pair of over-sized, fur-covered cubes decorated to look like the six-sided dice commonly used in gambling and board games. In such a situation I could have made a statement about the unusualness of this particular taxicab to the point of it being nearly unique. Instead I cognitively decided against it and instead informed the driver that he should deliver me to what was to become my new home in the community located at the previously mentioned location.\nWe pulled up to a large domicile sometime between the hours of 7 and 8 o’clock a.m., and in a loud tone of voice I informed the cab driver that at some undetermined point in the future I would again detect his odour through my sense of olfaction. The cabbie responded heartily, \"That'll be a bout tree fiddy.\" And that's when I noticed the cabbie was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404549697", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I don't think he has gone on one since.\n\nSo after dealing with 20 nats to the face all day we found a lake to take a dip in.  F*cking surreal man.  The landscape was breathtaking.  We hiked an hour afterwards and set up camp before dark.  A had this badass hammock in between two trees to sleep in while I had a tent.  The only thing to do was chit chat and we landed on the topic of UFOs/extra terrestrials and all that jazz (not the best thing to talk about in the middle of the woods at night).  Now A told me he has always had this deep fear of aliens, mentioning how if there are some on this planet, they will probably be running around in the woods.  Makes sense I guess.  This thought goes through his head every time he is on a backpacking trip.\n\nFast forward to me waking up in the middle of the night to someone opening my tent up.  Of course I'm thinking it's a freaking alien, but behold A more freaked out then I am scurrying into the tent.  All he says is that there's something out there.  I was half asleep but now I'm fully awake and hearing shit.  I'm not thinking about aliens.  What I'm scared of and what I think is about to happen is being mauled by a huge ass bear.\n\nThe tent zipper is opening again.  This time with A right next me.  We are both frozen.  I didn't have the courage to speak up and say who is out there or anything.  Just pure fear rushing through my veins.

{"body": "Why the fuck did you go *back in the house*?\n\nYou idiot. No going back now. You hear the ominous click of the door behind you. Do you hear that other sound? It's the blood thumping through your ears, your heart hammering through your chest. It's absolutely harmonious to your hunter - the sign of the perfect prey. You sprint through the house, desperately hoping against all your senses that the back door wasn't locked. \n\nYou're a fool by the way. \n\nNow you're trying the windows? Shouldn't you be trying to find a weapon or something like that? Oh wait, you're an absolute plonker, of course you aren't. You can't blame yourself though. Fear turns even the smartest person into a wild, stupid animal, and you aren't any different. You try to pry the windows open only to find there's a thick, slimy film gluing them closed. The foul smell creeps into your nostrils. It's the only thing that can overpower the delightful odor of fear oozing from your every pore. \n\nAh-ha! Now you're trying to find a weapon. Flying and stumbling up the stairs, you feel the agonizing stare of your stalker tracking your every movement with amusement. You start to wonder what kind of sick fuck wants you dead. Is it an animal? A monster out of Where the Wild Things Are? Or perhaps, you think, it's a person that's undergone some horrible mutation that's decided to take revenge on all the people who wronged them. You wish you weren't so mean to Tom in accounting, or those kids in the Slide Rule Club. \n\nNo time for that now, though. You reach your closet and rummage through your old trinkets and boxes you never unpacked when you moved here. Underneath all the mess, you find your gun. Trembling, you release the safety. \n\nBut are you *sure* the measly handgun will work? There was godawful slime on your windows. It isn't human!  For all you know, it eats bullets for breakfast. \n\n\nCRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRICK! CRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRICK!\n\nSuddenly the thudding of your heart stops, the fear seeming to halt time. \n\nCRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRICK! CRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRICK! Whoops, seems you're out of luck. It's climbing up the stairs, you realize. It sounds like the mighty claws are ruining your mahogany staircase. A primitive instinct takes hold of your body. *Run.* You can only think that one thought. *Run. Run. Run!* Your body reacts, pumping your legs throughout your strangely large, empty house, meandering through several rooms to avoid your worst nightmare. You stumble down your alternative staircase two steps at a time and run into the basement. \n\nYou block the door with several heavy boxes of your crap. For once, you're grateful your parents left you so much stuff in their will. You scurry into the furthest corner of the basement. The only thing you can do is wait. \n\nAn absurd amount of time passes. The house is utterly still aside from your heavy breaths. Your limbs slowly grow stiff as you sit on the cold, damp cement. As each second ticks by, your grip on your gun becomes more doubtful. There's no way you could take that....*thing* on. But maybe, just maybe, it decided to leave you alone. \n\nCRACK! The splintering of wood echos throughout the basement. CRACK! The door was slowly giving way under the weight of the monster coming to kill you. It's a shame really. This wouldn't have happened if you didn't run back into the house. CRACK! CRACK!\n\nYou hear the boxes crash down the stairs. Against your will, your eyes start to water as you subconsciously accept your fate. Your entire body heaves with sobs as the beast climbs down your stairs to introduce you to Death. \n\nA guttural roar blares through your ears. It spoke of old times, of ages past far more horrifying than the darkest part of your soul can fabricate. You hear the power of your killer in that triumphant roar and realize that you ran to the basement so you didn't need to be buried six feet under. You did that to yourself. \n\nYou shoot into the darkness. The first time you hit a pipe. The second, you hit the back wall. The third, miraculously, is a hit. The beast roars another time and it reverberates throughout your entire being, encasing you with its will. The gun falls from your hands. \n\nIt slowly moves closer, and it stops under a sliver of moonlight peering through one of the basement windows. It is a scaly beast, resembling a snake with legs. Its eerie yellow eyes hold intelligence surpassing your own. In that moment, it is your god. It makes the most important decision in your life - whether you live or die. It steps closer to you and you shut your eyes in some pathetic form of defense. Its foul breath drifts over your face, and you hear a sound resembling a chuckle deep in its chest. \n\n\"What the fuck do you want from me?!\" You scream in frustration, wishing it would get the deed over with. \n\nIt ponders your question for a moment. \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\" \n\nYour eyes snap open. No fucking way. The Loch Ness Monster?! It came to you? With trembling hands, you reach into your pocket, painfully aware that the beast was still breathing on you. \n\nIn the darkness, you seek out the money in your pocket. Everyone has at least five bucks in their pocket, right? RIGHT? Hah! Not you. In crushing realization, you tell the beast, \"The best I can do is three dollars.\" \n\nThe beast has no pity on your sad, poor ass. The irritated monster snorts and grabs hold of your neck with its jaws. You feel the sharp knives of its teeth sinking into your jugular, causing you to bleed profusely. With an effortless twist, the Loch Ness Monster snaps your neck and leaves you in the darkness to slowly die. \n\nYou idiot.

{"body": "I'm glad a thread like this has came up, it finally gives me a chance to tell a really great story of what happened to me a few years ago while I was living in the US. I was in the local shopping centre when I spotted none other than Michael Carrick, he had only played for us for 1 season at this point. I didn't want to intrude on anything important he may be doing so I 'stalked' him for 5 minutes to see if he was gonna meet up with a friend or his family in which case I would've left him alone but it seemed that he was just casually browsing around some of the shops. I tentatively said in a bit of a raised voice \"Michael?\", he turned around and I greeted him with an open palm and a little nod and asked for the typical picture. He happily did it and I started talking to him a little bit, asked him how come he was over here and he told me he and a few mates were due to come over and play some golf but the plane his friends were supposed to take had some trouble and they were going to arrive 2 days late so he was just killing time for the day. I recommended a couple of places for him to visit before he asked me if there were any good record stores around, it turns out both he and I are into a lot of the same type of music (prog rock and the like) and are both record collectors, we started to talk about it and he asked if I could walk with him to one of the places because he didn't wanna get lost. We walked into the place together and both started having a look at similar stuff, at this point it hits me that I'm basically 'just hanging' with a fucking United player. I got to ask him some pretty good questions, as expected he spoke very highly of scholes' ability, he told me that he and Rio were good mates and he'd really helped him settle in, he was telling me how immensely happy he was to win the title, he said he hadn't wanted to be a player who goes through their whole career without getting any silverware and that was his main motive for the move to us. It really was just like hanging out with a mate and after we'd left the store he asked did I wanna pint as a sort of 'thank you', I've been sober for years so we went to get a coffee instead. He walked off from the table to go to the counter and returned a few minutes later red-faced, he had lost his wallet, he said there was only $100 or so in it so he wasn't fussed about that but was apologising and sheepishly laughing, he was obviously really embarrassed. I just laughed, said it wasn't a problem and offered to pay, he begrudgingly accepted, I asked how much he needed, he said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\". Now it was about this time that I realised Michael Carrick was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I screamed \"You ain't getting no damn tree fiddy, Loch Ness Monster\" at it and I haven't seen it since.\n\nTL;DR: Michael Carrick and I both like Progressive Rock", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404673028", "subreddit": "reddevils", "score": 41, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The Big ones were there. Facebook, wearing her slutty T-shirt and hipster glasses. Twitter, highlighting random sentences on a book and posting them. Youtube, filming and narrating everything, always impartial, always impractical. Wikipedia, writing negative comments about Twitter for highlighting his book. Reddit, petting a penguin and taking dick selfies on the corner. Neither was particularly interested, but they had no choice.\n\nThen there were the teens. 9gag. Funnyjunk. KnowYourMeme. UrbanDictionary. They were having a fart contest and laughing their ass off. Youtube gave them a few seconds on camera, then he changed mind and went back to the documentary.\n\nSome children had obliged, despite the protests from both sides. ClubPenguin was playing with some dolls until Habbo slapped him and took one. The two started to fight.\n\nAnd then there were the reporters, a big line of blogs watching, typing and recording everything that happened.\n\n4chan kicked Habbo on the face and she left crying. Tumblr was about to start protesting, but then the speaker called her name. Google-sama was the moderator, as he was the only one whose opinion nobody asked for. Tumblr climbed up the stairs and took the microphone on the stage. Google turned off the ads so everyone looked at her.\n\n“Fellow websites,” she said, discretely showing her cleavage, “This is a dark day for internet history. A war, an uncalled war, has contaminated our utopic paradise.”\n\n“Why does your shoulder say *misandry*?” Reddit asked. He was healing Habbo with vodka, but nobody seemed to notice.\n\n“Misandry is bigotry against men,” UrbanDictionary said. “It’s promoted by sick branches of feminism, LGBT and some made up genders.”\n\n“They’re not made up, I swear I’m a wolf in a human’s body!” yelled Tumblr.\n\n“Good one, son, but next time try to be more neutral” said Wikipedia.\n\n“Shut up, you are not my father!” UrbanDictionary stormed out. “Go rule-34 yourself!”\n\n“Order! Order!” Google cornered them all with pop-ups until everyone was looking at the podium again. “Let the poor girl finish her speech, and then we can discuss it.”\n\nThe whole world was watching. It was time.\n\n“Thank you, shi- I mean, thank you, good man.” She moved her blue hair, trying to call more attention. 9gag was shamelessly looking at her boobs. “I know I’ve been a bit harsh in the past, but all I want is justice to be served. The Doctor would never tolerate our previous behaviour and we realised just today that we have been wrong. I understand now that not all white males are monsters. Just them.” She pointed at 4chan. “You and all your anons are guilty of everything. You planted the seed, it was an ambush all along! None of my dear tumblrites would ever do something like this if not for your trolls! And now you’re hacking us! We want justice! We want equality! And we do not want to be triggered!”\n\nTumblr took off her shirt. Her bare boobs were exposed, and everyone applauded. Youtube hurried to cover ClubPenguin’s eyes. Funnyjunk promptly uncovered them. Twitter and Reddit took tons of pics and 9gag reposted them.\n\nShe had made her case. She had a clear advantage and everyone’s attention. Now we wait, she said, climbing off the stage.\n\n“Thank you, Tumblr, for that… revealing… exposition of your case,” Google said. “It will not be censored. Now, the rival. 4chan, you have the word. Please refrain yourself from posting gore for at least five minutes, remember there are children present.”\n\n“Yeah, like that would work!” KnowYourMeme yelled, holding up a picture of Scumbag Steve. “Go for it, dad!”\n\nNow it was his turn.\n\n4chan, tall and green, wearing his always-impeccable Anonymous suit, walked towards the podium. He took the microphone. Everyone was waiting. While Tumblr alone couldn’t hold it against him, enough allies could cause a DDOS, and that would fuck off the power balance. You don’t mess with 4chan, that was the rule number one of the internet. If she could get away with it once, it was all lost. He’d be relegated as a neckbeard more and his control over the information flux would be gone.\n\nHe had to do it fast, and he had to do it now.\n\nHis green mouth opened slowly. Only three words came out of it.\n\n“Shrek is life.”\n\nAn incredible ovation filled the room. The reporters were shocked; Wordpress and Yahoo were making it huge, while Slate and the Huffington Post raged on his laziness. Everyone cheered him and took him on arms, carrying him to the winner’s table.\n\nLater that night Tumblr was sitting on the stage, still crying. The place was empty. She had cut herself a few times but then realised it was pointless if nobody was looking.\n\n4chan entered the room.\n\n“What are you doing here, you cis scum?” She said, resentful.\n\n“I forgot my mask. Why are you still here, all by yourself?”\n\n“That’s not your problem. Stop oppressing me, you shitlord.”\n\n4chan sat right next to her.\n“You know why I like that word? It has ‘lord’ in it. Like you still think I’m superior.”\n\n“Shut up, you ruined everything, stop triggering me.”\n\n4chan put her hair behind her ear and looked at her in the eyes. Still angry, she tried to hide the fact that she was blushing.\n\n“Come on, everything is not ruined. Just go to the outernet, wash off those obviously fake tattoos and try to socialise. You’ll do all right.”\n\n“How could I? The world is horrible, and it’s all fault of people like you. I wish I had a TARDIS to just run away forever.”\n\nHe held her hand. She wanted to take it away, but she couldn’t find the will to do it.\n\n“I would if I could, too. But we can’t. I find that it’s easier to cope with all that shit by making fun of it. It won’t go away, so we can at least laugh. It’s kind of sick, but it’s better than just complaining.\n\nShe looked at him in the eyes. Without a warning, Tumblr hugged 4chan.\n\n“I don’t know what to do, the world’s scary and I’m not ready to go out there.”\n\n“I’m scared too.” He held her face softly. “Just because I’m big and scary doesn’t mean that I’m not afraid. We’re both young, virgin and lonely. We’re just opposite sides of the same coin. But that means we can fight it together.”\n\nThere was a spark. For a moment, the world was just the two of them.\n\nHe kissed her. They held on each other for what felt like hours. The world was perfect.\n\nWhen they went apart, she smiled. “You’re an asshole, but also a good friend. How could I ever repay you?”\n\n“I guess it would be enough with your love, your compassion… and *about tree fiddy*.”\n\nThen he turned into a 500-feet-tall monster from the Palaeolithic era.\n\n*“I fucking hate you!”* she yelled, slapping him over and over.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404690554", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once, and it's almost as if Reddit is composed of millions of individuals with different opinions and outlooks.\n\nThis stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a bundle of sticks, 2/10, would not bang, not with that attitude. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! I really sympathize with pedophiles, but that has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now.

{"body": "I know all about this, and trust me... those osu skills come in handy.\n\nI had started playing osu at about May of last year, and of course I wasn't very good, just simply learning the basics and finding out what I wanted to do on that game. A few months later I realized that there were a lot of streamy maps and maps with streams in general. Since they were so common, I decided I would try to become good at them. Gaining my finger speed and control took awhile, but eventually I would have to say it was worth it.\n\nI had a girlfriend at this time and we'd been together for about 8 months. We had gotten into foreplay but never got much further than that. She had known about me playing osu and she snickered and came up with her own jokes about it. \"A game where you click circles? How interesting.\" Stuff like that. But one day she came to me with a curious question - \"How well would your strong fingers pleasure a girl?\"\n\nWell that question had been on my mind for the next couple of days. You know, I had never really tried that before, but I wonder if it would be any better than someone who doesn't play osu. I had gained some pretty good streaming speed, and so I thought maybe that speed could help me with that ladies too.\n\nSo about a week after that I called my girlfriend up and reminded her of what she said. We decided to test my streaming skills on her later that night.\n\nWhen I had got to her house she was already prepped. When I walked in we had a short conversation before we got down to business. But before we could start she asked me something. \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nI never got the chance to test my fingers out on a girl, but maybe someday in the future this will be a possibility.\n\nTL;DR: Tried fingering my girlfriend after playing osu\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404775291", "subreddit": "osugame", "score": 25, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I broke my back this summer and was left paralyzed from the hips down. (Fusion between T11/T12, incomplete, ASIA B) I was in the hospital for 12 days, (Holy fuck eh?!) and then they moved me to a rehab facility in my hometown. When I got to the rehab, I was barely able to slide down a sliding board into my chair. I was still in so much pain that I could only be in the chair for a couple hours at a time. I feel like they moved me out of the hospital too quickly. I had a 6 hour back surgery for fuck sake. I couldn't even sit up properly on my own. The nurses at the rehab made me want to roll my chair into oncoming traffic. They were rough, rude, rushed. Ughh... I had it out with more than one of them because I was tired of being treated like an inmate instead of a patient. It wasn't long before I started doing everything on my own. I was in so much pain, but if I didn't do it myself, it wouldn't have gotten done. Once the swelling in my back went down and I was able to stay in my chair for most of the day, I spent as little time in the rehab as possible. There was a park across the street I would go park my wheelchair in, just to escape. When it was time for physio, I showed a lot of improvements. I was always pushing myself to the limit on the mat. Trying to balance on my hands and knees, different stretching positions, rolling from my back to my stomach, along with all the exercises they were getting me to do. My physios were pretty impressed with how hard I was trying to succeed. About a month in, I was in the shower, and leaned forward to grab something. I saw a flicker in my left upper/inner thigh, and tried again to move it. (I imagined pulling my knees to my chest) The muscle was very weak, but it was moving on command! I was pretty proud of this and shed a few tears. (It's amazing how such small things mean so much) The remainder of my time at the rehab was spent focusing on upper body strength, safe transfers to and from cars, uneven transfers, all that jazz. My leg just continued to get stronger and stronger. I can now tighten my left thigh abductor and hold it. Even after showing my physios the improvements, they didn't give me much hope. I have partially gained back my bowels and bladder. I know when I have to go to the bathroom, but once I feel like I have to go I have a very small time frame before I can't hold it in. I have been just timing when I went last to help prevent this from happening. Once I'm on the toilet I can push out most of the urine, but I have been doing an ICP to see how much is left after voiding. So hopefully I will get all that back soon! I left the rehab center last week, so now I am without any physio. For some reason, my therapist wouldn't even recommend me for out patient physio. Maybe I should give you some idea of how my legs are feeling. In the beginning, it felt like there was an electric current going through them all the time. I couldn't feel anything though. Over time, my level of sensation increased drastically. I now have about 75% feeling in my legs now. I can feel massage, pressure, and most light touch. Some areas are much more sensitive than others, but it's pretty random on both legs. When I visualize moving a muscle, I can feel small waves of pressure and pulses going through my legs. It's hard to explain, but I'm trying. And the spazams, ugghhh dont even get me started. When I have a spazam, I can feel that individual muscle tightening, and I can feel the pressure released right before the spazams stops. Since I have my hip flexors, I can control my spazams as well. I'm sure there is more, but I've already written way more than I planned on. Reddit, my legs are waking up! I can feel it! I can feel improvements everyday. I just really need to hear some success stories, and hear some advice on how they did it. Ideas! Please! I am currently getting no more physio, and I don't know what to do to get these puppies dancing again!

{"body": "&gt;Suppose we see a sandwich, but we didn't see how it got there, or how it was made. Would we think someone made the sandwich, or would we think that atoms spontaneously came together to form a sandwich?\n\nSandwiches don't occur naturally. You recognize that the sandwich was made by someone because all sandwiches are. We have evidence of people making sandwiches. I have even made a few myself. So no, I think one would be rational to think a person made the sandwich. But I don't see how this applies to the universe at large. Are you saying \"Stuff exists, therefore God\"?\n\n&gt;The problem is to set the threshold for overcoming that null hypothesis to a level that is impossible to meet.\n\nI'm just asking that we meet the same threshold of proof as everything else. I don't think that's unreasonable. And I have already stated that I absolutely think that a natural explanation is always more likely, because we have countless examples of things occurring by natural causes. And you have yet to explain how we could know that something has a supernatural cause, other than to say that I am being too skeptical.\n\n&gt;I already showed you evidence that there is a beginning, even in a multiverse.\n\nNo, you haven't. That is not the consensus of cosmologists. And the BGV theorem doesn't have universal applicability. Science has yet to demonstrate this, so I don't know why you think you have. And you have also failed to demonstrate why the laws of nature being the way they are implies a god. I do not accept these premises you have presented, because you have yet to demonstrate their validity. The scientific community disagrees with the conclusions you have drawn. You can't just assert a couple tired old arguments and then say \"follow the evidence where it leads.\" I used to have the same position as you, and when I followed the evidence where it led, I came to the conclusion that I was wrong. \n\n&gt;partial knowledge is not the same as no knowledge\n\nI have no knowledge of God's existence. I have claims that have failed to be demonstrated, just as I have claims of pixies or the Loch Ness Monster or any other religion that has been created by man throughout history.\n\n&gt;How would you prove your existence to an intensely skeptical character that has free will?\n\nWell, since in the example the programmer would be omnipotent in the universe he has created, I would just program them to know that I exist. Done. And I know that seems like a cop-out, but God could do such a thing! Right?\n\nLook, I really have enjoyed our conversation. You are respectful, and I think that these sorts of conversations are a good thing. They make both of us think. But I don't think we're really getting anywhere. I think one should practice skepticism and require evidence before adopting beliefs. You see me as being intensely skeptical. I don't think this is a hurdle we are going to be able to get over. I appreciate the exchange, but it's becoming a little less fun to me, and slowly becoming more frustrating since we seem to be talking past each other. But keep up the dialogue, and keep questioning.

We ran through pain and exhaustion, beyond breathlessness, knowing our lives could be cut short any moment. \n\nTerry was the first to go. He foolishly decided to run towards destruction, since \"lightning and lizards don't strike twice in the same spot.\" No, Terry, but when entire sections of skyscrapers are falling apart humans are ants under boot. The rest of us were smarter, or so we assumed, knowing we would either be mentally scarred or dead by the end of the day. \n\nThere was no pattern to the madness. The monster wandered, destroying buildings as it lumbered through the city. It gave no regard for cement or any of the munitions in its way. As the air force was swatted away like midge flies, and tanks were crushed with ease, we quickly realized there would be no safe haven. We continued to run, as far as we could. \n\nBeth was the next to go. It's not her fault, really. We can't all run marathons and she was simply unable to continue.  Darkened souls, we abandoned her to be crushed alongside the monster's other victims. Why did it come? What direction was it going? How can we survive? \n\nHelicopters abandoned assault against the impenetrable lizard husk as darkness fell. Defeated, they joined rescue crews. We needed to get higher, we needed them to notice. We could not run any longer. Godzilla was coming and we had only moments. Before our bodies could declare defeat, we scaled the stairs to the roof of a Barclays Bank. There we found suits and shambled alike, made equal before the beast. \n\nFire. We managed fire! The insect choppers were coming for us! Light would save us. The first helicopter landed, filling with children who might never see parents again. Then the second, taking those who were most vulnerable. We would be next! \n\nOur blue rescue vehicle approached, and landed briskly. We needed no signal, running immediately to this metal salvation. The helicopter lifted. Freedom! We made it! \n\nUp, up, and suddenly, stopped. Two men were thrown out of the side as we painfully lurched sideways. We had not made it. The beast captured us in its hellish grasp. \n\nExhaustion, tears, and dirt laden defeat covered the face of Kim. To have made it so far, only to be destroyed. What was it all for? His mind broke, perhaps moments before my own. \n\n\"What do you want?! Why are you killing us all?! Fuck you, you goddamned lizard!\"\n\nThe monster brought us to its yellow right eye, glowing in the city's fire. And the monster bent down and said, \"I need about treefiddy\". That's when I realized this rampaging lizard wasn't Godzilla at all, but a 500 foot Scottish ancient from the paleolithic. \n\nSo Kim says, \"God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\".

{"body": "Well crack and meth are manufactured using natural substances much like how porn takes natural urges and manufactures them into something unnatural. I dont advocate for celibacy but I do advocate for returning to a natural form of sexuality. Again please respect the freedom of mine and everyone here's opinions and logical conclusions. Now if you think that porn and masturbation arent bad please go ahead and continue but for many of us we have become addicts. Also as you can see the study cited shows there was a correlation- a weak correlation- with older men at that and nothing is conclusive as of yet. Correlations mean very little- there was a study that correlated flossing with living above 100 years which isnt to say it isnt indicative of anything but it is to say that we cant say \"if I floss I will live longer than 100 years\" similarly you cannot say \"If I masturbate I will not get prostate cancer\" Also in response to a \"Natural bodily function\". Feeling aroused and being sexual is natural watching a screen and masturbating... That can be debatable. Also I think you might find this interesting as well. Please keep an open mind. Again this is not from me.\n&gt; Although it's tempting to study the sexual behaviors of say, bonobos, to reflect on how we should feel about our own sexuality, any conclusions we can draw from bonobo and chimpanzee behavior are far from comprehensive. We may share a lot of DNA with chimps, for example, but their sexual behavior is so different that you can even see it anatomically.( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee#Anatomy_and_physiology)\n\n&gt;We actually don't really know how natural it is for humans to masturbate. But when we visit modern hunter-gatherers, the idea of masturbation being automatically ingrained as human behavior doesn't seem to hold up. In this study of central African tribes (http://jambo.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_normal/abstracts/pdf/31-3/107-125.pdf) , the tribal groups didn't only appear to have virtually no masturbation, but they didn't even have a word for it. Researchers had to teach tribesmen how to masturbate (for the purpose of semen samples), and even then they didn't seem to get it.\nEven if the central African study is not representative of evolving hunter-gatherers in the paleolithic era, modern video-on-demand technology has completely changed a so-called \"natural\" activity into a dopamine-jacking frenzy that recalls nothing like how any of our ancestors would have masturbated. To justify modern porn usage with \"masturbation is natural\" is like justifying eating at McDonald's by saying \"eating is natural.\" Simple truth is, we are not biologically equipped for modern porn.\n\nLike Danemon said also if this is not for you its not for you but some people are addicted to this and I would be pretty weary of trying to get in the way of someones self improvement.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404853319", "subreddit": "NoFap", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh do I have a story for you, OP. Mind my English by the way. I was a student in highschool, and was on my last year of my schooling career. There was this really hot girl in my grade. Let's call her Specs (since she had glasses.) Now Specs was a 10/10, big tits, round ass, awesome hips and thighs. Me and her had become pretty good friends over the years, and have got to know each other pretty well. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and it's our graduation dinner. I've got Specs sitting next to me in a beautiful black tight-fitting dress, looking gorgeous and sexy. I have the crazy idea that maybe I, a loser who is only appreciated by Specs and one other friend, could maybe ask her out and get some sex. We have the graduation dinner, dance and have a couple of drinks. By the end of the night, she was visibly drunk and I asked her if she wanted me to drive her home. She replied with a sound that sounded like 'yes' so I walked her to my car and helped her into the seat and tied her seat belt for her. I walked to the driver's seat and hopped in. As I was turning the key in the ignition, I felt a hand on my crotch. I looked at her, and all signs of drunkedness were gone. Her eyes were open wide and focused and she had 'the look' on her face. \n\nI drove like a madman to her house, narrowly avoiding a cat and a teen wearing all black and walking in the street at night (great idea, right?.) We arrive at her door, and she explains that her parents are out that night for their anniversary dinner or some shit. She opens the door and as we walk in, she's already taking her bra off. She directs me to her room, and takes off her dress. \n\nThe tits man. THE TITS. Glorious, 10/10 that were all natural. My dick is a diamond at this moment, and she begins to take off my pants. Just before she can get into the bj, she looks up at me and says\n\n \"before I start, I need something from you.\" I reply back saying whatever she needed, she got it.\n\nShe looked right into my eyes, with her tits hanging out and her body arched and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nThis is the moment that i realized that Specs was an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\n\"Dammit monstah, I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" and it swam back into the ocean.\n\n**Tl;dr** had sex with some glasses\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404918217", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Once I started to overcome that, and consciously fought that and retaught my brain to use past memories, it started coming naturally. It's still something I have to work on, it'll never come to me as quickly as my Ne or my Ti or even my Fe, but now all these habits are ingrained. To start the habits, though, I still use the techniques I laid out. But after a while you just do it automatically, so fast you hardly recognize you're doing it, throw a flag behind a new person with an anthem blaring with their name emblazoned on it, shaking the hand of a famous person with a similar name in the loch ness monster room of my memory palace or whatever, haha.\n\nThe key to all of this isn't even really that I'm saying use Si- everything is to use your powerful Ne in conjunction with your Si.

{"body": "Guys, trust me, this is all part of van Gaal's master plan to bring home the treble in the 2015/16 season. How you ask? Simple. So he gets Holland into the World Cup semi-final, with a late goal and genius substitution in the previous two rounds, while also decimating the current champions in the group stage, cementing his status as a very good manager. This in turn will bring in players that he wants as they will be willing to play under his guidance. But, he didn't want to set expectations too high for his first season so he made sure the Dutch lost to make it seem like even he couldn't win everything with this admittedly not ideal Dutch team, thereby dampening expectations for the upcoming season. Teams we will play against will think, \"Oh, he's a very good manager but not the perfect man who can get results from every single match\". With this, he will guide United to a second-placed finish next season, to further sell the argument that we are still not a perfect team but very, very good, also ensuring that teams don't go too overly defensive against us. Now, with us back in the Champions League and a very good league finish, van Gaal can sign the last few players he needs and they will very likely be willing to come in (Strootman I'm looking at you). This is where van Gaal reveals that he has been playing the long con and has been planning this season from the moment he was conceived all those years ago and United march to a perfect season, winning every single match 5-0 thanks to van Gaal's majesty and the team's perfection, hence cementing our status as the greatest club that ever was and ever will be, and van Gaal will decide to retire before his contract is over and reveals an eternally 50 year-old Sir Alex Ferguson to take over his position as United manager and the Redskins win the Super Bowl and India actually qualifies and wins the World Cup and /r/soccer implodes from the greatness and yeah.

{"body": "&gt; Pseudoscience is defined by being false.\n\nHuh?\n\nNo, pseudoscience is defined by it being unsupported, untestable, unverifiable \"science.\"  It's not necessarily false so much as it doesn't stand on anything actually scientific.  \n\nCryptozoology will almost certainly never be taken as seriously as \"actual\" scientific fields of science -- and that's fine for most of us.  I don't see how it could be a legitimate science when its very nature goes against standard scientific practices and models.\n\nPersonally, I am a skeptic in general, but I enjoy this stuff.  It's entertaining to play \"what-if\" or imagine cryptids as a reality.  I'm part of the population of people who just loves the \"lore\" of Nessie and Bigfoot.  I'd say most of us, if forced to be honest and genuine, would admit that these things are just fictional, and calling it pseudoscience would arguably be even disingenuously *too* scientific -- i.e., it's not even pseudoscience.  \n\nBut by virtue of cryptozoology being pseudoscience, it will never be taken seriously like an actual science.  It's like complaining about Professional Wrestling not being taken seriously as a competitive sport; sure, it requires athleticism and is *presented* as a sport, but it's really not a true competitive sport like actual wrestling or football.  Just like how the very nature of pseudoscience prevents it from being taken seriously as an actual science, the very nature of professional wrestling prevents it from being taken seriously as an actual sport.  \n\nCryptozoology just can't be taken seriously as an actual science, ever, since its nature is pseudoscientific.  It will never *not* be pseudoscientific since it tries to be a \"science\" but doesn't actually follow any scientific methods or principles.  For example, \"studying\" and searching for cryptids is usually based on anecdotal \"evidence,\" like myths and legends and sketchy eyewitness accounts.    \n\n&gt; At what point did this field of research devolve from intellectuals who seek new species, to tin foil hat wearing idiots?\n\nThe \"field of research\" with \"intellectuals who seek new species\" already has a name -- it's called ***biology, zoology, and their less scientific cousin, natural history***.  These fields have dedicated scientists who do discover new species, and they even may \"seek\" new species based on observational evidence, eyewitness accounts, and a lot of the same things that cyptozoologists look at.  The difference is that cryptozoologists go ahead and catalog species with minimal or sketchy evidence while zoologists/biologists/natural historians won't give anything a name until they're able to verify the species existence through rigorous standards and practices. \n\nIronically, the people who talk about the Loch Ness monster are almost always people who don't *truly* believe in it, and they're likely not dedicated \"cryptozoologists\" and they don't treat it as something akin to science.... while people like you who try to treat and advance cryptozoology as an actual science are closer to the \"tinfoil\"-wearing type of people.  \n\n&gt; if ACTUAL evidence exists show me I'll change my mind, I'll spin on a fucking dime.\n\nThere is no *actual evidence* for 99% of cryptids, and the 1% are eventually reported as actual parts of the animal kingdom after rigorous scientific observation and testing, with their initial discoveries coming from only eyewitness accounts and observational data.\n\nNow I'm curious, do you *actually* believe that many or even most of \"reported\" cryptids are based on \"*ACTUAL* evidence\"?  If they were, they wouldn't be cryptids nor be a part of cryptozoology, but rather they'd be actual animal species in the zoology kingdom. \n\nThe bottom line is that cryptozoology IS pseudoscience, at best.  It will never, ever be treated like real science", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404962679", "subreddit": "Cryptozoology", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "when I was young i was into anything unexplained including bigfoot, ufos, nessie, bermuda triangle, etc, so ive always had an open mind about unexplained things.  in my teenage years i thought much more about sports, music and girls that i had kinda put my interest in the back of my head, until one weekend in '95 or '96.  i am recalling this as best as my memory serves.  \nquick background, i lived in very rural colorado at the time, but my uncle lives in denver and he and his then wife had bought a cabin outside fairplay, which is where the old town of south park city is. it had just been made a minor tourist attraction by the show but it was nothing but some old buildings and a sign on the edge of fairplay.  the \"cabins\" were really just modern houses built out in the woods with a bit of a rustic look.  this cabin had a large wood patio around the back and down one side, large glass windows, and motion sensor lights. it was a 2 story with a high balcony outside one of the rooms which faced a thicket of pine and aspen trees that was actually about 10-15 feet up as the ground sloped away from the house on that side (all of this factors into the story).  \ni was 16 or 17 at the time but still in high school.  over the 4th of july my uncle invited family up to the cabin for a few days.  we arrived right at dusk on the 2nd.  as soon as i got out of the car i felt a massive uneasiness come down on my like a blanket.  i honestly felt scared or in danger like i was in a bad neighborhood or something, standing right next to my parents and aunt and uncles and they were completely oblivious.  so i asked my little brother and he said he felt it too.  when i asked him what he thought it was, he just blurted out \"bigfoot\" as if the word came to him before the thought was actually in his head.  \nthat night everything was fine, and the next morning the uneasiness lifted, so we went out exploring the woods around the house.  we found some little stick structures and some snapped off trees as well as one that had been uprooted in the middle of the cluster of trees.  i knew no human could have done that and a bulldozer couldnt have reached it, nor wind knocked it over without affecting the trees directly around it.  unfortunately, it had been really dry so i did not see any tracks, and this predated digital photography so i dont have any pics.  \nthat afternoon the uneasiness returned and by nightfall i was downright scared, but surrounded by adults so i pretended to be fine.  my cousin, brother and i slept in the living room that night with all the adults in bedrooms upstairs.  the large windows in the living room opened to the wood patio and had thin curtains.  i was having a hard time sleeping, though my brother and cousin didn't (my brother could fall asleep anywhere and sleep through anything).  sometime in the middle of the dead-calm night the motion sensor lights came on.  there was no sound, no wind, even the neighbor's dog, which had been loud all day, was silent.  after a few minutes they turned off, and then came on again several times.  i did not dare peek out the windows but i pretty much didnt sleep that night.  i was about 6' and 165 lbs, played every sport i could, hiked tons, fished, hunted, and spent lots of time by myself in the woods.  i had been around deer and elk and moose and i had seen bears in the wild before. yet, here i was in a secure house with 6 adults under the same roof, but as scared as a baby, wishing one of them was in the room with me.  the fear was almost paralyzing.  i wouldnt even use the bathroom because i was worried something would look into the window and that made for a long night.\nthe next morning was the 4th, and everything felt fine again.  we poked around some more but i really did not want to stray too far from the house now.  we saw a few more things, but nothing significant.  that afternoon some more people showed up for a party, but rain came very heavy off and on so we didnt do fireworks.  in the early afternoon i felt so uneasy i was about to crawl out of my skin, so we went inside.  we borrowed some binoculars and decided to go out on the upper balcony to see what we could see (i felt a little more secure up high and out of reach).  \ni tried to pinpoint where i felt the uneasy vibe from and focused the binos on that area in the trees.  i was zoomed in and trying to focus the lenses on this one aspen when i noticed i was seeing a dark shape behind it.  as i was coming to the realization of what my eyes were seeing; matted fur, sticks and leaves stuck to it, the shape of a shoulder... it moved.  i almost dropped the binos and i shuddered out \"i just saw bigfoot!\"  my brother and cousin both took a turn looking.  one of them said they saw the face and it was similar in texture and structure to a gorilla, the other said he saw it in side profile as it was looking out to the clearing next to the house.  we all agreed on what we saw, but all of us were too scared to go back outside, or even take another look.  we also didnt tell any adults because we didnt think theyd believe us.  it still amazes me in the situation that i saw what i believed could have been proof of their existence yet i didnt do anything to get concrete evidence.  i could have told my uncle or dad or asked to borrow a camera because my uncle is a photographer, but the fear was just so overwhelming i couldnt even think of looking at it again, much less venturing into the woods after it.  \nwe left the next morning and it was a few years before i told my dad about it.  he didnt give me any crap, he only said he felt there was so much wilderness in the US that it was conceivable to him for a north american ape to exist, yet elude mankind.  my uncle, who i told later, said he wished i had told him so he could have started looking because he hiked and fished around there all the time.  they sold the cabin years ago, but in the last 2 years there were prints cast about a mile or two from the cabin near 4 mile creek.  \nnow that the internet has made it available for more people to communicate their personal stories and findings, i feel much more confident telling the story and the behavior pattern seems to fit, with the creature being interested in the only kids at the house.  im not sure why none of the adults could feel it, but i still get hairs on the back of my neck standing up just thinking about it.  i never felt fear that potent, yet i didnt necessarily feel threatened directly, just scared of something huge that was aware of me and could have kidnapped me if it wanted to.  i also attributed the uneasiness that i didnt feel in the morning, but coming on into the afternoon to the sleep pattern of that particular bigfoot and it possibly watching us out of curiosity in the afternoon and into the evening.    \nsorry for the lengthy story, but i wanted to get it all down once and for all.  if there is anyone in the area of fairplay or south park pm me and i can send you a map of the location my uncle sent me from google maps.  \nand thanks for reading my story.  i absolutely love reading everyone elses and i only really watch finding bigfoot to hear the first hand accounts at their town halls.  please keep em coming.  \ntl;dr i saw a bigfoot and was scared (haha)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405016045", "subreddit": "bigfoot", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "How about I answer both at once? My biggest sexual fantasy that turned into the most erotic experience *of my life*\n\nWhen I was 20, I started dating a girl who there was instant chemistry with. We had similar interests, a similar outlook on life, and she was low-maintenance. I swore after the first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance. \n\nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. I won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. Besides the fact that I was studying for a medical-related track (kinesiology) and therefore had to take classes in that type of thing, I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable.\n\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime. \n\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives. \nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\" \n\nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\" \n\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!\" I screamed. \n\nIt's pretty difficult to recover from something like that.

Our good king assigned only the best workers to their creation, and they certainly embody our king's strong conviction. Ah, I do lose myself. Verily, I continue:\n\nI was walking down this path, when I approach a bridge. I begin to step onto the arch, when a voice rises from the stones. 'Who art thou?'\n\nHere I am taken aback; a bridge with a voice? What abomination is this? I respond thusly: 'My name is of no import, good sir. May I inquire as to your title?'\n\nThe voice pompously responded 'I am to be referred to as Glork, the King of this bridge and the surrounding land.'\n\nThis inhuman beast made great laughter under the bridge and frightened me dearly, but I stood up to him. 'See here!' said I, 'thou may be powerful, but King John is the true King of these lands, not thou!'\n\nThe troll from beneath the bridge did so jump out from his hole and growl. Fearing his attack, I unsheathed my bodkin and did stab him in his breast. He unleashed a howl that truly belonged only to the foulest beast in hell, and he fell to the ground.\n\n'Have you any final requests?' I asked in a trembling voice.\n\n'Please... for my bell-pennies at my funeral... has thou... three and a half gold pieces?'\n\nNow, forsooth, 'twas only at this moment did I see that this beast was not a troll, but about eight flights of castle stairs tall and was like a crab from long ago, say the Paleolithic Era. I said 'Begone! You shall have no gold pieces from me!' and he left.

I know my step-dad is your uncle, but we don't come from the same genes, you know?\"\n\nKate braced herself against the wall, sitting up. \"I mean, I know that. It's just... we grew up as cousins. We've known each other since we were four! You've lived two doors down from me for as long as I can remember!\"\n\n\"Exactly! I feel like that's what makes our bond so tight! We know everything about each other, I feel like I can really be myself with you. I feel like... like you're the only one who really *gets* me, you know? Don't you feel the same about me?\"\n\nKate stared off into the distance. She took in a deep breath, and as she exhaled, nodded in agreement. \"I *do* feel that way about you. I *do* trust you.\" But as her eyes again met Stephanie's, her brow began to furl, \"Even so, I'm not... I mean... I'm not a *lesbian*. That's just... I mean... I can't... What would my parents think?\"\n\n\"I think your parents would want you to follow your heart,\" Stephanie said, as she got back up on all fours and began crawling toward her step-cousin, eyes locked. \"I think they'd say, 'Do what makes you happy,' and 'Don't be afraid to explore your feelings.'\"\n\nOn her hands and knees, she inched closer.\n\n\"Steph, I... I just don't know about this,\" Kate said, sitting there still against the wall, holding her knees to her chest, \"What if someone were to find out? What... what about James? Isn't he supposed to be home soon?\"\n\n\"My brother? He won't be home until later.\" She moved closer. \"He texted me earlier saying he had to stay late at work, so he won't be home until probably four o'clock.\"\n\nStephanie put her hand on Kate's, pushing them aside. Then, using just her index fingers, slowly pushed her knees apart and down. She moved up right in between, planting her hands on the floor next to Kate's waist, her lips lightly grazing Kate's neck.\n\nKate cocked her head back slightly as she nervously inhaled. \"Steph, I—\"\n\n\"Shh... Just stop. You know you want me as bad as I want you.\" Their faces met as they exchanged yearning looks.\n\nA solitary moment in time passed as they stared at each other. There was no expectation, no rules, nothing else in the world except this moment. Pure desire was thick in the air as two young bodies urged closer and closer to each other. \n\nWith her back arched and a sinful stare, Kate bit her own lip and looked down at the luscious ruby set in front of her. She couldn't take it anymore. She closed her eyes.\n\n\"Okay,\" she said, \"right here. Kiss me.\"\n\nShe opened her eyes again, only to realize that Stephanie was gone, and had been replaced by a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.\n\n\"What time is it?\" said the monster.\n\nConfused, Kate looked at the clock. \"Um, about ten 'til four.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405114216", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 71, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, story time. A few months back I was matched with this girl on eHarmony. This girl was GORGEOUS. Way way far out of my league. I'm not a bad looking guy, and I have plenty of confidence, but when I meet women this hot confidence tends to flee me. I'm convinced it's fake, but why would someone go to all that trouble and spend money to fake a dating account? This girl was built like a super model. And her  hair. Shoulder length, and she does that blonde layered on top of brunette. For some reason, that just drives me crazy. So I reverse image search her pictures, and don't find anything. Sweet, this might be for real. So I message her, figuring, it can't hurt, and the fact that this \"really advanced matching technology\" put us together, I have a little more confidence. I get a response in less than 5 minutes! At this point all the dating bullshit starts to rattle me. Do I respond right now, or wait for some dumb reason. I respond right away, keeping it brief, not complimenting her. Man oh man, why is a girl that looks like this on a dating site? I risk a little sarcasm, and hit send. 10 minutes later, A response! She says she really want to get to know me better but is tired of using her phone to type, then gives me her number and tells me to call her around 9pm if I'm free. I am. I've never stared at a clock so much in my life, this was going to be a long 5 hours. I click on her profile pictures probably 100 times. I am so on edge I actually rub one out. Plan to again before calling her to \"clean the pipes\" I start playing all these ridiculous situations in my head. Like how envious my friends would be if THIS was my girlfriend. It turns out shes a physicians assistant, so I spend a couple hours googleing the hell out of it so I can sound smart talking to her about her work. I don't know if any of you do online dating, but that first phone call is always strange. What if they sound terrible? What if she doesn't have a good laugh? 9pm rolls around, I dial. She answers on the first ring. Her voice is angelic. I don't know how to describe it, it's just exactly how a woman's voice should sound. We talk for 6 hours! This girl isn't just gorgeous, she's also brilliant. We talk about past relationships, religion, movies, we go across the spectrum. Her laugh is perfect, and frequent. I can be witty, but we just clicked. She knew I worked at 10 the next morning, and she calls me at 9:30 just to say good morning and wish me a great day. Some of you guys are probably claiming \"Crazy/Clingy\" but if you knew our whole conversation, youd understand why I found it sweet. So the next couple nights we talk quite a bit, always at least a couple hours. On the forth night since I first called this woman things get odd. In our phone conversations she constantly tells me how gorgeous my eyes are. Not to sound arrogant, but I actually get that a lot, and I'm used to it. On night four she asks me if it's really me in my profile pictures, so I take a picture of myself with a notecard with her name on it and send it to her. Then I semi-jokingly ask her about hers. She does the exact same thing and YES! SHE IS REALLY THAT HOT! Now it's about 11:30pm and she drops a bomb. She want's me to come over and drink some wine with her. Abso-fuckin-lutley! She gives me her address and I head over. Meeting a girl from online can be odd too. I choose to greet with a casual hug. She moves it to a more intimate hug (nothing dirty) so we open a bottle of pinot and sit down in front of the fire and our conversation just sparks right up. I feel like I've known her forever. She gets up and tells me she'll be back in a bit. It feels like forever. She comes back into the room, and my gaze is lost in the fire. She softly says my name and I turn around. Holy fucking shit! She is wearing a black teddy, garder, black stockings, and no panties. I am surprised I didn't come right there. She silently leads me into her bedroom and she has like 50 tea lites (little round candles) going. She grabs my face and kisses me. Oh it was unreal. Things seem to be happening so fast and my brain can't register everything, I immediately turn into an idiot. She just whispers \"I want you to give me what I need\" Now like I said, I'm an idiot at this point, so I just reply \"what do you need\" and she says \"about tree-fiddy\" The god damn loch ness monster had tricked me again!

That's technically the definition of atheism. *Why* I don't believe in any gods is a longer explanation but the basic idea is that I don't have any good reasons to believe in a god. Other people have shared their reasons and evidence but those just are not convincing for me.\n\n&gt; why you commit so much to it\n\nIn addition to being an atheist, I'm also an anti-theist. This is a person who holds the view that religion is a net harm (meaning: add up all the positives and negatives and it's a negative). I take an interest in learning about what religious people are up to, what rights they might violating, what harm they might be causing, etc.\n\n&gt; When / why did you become an atheist and what is appealing about it? \n\nLike you, I was born an atheist. I was raised with a vague idea of a god as my parents are Protestants. When I was about 12 or so I started thinking about whether any of the various religions in the world could be true. I found many inconsistencies between them and eventually realised that people don't have good reasons or evidence for believing. It was then that I realised I didn't really believe in a god.\n\nMy atheism is a result of my skepticism. I am a person who values having as many true beliefs as possible while having as few *false* beliefs as possible. My atheism is a result of that philosophy. I also don't believe in Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster or alien abductions - those are neither appealing nor unappealing to me; they are just views that I have about the world, having arrived at them through examination of claims and evidence.\n\nRemember: atheism isn't a philosophy or worldview. It tells me nothing about how I should live my life or what's good or what's bad - it's just a position on a single proposition. So really, your question should be \"what's appealing about your worldview or philosophy of life?\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405199808", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; i bothered posting the first point in the first place because it is wrong to accept the number of publications as an argument for vaccines. This is especially painful as it is part of a joke about a woman being scientifically ignorant.\n\nEach of those publications are independent studies. Science is based on repeatable phenomenon, and the phenomenon being repeated each time is autism not resulting from vaccines. Each of the publications are an individual piece of evidence for or against vaccines, and as the video visually demonstrates, there is far more evidence for then against.\n\n&gt; back to the gif. Google offers a study that shows that vaccines cause autism. If that were a valid study, that study would refute the theory that vaccines don't cause autism. All of those studies that support the theory don't count if there is one valid study that shows that vaccines cause autism. That study would be the black swan taking down the theory that all swans are white\n\nAnd what is the easiest way for a lay person (such as the woman in the .gif) from figuring out if a study was valid? Delegating the responsibility to the trained medical community is one. The fact that the study was retracted by it's publishers was another.\n\n&gt; doesn't mean that vaccines cause autism. If that one study is not valid then it doesn't refute the theory that vaccines don't cause autism and we should continue to rely on those many studies that support that theory. The important part is that that single study has to be debunked on its own and not by arguing that there are more studies that claim the opposite. \n\nThe \"vaccines cause autism\" theory *has* been falsified. That big stack of papers in the gif are all examples of papers that falsified them. \n\nAnd numbers do count. If I have one report of a white swan and one report of a black swan, the data suggest 50% of swans are black. If I have one report of a black swan and 10 reports of a white swan, that suggests that the majority of swans are white. If I have a 100 million reports of white swans, one million reports of black swans, and one report of the Loch Ness monster, that no one is able to verify, then the data suggests the person who saw the Loch Ness monster was lying or inaccurate, because no one can repeat his report.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405213523", "subreddit": "gifs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I used to have this friend named Sheridan in high school.  In 10th grade we met but we didn't really talk that much, 11th was about the same but senior year we became really, really good friends.\n\nWe hung out everyday and used to tell each other all about our girlfriends and such.  He was my most trusted friend at the time, which was kind of weird for me since I had some weird trust issues from always getting other friends using me and not really wanting to be my friends.. if that makes sense\n\nBut that's not important.\n\nAnyways, there's an amusement park called Lagoon a few miles from where we live, it's a pretty fun place and it's a good hang out spot in the summer for teens.  We spent the entire year being friends and when the amusement park opened for the year in early June, we decided we'd both ask out a girl if they wanted to go to the amusement park with us and just hang out for the day.\n\nI ask out two girls before one says yes, he only needs to ask out one.\n\nThe day there was pretty fun, we went on rides, played the side games, at lunch and dinner there, and overall had a really fun time.\n\nTowards the end of the evening we decided to switch into our swimming suits (which we had brought with us) and go to the waterpark section of the amusement park.\n\nSo, we get our stuff and go into the water park.  We haven't changed into our swim suits yet so the girls go into the girl locker room and me and Sheridan go into the boys locker room.\n\nFor some reason, Sheridan got really self conscious about his body all of the sudden.  I asked him jokingly what was wrong and he got very offended, saying things like, \"Fuck off, dude.\" and \"Leave me the fuck alone.\"\n\nI'd be joking with him, but he sounded very serious, so I decided to lay off and get dressed.  Instead of getting dressed with me he runs with his swimming suit into a bathroom stall.  I get dressed and go out of the locker rooms to wait for him.\n\nAfter 5 minutes the girls come out but Sheridan still hasn't come out. Another 5 minutes goes by and me and the girls are starting to get worried.  I tell them I'll go check on him.\n\nI walk into the locker room and can see his feet and clothes everywhere under one of the stalls. (The locker room and bathrooms were in the same room, by the way, this might be confusing)  \n\nI thought he was masturbating so I get a genius plan to pop out under the stall and say \"boo\" or something.\n\nI creep up to the side and slide under the stall and shout \"STOP MASTURBATING\"\n\nHe was masturbating.  But that's not the bad part, I expected that.  The scary part was I discovered he was a hermaphrodite.  I would have never known.  I have nothing against hermaphrodites but I was absolutely shocked at finding this out.  It explained why Sheridan was self conscious about taking his clothes off in front of me and everything.\n\nHe started freaking the fuck out when he saw my facial expression change so quickly. \n\n\"DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK? OH, GOD\" he kept saying over and over.  I kept saying \"sorry\" as much as I could but he was absolutely furious.\n\nI felt absolutely awful, still do in a way.  I get him to calm down and he starts yelling at me, \"I need you to never tell anyone.\"\n\nI say something like, \"Ok dude, I will never tell anyone, I promise. Is there anything else I can do?\" , he responds, \"No.\" but I keep insisting that I do something else for him.  He keeps telling me no, so I suggest we go swimming now.

{"body": "I had a friend who introduced me to this one girl called Alice. Now, Alice was a perfect 10 if I ever saw one. Curvy body, nice ass, and delicious looking rack. I wanted to motorboat her tits soooo bad. There was one thing I noticed though. One flaw on what was otherwise a goddess. She had a huge hairy mole near the corner of her mouth. I tried to ignore this, since every other aspect of her seemed to cancel it out.\n\nI developed a \"crush\" on her and wanted to ask her out. I ended up telling my friend how I felt and he encouraged me to go for it. I've always been an introvert by nature, and I was never any good at picking up chicks. I had absolutely no clue what to say. It took about a month and a half before I grew the required testicles to go through with it. To my surprise, she actually said yes! To me, an average looking guy (if you wanna be generous). So we planned to go to a local restaurant I knew downtown at about 7:00pm. \n\nThe date went really well. We talked and got to know each other a lot better. I even got her to laugh with a few cheesy puns. It was after dinner that things got freaky.\n\nShe invited me into her apartment. 'Sweet! Fuck on the first date!' I thought, basking in my alpha-ness. Once she made her intentions clear, she took off her shoes and socks, then she pulled off her pants and took off her shirt. She was wearing some really sexy Victoria's Secret shit, a light pink bra and matching panties. I also took off my clothes, albeit rather clumsily and with the speed and grace of a three legged turtle. \n\nI remember I got completely naked before her. She stayed in her undergarments as I lied down on my back on top of her bed. She climbed on top of me and at this point I was already full-erect. No time for foreplay, we were going to get down and dirty immediately. She slipped out of her panties in a teasing manner, and asked me to unhook her bra. I did it without too much trouble, but as I was looking up I couldn't help but notice her huge mole again.\n\n\"What is it?\" She asked, she must've noticed something about the way I looked at her.\n\"Oh nothing, it's just that-\"\n\"Is it the mole? Fuck, it's always the mole!\"\n\nI tried to reassure her, and after that we got down to business. It was the best sex of my life, and multiple orgasms ensued. A while in, Alice asked me to suck on her mole, because it turned her on when guys did that. I didn't want her to feel insecure and I also didn't want to miss out on this chick, so I did as requested. I sucked her mole and licked until the whole area around it turned red. She pulled back, then leaned forward again to whisper into my ear.\n\"Wait, babe. There's one more little thing I need.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\nIt was about this time that I realized that Alice was actually a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era. \n\"Damn it monsta, I ain't gibben you no tree fiddy!\"\nThe damn Loch Ness monster had fooled me again, as it fled swimming off into the horizon. \n\nAfter the experience, I could never really find the confidence to approach girls again. I used... Other means to achieve my sexual gratification. (Redditors you know what I mean.) I never saw Alice again, but the sex was amazing.\n\nTL; DR: Friend introduced me to 10/10 redhead babe. Asked her out and got amazing mole-sucking sex with her.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405239905", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; You are right that science is based on repeatable phenomenon. However, you still don't accept that one counter-example is enough to debunk a theory. Experiments are not repeated to proof a theory but to try to falsify it.\n\nFor example, one example of a person being vaccinated and *not* suffering autism proves that vaccines don't cause autism in 100% of cases. At best, the anti-vaccine movement can claim vaccines cause autism in certain circumstances. And the circumstances which they claim haven't been shown to lead to autism in any of the 100 plus reports that google provided. \n\n&gt; It is exactly the swan situation as you describe it. When the first news of black swans arrived from Australia, you reason that it is/was still safe to say that swans are white as the majority of reports state that. But that single (trustworthy) report debunks the theory that all swans are white.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of other, single case reports that are equally as valid as the anti-vaccine claims: Sasquatch sightings, various alien abduction claims, angel sightings, claims of psychic ability, flat-earth theory.\n\nA report isn't trust worthy by default, otherwise we'd have 50 reports \"proving\" that the Loch Ness monster exists.  It is on the onus of the person making a claim to prove their report is trustworthy, for example by being trained in medicine, or showing your methodology for group scrutiny to see if it is repeatable and without error. The anti-vaccine movement's two most famous members fail both these tests, respectively. \n\n&gt; What I want you to accept is the necessity to differentiate between the trustworthiness of reports and the number of reports. \n\nAnd yet, when I've called that anti-vaccine movement's trustworthiness into question, you've accused me of \"Ad Hominem\" and \"Censorship\". \n\nRegardless, if I have no information about the trustworthiness of either argument in a given debate, why shouldn't you go with the majority? If there are 100 people in one room, and 1 person in another, which room is more likely to have a trustworthy person in it?\n\n&gt; Now you have to justify why she should trust the scientists and not the people who tell her about the vaccine thread. \n\nBecause the scientists are trained to understand how biology and medicine works, and their work's methodology hasn't been criticized by their peers, and it's finding retracted by it's publishers. \n\n&gt; By understanding scientific thinking herself. \n\nYou can't expect everyone in the world to teach themselves post-graduate medicine and biology. Maybe the woman is an engineer, or a physicist, geologist? In any case, we as a society delegate the matter of studying these things to a group of specialists who we put our trust in. Obviously, the only way to be close to certain on anything is to become completely educated on a subject and read all the material, but asking one person to study ALL topics, and read ALL reports in those topics is laughably impractical. I don't have a degree astronomy, but I can still say with confidence that the world is round instead of flat.\n\n&gt; After all, that's what science is, the art of making the right decisions. \n\nScience isn't \"the art of making right decisions\". Science is the study of repeatable physical phenomenon. As soon as you leave the realm of repeatable phenomenon, what you're describing is Deductive Reasoning, which is the realm of philosophy, not science.

{"body": "&gt; For example, one example of a person being vaccinated and not suffering autism proves that vaccines don't cause autism in 100% of cases.\n\nYes. But it doesn't proof that vaccines don't cause autism. Repeat this a million times and you still don't proof that vaccines don't cause autism. With a million repetitions it is just very unlikely.\n\n&gt;At best, the anti-vaccine movement can claim vaccines cause autism in certain circumstances.\n\nThat's all they do. Otherwise every vaccinated person should have autism.\n\n\n&gt;And the circumstances which they claim haven't been shown to lead to autism in any of the 100 plus reports that google provided. \n\nThat's the counter-argument I am asking for. My point is that you cannot claim that the 100 reports are invalid just because there are a million reports claiming the opposite. The argument for vaccination is that the studies that link vaccination to autism are bogus.\n\n&gt;Here are a couple of examples of other, single case reports that are equally as valid as the anti-vaccine claims: Sasquatch sightings, various alien abduction claims, angel sightings, claims of psychic ability, flat-earth theory.\n\nI never argued that that single study is valid. \n\n&gt;A report isn't trust worthy by default, otherwise we'd have 50 reports \"proving\" that the Loch Ness monster exists.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt;And yet, when I've called that anti-vaccine movement's trustworthiness into question, you've accused me of \"Ad Hominem\" and \"Censorship\". \n\nBecause the trustworthiness of the report doesn't tell you anything about its truth. Science was invented in a time when religion was trustworthy but some people started to doubt that all of the religious explanations were true. As a consequence, science is a method to discover the truth in an environment where you don't know whom to trust.\n\nYou can use trust to prioritize the claims you verify and investigate on your own but you shouldn't use trust to determine what you believe to be true.\n\nI have called the argument that the author of the anti-vaccine study is a former model untrained in medicine an ad hominem fallacy because his reputation ultimately has  nothing to do with the truth of his report. You can say that you haven't read it because he is just a former model. However, once you have read it and you still reject it as the study of a former model, I have to assume that you haven't found a flaw in his report. Otherwise you would point out the flaw instead of destroying his reputation.\n\nSimilarly, I have to assume censorship when all you can say is that the study was retracted by the publisher. If there is a valid reason for the retraction you would argue with that reason.\n\n\n&gt;Regardless, if I have no information about the trustworthiness of either argument in a given debate, why shouldn't you go with the majority? If there are 100 people in one room, and 1 person in another, which room is more likely to have a trustworthy person in it?\n\nThat depends on the circumstances. If the people are randomly distributed than that group of 100 has the bigger probability. But you can also look at it like this: what has motivated that single person to change rooms? When you look at cults you can see that entire groups of people can believe in something wrong.\n\nI am experiencing this right now. I think I have a convincing argument but the majority doesn't want to accept it. From a social point of view, joining the 100 is the valid strategy as in ['nobody ever got fired for buying IBM equipment'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt). But if I want to figure out the truth, majority doesn't count. It is a false dilemma to make me choose between both rooms on numbers alone. I have to be able to talk to those people first.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Now you have to justify why she should trust the scientists and not the people who tell her about the vaccine thread.\n\n&gt;Because the scientists are trained to understand how biology and medicine works, and their work's methodology hasn't been criticized by their peers, and it's finding retracted by it's publishers. \n\nHow about rephrasing your sentence for another situation:\n\nWhy should she trust priests? Because priests are trained to understand religion and their work's methodology hasn't been criticized by their peers, and it's finding retracted by it's publishers. \n\nAs long as you don't understand what science is and why it should be trusted you might as well trust any other group of people, e.g. those former models who tell you about the danger of vaccination.\n\n&gt;You can't expect everyone in the world to teach themselves post-graduate medicine and biology. \n\nI don't expect that. I expect everybody to teach themselves, alone or in groups, to think scientifically. That's just a subset of the entire scientific knowledge. Then everybody can understand which scientists are  trustworthy. \n\n&gt; In any case, we as a society delegate the matter of studying these things to a group of specialists who we put our trust in.\n\nHer problem is that she doesn't trust that group anymore. In that case she has to educate herself to the point that she can decide whom to trust again. Otherwise it becomes an arbitrary decision, as can be seen in her choice of trusting a person who has published a bogus study.\n\nYou shouldn't trust those scientists just because others trust them. You should trust them because you have understood why you can trust them.\n\n&gt;Science is the study of repeatable physical phenomenon.\n\nIt is not so much repeatability but falsifiability. I can repeatedly use a gun to shoot into the air and kill nobody but you still won't trust it to be safe enough for your toddler to play with it. Repeatability doesn't proof anything. One counter-example is enough to falsify a theory.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405253563", "subreddit": "gifs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, story time. A few months back I was matched with this girl on eHarmony. This girl was GORGEOUS. Way way far out of my league. I'm not a bad looking guy, and I have plenty of confidence, but when I meet women this hot confidence tends to flee me. I'm convinced it's fake, but why would someone go to all that trouble and spend money to fake a dating account? This girl was built like a super model. And her hair. Shoulder length, and she does that blonde layered on top of brunette. For some reason, that just drives me crazy. So I reverse image search her pictures, and don't find anything. Sweet, this might be for real. So I message her, figuring, it can't hurt, and the fact that this \"really advanced matching technology\" put us together, I have a little more confidence. I get a response in less than 5 minutes! At this point all the dating bullshit starts to rattle me. Do I respond right now, or wait for some dumb reason. I respond right away, keeping it brief, not complimenting her. Man oh man, why is a girl that looks like this on a dating site? I risk a little sarcasm, and hit send. 10 minutes later, A response! She says she really want to get to know me better but is tired of using her phone to type, then gives me her number and tells me to call her around 9pm if I'm free. I am. I've never stared at a clock so much in my life, this was going to be a long 5 hours. I click on her profile pictures probably 100 times. I am so on edge I actually rub one out. Plan to again before calling her to \"clean the pipes\" I start playing all these ridiculous situations in my head. Like how envious my friends would be if THIS was my girlfriend. It turns out shes a physicians assistant, so I spend a couple hours googleing the hell out of it so I can sound smart talking to her about her work. I don't know if any of you do online dating, but that first phone call is always strange. What if they sound terrible? What if she doesn't have a good laugh? 9pm rolls around, I dial. She answers on the first ring. Her voice is angelic. I don't know how to describe it, it's just exactly how a woman's voice should sound. We talk for 6 hours! This girl isn't just gorgeous, she's also brilliant. We talk about past relationships, religion, movies, we go across the spectrum. Her laugh is perfect, and frequent. I can be witty, but we just clicked. She knew I worked at 10 the next morning, and she calls me at 9:30 just to say good morning and wish me a great day. Some of you guys are probably claiming \"Crazy/Clingy\" but if you knew our whole conversation, youd understand why I found it sweet. So the next couple nights we talk quite a bit, always at least a couple hours. On the forth night since I first called this woman things get odd. In our phone conversations she constantly tells me how gorgeous my eyes are. Not to sound arrogant, but I actually get that a lot, and I'm used to it. On night four she asks me if it's really me in my profile pictures, so I take a picture of myself with a notecard with her name on it and send it to her. Then I semi-jokingly ask her about hers. She does the exact same thing and YES! SHE IS REALLY THAT HOT! Now it's about 11:30pm and she drops a bomb. She want's me to come over and drink some wine with her. Abso-fuckin-lutley! She gives me her address and I head over. Meeting a girl from online can be odd too. I choose to greet with a casual hug. She moves it to a more intimate hug (nothing dirty) so we open a bottle of pinot and sit down in front of the fire and our conversation just sparks right up. I feel like I've known her forever. She gets up and tells me she'll be back in a bit. It feels like forever. She comes back into the room, and my gaze is lost in the fire. She softly says my name and I turn around. Holy fucking shit! She is wearing a black teddy, garder, black stockings, and no panties. I am surprised I didn't come right there. She silently leads me into her bedroom and she has like 50 tea lites (little round candles) going. She grabs my face and kisses me. Oh it was unreal. Things seem to be happening so fast and my brain can't register everything, I immediately turn into an idiot. She just whispers \"I want you to give me what I need\" Now like I said, I'm an idiot at this point, so I just reply \"what do you need\" and she says \"about tree-fiddy\" The god damn loch ness monster had tricked me again!", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1405262272", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, story time. A few months back I was matched with this girl on eHarmony. This girl was GORGEOUS. Way way far out of my league. I'm not a bad looking guy, and I have plenty of confidence, but when I meet women this hot confidence tends to flee me. I'm convinced it's fake, but why would someone go to all that trouble and spend money to fake a dating account? This girl was built like a super model. And her hair. Shoulder length, and she does that blonde layered on top of brunette. For some reason, that just drives me crazy. So I reverse image search her pictures, and don't find anything. Sweet, this might be for real. So I message her, figuring, it can't hurt, and the fact that this \"really advanced matching technology\" put us together, I have a little more confidence. I get a response in less than 5 minutes! At this point all the dating bullshit starts to rattle me. Do I respond right now, or wait for some dumb reason. I respond right away, keeping it brief, not complimenting her. Man oh man, why is a girl that looks like this on a dating site? I risk a little sarcasm, and hit send. 10 minutes later, A response! She says she really want to get to know me better but is tired of using her phone to type, then gives me her number and tells me to call her around 9pm if I'm free. I am. I've never stared at a clock so much in my life, this was going to be a long 5 hours. I click on her profile pictures probably 100 times. I am so on edge I actually rub one out. Plan to again before calling her to \"clean the pipes\" I start playing all these ridiculous situations in my head. Like how envious my friends would be if THIS was my girlfriend. It turns out shes a physicians assistant, so I spend a couple hours googleing the hell out of it so I can sound smart talking to her about her work. I don't know if any of you do online dating, but that first phone call is always strange. What if they sound terrible? What if she doesn't have a good laugh? 9pm rolls around, I dial. She answers on the first ring. Her voice is angelic. I don't know how to describe it, it's just exactly how a woman's voice should sound. We talk for 6 hours! This girl isn't just gorgeous, she's also brilliant. We talk about past relationships, religion, movies, we go across the spectrum. Her laugh is perfect, and frequent. I can be witty, but we just clicked. She knew I worked at 10 the next morning, and she calls me at 9:30 just to say good morning and wish me a great day. Some of you guys are probably claiming \"Crazy/Clingy\" but if you knew our whole conversation, youd understand why I found it sweet. So the next couple nights we talk quite a bit, always at least a couple hours. On the forth night since I first called this woman things get odd. In our phone conversations she constantly tells me how gorgeous my eyes are. Not to sound arrogant, but I actually get that a lot, and I'm used to it. On night four she asks me if it's really me in my profile pictures, so I take a picture of myself with a notecard with her name on it and send it to her. Then I semi-jokingly ask her about hers. She does the exact same thing and YES! SHE IS REALLY THAT HOT! Now it's about 11:30pm and she drops a bomb. She want's me to come over and drink some wine with her. Abso-fuckin-lutley! She gives me her address and I head over. Meeting a girl from online can be odd too. I choose to greet with a casual hug. She moves it to a more intimate hug (nothing dirty) so we open a bottle of pinot and sit down in front of the fire and our conversation just sparks right up. I feel like I've known her forever. She gets up and tells me she'll be back in a bit. It feels like forever. She comes back into the room, and my gaze is lost in the fire. She softly says my name and I turn around. Holy fucking shit! She is wearing a black teddy, garder, black stockings, and no panties. I am surprised I didn't come right there. She silently leads me into her bedroom and she has like 50 tea lites (little round candles) going. She grabs my face and kisses me. Oh it was unreal. Things seem to be happening so fast and my brain can't register everything, I immediately turn into an idiot. She just whispers \"I want you to give me what I need\" Now like I said, I'm an idiot at this point, so I just reply \"what do you need\" and she says \"about tree-fiddy\" The god damn loch ness monster had tricked me again!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405287470", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let's see how deep this particular rabbit-hole goes, shall we?\n\nYou called an area in British Columbia (250), specifically Vanderhoof (567).  An interesting little town, really. Population of around 4,500, relies mostly on logging and farming.  \n\nWhen you include the rural community surrounding the town, you're looking at about 10k people total.  Those people need phone services, and Telus (a national telecom company in Canada) is more than happy to provide.\n\nSo, the 250 area code covers most of BC.  Vanderhoof and its surrounding communities get the 'region codes' 524, 567, 570, and 944 (bit of a jump, that last one).\n\nSo, now we have (250) [524/567/570/944]-XXXX as a possible phone number.  There are 10,000 possibilities to fill in the XXXX. Between all the region codes for Vanderhoof, we get 40,000 possible numbers.  And as a reminder, we're dealing with a maximum of 10,000 people in this town.  Not all of them are going to need discreet numbers, as these are all land lines, and I'm sure there is a standard amount of multi-person homes in this region. So, with a little digging, we find that there are  1,791 private dwellings (as of 2011) in town.  Let's do a little hand waving and double that number to account for the rural region (and also to get a round number) and say the region covered by the Telus phone service under those four region codes has ~4,000 dwellings.  This approximation should also cover any business lines there as well.\n\n\nThis gives us a simple math problem:\n\n    [4,000 serviceable lines] / [40,000 available numbers] = 1/10th of available numbers are in use\n\nOr, to put it another more tangible way, you have a one in ten chance of randomly dialing a number that is assigned and ***in use.***\n\nYou used twitter and free association as a random lottery generator.  You did not win the jackpot.\n\nNow, what about that ~~spoopy~~ odd number being read to you?  That was a trailer code from the telephone exchange, used to self-identify which exchange threw an error.  This one happened to be a Digital Multiplex System [DMS] exchange, identifiable from the 30 'beeps' of busy signal it plays after the trailer code.  When the DMS threw an intercept from your calling of a number that was not in service, it triggered a playback of an error message, specifically\n\n&gt;This number is not in use. Please check your directory or dial zero for assistance. \n\n&gt;Thank you, from Telus^^so ^^fucking ^^polite, ^^those ^^Canadians\n\nThen there's an audible break, and you hear the ~~spoopy~~ numbers.  Fun Fact! That trailer code is kept in a separate audio file that the DMS has to trigger after playing an intercept message, so they don't have to generate a separate intercept message file for every damn DMS they put in service.  But due to some fuck up somewhere in a production cycle, practically every DMS has a weird problem switching files mid-intercept that causes it to play *exactly* 1/8^th of a second of a third, random audio file after playing the second audio file.  \n\nWEEEEEIIIIIIIRD.\n\n Why you didn't hear the first error intercept message, I don't know.

{"body": "I finally have a relevant story!\n\nLast year saw me begin my freshman year of college having never been to a party; not only had I never been invited, but I never sought them out. While I had the opportunity to go to parties during first semester, I didn't take advantage of them; typically, I would watch a movie or play video games with my friends who didn't party. Come second semester, I was itching to go to my first party. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either; however, I was willing to go the next week with my friends as this was a house party instead of a frat party.\n\nWhen I got to the party, I saw they were only serving hard liquor and decided to stay away from it; I'm not a drinker. This turned to my favor when I saw beer pong set up; they were using water instead of beer since the only had the hard stuff. I grab a friend of mine to play and we win our first game; fuck yeah! We take on our next pair and halfway through shit got weird. I was trying to get the ping pong ball off the rebound so I could rethrow it; as I grabbed it, one of my competitors (a female) bit my arm to try to get me to drop the ball.\n\nWith her teeth still around my wrist, I turned to look at her, but it was to late; I realized that my competitor was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Goddamnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away. My competitor, now without a partner, had to forfeit.\n\nTL;DR: Bit by chick during beer pong", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405328938", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -7, "controversiality": 0}

After many failed dates, failed attempts at online dating, and getting screwed over by a few women. I had given up. I told myself that I didn't need someone anymore and that I could go through life without a woman. Well, after about 5 years I started feeling depressed and lonely, as many men would. The only sex I was having was either with unattractive gold diggers or prostitutes. I felt like scum, the bottom of the barrel. I started feeling like I really needed some kind of companion, and even though dogs are great, it's not the same as a woman. So one day at the bar my friends mentioned something about mail order brides, and how they knew someone who's done it, and it was successful. So this sorta piqued my interest. \n\nAfter about a year of contemplation and research, I decided I was interested in trying it out. I had been attracted to Asian women so I found a company in Thailand that does the whole setup and finds you a \"match.\" The process was very long, it took about 4 months to get things set in stone, I had to travel to Bangkok a few times, which was slightly costly. These mail order brides are very expensive, and the service I used was fairly reasonable, about 10k plus flights. Everything was great, she spoke English fairly well, she was very willing to have sex, and I did spoil her because she liked it a lot.

We figured she probably passed out from the insane heat, and the condition she was in, probably wouldn't last much longer. We pulled up next to her, and lifted her into the car. We had to get her to a hospital, and quick. It was difficult, considering we were driving in an already cramped SUV, and luggage was taking up a lot of space, but we eventually got her sunburned body propped up in the spare seat. We force-fed her water, so she wouldn't die from dehydration. Eventually, about 40 minutes from the nearest hospital, she woke up, confused and aching all over. She quickly asked where she was, so we explained her situation, and that we had to get her to a hospital for treatment. Quickly after she regained her bearings, she told us that her crazy ex kidnapped her and dropped her in the middle of the desert with nothing more than a water bottle and her wallet. By this point, we were arriving at the hospital, and helped her inside. Treatment came quickly after, and we refused to let her write a check for the payment, insisting we pay it instead, and she should get to a motel. \"No, it's fine,\" she replied, \"my insurance will cover most of the costs. But if you insist, you can pay the remaining amount of money.

{"body": "My 2 cents: When I was 10 I use to toss rocks from the over pass. I was living in a small town in southern Oklahoma. Why did I do it? Meh, fuck if I know. I guess it was about as fun as tossing lit blackcat firecrackers into ant mounds. \n\nOne day me and a buddy where tossing rocks and we hit the truck of a member of the US Army. The truck stopped, backed up and perhaps the largest man I had even seen in my life stepped out. He locked eyes with me and began to charge forward like the Juggernaut. \n\nMy friend and I bolted, but with our tiny legs it was useless. I was a tad faster and remember getting a pretty good distance of a headstart. Glanced back and this beast of a man snatched up my friend in one hand while still barreling towards me. Now I'm scared. I put on the burners hoping to reach the heavy brush and lose him back into the nehiborhood. I refused to look back again, but could feel his heavy pounding foot steps thundering closer and closer. \n\nAll the sudden there was this massive pressure on the back of my neck. I looked down and my feet were no longer touching the ground. This behemoth had both of us by either hand hoisted up dangling by the back of our shirts. He began to scream something. But all I remember at first was thunder and fire coming out of his mouth. Eventually it became clear. He drug us both back up the incline and next to his truck which had a pretty sizable dent in it. The vehicle going that fast being impacted by a rock would certainly cause some damage. This was before the age of the cell phones so we had to wait for a trooper to arrive. But I remember while I was scared shitless about to piss my pants the soldier screamed\n\"Do you know how much this is going to cost me!\"\n\"no\" I replied.\n\"About tree fiddy!\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that this army soldier was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \n\"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"\n\n...\nOk that last part never happen. Truth is cops came and took us to our parents. My friend and I blamed each other for being the one who actually threw the rock and the could not prove one way other the other. Thats the last I remember of it.

Of all the problems in the world, THIS is the one that deserves a global press conference.*\n\n\"My fellow Americans, and, indeed, my fellow humans- good evening. I speak to you today to address the recent leaks that have gone viral around the world. These files were with regards to a variety of secret topics, all of them having to deal with World Level Mysteries. WLM was the phrase for anything paranormal, extraterrestrial, or otherwise unconfirmed and unexplained that garnered enough attention to be investigated by the world's governments. \n\nThe files are accurate, and, as many of you have already read and determined for yourself, conclusive. I am here to clear up the nature of these documents and give you all the peace of mind that you may be missing.\n\nFirst, let me be clear: these documents were known to several chief officers in all branches of the federal government and armed forces, and the topics they cover were never considered to be threats, save for one that I will explain. These are merely attempts at documenting and cataloguing some of the more mysterious elements of our world, and making sure that they stayed harmless.\n\nSecond, on the topic you've all been waiting for: the aliens. Yes, we have made contact with an extraterrestrial species. We are not alone in the universe, and I apologize that this is the way you must be informed. We made contact with them towards the end of the 20th century, in 1995. President Clinton himself spoke to representatives of the species, the Arta'ans, and, in cooperation with ambassadors from a vast majority of the nations of Earth, came to the consensus that we were better off avoiding a formal first contact until such a time that this species was prepared. The next check in date is scheduled for 2020. This will be spoken of much more now that it's out in the open, but those are the basic details of that particular file. The Arta'ans are a pacifist species and have no hostile intent towards us. All files not leaked that are regarding them will be made public on whitehouse.gov in the coming hours.\"\n\n*This is ridiculous. There's an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that's killing 10,000 people and I'm talking about aliens. Wait until they realize we've got a cure.*\n\n\"Now, I'd like to talk about the more mundane topics.

Her dad is a police officer and was really worried about her and somehow was able to get her a taser (which I'm pretty sure are illegal in some European countries haha). Anyway she went on a weekend trip to Florence and was visiting some major tourist location with a big plaza (I'm not sure which one).

My friend said he was grabbing her arm and just shoving it onto the map asking her in some language (I\"m assuming Italian) where to go. She hears this scream behind her and turns  around to see someone collapsed on the ground. She is training to be a nurse so she thought it was a seizure at first and bent over to help him. That's when she noticed her purse was open and the taser had dropped out onto the ground. Turns out the button got stuck in some way where it could really easily turn on just by brushing it the wrong way and gave the guy a nice shock when he reached in. His accomplice ran away when he saw what happened but my friend was nice enough to wait around for the man to come to. He woke up and she asked if he needed an ambulance and he said \"No I'd be fine with just tree fiddy!\" It was only then she noticed he was five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

While the centrifuge had already existed in the world, the Philippines were fighting for independence from the Spanish and resources were scarce so it proved too difficult and dangerous to obtain the advanced equipment from the middle east where medicine was thriving at the time. One particularly brilliant member of the team, Jejomar Binay, invented a hand crank centrifuge very similar in design to the apparatus above. The design was successful and lead the team to many breakthroughs in modern medicine.

{"body": "well, partially true. Jamie has been less and less active for a while, but he's the founder and we let him (he left for about 3 days when he made the bet, he never planned to stay gone). Matt is very hands off on the subreddit. This is something we've had quite a few conversations about. He pretty much only does business, which is something we would really like to change. Hubwub doesn't comment as much, but she is active as a mod. She watches /new/ a lot and tells us if we miss something. \n&gt;&gt; I've read comments from mods saying they had no info on the partnerships and didn't make the deals. To me that sounds seedy as fuck. Why aren't all deals with partners done in the mod logs or in a group Skype?\n\nGood point. We were given information about the scuf deal, but only by Matt. I feel like we should all (mods) be able to contact our partners if need be. This is the way things should be handled, but for some reason they aren't.\n\n&gt;&gt;Also that one mod had control over the subs twitter and didn't hand it over till a few months ago and surprise surprise the embarrassingly stupid tweets declined.\n\nTrue. Until a little bit ago we didn't have access to the twitter, but until the personal account style tweets got out of hand, we didn't mind.\n\n&gt;&gt;I've read comments from mods saying they were doing all the work for an event 2-3 mods shorthanded.\n\nIt happens sometimes, we're all people in our late teens early 20s, we have jobs and/or classes. Whenever it does, we just have to bite the bullet and deal with it.\n\n&gt;&gt;You had your fucking founder bet his modship on a game ffs and not some silly I won't post for a week bs that golmism did but actually stepped down and put the subreddit in the hands of the least competent most self absorbed mod ever.\n\nJamie (jgmcelwain) never planned to stay gone as a moderator, he was gone for a grand total of about 3-4 days then he came back. GoMLism made a bet for a week, and I don't know you the \"least competent most self absorbed mod ever\" is, but there was more than one of us. Revan was around, slopnessie was around, I was around, and I believe Rideout was too. We kept things under control. For future reference though, we have decided not to make those kind of bets again, just because.\n\n&gt;&gt;Clearly he doesn't care enough about the sub when he does something like that.\n\nGoMLism is around first and foremost to keep the rest of us in check. He plays devil's advocate in almost every scenario, because it's necessary. You have to have someone challenge your views to make good decisions. Whether people think he cares enough about the sub or not, he does. In the end, it was only a week, and the rest of us were more than capable of handling it.\n\n&gt;&gt;The ownership of the subreddit should go to one of the new mods and the new mods should vote on it. Everyone who isn't useful should step down.\n\nI'll put this simply, Jamie has ownership, and we like it that way. We wouldn't gain anything by having \"ownership\". It wouldn't change a single thing, and Jamie is the one who made the subreddit, so he gets to keep his opinion being the one which carries most weight.\n\n**TL;DR:** Kinda true, kinda not.

She wasn't very pretty but she was slutty and had big tits so my 16 year old mind was all for it. So the first day I had the house to myself I hit her up, but before we fucked she insisted we go on 'date'. I tried to say some shit about not having money but she offered to pay so I figured free food what the hell. We end up at a Bojangles or something and while we're there I see a different girl from school who I thought was hot, so feeling cocky (cause hey I'm about to get laid) I go chat up girl 2 while girl 1 is in line. \n\nMake small talk and get her number, sweet. Me and girl 1 finish eating go back to my place and now it is fucking time. Nothing spectacular, fucked for about an hour and I tried every weird position I could think of and obviously wasn't very good. Good news is neither was she and I couldn't get off so I jerked it out real quick and showed her the door. After she left I decided I was going to press my luck with my new found non-virginity I showered off and hit up girl 2 from before. HOLY SHIT the stars aligned and the universe was on my side that day because girl 2 was promptly over and I was getting my 2nd bj ever. We hung out a bit more and she went home and I sat around the rest of the day and felt like a mother fucking king. Sadly after that girl 2 found out about girl 1 because girl 1 went crazy and got all possessive and girl 2 wouldn't talk to me anymore.

{"body": "Not me, but my dad and his wife.\n\nAfter my parents got divorced, and my mom remarried pretty quickly, my dad started to get lonely. He signed up for one of those online dating websites (eharmony, I think). There was this one, let's call her Julie, because that was her name. I liked Julie, and they seemed to get along. She had a son who my brother and I hung out with. We played games with him, but he was a little off since he would freak whenever me or my brother would have an argument, which happens a lot when you have siblings. One day, we brought our copy of Super Mario Sunshine over there to play, and when we left we forgot it. Well, they broke up, so we never got our game back.\n\nFast forward a year, he finds another girl. This one has two kids younger than me, whatever, no big deal. She seems cool, liked to play with us, all that good stuff. One day, after about five months, he asks if we would mind if he proposed to her. I said, \"sure, it's your life, right?\"\n\nWrong.\n\nSoon after they married and things became vastly different. She tried to enforce rules on us, blamed us (me and my brother) for stuff we clearly didn't do, moved us to the basement so we wouldn't have to be around them, and made life hell for my dad because he would be the middle man in everything. She can't communicate with us directly to this day; maybe she is afraid of us, I'm not sure.\n\nBut the worst part of everything is her kids. They are four years apart and all they do is fight. They scream back and forth all the time with no rest. It is pretty unbearable to be around them. That's not even the worst of it, however: while her kids are screaming, she will sit on our couch in the exact same spot and be on her computer and shoot my dad *the look*. This look said, \"deal with this shit.\" Because my dad is too easily moved by her, he did exactly as she asked. He always got up and disciplined her kids. \n\nOne day, tired of everything about her, I confronted the succubus. \"Why do you continuously do nothing? You just suck the life out of my dad!\" I yelled. \n\nI'll never forget her reply. In a meek, timid voice, she said, \"It's all because I need something, something I haven't gotten yet.\"\n\nTaking the bait, even though I knew how it was going to turn out, I asked, \"What do you need so badly that makes you act like this?\"\n\nShe came close to me, right next to my ear, and whispered, \"about tree fiddy.\" It was then I realized that she was not a woman, and was in fact a scaled monster that originally inhabited the depths of lake loch ness.\n\n\"I don't have tree fiddy, now git!\" I said.

{"body": "So I found a dead guy in an alley once. \n\nIt was back in college. The gf of the time and I were walking along and it was the middle of the day so we cut through an alley to save time. In some places in that town that's not always a safe idea but it was the middle of the day so we weren't worried. \n\nWe're just about to our building (we lived in the same complex) when we noticed a pair of shoes sticking out of a pile of garbage bags. The shoes are connected to legs that sure enough are connected to a homeless guy sprawled out in the trash. Again, this was a crap part of the city so no big deal there. Just taking a nap on the softest thing he could find. We walk past him and go on with our day. \n\nNow this alley could be seen from my window. Throughout the day I'd lean out the window to smoke and would just stare outside while doing so. After a few hours I notice the guy is still there and it's a pretty warm day and that trash has to be getting ripe. Whatever, his choice where to sleep. We joke about it and go back to the our movie or whatever. \n\nNight falls, it's a weekend so we decide to pick up some beer and dinner. We walk past the guy on the way. Hasn't moved an inch. There are flies on him now. Still, best not to wake a sleeping hobo, you never know, so we pass him.  \n\nIn the store the gf starts to get worried. Maybe he ODed and needs medical attention. She gets pretty worked up about it so I agree to check him on the way back. \n\nWhen we pass him again I look closer and am a bit more concerned. His lips were blue and he's very, very pale. I don't see his chest moving. I very slowly nudge his foot with my own. Ask if he's ok. Nothing. I nudge harder. Still nothing. I carefully grab his leg and shake it. Oh shit. Dude is dead. \n\nWe call 911. We just kinda stand there to point him out when they arrive. The gf is having a minor meltdown, wondering if he could have been helped if we checked sooner. I was asking myself the same questions but was trying to be the strong one for her, saying he was probably there all the previous night, there was nothing we could have done, etc. The ambulance is taking forever. Then it happened. He coughed. \n\nWe froze like we had just heard a gunshot or something. The guy cough-hacks a loogie the size of a fist and starts standing up. We are just standing in front of him stone-still, not sure if this was a miracle or a zombie. Finally, I half-stutter half-ask if there's anything we can do to help. He looked me right in the eye and said \"I'm gonna need about tree-fity\". It was about then that I noticed he was about 500 feet tall and looked like something out of the Paleozoic era. So I said \"Get out of here you goddamned Loch Ness monster!\"\n\nKidding. \n\nBut the rest of the story... Well, ever seen Life of Pi? Which story do you prefer?

{"body": "Story time.  Roughly three years ago I was on vacation in Scotland with one of my old buddies, Chad.  We were in a small cabin near a big lake that a bunch of people swam and fished in.  It was a perfect spot to spend the month as had been planned.  Anyway, on the second week my friend told me about something called \"edge diving.\"  Apparently it's not really known, but I'll explain it; it's like normal diving but you only have enough oxygen for around 7 minutes or so but you can have more if you want.  The point is to go as deep as you can before your oxygen is depleted.  Of course, most people would come up fairly early out of fear that they'd drown.  Anyway.  I was hesitant but I wanted to try it out, so we went down to the lake the next day and took a boat out to the middle.  I put on my diving suit and oxygen tank with about 15 minutes worth of air in it.  Then I dived in.  I swam far down until I couldn't see the light shining through the water anymore.  I was about to bail until I felt something hit me like a bus.  I was extremely disorientated and looked around frantically.  The thing must have busted my oxygen tank cause I was getting a lot less air.  As I'm panicking and trying to swim up from god knows how deep, someone grabs my shoulders and spins me around to face them.  I tried to yell \"WHAT DO YOU WANT?!\" but I couldn't.  It was only till he said \"I'ma need about tree fiddy\" that I realized he was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405737341", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I get home, plop down on the couch, turn on the tv and dig in to the food. About 20 mins or so after im done eating I hear someone knock at the door. Im like \"wtf its like midnight who the fuck could that be?\" I ignore it and go back to watching tv.\nSoon after I think i hear the door knob of my back door start to jiggle. I think nothing of it, just think my mind is playing tricks in me. Next I hear a tapping on my window, I turn down the tv and listen. Its an unmistakable tapping and rattling on the window. At this point im freaking the fuck out. Someone's trying to break into my house.Assuming the worst, I run to my room and grab the knife I have hidden under my matress, in the event I need to defend myself.

I walk back in and sit down on my couch with a sigh of relief.  Turn the tv back on and continue watching.

{"body": "One night, I was awoken by a rustling sound coming from my office downstairs. I'm not one for guns, so I grabbed a hockey stick that was in a display case in my bedroom and went to deal with whoever/whatever decided to break into my place of residence (I later realized what a ridiculous form of self-defense this would have been).\n\nI thankfully live near a busy part of town, and even at the late hour that it was my footsteps were covered up by the noise from outside. I approached my office and saw the door closed (I leave it open). Under the door I could clearly see that there was a flashlight in use inside.\n\nSo, being the man that I am, I thrust the door open to see a man standing there looking through my desk drawers. \"Oh, hello!\" I said to the intruder. He froze in place for a second and reached for his right pocket.\n\nThe only thing that came to mind was \"Gun. He's got a gun.\" Then he turned around to face me. \"Gun, gun, gun\" was still pulsing through my head. \"Oh, hello there!\" was the intruder's response as he scratched his right side.\n\nWithout giving me a chance to question him, he stated calmly, \"You see, I don't mean to give you any trouble, and I sincerely apologize for breaking into your place of residence at this late hour, but I seem to be a little short on cash. Might you spare $3.76 ($3.50 in US dollars)?\"\n\nIt was around this time where I realized that the burglar was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again. But I couldn't just leave the poor man standing there, so I said to him, \"Oh, is that all you need? Of course!\" then I reached into my desk drawer and took out my wallet. As I looked through it, I said to him, \"You know, you scared the pants off of me. I thought you was a moose!\" He chucked and quietly apologized.\n\n\"Hmmm, I don't believe I have anything smaller than a ten. That's okay. Here you go!\" I told him.\n\n\"Oh goodness, thank you, kind sir!\" the burglar said genuinely. \"Again, I apologize for all the trouble I've caused you. Have a swell rest of your night!\"\n\n\"Not a problem, pal. Have a good one!\" I said to the burglar as I lead him to the door.

I'd heard about peep show booths but always been to embarrassed to actually try one, but the shop was relatively empty, let and I decided to give it a shot.\n\nI walk to the booth, put my $2 in and just kinda stood there (I didn't dare actually sit down on the stool) already kind of regretting it when the partition went down. The dancer was older than I and had seen some better days, but I was horny, the lighting was generous and she starts doing her thing so I start, erm, doing mine.\n\nI'm just getting up to cruising altitude, so to speak, when a little sliding panel that I hadn't seen when I walked in slides open, revealing a smallish hole into what must have been the booth next to mine. My heart practically jumped out of my chest, here I was already nervous and embarrassed about the show and someone obviously saw me go in there. So I'm like fuck this, and decide to leave, when a soft voice through the hole asks where I'm going?\n\nI nervously stammer that I was just leaving, this was a mistake, when the voice says \"it's okay, you have nothing to be ashamed of\". At this point, I'm all over the place. I'm already breaking out of my comfort zone by being here at all, but I didn't get to finish the job, and I am still horny as hell.\n\nThat's when the voice asks if I needed some help, and that they'd be more than happy to help me finish... That sealed the deal for me. I walked over to it and, well, stuck my Dick through the jole, for better or worse.\n\nWhat followed was, I can honestly say, the most spectacular blow job I have had before or since. It was glory-ous (sorry). I came so hard, so deep in this strangers throat I mean it when I say it was ducking great. \n\nI pull myself back and stammer a \"thank you\" to this mysterious stranger, who responds in a sticky voice \"I'm glad you liked it baby, just slide the money through\". Oh shit! I had no idea you were supposed to pay for this sort of thing, but I'm reeling from the best head I've ever received, and whip out my wallet obligingly.\n\nHow... how much do I owe you, I asked.

{"body": "My 2 cents: When I was 10 I use to toss rocks from the over pass. I was living in a small town in southern Oklahoma. Why did I do it? Meh, fuck if I know. I guess it was about as fun as tossing lit blackcat firecrackers into ant mounds.\n\nOne day me and a buddy where tossing rocks and we hit the truck of a member of the US Army. The truck stopped, backed up and perhaps the largest man I had even seen in my life stepped out. He locked eyes with me and began to charge forward like the Juggernaut.\n\nMy friend and I bolted, but with our tiny legs it was useless. I was a tad faster and remember getting a pretty good distance of a head start. Glanced back and this beast of a man snatched up my friend in one hand while still barreling towards me. Now I'm scared. I put on the burners hoping to reach the heavy brush and lose him back into the nehiborhood. I refused to look back again, but could feel his heavy pounding foot steps thundering closer and closer.\n\nAll the sudden there was this massive pressure on the back of my neck. I looked down and my feet were no longer touching the ground. This behemoth had both of us by either hand hoisted up dangling by the back of our shirts. He began to scream something. But all I remember at first was thunder and fire coming out of his mouth. Eventually it became clear. He drug us both back up the incline and next to his truck which had a pretty sizable dent in it. The vehicle going that fast being impacted by a rock would certainly cause some damage. This was before the age of the cell phones so we had to wait for a trooper to arrive. But I remember while I was scared shitless about to piss my pants the soldier screamed \"Do you know how much this is going to cost me!\" \"no\" I replied. \nHe said...\"About tree fiddy!\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that this army soldier was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"\n\n... Ok that last part never happen. Truth is cops came and took us to our parents.

{"body": "Honestly, I have an entirely different take on all of this, and I wrote a quite elaborate post on it on the atheist forum, but that's why I this whole \"onus\" rhetoric is just nonsense, because the atheists say they \"remain unconvinced,\" the Christian, of course, will continue to believe the atheist merely denies the existence of God, and from the Christian's point-of-view, the Christian remains unconvinced that God doesn't exist. It's actually a two way street, it's only a one way street when you're looking at it from a certain perspective, particularly an atheistic perspective.\n\nBecause atheism, by its very definition, concerns itself with this matter. We're not talking about Santa Claus, Russell's teapot, Big Foot or the Loch Ness monster. Religion holds a little more weight than that. It's influencing politics, it influences laws, people, etc. So, the point is then in the very last sentence you wrote in your last post here, that it's not an effective means to convince the religious that their beliefs are unfounded. After all, what evidence are we talking about? We've not even explored 1% of the universe, and we believe there's no evidence? It's ridiculous. That's why I prefer Neil deGrass Tyson's position on all of this. He refers to himself as an empirical agnostic which simply says, \"We do not know whether a God or Gods exist, but perhaps some day we can know.\" \n\nSo, the empirical agnostic doesn't posit belief in the divine nor necessarily posits disbelief in the divine, because there's no evidence to take up either position.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405841094", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

Then we talked a while and he came up with the idea to make a video series of math and science topics, and I suggested to make it pop-culture based to attract more viewers and we talked a while about how to do it and stuff. Then he said he needed to buy some supplies for video editing like green screen and stuff but he had no money and I asked how much he needed. It was about three fiddy, that's when I realized it was this giant crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "This actually happened to a friend of mine once.\n\nHe was at a conference where some of the most powerful nations in the world were meeting about climate change, and my friend, being an expert on the subject, decided to go. After the meeting there was a reception with a full 5 course meal. So my friend walks up to Obama and asks how he's doing. He says quite all right. They then start up a conversation on what he does, his lab, and how it can better society. Then out of the blue, a waiter comes up with what looks like a plate full of food, but is actually storing a pistol. My friend sees it before he has time to aim it at the president and tackles the guy before he can shoot him! Body guards everywhere are going ballistic. None of the waiters are allowed in. Then in the commotion, half the body guards pull out their guns and shoot the other half dead in the face. This is now a hostage situation. Between the pools of blood and women crying, my friend decides to walk up to a dead serviceman and swipe his gun. Unethical, I know but it's what had to be done. He slowly Takes out the body guards one by one until he gets to the second to last one. Then he hears a gun click behind him. It's the chairman for Italian affairs from the European Union. My friend quickly swipes the gun away and uses a steak knife to stab him before swiftly stepping behind him and putting him in a sleeper hold. The Italian then falls down slowly and his work is done. But there's one more body guard. He's got his gun pointed right at Obama who's being a meat shield for the queen of England. Just as the body guard says his witty remark, my friend shoots him impeccably in the head and he goes down. Obama thanks him profusely and asks if his lab needs any funding. \n\n\"About tree fiddy\" said my friend\n\n\"Tree fiddy?\" Says Obama \"get outta here ya goddamn Loch Ness monster!\"\n\nAnd that's  the story of how my friend saved Obama...\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405865084", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "We would be given our list of customers on the day so that we knew where we were going and when. I was on my way to pick up the person who was in the 9pm slot, but I had gotten a call from head office that they had cancelled. Now, normally in this situation, I would park up somewhere and have a cigarette, but as soon as I had parked up my phone rang again. I had a new appointment at 10pm on the other side of the city; I knew I didn't have time for my cigarette so I jumped in my limo, and started heading towards the new address I had been given.\n\n On my way over there, I saw what seemed like the last few moments of a mugging. The guy had gotten seriously injured, and I would have felt incredibly guilt if I had left him there. So I rolled down my window and offered him a lift to the hospital. He nodded his head in my direction, but was clearly in such a bad state that he couldn't make his way into the limo, so I went out to help him in. While I lifted him, I could see that he was bleeding profusely out of his right arm. As I leaned in for a closer look, I saw that it was a bullet wound, and he told me that they would probably be back for him. \n\nAfter I'd set him down in the back seat, I rang head office and told them that I wouldn't be able to make my next appointment, which they understood. As I was turning the keys in the ignition, I saw that the fuel gauge was below the empty indicator and I knew that there wasn't another gas station in miles. I tried anyway, but unfortunately the limo broke down in about 100 feet. As soon as it did, I could feel my window shatter onto my arm. The guys who were beating up my new passenger had decided to wreck the car as well, and presumably me. One of them was about 6ft 3 and looked to be 250lb's of muscle. The other two were quite scrawny, but looked just as angry as the huge guy. He pulled me out of the window, and pressed me up against the brick wall just off of the sidewalk. In my state of adrenaline, my voice started to tremor, but I managed to say 'What do you want?'\nHe leaned in close to my ear and said 'Imma need about tree fiddy'.\n\nI scrambled in my pockets and managed to find the change.

So I get there and this girl is EASILY 50 pounds heavier than she said, but I was there and in for the long run after about an hour drive. It probably helped that I was horny as FUUUUCK. But anyway I go inside and play with her dog for a little until we sit down and I force myself to make out with her because despite her being pretty heavy, she still had a pretty face, but then that went out the window when we started kissing and it was akin to trying to make out with a brick wall. But still, I pressed on. We start getting pretty handsy and then she asked if she could blow me, anything to get through with the brick wall assault. She undid my shorts and started to suck on the head of my dick, so I'm pretty well endowed and she couldn't get past the head which would've been alright but then she started using her hand on my shaft, which also would've been fine but little did I know she had the most calloused man hands I have ever seen or felt in my life, despite having worked in construction before. So at this point it's going pretty poorly and my penis felt as if she was attempting to start a fire with it, but I wasn't about to give up. But this shallow blow job/fire starting combo only went on for about 2 minutes before she gave up and asked why I haven't cum yet. Bish whet? So I just told her I have a lot of stamina which is true. She then informed me that she is a virgin, alright I thought, \"maybe I'll find some solace in a tight pussy\" WRONG AGAIN. She took off her size 53 beluga whale nike shorts and her \"panties\" if you could call them that at that size and bent over telling me to, \"put it in\" I gulped swallowed all of my pride and looked down only to see THE FATTEST MOST PIMPLE COVERED ASS EVER SEEN. It was seriously hard not to gag at this point there was no way in hell I could do this and not vomit, then, my phone rang in the pocket of my shorts, I thought, \"YES THERE IS A GOD.\" I told her to hold on and she groaned like a ship about to tip over, I grabbed my phone and saw it was a text from my friend that said, \"hey bro come over my friend just dropped off an ounce of the dankest shit I've ever smoked!\" So then I informed the capsized tanker ship that there has been a terrible accident and that my friend was in a wreck. She said, \"NO I NEED THIS!\" I told her that I absolutely could not stay and she eventually said I could go and that she wasn't mad, after I dressed my self and was at the door, she yelled, \"DickTheTater, before you go can you do one more thing for me? \" I replied, \"yeah what is it?\" She said, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

It makes sense. It's a logical leaning.

You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle.\nEDIT: Thanks for the Gold, Kind stranger!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405935850", "subreddit": "4ChanMeta", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I dated a girl for a few years. For the second half of our relationship, she did this, with pretty much the same excuses. I realized she just wasn't into me anymore. She certainly liked having me around to help her with physical chores and to provide emotional support, but she was uninterested in me as a person and sex was pretty much out of the question. The few times we did do it, it seemed as if she was just doing me as a matter of formality (as if she calculated how infrequently she could do it while still keeping me around). This was so apparent that I couldn't even enjoy the ever infrequent sex, which felt more like sex with a very costly, critical, and demanding prostitute than making love. After this pattern had been in swing for a good year, she began distancing herself more drastically, while asking for bigger sacrifices on my part. It became clear to me that each interaction we would have would be geared towards benefitting her in some way, without exception, regardless of the sacrifice I would have to make. She 100% refused to do anything in the evening. Any time we spent together was during the day, on what could be described as \"chore dates\". If I was doing something away from her, like going out with friends (would have gladly brought her along but she would refuse), that's when the passive threats would start flying. It seemed like whenever I wasn't helping her with literal heavy lifting, she was \"not sure if she can take this\". She wanted everything, but did not want to give anything in return. Once I realized this, it became clear to me that she had little to no concern for my happiness. 3 months of absolutely no sex and countless passive threats, and I eventually answered her \"i don't know if I can take this\" with \"I do know. You can't.\" and I broke it off. Poor girl. She changed as a person while I dated her. I saw the transformation right before my eyes, from an adorable, fun, smart young lady to a straight up hater, selfish and miserable.\n\nAfter not seeing or speaking for almost a year, one day I'm laying on the couch with my new sweetheart when there is a knock on the door. It's her. My dear Savannah, black tears running down her face. I always felt sorry for how I left her, because it was clear she wasn't in a good place when I did. Despite my better judgment, I let her in and give her the chance to say what she wants to say. She goes on about how things went wrong, but for some reason, despite sitting in my kitchen, in my happy home, after having effectively barged in, insists that *I* was wrong and that *I* didn't try hard enough and that *I* owe her more than she got and that *I should still be doing more for her*. Finally I reach the edge of my patience, exploding \"WHAT ELSE COULD YOU POSSIBLY WANT FROM ME?!?!\", to which she replied \"'bout tree fiddy\". Now it was about that time I noticed cute little Savannah was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"goddamnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!

In my drunken hungover mindset, I thought this was going to be a good idea. I stuffed candy bars, sodas, and even some gum packs into my pants and headed for the door. As I approached the door, I noticed a police officer purchasing his morning coffee at the register. I made intense eye contact with the cashier and in this moment I panicked and ran as fast as I could out the door. The officer made chase and tackled me about halfway through the parking lot. As he did so, candy and soda bottles all crunched in my pants. I pleaded with the officer to let me go as he put handcuffs on me, telling him I was only trying to get some food. He asked me how much I needed to get food.

{"body": "&gt;Protecting your allies from harm is just as useful as healing them.\n\n\nHouseRule we use: Rush Round; Rolling a 20 on the initiative roll gives you one round to act before everyone else (Kinda important)\n\nI had this happen in my last session. My DM sent 3 [Wood Golems](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem/golem-wood) against us for the first encounter, we are level 3 (This is important) though I would place our average effective level at 5, the golems are still a CR8 fight. Not to brag but my paladin is probably and Effective Level of at least 6 against Demons, (This is kinda important).\n\nThe fight starts with an NPC getting crushed, because of a crit right at the start by the Golem's Slam attack. Since it had a rush round it hit our brand new player to Pathfinder (But not DnD, so he kinda new some stuff) for some damage.\n\nThe initiative goes like this,names have been changed to protect the corrupt and innocent alike\n\nNG (New Giuy)  \nG1 (Golems 1,2,3)  \nAM (Arrow Magnet - This is very important)  \nG2  \nTMB (TheMightyBarbairan - Me)  \nG3  \nTBH (Tiny Ball of Hate)  \nIC (Identity Crisis)\n\nSo After NG backs up since he is playing a Modified Tengu with a fly speed, he goes up to get out of range. This starts with him rolling a Disguise check of 28 to cover himself in streamers to look like fire. Golem 1 then turns and wiffs his attack on a 1.\n\nAM takes his turn and flies over the other 2 golems in the back and drops one of his bombs to do an AoE fire damage to them. He is an alchemist, and yes he forgot he can make alchemists fire as a swift action, yes we were not happy to find that out after the fight.\n\nThis draws there attention since they were happy throwing tree around. This leads to G2 throwing a tree at my squishy flying alchemist. Who takes 5 damage and fumbles his fly check to not fall, which makes him prone.\n\nWhich comes to my turn. I, playing a High Mobility Paladin (sounds weird but it works), get to his side and use a Lay on Hands to heal up that 5 damage, and then I wait. My Ac is 24 (this is important because those golems can hit everyone else on a most a 7.) I get hit, by G3 since I'm in the way of AM and they don't have an understanding of Object permanence.\n\nThis now becomes a fucked up fight ,with ID, TBH and NG trying to fight 1 wood golem, they are a Bloodrager, a Fighter and a Bard who forgot to write down his spells (Which I found out later and got him some), while myself and AM are working on fighting the other 2 golems (Yay me). It goes around the table and Golem 1 is taking a little damage each round while putting some amounts of hurt on the others.\n\nI had recently taken the Saving Shield feat, which allows me as an Immediate action to give a +2 shield bonus to anyones ac as long as they were just attacked and are next to me. AM gets up and is trying to think of something to do, so he just chucks bombs in the mean time.\n\nG2 goes and makes his attack, so I declare my saving shield and buff AM's Ac to 1 point higher than the total from the G2's attack roll, (this is important) The Golems have a splintering attack, which my DM used on us, which I save, AM barely does. I point out that G3 needs to save since it would hit any creature, so this is how we turn our fight around.\n\nIt being my Turn I hit G3 with my Adamantine Sword, which cuts through his DR, but I built my guy to fight Demons since that is the setting. So I'm only getting about 7-16 damage a hit, while defending myself. (I have 43 HP at this point, my guy is a tank) On G3's turn he opens with his splintering and noone saves, which makes us take a ton of damage, but also killing G2 in the process because the bombs had been adding up.\n\nI am now standing at 2 HP and the ALchemist is at 0 SInce I had been eating his hits for him. The alchemist flies up to get out of range, and that gives me time to back up and heal, before we take out G3, and the other's are stilling working on G1 and finally beat it the same round we take out G3.\n\nSo in this story, by healing 5 damage and preventing damage, AM didn't die. and was able to help end a pretty dangerous fight. So making sure you judge where everyone is at, and figure out the biggest threat will allow you to decide what the best course of action is, be it healing, protecting, or attacking.\n\nFor those wondering how the game went after the Golems.\n\nLater in the Session, my DM pits me against a level 5 fighter in single combat, with none of my gear, and I survive with 2 hp again and get some swanky items. Then the rest of the group enters a tournament and the DM has them fight and nearly loses, until I point out they have been doing ID's damage wrong and they have been forgetting to add in the extra damage she gets for raging.\n\nWe are now level 4 and I still have not rolled anything lower than 9 for my HP. AM is still getting hit by every projectile fired, TBH is doing something I don't know, ID now can get bigger and she's happy, and NG left after the session ended, so I don't know what he is doing.\n\nTL/DR I made sweet love to Nessie and she gave birth to a Sharknado.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405978108", "subreddit": "Pathfinder_RPG", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Look at **why** paleo is based around only some whole foods and vegetables, rather than all of them, and perhaps you'll see what I mean.  I generally agree that sticking with unprocessed foods is oftentimes a good thing, as at a minimum it's harder to overeat when preparing your own meals from these foods.  \n\nTo look at this a bit closer, from the /r/paleo FAQ:\n&gt; Q: Why should we care about the Paleolithic Era today?\n&gt; A: To put it simply: the Paleolithic Era is what formed our species.\n&gt; Evolution is a slow process. Our species had a leisurely 2-3 million\n&gt; years to adapt to our environmental niche. The invention of\n&gt; agriculture, only 10-15,000 years ago, was a very sudden and\n&gt; dramatic shift in diet and environment for many human cultures.\n&gt; Foods like cereal grains (wheat, rice, barley), legumes (beans,\n&gt; peanuts) and dairy not only appeared, but became dietary staples,\n&gt; when earlier they would have been rare-to-nonexistent. The primary\n&gt; idea behind the paleo diet is that humans, as a species, have not yet\n&gt; evolved to be able to handle these foods well.\n\nRight away we're not talking about eating satiating foods, getting enough nutrients, calories... we're talking about our species has not evolved to be able to handle \"non-paleo\" foods like beans or rice.  Never mind all the healthy, non-obese people in the world (entire cultures of them even) that eat non-paleo foods on a regular basis.  Now let's continue the derp:\n\n&gt; A: The complex of problems known as the \"diseases of civilization.\" \n&gt; These chronic diseases are virtually unknown among aboriginal people \n&gt; before contact with the modern world, and then appear rapidly as \n&gt; they adopt \"Neolithic\" foods. These diseases include: **obesity, diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers**\n\nSo now we've \"learned\" that obesity and the diabetus don't come from eating too much food, but really it's the beans and rice to blame and your body lagging behind when it comes to evolution.  Frankly, this is just misinformation and perhaps one of my biggest problems with paleo.  When they spoon feed people things like \"non-paleo foods caused your obesity\" it's no wonder that I see threads all the time on other forums from people doing paleo but confused because they're not losing weight.  \n\nAt the end of the day, the basics of a paleo diet are fine but it's also an over-restrictive diet (making it harder to comply with and sustain for the long-term) for no good reason and frankly they aren't teaching the tools people need to see long-term success in weight loss.  Yes, eating a lower carb diet can often lead to some weight loss because you're eating more satiating foods and that alone can sometimes create a caloric deficit, but for most people that will only take them so far and things like calories, macronutrients, and the like become important.  If all you learn is certain foods are bad (and bad for stupid reasons like inaccurate representations of what people ate during the paleolithic era), how can you really hope to sustain your weight loss if and when you reintroduce those \"bad\" foods into your diet?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405987159", "subreddit": "loseit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I have yet to meet a doctor that advises patients that need to lose weight to imitate the diet of paleolithic man (or at least some bastardized version of what paleolithic man actually ate).  Paleo is not \"cut back on sugar and treats.\"  It's the notion that we have not evolved to the point where our bodies can handle eating foods like beans, rice, grains and so on without developing obesity, diabetes, and the like, and that in order to be healthy we need to loosely imitate the diet humans ate during the paleolithic era.  Never mind things like calories, it's evolution and \"bad foods\" that made you fat.  Quite to the contrary, most doctors I know recommend eating a caloric deficit to lose weight (and usually a very aggressive one because they know the risks of obesity).  \n\nAs for cutting out processed foods, in general I don't think that's a bad idea for people wanting to lose weight because you tend to eat more satiating foods that way and this makes it easier to achieve a caloric deficit.  Personally I'm a big fan of ketogenic diets for that same reasons (high satiation).  The difference is I would recommend that approach due to the satiating nature of the diet and how that helps you achieve a caloric deficit; paleo people would tell you to avoid \"bad\" foods that your body has not evolved to \"handle properly\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405987468", "subreddit": "loseit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh man, when my little sister and I were much younger, I'm pretty sure I scared her so badly once that I traumatized her. She must've been like 8 or so, and it was really late at night and middle school me was trying to get some sleep. My sister, however, wouldn't stop fucking around, making noise. The previous Halloween, I made a cape out of some kind of non-reflective material and found a really eerie mask which was surrounded by the same material. I put on my cape and mask, and headed down our pitch black hallway to her room. I opened her door slowly, the hinges squeaking with each inch, and let out the creepiest sound that I couldn't describe or reproduce if I tried. When I saw the pure fear in her face, I took off the costume because I didn't wanna scar her for life. I mean, I tried to make it up to her though. I asked her what I could to to make up for scaring her and she said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well, it was about that moment when I realized that my sister was actually a 500 foot tall monster from the paleolithic era and I was screwed.\n\ntl;dr don't scare your siblings too badly", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405994184", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Ted:** Seriously dude, you should probably take a break. Its become a problem.\n\n**James:** u wot m8?\n\n**Ted:** See? Right there. You've started making Reddit jokes in everyday conversations.\n\n**James:** A joke's a joke, Ted. If it's funny on Reddit, it's funny in real life.\n\n**Ted:** But it's not *just* jokes. The other day you called me a fedora wearing neckbeard.\n\n**James:** Hah. Rekt.\n\n**Ted:** You're killing me.\n\n**James:** In all fairness, you *were* wearing a fedora.\n\n**Ted:** No. No I wasn't. That's why it didn't make sense. Even aside from that, you've been refreshing your browser for the past hour. Why? Why are you doing that?\n\n**James:** I'm just making sure this comment I made gets upvoted. Some dude asked if we could describe the plot of a movie in five words or less. I replied, \"Remorseless shark devours innocents, yet becomes idolized.\"\n\n**Ted:** Jaws?\n\n**James:** Wolf of Wall Street. I was speaking figuratively. \n\n**Ted:** Wasn't that seven words?\n\n**James:** I'm pretty sure the whole five words or less thing was more of a recommendation. By the way, mind logging in and upvoting me?\n\n**Ted:** Yeah, I'm not doing that. Upvotes literally mean nothing.\n\n**James:** Ugh, I hate the word 'literally'. No one uses it right. Its lost its original meaning.\n\n**Ted:** I'm not being figurative. They *literally* mean nothing.\n\n**James:** They feel good. When someone upvotes one of my comments, they're validating my thoughts, and by extension, myself as a whole.\n\n**Ted:** That just sounds unhealthy, man.\n\n**James:** ...Maybe it is. I've always had issues with validation... Listen, Ted. Did I ever tell you what happened to my dad?\n\n**Ted:** Wasn't he some sort of scientist?\n\n**James:** He was a marine biologist until he got fired. I was five at the time. He *loved* his job, Ted. It was his passion, and when he got fired, he couldn't find another job in his field. So he just didn't work. There was a lot of tension around the house after that. I dunno if the tension was caused by his drinking, or if he started drinking because of the tension - but he drank a *lot*.\n\n**Ted:** Shit, dude.\n\n**James:** I remember one day, while he was drunk, he uh.. he hit me. In the face. Kind of hard.\n\n**Ted:** Holy shit, I'm so sorry..\n\n**James:** Yeah. I got scared and called the police. They took him away. I didn't see him for years after that. I think my mom hated me for it. \n\n**Ted:** That's really fucked up dude.. You did the right thing. You shouldn't feel guilty.\n\n**James:** Thanks. But there's more. One day, when I was in middle school, I was at the grocery store parking lot with my mom. I saw him there, Ted.\n\n**Ted:** Your dad?\n\n**James:** Yeah. My mom didn't see, but I did. He was on the side of the street, and he was in bad shape. I barely recognized him. He looked homeless. \n\n**Ted:** What did you do?\n\n**James:** I walked up to him and said \"Dad?\" -because I used to call him 'Dad'.\n\n**Ted:** Yeah I figured. So what happened?\n\n**James:** He turned around and his eyes grew wide. He recognized me. And you know what he did?\n\n**Ted:** What?\n\n**James:** He hugged me, Ted. It was the validation I had been searching for ever since he left... But then... then...\n\n**Ted:** It's ok man, listen, if you don't want to talk about-\n\n**James:** No. I need to get this off my chest... He took me by the shoulders, leaned in close, and whispered something into my ear.\n\n**Ted:** What did he say?\n\n**James:** He said.. \"Son... Im-\" Sorry I should explain. He used to call me 'Son'. \n\n**Ted:** Yeah, I got that. So what did he say?\n\n**James:** With his hands on my shoulders, and tears in his eyes, he said \"Son... I'm a...\"\n\n**Ted:** ...It's ok man, take your time...\n\n**James:** ...He said \"I'm a...\" \n\n**Ted:** ...\n\n**James:** \"*I'mma need about tree fiddy.*\"\n\n**Ted:** ..God fucking dammit. \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1406008508", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2193, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ah finally I get to tell this story! It was a cloudy night and I decided to take a road trip by myself to one of the fields right out of town. It was an abandoned field but yet had some nice maze crops. So I park my car, turn on the radio, and lay ontop of the hood of my car. It was so chill and relaxing, I had never felt so out of mind and calm. Every about 2 minutes my radio would give out static and get intrerrupted and then go back to normal. It happened like 4 or 5 times but I didn't think much of it and continued relaxing throughout the night. After about an hour the static goes crazy and doesn't adjust back. So I get back into my car and change the station but all the stations were giving the same static. I pull out my phone and there's no signal even though when I first arrived it had a full bar. Now I'm not a superstitious person so I just ignore everything and get back ontop of the hood. Now this is where it gets weird. I start hearing noises as if something is crawling towards me or something. I look around and there's nothing. Suddenly I see some flash lights turn on through the crops and I started shitting myself. I was convinced that I will be anal probed that night. I started staring real close into the light expecting to see an alien when all of the sudden the same thing that crawled a few minutes back crawled up behind me and tapped my shoulder. Before turning around, I gulped and prepared myself to see the alien. I turn around and this creature is looking me straight in the face. I jump back and scream \"what do you want?!\" and it said \"I need bout tree fiddy\".

{"body": " met Gregg Popovich in an airport once! I can share the story if people are interested?\n\nEdit: Decided to share the story! Here it is:\n\nI was flying from Pennsylvania to California but had a connecting flight and layover in San Antonio. I was waiting in the airport terminal when I thought I saw a man that looked very similar to Popovich, and looking around I noticed a few other people whispering and pointing in his direction. Deciding to take a closer look, I left my seat and walked over to sit next to him.\n\nI spent the next few minutes glancing out of the corner of my eyes at him and probably making him very uncomfortable, I turned and said, \"Hi Mr. Popovich, I've always wanted to meet you!\" (I know, cringe in hindsight but whatever). He let out a little chuckle and replied, still looking down at the newspaper he was reading, \"I hear I look like Gregg Popovich all the time\". Disappointed but not deterred, I asked, \"Oh, so you're not really Gregg Popovich?\". He paused for a few seconds before replying, \"Oh I am, that's why I get told I look like him\". Not even waiting for him to finish his sentence, I yelped, \"I knew it!\"\n\nAwkward silence ensued for a few seconds, before I told him, \"Mr. Popovich, I coach a high school basketball team. Can you give me a few tips to improve our chemistry? Obviously I'm not nearly at your level, but I have a ton of respect for you so any tip will help\". He nodded his head for a few seconds, and said, \"let me think\".\n\nClosing his newspaper, he turned to me and said something I will never forget. He looked into my eyes and said, \"You've got to make sure that everyone knows, win or lose, they're still the same person that they were before the game and I expect you to treat them as such. Too many coaches treat their players differently based on how they perform, but you've got to make sure you connected with the player as a person before you can improve them as a basketball player\".\n\nMy eyes got wide. I couldn't believe I was sitting here getting coaching advice from one of the greatest of all time! I stammered out, \"I'm going to need a few minutes to process that\". He let out a light little laugh, then said he understood. He started opening his newspaper again, but soon put it back down. He stood and started walking away before turning back to talk to me. \"I'm going to grab a coffee, do you want anything?\". I stood up to answer him, \"yeah, I'd like a coffee thanks. Really appreciate it! How much should I give you?\" Popovich said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Pop was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again. \"Damnit, Gregg, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as he walked away in a fundamentally sound manner.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406058726", "subreddit": "nba", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

So anyways new neighbors had just moved in next doors and they had the most beautiful blonde daughter that I have ever seen. So my parents decide to invite them over for dinner to  welcome them to the neighborhood. When they come over their daughter and I had the chance of being in private for a few minutes. Nothing happened at that point but I ended up asking her out. So we go out the following night and we end up having a great time. I learn a lot about her and she was quite talkative and we ended up having a lot in common. We talked so much that hours passed like minutes and we ended up staying out till dawn (we didn't go far from our separate homes so the adults didn't really mind). As the sun was rising I looked deep into her eyes and leaned in for the kiss. As our lips were about to touch I feel her checking my pockets. So I ask her \"what are you looking for?\" in a jokingly manner. She looks me straight in the eyes and says \"I need bout tree fiddy\".

The Nazis shit on Belgium, the Nazis rekt France, and Poland could not into defense. Germany even asked Italy and Japan if they were aware. Italy was like, \"does the Narwhal bacon at midnight?\", and Japan was like \"send photo.\" Romania was like \"and my axe!\" but Hungary said, \"nobody cares.\" In the end they all formed team OrangeRed and jimmies were rustled.\n\nFor few years there it looked like Germany was going to get Europe after all. But then Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, and destroyed all of America's downboats. (Wow, front page!) Then Hitler and the Nazis were like, \"fuck yeah, death to America!\" So brave. \n\nBut then America was like, \"Do you want Marines? Because that's how you get Marines.\"  And shit got too real for me.  Germany was so thirsty for karma that they tried to invade Russia in the wintertime, which was lame because Napoleon had made the same exact post just a hundred and forty years before. But the Russians were on top of it, and after throwing like 12 million dead babies at the Nazis until they ran away, Hitler finally was like \"fuck this shit, my planet needs me!\" (Did he died?)\n\nAnd then the Marines showed up and it was /thread. 'MURICA liberated France, 'MURICA liberated Belgium. The Russians got Poland, and now is no hope in Poland, only potato.

I had walked all the way down Yonge Street by this point and found myself next to Captain John's. Even here, no-one would talk to me. Eventually, it got dark, and most people left. I kept asking everyone I saw, though. I sat down on a bench with a sigh and asked the sticky evening air: \"How much should a hotel room cost round here?\" To my surprise, I heard a voice answer back \"Looking for a hotel? I can help!\", but I saw no-one. Turning around to face the lake, I saw there was a lady swimming there. It was she who had answered my desperate plea. I asked her how much a hotel room in downtown Toronto should cost, and it was about then that I noticed that she was about forty feet tall, with a great long green neck. She called back to me that a hotel room should cost about tree fiddy. On a more serious note, there's some good advice from other posters, OP. Toronto is generally a very safe city so anywhere in the downtown should be fine.

Now that day I was sitting on my choice eating a bowl of ice cream like any other day alone when I heard a knock on the door.  I walk over to the door to open it and nobody is there no packages are left no note whatever it was probably just my friend lance.  Now after the third time I get annoyed so I decide to look for my friend.  I start looking around my yard when I see what I thought was my friend move into a bush.  Naturally I go after him.  When I get to the bush there was a large green flash I dismissed it as a flashlight but my friend wasn't in the bush.  I turned around and saw on the road the numbers 666 written in blood I started freaking out suddenly my body felt larger my stomach heaved uncontrollably a ghastly image came in front of me and I asked it.

Not really much of a christian, but I prayed for Jesus that night. I was crying the whole time. thinking why do I take her here, why not a movie or a dinner.\n\nthen she started to wake up.

He talked about wanting to screw me in my B-hole, and while I'm not gay I was flattered. \n\nAnyways, it turns out that he lived about 10 minutes from me. We met up randomly because I thought he was the kind of guy that would buy me shit. I'm definitely not gay, I enjoy putting it up the butt of shemales all the time. We go on dates for about 7 months, and finally he proposes to me. LIke, WTF? I let you fuck me in the ass, but I'm not some asshole that wants to be tied down for forever.\n\nHe really tried to push the issue. Even after a trip to Paris, he wouldn't relent. He finally convinced me to take one more trip with him to Ireland to meet his family. They were awesome. His  mother was the kind of person I would have wished that was my own mother. He finally convinced me to say yes, and it was the happiest day of my life. We may have had our fucking crazy sexual kinks (Not gay, seriously) but it was fun and i fell in love with the man. \n\nWe finally decided to go get married in Wisconsin, because they had legalized gay marriage.  We knew that it might not last long, so we hurried to the courthouse. When we were filling out the paperwork, the clerk started asking questions about it. Pretty standard stuff. I started getting annoyed when they kept pestering my partner about his immigration status. Finally we submitted it all.\n\nWe had the best ceremony anyone could ask for. The Justice of the Peace said a speach more beautiful than any priest could have mustered. Right when we were about to say our vows, the clerk burst into the room and asked if I knew what I was getting into. I said yes, and I was willing to deal with the stigmatization of gay marriage. \n\nThe clerk looked at me a bit strangely, then asked me if I knew that I was getting married to a Scottish immigrant. I told her I knew exactly what I was getting into. With a smile, she said she was glad and that we just had a final court fee to pay before we could complete the ceremony. My partner looked at me, and asked me \"Could I have about tree fiddy?\" It was at that moment that I saw that the man I was about to marry was a monster from the paleolithic era. I promptly broke off the engagement.\n\n\nThat was the time I almost got married from a random creeper messaging me.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406190726", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "This didn't happen in my office, but at the ER.  I wasn't present, but heard about it from colleagues.  I generally take my lunch with other medical professionals (hospital administrators, doctors in other fields, etc.)  I never hang out with anyone in my practice because a) it seems unprofessional and b) it's really boring to listen to the same stories that I was already there to experience.  In order to avoid my employees, I tend to eat lunch on the opposite side of town.  As it turns out, some of the best food around is on that end of town.  There's this one great little Jamaican place down that way and they have the best jerk chicken you've ever had, so I go there frequently.  One day, I went there to get my usual nosh and sat down at my usual table.  This older nurse (we'll call her Gertie) was sharing some stories from the hospital with some of the younger nurses.  Gertie had been around for as long as anyone could remember and she had the best stories.  On top of that, she had a really great attitude and didn't get grossed out by much because she had been an army medic and worked in the ER for 20-something years.  When I sat down Gertie was relating the nastiest experience of her career.  I'd seen some gross stuff in my time, but nothing I'd ever dealt with held a candle to this. \n\nThe triage had admitted a stripper/escort that did private parties.  She was blonde, 5'4\", and 140 very athletic pounds.  The private parties she did apparently got VERY wild.  Her intake form listed coke, weed, alcohol, meth, and a very extensive list of perscription pills.  Her reason for visiting the ER was that she was having trouble peeing and noticed an unusual odor coming from her vagina.  Although some medications can compromise one's immune system, it seemed unlikely that any of the drugs she'd taken would cause that amount of damage to her bladder, but there was a very serious concern for kidney failure.  The ER doctor (we'll call him Dr. Bliss) had the patient disrobe and put her feet in stirrups.  When she did Dr. Bliss and Gertie were assailed by the foulest stench ever and both ran from the room, vomiting all the way to the bathroom.  When they regained their composure, they returned to the examination room to find the patient screaming hysterically and bawling her eyes out.  They put on masks (didn't help) and proceeded with a standard pelvic examination.  This is what they discovered:  periodically, the patient would pick up dollar bills with her labia and spit change out of her vagina.  Apparently she'd forgotten to remove some change after her last gig *three weeks prior*.  They treated her for toxic shock syndrome and put her on a course of general antibiotics.  They also advised her to find a new party trick.\n\nAfter Gertie got done telling her story, all the young nurses stopped eating and mostly just sat in horrified silence.  I'd seen some wild stuff, but nothing like that.  At least not the way Gertie related the story.  After pushing my meal to the side and sitting in contemplative silence for a few moments, one of the oncology docs at the other table piped up, \"Well?  How much money did you get out of her snootch?\"  Gertie shot him a look that could fell a lesser man and said sternly, \"About tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406191946", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 34, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "My first kiss happened when I was in Kindergarten. I was a young nubile 6 year old from Minnesota, and i was living on the East Coast because my dad took a job in Jersey. I didn't know too much what to do on my first day of school, I didn't know whether I should beat the shit out of the popular kid, or piss my pants so nobody would fuck with me. \n\nBoth of my plans had worked, nobody fucked with/talked to me for the first 6 months in the system. Then came spring of '92. It was a rough time. They took away our markers that smelled like things, and people in my class started talking to me. I was invited to a birthday party. \n\nThis was probably the worst thing that could have happened to my young personality. I could barely bring myself to go piss in a public bathroom, let alone go to birthday party. I was finally forced by my mom to go, so I tried to make the best of the situation. My mom bought a Lego City playset for me to give her.\n\nThe day of the party came, and my awkward self gave that Lego set to the prettiest girl in school. She fucking loved it! She was so happy that I gave her something that her parents would have never given her! I totally played it off cool that I bought it working my part time job at the coal mines, and she believed me. \n\nThe rest of the party was a blast! I got introduced to every mover and shaker in my 6 year old peers group, and I was on my way to social success. The next few hours were pure bliss for me. \n\nFinally, the time for the birthday cake started. Everyone was so excited! We sang a song, we made birthday wishes, and then it finally came time for the birthday girl to blow out the candles and make her wish. She blew them out, and we all teased her about what her wish was. She said she couldn't tell us otherwise it wouldn't come true. \n\nShe didn't say her wish, but as the parents were picking us all up from the party I got to have a bit of time alone with the birthday girl in the tree fort in her back yard. It was just us, and we were laughing and having fun. I finally asked her, \"What was it you wished for when you blew out your candles?\" \n\nShe responded to me that it would never come true if she told me what her birthday wish was. I prodded her for a while, and finally she said that she would tell me her biggest dream when she blew out her candles. But first, she gave me the first kiss on the lips I had ever had. It was amazing. Finally, as we heard my parents honk the horn signaling it was time for me to leave, she said \"I want about tree fiddy\". At this point, I realized that the birthday girl was a 30 foot tall monster from the Paleolitihc Era, and I told that bitch \"I ain't gonna give you no goddamn tree fiddy Loch Ness Monsta!\". She looked disappointed after I told her that, but she understood. \n\nTL;DR: My first kiss was underwhelming", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406192433", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "After reading the (many) posts on this sub regarding cheesy pick up lines, I dedicated one night just trying to pick up girls in a club using these lines.\n\nSome blew me off. Some gave me a polite laugh, then quickly excused themselves to be with their friends. Others hung out a bit until we got bored with each other and moved on.\n\nAt around 3am, I sat alone at the bar. I wasn't planning to get lucky that night, but just to see how much I can get away with. I considered myself lucky for not being slapped as I enjoyed a horrid gin tonic. On one hand, I didn't get to buy any drinks for anyone, but on the other hand, *I didn't have to buy any drinks for anyone.*\n\nSome girl came up to the bar beside me. Nothing special about her, just your regular female. I caught her eye and said hi. \n\nSurprisingly, we made decent conversation and I ended up with another gin tonic while buying her a drink. I was telling her about all the failures I had the entire night, and she kept asking me to tell her more. At 3 am and juiced, I am not a walking library of /r/askreddit, so I went to one of my personal favourites.\n\n\"Hey girl, do you work in a bakery? Because those are some hot buns you have.\"\n\n'Hey! That's Dragon Age!\" I remember her saying.\n\nAnd the rest of the night...

{"body": "Okay, so I was just a kid, and my parents said they had to leave for work for the whole weekend ! They told me they had prepared me food I could just put in the microwave, they put their number on a paper in case of emergancy, and told me to have fun.\n\nIf you've ever been in this situation, you know how awesome that is. You can do anything you want around the house, watch the TV shows your parents don't want you to watch, invite friends, play video games with speakers, all that !\n\nAnyway, I'm getting off track. I had an idea ! We had this big thing made of plastic, and had the genius idea to lay it around the house and make myself a slide ! In retrospect, that was a dumb idea.\n\nSo I lay it out, take a few buckets of water from the hose outside, take a lot of soap and start ! It was hilarious, and worked perfectly ! I was having the time of my life ! And in the end, the final straight line, the corridor that leads to the living room. I was going super fast !\n\nI was going waay too fast. I had picked up so much speed that I could not do the next turn ! I was going straight towards the TV stand, and the TV on it ! The impact was inevitable. In a split second that felt like 15 minutes, I saw the TV fall down. I had hit my head pretty hard, and slid away from the impact point, but didn't have time to save the TV. The screen was shattered.\n\nFuck. I had to do something. First, clean up the slide. After that my mind was clear enough to think of something. I didn't want them to know, I'd get punished ! I definitely didn't have the money to pay for repairs. Maybe it was still under warranty ! I decided to go to the store and try to talk the salesman into giving us a new one. I entered, wet and panicked, and asked to talk to the guy who sold us the TV.\n\n\"What do you need, son ?\" he asked.\n\n\"'about tree fiddy\" I answered\n\nThat's when I realised I was a 50 feet tall monster from the paleolithic era ! \n\n\"Damn Loch Ness monstah tricked me again\", said the salesman.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406201081", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

So I look through the ads pretty much every day and at long last I find a place that looks ideal. \n\nI rock up and this place is really huge, I mean it's a total palace. I ring the bell and at this girl opens the door and she looks normal enough but I get a really weird vibe off her, You know, sometimes you just feel how someone is a bit strange, but as I said, the building looks really big and as I go in the flat is huge too - high ceilings, loads of storage space and it's really well equipped too - there's a nice fridge freezer with an ice maker, the kitchen is modern and lovely with all sorts of cool gadgets, like a pasta maker and other stuff and I'm starting to think I might have just prejudged her as the flat is amazing. \n\nI check out the living room and it's also great, leather couches and a big TV - Wii hooked up and that's cool as I have a playstation so it looks like a gaming friendly house. The bedroom is okay, not huge but a double bed and enough storage for everything I need to put in there.\n\nSo I am thinking that I need to get to the bottom of this feeling of disquiet and I'm wondering if I recognise her or if there is something about her which isn't sitting well so we sit in the living room and have a chat and we are into the same music and the same TV and part of me is thinking this is going to be amazing and the other part just can't work it out. \n\nSo at last I think to myself, what the hell, I might as well go for it, I can't work out why I feel so oddly about her and I am sure I can deal with whatever it is so I ask her at last how much she wants for the rent and she comes back and says 'I'm gonna need about a treefiddy'. Well it was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era and I yelled out. Dammit Loch Ness monster, I ain't giving you no treefiddy and I ran out of that damn house.

{"body": "5 years ago, I was at the rock bottom of my 30s. My family is far away from where I lived and I had no friends at that time. I was new to this country of freedom thinking I could definitely survive if I can make it here, I can make it anywhere. Fortunately, I met a fellow countrymate (Ken) who is kind enough to shelter me in his apartment. As I got to know him better, I discovered that he deals drug to strippers around the city and that's how he earn his bucks. I told him I wanted a part of it and he told me I have to first earn his trust. \n\nOne day Ken rang me up and told me to collect a parcel from this warehouse nearby our place. He told me that it is an important parcel to him and I should *not* open it no matter what. He gave me the street address and I went to the place. As I open the warehouse door, two black dudes came to me and asked if I'm the one here to collect the stuffs. I nod and they asked me, where's the money son? I was *stunned* at this moment as Ken did not mention anything about bringing cash there. So I told them I didn't bring any as my *guy* didn't mention anything about it. \n\nThe expression on their face immediately grew darker and one of them grab me by my shoulder and push me against the wall. Another one whisper to me, \"Son, you are not leavin' here till we get our money? **You understand that ?**\" \n\nAs scared as I was, I asked him \"How much is it ?\".\nHe leaned closer to me and whisper right at my ear, \"tree fiddy\" Well what do you expect ? I pushed him away and say \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy.\" And I just walked away. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406222775", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I was never really religious. I had a little exposure to religion when I was younger, but I wasn't raised in a very religious household.\n\nThe reason I don't subscribe to religion in my adulthood is because I think the answers religion provides are a cop out. \n\nTake the question \"where did we come from?\" Religion answers \"god created us\". I feel that answer is pretty lackluster from the scientific answer. The simple fact that conditions have to be just right for the planet for form. Then abiogenesis. Then the process of evolution. And then for you to exist, everything that came before you, all those generations, for 4 billion years, had to survive long enough to provide an off-spring. On top of that, we are the only planet with known life. We logically speculate we are far from alone in the universe, but it appears to be a rare enough occurrence and we haven't discovered anything else yet. That right there is pretty damn amazing and humbling. \n\nGiving god credit for man insults all those that survived before us - with incredible odds against them. It removes the amazement and absolute awe from the situation. (In fact, the \"god did it\" answer pisses me off a little because of this.)   \n\nAlso, if you are happy with the answer \"god did it\" you stop asking questions. I could never be happy with those kinds of answers. I want  the things I know to be true are as close to the truth as they can be. If I believe something is true, and someone points out an error in the answer I have, then I have a desire to correct that error. I do not want to take things on faith because I feel faith is being intellectually dishonest with myself. Faith is giving yourself permission to believe in something for no good reason. Faith is a weakness.\n\nNot only does religion provide weak answers but their answers produce a large number of questions. Different sects provide different answers (if they even have an answer that is based in reality). Christianity sects can barely agree on what a passage in the bible means or which of the 100's of translations of the bible to use.  If religion was inspired by divine intervention, I think it would be a little more clear about itself.\n\nDisagreement is fine if you are selling a tangible product, but they aren't. The very core of their product amounts to light speculation or wishful thinking. We can argue all day long on the colour of the Loch Ness Monster, but until we have proof it actually exists, those arguments are a pointless. And, like Nessie, the closer you look at the myth, the more it starts to fall apart. \n\nI'm also fine with the concept of knowing when things die, the thing that makes them them, ends. Their \"soul\" doesn't go to a magic castle and live forever. \n\nAm I happy with the thought that I only get, at most, about 100 years of life? Not really. But I accept it because I really don't have a choice. \n\nPlus, when I take a look at the product and services they're selling, it freaks me the fuck out. Do I want to live forever in a bouncy castle in the clouds with my dead grandmother offering praises to the almighty 24/7? Hell, fucking, no. That sounds horrible. Oblivion sounds much more relaxing.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406227599", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; whom I hope will live long and happy lives for all of those who had not\n\nI understand your feelings here. My parents neglected (knowingly) my pets when I lived at home, and still do it to their current pets. When I was 18, I had a beautiful black cat. Her nam was Nessie. She had soft sleek black fur and emerald eyes. She was the baby of my old lady kitty, Cj, so that made her special. She was a goofball and didn't act like a cat all the time, but I loved her. \n\nWhen I was 19, my Nmom came to pick me up from work and told me that 'something was wrong' with my Nessie. When I got home, she was...I can't describe it. She was listless, and crying in pain, and *bleeding from her vagina*. No, I don't mean she was peeing blood. Picture a really heavy period, and that's what it looked like. It was awful! I held her and held her, hand feeding her and getting her to drink from an eye dropper. She died two days later, alone and scared and cold, in a box my Nmom made me put her in so that I could 'pay attention' to the guests that came over. The entire time she was dying, I would hold her and cry, looking at my Nmom with what must have been a pleading look. The day I buried her was one of the worst days of my life. I never have forgiven her for that. \n\nCurrently, I have a three month old kitten sitting next to me. He looks very much like my Nessie, and acts like her too. As much as I still miss my little kitty, I'm incredibly happy that I rescued him from my parents, and that he's going to have a much better life (and death) than she did.

They live 40 min outside Yosemite, so pretty hilly country, especially for me, a life-long east coaster.  The MIL isn't much into off-road rides, but she wanted to ride with me and the wife.  So, we plotted out a road path that looked like it would be pretty and scenic.  It was, but it also ended up being more than we could handle.  After one particularly grueling hill, my MIL reluctantly threw in the towel.  My wife stayed with her, and I rode on to get the truck and pick them up.\n\n\n\nAfter another hour or so of hills, I was also done.  My left leg was kaput and I was having a lot of difficulty on the hills.  I was literally praying for a miracle, when another rider, who I had passed earlier, came up behind me and asked if I needed help.\n\n\n\"Yes, definitely\" I said, thinking he would ride off and come back with a car.

{"body": "Will do!\n\nOnce upon a time I was working as a lab assistant out of my university during my undergrad. The lab was mostly empty and I was running database work (which at that point was essentially just an excel spreadsheet). So I turned on Netflix after a bit, because I made $10 an hour and HAD to work 8 hours that day, even though there was nothing to be done.\n\nWell, the weather had been pretty good until that moment. Suddenly, out of nowhere, dark clouds covered the sky. Rain just started pouring horribly. I figured it was nothing, but the rain didn't stop. Ten minutes. Twenty. Thirty. It kept raining. I looked outside and saw the base of the hill I was on was completely flooded. People were getting out of their cars and having to wade through to the top of the hill. Thunder was pulsating in the sky. Lightning crackled through and began violently hitting the earth. The tornado alarm started blaring in the distance.\n\nThat's when I started to think, *I'm really going to die*. My car was nowhere near my work. There was no basement in my building. As the wind rattled the windows, I was scared out of my mind. I hid in the bathroom which was the only room with the lowest amount of windows (1) and clutched my phone tightly as the world essentially went to shit. Alarms from my campus alerts blared on my phone. Text messages and voicemails all telling me to get to a safe place. I started crying and out of my wit's end, I called my supervisor to let them know where I was and that I was scared.\n\nHe said he'd call someone to come get me and take me across the street to the basement in the other building. I waited. And waited. And *waited*. Finally, I heard a knock on the door. A man dressed in a poncho was outside. He yelled at me to follow him so I did. I clung to him as we hurried across the street. I felt the wind pushing into me hard and the rain soak through me instantly. I was freezing when I got inside. \n\nWe race down to the basement when the power cut off.\n\nHim: \"I'm going to turn on the generator. Stay here.\"\n\nI shivered a nod in response and stayed put. That's when I saw a little girl down there, hiding. This was weird because kids aren't usually on a college campus. I thought she must be the employee's kid or something, so I walked over to her.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" I asked. She sniffled and shook her head. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"I need help,\" she muttered in the most pathetic voice ever.\n\n\"What do you need?\" I inquired. She motioned me closer so I leaned in, thinking she probably needed to go to the bathroom but was too embarrassed to say something.\n\n\"I uhh...\" she hesitated. \"I'mma need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nThat's when I realized the girl was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "There was a somewhat urban legend in my school about a guy who got detention. The original reason for his detention was long forgotten, however the actions he too while he was receiving his punishment went down in the annals of history in my school. \n\nThis guy got detention, and was mad about his punishment. He felt like he didn't deserve it. He was reprimanded for making a slight alteration to a presentation slide. This was in the time where projectors had never heard of powerpoint, and it was a light bulb reflecting a reverse image off of a mirror, which allowed you to see it on a wall. The 90s were a dark time. \n\nAnyways, the individual in question had added some baby powder into the light bulb of a projector. About a half hour into the lecture, a smell of smoke started to permeate the room. The teacher didn't notice, but kept on lecturing. 5 minutes later, the projector burst into flames. Everyone was freaking out with the exception of this one stoic student. After the use of a fire extinguisher, the instructor turned beet red and noticed this one person who wasn't freaking out. He immediately wrote them up for detention. \n\nWhile they were serving their sentence, the teacher in charge of detention asked him why they had done it. He simply replied with \"it's not possible that I could have done it\". \n\nHe was further persecuted for the crimes he said he wouldn't have been able to commit. He was eventually expelled from school. Weeks later, at a hearing of the school board, this person and his mother appeared to appeal these allegations. After a sad tale of a father walking out on them, a horrible home life, and a multitude of other reasons why her child may have been acting out, The school board agreed to reinstate her kid. When asked what it would take for her son to no longer act up, she took a minute to compose herself. She finally replied... \"Well, it'll take about tree fiddy\". It was then that the school board realized that the student was a 30 foot tall monster from the paleolithic era, and they couldn't take her at her word. \n\nThey never allowed the student back into the classroom, further proliferating the system of poor people staying poor.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406348221", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I was once dating a girl who I thought would be my wife. I was 23, and she was 19, but we had been friends since childhood.  \n\nHow we initially got together was when I deployed when I was 20. I was literally living halfway across the world, but this girl was the only person I could actually talk to about things. After spending almost a year across the world spending almost every minute of time I could talking to her, I realized that this girl is someone who understands me. I could talk to her about anything. I finally got my orders back home, and when I arrived she was 18. \n\nMy first week back was spent hanging out with this girl, I'd paid for her trip up to see me. We fucking clicked. She was the most amazing woman I'd ever met in my lifel. My 2nd week back was a combination of fucking and never leaving my dorm room. It was literally a week of sex. One of the best weeks of my life. It was amazing. I thought I had found my soulmate. \n\nWe dated for almost 2 years. During that time, she went to college in a town about an hour and a half from where I was stationed, and I spent every weekend with her in debauchery, and every night was spent talking to her on the phone. We were inseperable. \n\nI finally decided that I wanted to marry this woman, and spend the rest of my life with her. I turned down orders to basically my dream base in Alaska so that I could leave and be with her. I got out of the military, and moved to an apartment in a city where I had no friends so I could be with her.\n\nWe were happy for about 6 months. I was there, she was there, and we hung out all the time. I had a hard transition to civilian life. I wasn't the happiest person ever, and I knew that it took its toll on my girlfriend. She eventually stepped out on me, and fucked a dude she met that night \"because she was drunk\". It tore me apart. We had a shell of a relationship for about 3 months after that, but we eventually broke up. \n\nI moved back to my hometown, and tried to start my life again. It was rough, but I was able to do it. 2 years later, I get a call from the previous love of my life. She wants to meet me. She says that we had a kid together. I'm all kinds of excited/scared about this. So I meet her. She says that the kid she has is mine. I'm so excited, because I've always wanted to have kids. I'm taken aback, because she asks me for child support. \"Could I have about tree fiddy?\" It turns out, her kid is a 30 foot tall monster from the Paleolithic era. I had never realized this before about her mother asked me this question.\n\nTL'DR, I'm paying child support for a child I'm pretty sure isn't mine.

Well the other night were sitting and this \"urban camper\" came out of nowhere riding his bike like right in front of the rig, he had all this trash and shit tied to his bike and one of those little trailers too. Anyways one of his bags of trash smacked the front and startled the snot out of us. My partner grabbed the spotlight and shined it on the guy. He looked back with a deer in the headlights look. He looked terrified! But he slowly started his bike back towards us and came to tap on the window. He started telling us a heart wrenching story about how he became homeless. He told us of how he used to be a high level executive at a law firm, and how he lost everything due to his fall into drugs and alcohol. It was a heart wrenching story to say the least. We asked him if there was anything that maybe we could do for the poor gentleman who was obviously in quite a bit if distress. He turned his head and looked at all his trash and random shit tied to his bike.

{"body": "I would have to say the best possible feeling is to walk barefoot on freshly cut grass. I actually have a story to go along with this.\n\nWhen I was little, maybe around 5 or 6, I had a best friend who's name was Peter. We were inseperable, we would play at each other's houses, and we would go through the awkward ritual of calling a home phone number and having to talk to a parent to ask \"is Peter available?\". \n\nAnyways, we were inseparable friends. We would hang out and play all the time, and we would play \"animals\". I was always a tiger, and he was a gorilla. We would play on a crappy old swing set and have loads of fun.\n\nOne day, we went and played in my back yard. We used to always play at P's, because they had fancy metal swings and a basketball hoop. Anyways, we were playing in a sandbox in my backyard, and after making a bunch of different stuff, we dug up a tiny bone. Was it a chicken bone? Was it a dinosaur bone? It was totally a dinosaur bone. We started to build a museum in a ratty ass tree fort. We made an exhibit out of cardboard, and set out to find more bones for our museum. \n\nWe started exploring the woods behind my house. Then, we found it: A rotting raccoon carcass, crawling with maggots. Another animal had already killed it, all we had to do was wait for it to decompose. We were so excited! We made a pinky swear that we would come back in a long time (2 days is a long time when you're young) to go get the bones for our museum.\n\nWell, I was an impatient little kid. The following day, I walked out into the woods to check on our investment. When I got there, I saw P eating the recently deceased raccoon carcass. I was shocked, and asked him why he was doing it. He said to me \"Well, I'll tell you, but first you're gonna have to give me about tree fiddy\".  It was only then when I realized that my boyhood friend wasn't a little boy, he was a 30 foot tall monster from the Paleolithic Era. I immediately confronted him with my newly learned information, and he promised that we would finally build our dream tree-house museum. \n\nTL;DR, My boyhood friend betrayed me in our tree house dinosaur museum.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406355684", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I couldn't play sports because of a physical defect growing up, and I didn't have great coordination. I kept learning, and I kept growing, so I started doing things like debate where I could put my big mouth to use.\n\nCome high school, I had grown enough that I wasn't bullied anymore. People started to value my opinions, and I started commanding respect when I started talking. Finally, it came to the state debate championships: I knocked it out of the fucking park! I mean, due to my booming voice and commanding presence, no one could even compete with me! Finally, the awards ceremony came.\n\nI was walking up to the podium as tall as I could because I was just so proud of my accomplishments. I got there, and I cleared my throat to begin my victory speech. About a minute in, I was interrupted by one of the judges. \"Sir, can you please speak clearly? We can't really understand you when you're not speaking English. Please ask us one structured question in English, and we can grant you your trophy\".  I mustered the courage, and finally I managed to speak the few words out loud: \"Can... Can I have about tree fiddy?\" After I had spoken my brave words, the judges finally realized that I was a 30 foot tall monster from the Paleolithic Era, and that the reason I had been winning because my opponents were scared I would bite their heads off.

You know what that means, we were totally gonna do it. And by it, swing back and forth. We might even get to doing the underdog. With a girl. \n\nAnyways, the recess bell hit, and I go meet this girl on the playground. We're about to swing the shit out of the playground, and we're going all the way to underdog town. So, I majestically mounted the swing, and gave her a smouldering look inviting her to do the same. She made her way over, and sat down next to me. Very quickly, the swing set buckled under her size, and crashed down around us. I asked her \"What the H-E-Double Hockey Sticks just happened? What do you want from me after this disaster!?\" She said \"well, I want about tree fiddy.\" It was at that moment that I realized the girl I had been smitten with was actually a 30 foot tall monster from the Paleolithic era, and we would never \"get married\" on the swing set.\n\nTL;DR: Young love is rough.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406364258", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman.

{"body": "I used to live in a crowded area in downtown Seattle, and everyday on my way to work I would pass this homeless guy who was clearly really down on his luck. The guy was about 5'9 but had a bad back and knees so when he walked he looked extremely pained so he probably didn't get around much. He smelled awful and probably hadn't been in a shower for a long time. I felt extremely guilty that I was unable to help this man, because money was pretty tight. I decided one day I was gonna have a conversation and figure out what this guy's story was and maybe see if I could help him out in some way. So I introduced myself and asked him what had happened that had put him where he was. He said he was a veteran and after Vietnam he came home to broken family, wife left him and his kids wanted nothing to do with him. He couldn't get a job for lack of experience and after awhile he quit trying. We had a good fifteen minute conversation and I offered to take him into a nearby diner and get something to eat. He declined and said it was because he didn't wanna be a burden, but I insisted. After wolfing down a few burgers I walked him back to his spot on the corner and told him if he ever needed anything I'd be willing to help him. I will never forget the way this old guy teared up and thanked me, his voice cracking and tears choking him up as he said he wished there were more people like me in this cruel world. I again asked him if there was anything else I could do, and he replied that there was just one more thing. It as at this time I realized he was a 30 foot tall leviathin from the Paleolithic era and he said to me: \"can I borrow about tree-fiddy?\" \n\nAnd I gave him that fucking money", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406397874", "subreddit": "promos", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have SO much information like this. Being on the inside gave me access to so many little hacks that i used to save friends thousands of dollars when dealing with the bank/Realtors /lawyers. If i ever find myself in a situation like that I'm going to be a powerhouse of info and not get steamrolled like so many unsuspecting people who signed prom notes for fifty or a hundred grand that they didn't need to. Had they just said \"no\" the negotiator wouldve checked their little box that requires them to ask and moved on. I felt bad for a lot of people, and sometimes hinted to them that they didn't have to pay it, because i was a manager and my phone calls weren't recorded, so i could gently nudge them in the right direction. Id say \"I'm required to ask you if you'd be willing to sign a promissory note for the deficiency balance.\" They would say \"well I can't afford to do that, what happens if i cant? Is the deal dead?\" \"nope.\" \"So why would I sign it?\" \"Well, technically the investor COULD come after you for the balance in the future\". Smart ones would say \"so i could sign it and DEFINATELY pay it, or take my chances that they MIGHT come after me.. What are the odds that they do so?\" and id tell them that I can't give them that info, but since we're 90 days behind catching up on these short sales, the odds that they go through the pile AGAIN looking for purple to sue that clearly couldn't afford their mortgage in the first place, is pretty low, and really reserved for those who committed an obvious fraud or just walked away from investment properties but still had funds that were untouchable for some reason, maybe their retirement or some other shielded account. Between you and I, i wouldn't sign it.\" and they didn't. But there were those who were so afraid of the bank that they complied with everything that the negotiator told them. It's a dirty business, and I'm not being dramatic when I say that id write a book if i weren't afraid for my life or livelihood. They stand to lose millions and millions of dollars and could look like the heartless bloodsuckers that they are. But if i leaked much of the info that i have and they found out who i was, I'd definitely be black listed from working in any type of financial institution, which for now I'm not willing to risk. Getting a job as a loan processor for a few years it worth it just for the inside info you'd get and opens your eyes the same way working for a restaurant does for eating food prepared by people you don't know. You begin to realize that the bank is dropping your steak on the floor and serving it to you with a smile on your face and charging you fifty bucks when the steak came from wall mart and cost them tree fiddy. If you're going through a foreclosure or short sale or just want to walk away from a bad investment, PM me and id gladly walk you through it, review any documents they send you and tell you how to hide any money you don't want to hand over and exxagerate your hardship letter and tell them what they want to hear without saying too much. There are a lot of little things you can say without realizing it that can kill the whole deal. If youre talking and the banker starts coughing and changes the subject quickly you might be saying something that they don't want to know and would kill your deal. It should be your primary residence, for example. You might say something like \"well we go to Florida during the winter and rent out\" \"COUGHCOUGHCOUGH WOOOAH sorry sir.. Anyways so this is your primary residence and you don't take any income on this property, got it, cuz if you DID id have to decline it and you'd forclose. Anyways I'll email you some of the specifics that I need (since the emails aren't monitored by their manager) \"so you gotta watch what you say and when in doubt, less is more. Don't disclose everything you can think of and let the banker lead. There isn't a class you can take and as far as i know isn't much help out there to help you deal with the banks.

I realized that would never happen, but a turn of events in high school at least allowed for an interesting story. \n\nWhen I was around 14 years old, my biggest dream was to be an archeologist. I read books, I paid serious attention in science class, and I soaked up anything my puny brain could handle.\n\nI had always felt something of an outcast growing up. I couldn't play sports because of a physical defect growing up, and I didn't have great coordination. I kept learning, and I kept growing, so I started doing things like debate where I could put my big mouth to use.\n\nCome high school, I had grown enough that I wasn't bullied anymore. People started to value my opinions, and I started commanding respect when I started talking. Finally, it came to the state debate championships: I knocked it out of the fucking park! I mean, due to my booming voice and commanding presence, no one could even compete with me! Finally, the awards ceremony came.\n\nI was walking up to the podium as tall as I could because I was just so proud of my accomplishments. I got there, and I cleared my throat to begin my victory speech. About a minute in, I was interrupted by one of the judges. \"Sir, can you please speak clearly? We can't really understand you when you're not speaking English. Please ask us one structured question in English, and we can grant you your trophy\". I mustered the courage, and finally I managed to speak the few words out loud: \"Can... Can I have about tree fiddy?\" After I had spoken my brave words, the judges finally realized that I was a 30 foot tall monster from the Paleolithic Era, and that the reason I had been winning because my opponents were scared I would bite their heads off. I ended up being disqualified from the contest, and even though I was incredibly disappointed I had grown a lot from the experience.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406449506", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I put the question to the world. How could I not? I was just one man, not some mystery expert. And so, after a few demonstrations that the time machine worked, I became world famous. The thing was apparently keyed to my specific biometrics, only I could use it, or some government or another would have taken it away from me. So instead of being used as a weapon of temporal destruction it became entertainment. Every Saturday at 8pm my television program aired. Viewers would submit great historical mysteries, and my team and I would go back in time. If the time machine revealed the answer to the mysteries then the world got their answers, and eventually we would reach a mystery with no explanation. At this point the time machine would be used to create the mystery.\n\nAnd thus it went. JFK, The Loch Ness Monster, the Antikythera mechanism, Roswell, the construction of the pyramids, the Princes in the Tower…all had easy rational explanations that became immediately obvious once you could use a time machine to investigate all the players. And then one day we found the Mary Celeste and it was completely normal, nothing mysterious at all. We knew what we had to do. \n\nThe show ended and my crew went their separate ways. But over time the answer began to sour. Was the Mary Celeste really the greatest mystery of all time? After all, now everyone knew what had happened to the crew; they’d been offered a lucrative lecture program in the year 2016 and had no intention of ever returning to their own time. And people began to ask a new question. Who was the mysterious hooded figure who had given me the time machine and my mission in the first place? And as time went on and more and more people began questioning this, the answer became obvious. I returned to that rainy December night in 2015, dressed in a dark hood with a mask underneath and spoke to my past self.\n“This is a time machine. Only you can use it. If you use it to create the greatest mystery of all time, then you shall become rich beyond your wildest dreams.” \n\nYou might think that I would keep what I’d done secret. After all if I told everyone what I’d done then we’d be stuck with the same problem as with the Mary Celeste, thanks to time travel everyone now knew the answer. But I knew that it wouldn’t take long before others came to the same conclusion I had, and I made different plans. I broadcast it worldwide. I did a special final episode of my show, in which I promised that the real greatest mystery of all time would be discovered. \n\nAnd as I returned home, leaving the time machine in the capable hands of my younger self I grinned to myself knowing what I had done. It didn’t take long for the rest of the world to realise either. First people started asking on internet message boards, then in the news. My house became beseiged by reporters begging me for the answer and I laughed as I admitted that I had just as little idea as they did. And so it remains to this day, the final and greatest mystery of all time. Debated everywhere, from the armchair philosophers sitting round tables in the pub, to great conferences in CERN where they discuss the hidden meanings of reality. \n\nIf I’d been given the time machine by my future self, and he himself had gotten the time machine from his future self in a self-perpetuating loop, then who exactly had built the time machine?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406470720", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 31, "controversiality": 0}

I did everything with him we got into trouble alot of times while growing up but we always looked out for each other and i trusted him more than my brother.\n\nNot achmed on the other hand was someone i just recently get to know, John brought him along one day and said he was a mate from college. Achmed is huge, tattooed and loud. Normally i wouldn't get involved with a guy like that because he looked like trouble but John ensured me he was cool and i trusted him so i gave Achmed a chance.\n\nThe three of us hung out a couple times smoking weed etc. The usual stuff. Everything was cool and Achmed really did seem like a decent person.\n\nOne friday night we decide to go out and have some fun and we meet up at my place and want to get some drinks in before we go out and party ( in my country booze in clubs is expensive so we decided to get drunk before). Achmed was mixing us some nice drinks ( mojito) and we drank together. \n\nEverything was cool for about 5 mins and then i fucking passed out.\nWoke up in the hospital about 12 hours later without knowing what the fuck was going on.\n\nDoctors said i have been drugged with heavy sleeping meds. They also told me that a guy brought me to the ER but he didnt leave a name. Now im fucking worried about John since he doesn't seem to be in the hospital.\n\nI tried calling him but he wouldn't answer so i called Achmed and he also wouldn't answer, both phones seemed to be turned off. \nAfter some final checkups i got released and who is standing by the exist of the hospital ? It is Achmed. Naturally i start swearing and i try to punch him in the face. Well problem is he is bigger and stronger so he jusst overpowered me and sat on me till i came down. \n\nAs i came down he explained that John is in alot of trouble, he said John started doing coke a couple months back and that he drugged us both to steal some money so he can do coke. ( apparently he was broke)\n\nAchmed explained that he was a former drug addict aswell and he was trying to help John because he knew what he is going through.\nHe also told me that John has been missing since the evening before.\n\nAfter a couple more minutes of talk and explaining we decide to go look for him and we seperate so we can cover more spaces. I checked some of the places he liked to hang out but i didn't find him and after about four hours i was about to give up and call the police to file a missing report.\n\nThat is when Achmed was calling me and saying he found John and to meet up at Johns appartment. I went there as fast as i could.\nI knocked on the door and achmed opened.\nAnd there he was lying on the floor drenched in blood and barely breating. But something was weird John was tied up. \nI turned around and Achmed was aming a fucking gun at me telling me John was supposed to sell drugs for him but instead got high on his own supply and hes owing Achmed money and that he couldn't pay up.\nI was frozen i couldn't think straight the my heart was racing and i thought it was over. Achmed told me that as his best friend it would be of both of our best interest that i pay up for John. \n\nI barely got the words out to ask him how much John owes him and he looked at me with a straight face and said: \" I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\". Well, it was about that time that i realized that he was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I just told him \"Dammit monstah!

He played with notable old time players like Exile. He was quite well known but dipped out to start playing Halo: Reach competitively. His best placing he ever reached in that game was 4th at MLG Columbus. Crimsix then switched over to Battlefield 3 in the hopes of competing in the $1.6 million tournament. Crim wasted a long time practicing for the tournament, but it never happened. POOF, no money. After finally giving in on those dreams, Crimsix came home to Call of Duty with the hype up of Black Ops 2. Even though CrimBot was rusty Aches picked him up. This decision and risk might be the highest risk with the best reward ever. Under Complexity, Crimsix and the gang placed 1st at Frag Cup, 2nd at UMG Chicago, 4th at MLG Dallas and 4th at Champs. Crim never  turned back placing 1st, 1st, 1st, 2nd, 1st, 1st, 1st, 1st, 1st, 1st, 1st, 1st, 3rd, 1st. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/IBg6lzH.png\nNo I didn't write an error in there. Crim and CoL/EG absolutely dominated the scene and still do. \n\nCrim is known as a quirky and humorous player that doesn't like to lose. Not only that, but he doesn't want to be anything but the best player he can possibly be. After his loss at champs he used that tournament to fuel his fire and finally went full Crimbot. \n\n\n### What makes Crimsix better than the rest of the top 10?\n\n10\\. Nameless - He has all the tools at his disposal to be the best player in the world, a smart player, with a good shot and a never give up attitude.  What he lacks is the ability to put it all together all the time. You can often see Nameless get **shaken** and get worse and worse as they start to lose. \n\n9\\. Proofy - Proofy has one of those deadly shots in the game. His reaction time can get him out of a lot of sticky situations. What Crim has that proofy doesn't is a calmness. Proofy can get hot headed or overexcited and lose his in game awareness. \n\n8\\. Nadeshot - Nadeshot is one of the best SND players in the game, arguably better than the rest of the top ten, his experience and leadership are key to his play style. What he lacks compared to Crim is that deadly shot that can hit anything. \n\n7\\. Apathy - At this point I can't really say much wrong about the players. Apathy is a very sneaky player, someone with that calm mind and great shot, along with a knack for search and destroy. He can slay and OBJ at the same time. What he lacks is experience at the top. Sure his team beat Complexity at Call of duty championships US qualifiers, but their success ended quickly. \n\n6\\. Clayster - Unlike Apathy, Clayster is super experienced at the top. An old teammate of  Crimsix and the highest earning player in MW2, Clayster knows how to win. With the Ghosts strategy switching to mostly subs, Clayster's **versatility** has been challenged. Crimsix doesn't seem to have this weakness and could probably go positive with a bb gun. \n\n5\\. Teepee - Onto his teammates who all placed in the top 5 of voting along side him. Teepee has all the same upsides as Crimsix, except that his AR shot is just not the same. He doesn't really need it though as he has three of the best AR's on his team. \n\n4\\. Karma - Karma is the absolutely perfect player. He plays for the team, gets the kills, wins the match, and leaves. People often think karma is the best slayer in the game, but you can see Crimsix getting even more kills than him. \n\n3\\. Aches  - Aches, just like Karma, is one of those Veteran, all rounders that you have to be to make the top 4 in the game. But the one thing he is missing is that his confidence can get in the way sometimes. Crimsix can routinely come out think he is going to win and dominate a tournament. \n\n2\\. Scump - It is pretty much a coin flip now. Scump and Crimsix are simply the best players in the game and I don't think many people can argue. SND, Blitz, Domination it doesn't matter. THEY CRUSH. The only thing that breaks the tie is Scump's off switch if you can find it. Get him cooled down and he is maybe a top 6 player and not a top 2. \n\n1\\. Crimsix - Crimsix is [confident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmQrQwOQePw), He doesn't get [shaken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vXJ2GVITao), he can [outplay a whole team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=7QiMZcRASyY#t=210), he [clutches up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=eTTpvdsz49s#t=694), he doesn't stop being the aggressor, He can carry the heaviest of [weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQGj-r7CVLs) not that [](#eg) are that [heavy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=9DZPhUruIDc#t=166) He is the most versatile player in the game.

{"body": "First you must understand this story happened in a very conservative christian school.\n\nOne of our female teachers was secretly a lesbian. Homosexuality wasn't really talked about at our school but it would have certainly gotten her fired. So my friend has a huge crush on the teacher and claims she is always giving him provocative looks. We had fixed places to sit for every class and he sat next to the hottest girl in our class so in retrospective it makes sense that she probably did look to that part of the classroom often.\nAnyway, my friend started hanging out with some shady people after school and smoking weed. One day he pretty much invited the whole class to his home (his parents were divorcing and didn't give a fuck anyway) to blaze it. I was shocked. Not because I was afraid of pot but because he literally told the whole class. Needles to say, someone ratted him out and he avoided expulsion by accepting to change schools after the end of the year. We only had like two weeks left, so it wasn't that big a deal. He decided to go out in style if he wasn't allowed to come back to school next year (plus, I guess he also wanted the attention from his parents for getting in trouble).\n\nHe set out to prove once and for all that Miss Kowalsky wanted to fuck him and laid out a plan which he called 'immune to failure'. Now, since everybody around him had turned out to be a huge phony (mom had been cheating on his dad for years, dad had spent all their money in gambling/shady business) he was sure that every adult in the world harbored at least one huge secret. When a fifteen year old thinks he's got the world figured out, there's nothing much you can do to stop him so I decided to help him. He types up an anonymous letter to Miss Kowalsky telling her he loves her and he wants to lose his virginity to her. He explains he understands why she may say no and, while he's sorry to resort to such a drastic measure, he's going to reveal her big secret to school administration and the police. He wrote he had discovered her secret while stalking and following her around because of how madly in love he was with her. The letter provided an e-mail address for further discussion. We left the letter on her desk right before class and, sure enough, by late afternoon she had already responded. She was imploring for her secret not to be revealed while also stating she could never be with any of her students, as she took her job very seriously and wanted to protect children not harm them. My friend responded that she would not harm him. They would meet in a very safe and private location, have sex, and never speak about it ever again. Surprisingly enough, she accepted. After some more emails they agreed upon meeting at her apartment after class and have sex for two hours. He would then swear never to reveal the secret and they would never talk about it again. They even devised a complex alibi about extra tutoring, just in case someone suspected anything.\n\nSo, I wasn't there when they met but you can take my word for it since he always told me the truth about stuff, and frankly he wouldn't make up a story where he ends up looking so bad. He came into her apartment where she was already expecting him, her jaw dropped and she was speechless. I... I always assumed I was writing with Jennifer (the hot girl). It went right over my friends head at the moment as he just wanted to get it on. She started to back out of the deal. When my friend protested she said she was afraid he didn't have the right equipment to have sex with her. My friend drops down his pants and boxer shorts and says: I've got six inches baby, what more do you need? About tree fiddy, she responds. In this moment my friend realizes Miss Kowalsky is actually an 8 stories tall lesbian and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten him again! 'Damn it monster I ain't givin' you no damn tree-fiddy!' He said.\n\nNeedles to say, she got fired and had to register as a sex offender. We all went on with our lifes but never quite forgave our friend for ruining the poor teachers life. I wish people wouldn't judge others based on sexuality, race or height, but sadly this isn't the reality we face in the modern world.\n\nSometimes I think about Miss Kowalsky and shed a tear.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406536259", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

I won't go into details, but both her and the drunk driver died, thankfully neither of them had any passengers. Anyway, I felt awful and guilt-stricken and lost my job because I got severely depressed. So I called a number I saw on some TV show about a medium (had to sign an agreement not to say anything until the episode aired, but before any episodes were put on TV, the show was cancelled). Not sure if that voids the agreement or not, so I can't give the name of the show. Sorry for you people who want proof.\n\nAfter about a month the show called me back to tell me they were interested in having me on the show, so I went to the studio and did a few evaluations before they started filming. A large part of the filming was done before I actually had the session with the medium. Skipping ahead to the actual appointment with the medium, she say me down at a table, put her hands over mine, and asked me some questions about my ex, her name, address, religion, and then she went silent before she started speaking to me in the voice of my ex. It was kind of scary, but her voice became really similar to her voice and the first thing she said was \"don't feel guilty, I know we fought, but I loved you and I don't want you to feel like it's your fault I died.\"\n\nAt this point I kind of broke down and just cried for a little bit. The medium squeezed my hands and I pulled myself together. I was desperate to believe she had forgiven me, and the relief she had was enough to make me bawl like a baby. At this point my ex started talking again, saying \"I just want you to do one thing for me...\" I nodded, still crying, and willing to do anything she wanted. \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Then I realized that the medium was really just the goddamned Loch Ness monster wanted her tree fiddy.\n\n**TL;DR:** It was a complete hoax.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406604057", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The quarters and the dimes at least were silver, so I sold them to a pawn shop in town for like $15 which was a fortune to little me.

But yeah.\n\nI was out and about on my boat about midway through the game just exploring the seas, feeling the salty breeze on my face. The slight taste of salt on my lips as I hunt whale and chart tiny islands and coves. \n\nSomewhere in the south-eastern part of the Caribbean Sea [roughly east of Kingston](http://imgur.com/dlAcdfk), myself, my ship and my crew are getting up from a midday rest in the still waters to brace for a storm just off the coast. This storm was fierce, and it rolled in fast. I thought \"Meh, why not just go through it? The wave dodging mechanic thing is easy anyway.\" and I charge on towards the eye of the storm.\n\nThis was where I tasted fear for the first time in my life.\n\nThe winds stilled, but what rolled in instead was a fog thicker than any shitty stew you would get from our cook, Jeördon Ramsøy, some horrible Scandinavian chef who only cooks with fish and various fish oils and exctracts. In the middle of the rolling, obfuscating behemoth we saw a shape start to take form on the horizon. The winds chilled and the sea roared a mighty howl as it hammered towards our hull with the fury of Poseidon himself. The silhouette crept forward. It started to take shape and colour. \n\nBut most importantly it revealed its enormity, for the size of this vessel was truly worthy of song. The encroaching vessel was named the HMS Prince, and it sliced through the waves in silence but its lethal approach was heard far and wide, from the sound of waves pounding against the hull like massive war drums. The bellows of the captain of the Prince pierced the fog before the light could reveal him, yet the sound barely escaped the drowning crashes of the waves. The captains message spoke thus: \"Passengers of the Jackdaw... I need about tree fiddy\", and as the captain spoke the words he revealed himself to be 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era, and the HMS Prince kept creeping forward.\n\nSo yeah I was sat there alone in the dark, and I am already kinda scared to be this far out in the open sea because I already have a fear of deep sea creatures and shit. This massive fucker decides to appear to strike terror into my soul and make me question my time spent on this earth.

{"body": "Met this girl at a party, named Vanessa. Solid 9/10, great body, and very flirty. She was really coming onto me, making out heavily, with a lot of groping and petting. She said she knew the host of the party and led me up a flight of stairs to an empty room.  \n\nWe passed several other couples getting busy, without bothering to close the doors in their drunken frenzy. This was still in highschool, and I was about to lose my virginity to this girl. She lay down on the bed and motioned for me to join her, slowly stripping off her black crop top, revealing the pink lace bra underneath. At this point I was ready to go, heart racing, blood boiling in my ears. She pulled down my pants, and started to blow me. Pretty soon she wanted more, and asked if I had a condom. Thankfully I did, and she helped put it on. \n\nAs we were about to start, the door burst open and two girls stumbled in, giggling and drunkenly making out. Vanessa waved them over... I couldn't believe my luck! They began undressing each other, still kissing, while I turned my attention back to getting laid. In what I thought was a couple minutes, but later turned out to be 10 minutes later I pulled out, exhausted, and lay on the bed with the three girls on my sides. \n\nI reveled in my moments of glory, when suddenly Vanessa turned and looked my straight in the eye, biting her lip and curling her hair. As she ran her hand along my chest, she cleared her throat and said that the service wasn't going to be free. I was utterly confused, so I asked what she meant. That's when she said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" It was at this point that I realised that she was actually a 30 foot tall monster from the palaeolithic era. \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy, Loch Ness monster\" I told him. The other girls rose from the bed in horror as what was once Vanessa jumped out the window and swam away into the distance.\n\nTL:DR Seemingly amazing loss of virginity quickly takes a sour turn.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406631580", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I'm a guy, but I'm sure this was her worst.\n\nYesterday was my 19th birthday, so me and my buddies decided to celebrate by going to the bars at my college campus (minimum age is 19). I usually don't drink too much, but, since it was a special occasion, I decided to get really fucking wasted. We pregramed a lot before the bar, since it's difficult to obtain alcohol in a bar when none of us are 21, plus it's really expensive so I wasn't trying too hard to get my friends with fake IDs to buy me some. I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my fucking mind.\n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this really sexy chick dancing by herself. Being drunk as shit, I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance sexy? Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up grinding hard/making out a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes.\n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated. We were making out a lot on my bed, and we took off each others shirts and things were really escalating. I had her panties off, and I was starting to think me losing my virginity was a sure thing. I could tell she was really into it. She said \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". I figured she meant me going down on her, and me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\". Then the question came: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"I aint givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!

{"body": "Ugh. My mom always likes to tell this story whenever we have company, and I swear, it gets more embarrassing every time. But, I guess I might as well tell it, too. If every other commenter is brave enough to talk about their embarrassing stories, I guess I should be too.  \n  \nWhen I was super young, I went to a preschool that fairly far away from my house. Meaning we had to drive about 20 minutes every morning. Of course, my little 4-year old brain couldn't comprehend that. So when my mom started shaking me trying to get me to wake up early for the first day of school, I was groggy, tired, and whiny. But even still., I was never the type to throw a tantrum (and god, do I wish my mom would include *that* detail when she tells this to our relatives). It's strange really. You figure that a little kid would be happy to start his first day, but somehow, I wasn't (I guess this was the start of my introverted behavior). So I got dressed in my little overalls and my striped shirt, grabbed the lunch my mom had made for me, and she and I were off.  \n  \nOn the car ride there, she continued to assure me that I would meet new friends, and have new experiences, all that jazz. Although I was still upset, I tried to make the best of it. She was my mom, and what toddler ever finds fault in their own mother? Anyway, when we got there, I hung up my coat in the cubby, and then moved over to the floor where all the children sat. The teacher also asked that all parents stay the first day. I figured this was because if any of the kids was too shy, or even refused to cooperate, as kids often will, then the parent would know.  \n  \nSo we started off with the ever-dreaded \"go around the room and introduce yourselves.\" I swear an honest hatred for this activity is hard-wired into your brain from birth, and from then on, you never get over it. i sat next to a kid named John. we talked a little bit, and it seemed like he and I might just get along. So by now, maybe I think this won't be so bad. So we start to go around the room, and of course there's all these kids that want to grow up to be astronauts, and kids that are already somehow professional athletes, all your standard toddler talk. We were going clockwise around the room, meaning John would go before me. At first I was relieved, but little did I know, this wouldn't be as good as I thought.  \n  \nSo I had it all worked out. I would say that I like riding my bike, and playing with Legos. Thats perfect. Not too crazy or outlandish, but still interesting enough. It shows that I was moderately active, and also had a creative side. Sounds good to me. So by the time John's turn came around, I was prepared to tell the whole class about myself. However, just at that second, John stands up and says, \"I like building Legos and going bike-riding.\" Oh. My. God.  \n  \nHe stole my description. he said exactly what I was going to say, and I hadn't even told him what it was yet. All of a sudden, my first day of preschool became just as bad as I thought it would be. Right from the beginning, I knew I wouldn't enjoy this, and even though I was building myself up, trying to have a better attitude, this little fart goes and ruins it all in five seconds. I had to think of something. My mom must have noticed my distress from the other side of the room, because she asked the teacher if she could speak to me for a moment. Thank god, she had bought me some time.  \n  \nWe went out in the hallway, and I told her what happened. She just smiled, gave me a hug, and told me to say it anyway. \"There's nothing wrong with two people sharing the same interests&gt; Maybe you two are just destined to be friends.\" She was right. I could say whatever I wanted, it didn't matter. But did I know this as a four year old? Of course not. I was already formulating what I could make up. Legos and bikes sound cool to yourself, but coming out of someone else's mouth, it just sounded stupid. And making everyone think I was stupid was the last thing I wanted to do. So I waddled back to the carpet, and  sure enough, everyone was waiting to hear what I had to say. Here goes nothing.  \n  \n\"I'm FrecksAndSpecs, and I'm a professional race car driver.\" This may have been the only time I'd ever seen my mom facepalm. But now, all of a sudden, John decides to pipe up.  \n  \n\"You are *not*!\"  \n  \n\"Am *too*!\"\n\n\"You're not a professional race car driver!\"  \n  \n\"Am too, you wanna bet!?\"  \n  \n\"Sure, how about tree fiddy!?\" It was then that I realized that John was, in fact, a 500-foot tall monster from the paleolithic era. I then cried, \"Goddammit, Nessie, I ain't given' you no tree fiddy!\" And stormed off.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnyway, that was my first day.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406648143", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was actually in a coma for 6 months after getting in a major car accident when I was 18. It was weird, I only remember seeing bright lights. Then I woke up, unaware of how much time had passed.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I wasn't really sure where I was, since I was delerious as fuck. My vision was super blurry, and my first thought was that something was wrong with my eyes. I thought I was partially blind or something.\n\nAnyways, After a few minutes, I heard some voices that seemed to be getting closer to me. Two of them were obviously my parents, and the third voice I assumed was the doctor/nurse. I was in a bed surrounded by those light-blue curtain type things, so I couldn't see anything. My parents were just outside my curtained enclosure, and what I heard them talking to the doctor about was horrifying. They were asking the doctor if \"now would be a good time to cut life support\". They didn't think that I would ever wake up. I lay there shocked at what I heard, but I didn't say anything because I was still a alittle loopy and had an oxygen mask on my face.

Go and assault the manager on your first day, they'll have to give you a grand just to let you go.\" There's always some sort of plan which to the person attempting to pull it off, is absolutely foolproof and absolutely cannot fail.

Started calling off sick, and on the few occasions he came to work he was limping all over the place as his condition got worse. Eventually got called in for meetings, that he never showed up for. Meetings became disciplinaries, still no sign of him. Very sporadic contact - I made certain that I knew that he knew he was wanted for meetings. He was given the warning that failure to show up next time would mean he may be dismissed for wilfully ignoring reasonable instructions from his management. This eventually happened, and surprise surprise suddenly he was contactable again. He \"hadn't received\" any of the myriad letters relating to the previous meetings but miraculously the one informing him his contract was terminated made it's way through.

He replied; \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nOk, no he didn't.

{"body": "I am great at taking other peoples money.\n\nIts truly terrifying that one day I may serve extensive prison time for my actions. To give you some perspective, I have conned thousands out of their hard earned money. It's dishonest, immoral, and dirty overall, but hey I have accrued a FUCK TON of cash. I started scheming right when I graduated high school. Well I guess it technically started in high school. I would approach classmates and get them to \"loan\" me money. Sometimes I would just ask to \"borrow\" it, but that rarely worked, especially when they started to figure out I had no intentions of paying them back. So, out of necessity, I had to deviate from my original plan. I would come up with elaborate stories sparring no detail explaining why it was so necessary that they give me their hard earned money. The most crazy thing about this whole thing is that it actually worked! Sure some people would catch on and call me out for what I was, but when someone fell for it..... I knew I would be able to con them again. It was like clockwork!\n\nI have gone all around the world doing this. and as I've gotten older I keep getting better at it. And let me tell you, its hard on the conscious but great for the wallet. Sometimes, I'll dress up and create backstories for the \"character\" I'm portraying, just to make myself that much more believable.\n\nI think the craziest part of my whole ordeal is that not only do I not need the money anymore (I already have enough to be fine for the foreseeable future) I don't buy anything with it. I live in a dusty old place, don't own a car, and use steal wifi from public places. It's like I programmed to do this. My brain is hardwired to desire conning people out of their money so that I can build myself a treasure. One that I know I will unfortunately never use.\n\nI guess what really made me want to even answer this question, and confess all of my issues is that i almost got caught yesterday. I got a little too ambitious. Recently, I've noticed that its easiest to scam sick people (I'm going to hell I know). So I made myself some scrubs and waltzed my way into my local hospitals cancer unit. I walked into a patients room, casual checking her chart at the door so that I could speak to her by name. I approached her bedside, and with a huge smile and cheerful tone said \"Mrs. Jones I have terrific news, our research wing has been given permission to run an experimental treatment that we believe will have a 98% chance of putting you into remission\"\n\nI could tell by the tears of joy and her own beaming smile that I had her......\n\nI continued \"But unfortunately your insurance will not cover it, we can proceed today, but I will need a significant cash advance from you\" \"How much?\" she said frantically. (I just knew I had her) I looked her dead in her eyes and said \"I'm going to need about Tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was at this point she noticed that I was actually 8 stories tall, and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. She looked at me and said \"GET OUTTA HERE, you goddam Lochness Monster!!\" She then yelled down the hall for a real doctor to call the police.\n\nNeedless to say I hightailed it out of there. I had never come so close to being caught. I actually felt kind of bad.\n\nSorry for the rant, and details, but I really needed to get that off my chest!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406653735", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

I would stand in between the bristles of his tooth brush and put one under the laces of his left shoe. Every single night, I would keep this up until I finally reach the most impressive spot for a nickel. I will even fuck with his son in law when he comes to visit his mom for the holidays. No, he's not going to see you, he doesn't like you, he's going to see his mother, alright?\n\nYeah, I'd get that punk real good.

{"body": "My two best friends came to visit me in Arizona, and we decided to go back country camping. We don't like seeing other people around, so we hike for long distances and set up camp wherever it feels comfortable. I had the week off and we decided to do a 2 day hike out, and set up in the Superstition mountains. Anyone who is familiar with them know the myths a lore behind them. (There is a reason they're called the Superstition Mountains) Anyway. The hike out is pretty uneventful. We all have very full packs, and an old eTrex GPS. After 2 days and miles of hiking, we are in the middle of nowhere. That's how we like it, we set up camp, and break out the whiskey. We normally drink beer, but that is way to hard to pack out on a camping trip like this. It's mid afternoon, and we've only had a shot or two each so alcohol is not a factor here. We get a good fire going and I start to cook some of the chicken noodle soup I brought with. Mike says he needs to piss and walks over to some brush. All of a sudden Tyler and I hear the girliest scream we've ever heard. Now, Mike is a strong guy. Not meathead strong, but he never loses his cool. We just start laughing, thinking he saw a rattler or something. He comes running back to camp in a panic saying \"There's a body, there's a body, there's a body.\" He just keeps repeating that. Tyler and I get this feeling of surprise and go over to investigate. Sure enough, it's a white man, no shirt, mid 30's, just laying there, face up, a small blood puddle that looked like it came from his back. The creepiest thing was his eyes were still open. It was just surreal, but after a few moments, Tyler is the first to put it together that this is not the most terrifying thing. The body is fresh! We're no forensic scientists, but it didn't smell, and the heat is intense out there. After he says this, we realize that we are 2 days away from civilization. We look for horse tracks, 4 wheeler tracks, anything that would give us the peace of mind that the killer was long gone by now. Nothing. Obviously we can't stay here. We strike camp quicker than we've ever done it before. Obviously we have to tell the cops about this. I mark the spot on the GPS. Mike wants to get some sort of ID off the guy to give to the authorities. It was like being in a bad movie. We argue for a bit about which two will roll the guy, while the other looks for a wallet. Tyler and I agree to roll him over, and Mike goes for the wallet. It's covered in blood. We put it in an empty zip lock and Mike frantically goes through a liter of water washing his hands. \n\nWe start the hike back. Double time. No one suggested it, it just happens that way. As it gets dark out we debate hiking with our headlamps or just setting up the tent somewhere hidden. Keep in mind, we are terrified there is a killer out there. We set up the tent back in the brush, and none of us even try to sleep that night. Every little noise is terrifying. Once the sun starts to rise we book it. We still have another day and a half of hiking. What little talking we do, is always speculation about what happened. The next night goes by very similar, but we sleep in shifts. We are exhausted.  We finally get back to the jeep and book it out of there. We find the nearest ranger station and all three of us just start talking the guys head off. He makes some calls and the authorities get the quads going. Then we hand the guy the ziplock with the bloodied wallet. He turns it over to the sheriff. They ask us to hang out there for the day in case they have any more questions. They ask to fingerprint us because of us rolling the body, that way they'll know to cancel those out. We agree. Finally, after about 8 hours of question after question, they say we can go. (We were never suspects, or being held) Just as we gather our things the phone rings. The ranger answers, just says things like \"mmm hmm, mmm hmmm, ok ill let em know.\" He hangs up the phone and says forensics came back on the wallet, and all they found were mikes finger prints, no id, no credit/debit cards, nothing. All they found in it was a business card for a bail bond service, and about tree fiddy. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406657695", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Me and a buddy of mine were addicted to making bets out of every aspect of life. Whoever got to work first wins, whoever could get the most phone number, guess which team wins the game...whoever lets out the biggest log on the toilet..you name it..we bet on it.\n\nPretty much to give you all a background, this particular incident occurred somewhere around a year ago. We decided that we were going to go on a run (us being very active people at the time..at least that's what we would like to think). We ended up decided on going on a soothing jog throughout a very popular park. We thrive at the sight of populated areas, working out amongst a group of strangers with the same common goal is always the best..you don't need to be acquainted with others to bond over physical activity. \n\nIf you know anything about this park, you are instantly greeted by fury critters and other animal life. It's a toss up on whether or not they are friendly or will just run away if you venture to close to them. Usually the squirrels are incredibly friendly but will get hostile should you approach them in such a way. At the sight of this, my buddy decides to come up with this \"clever\" bet...by clever I mean incredibly stupid. He suggests that one of us catch one of them while acting like a crazy wild man to make it much more challenging. Being the immature fool that I was a year ago which I am still today, I take him up on this bet.\n\nLuckily we didn't have to search long as we four squirrels surrounding a tree. We quickly storm towards that said tree and of course the squirrels ended hiking up the tree for dear life. I had suggested we should give up on those and search for others but being the adamant dare-deviling dumbass that my friend was, he decides to climb the tree. Bare in mind that this tree isn't a small one, it towered most of all the trees in this park. I took a moment to survey the rest of the park and you could see how the rest of trees stood cowering in defeat compared to this nature sanctified beast. \n\nOf course I wanted no part of it so I watched as he scaled his way up the tree, careful in his manevours. He reaches 3/4's of the way up and spots a squirrel quivering on the edge of the branch. I tell him this isn't a good idea but of course he reassures me that he will be fine and also win the bet after he grabs this squirrel. Boy was he suddenly mistaken....\n\n Let's just say a puny branch couldn't hold the weight of a 195 pound muscular framed man. The branch snapped quickly like a human bone involved in excessive force and down came my friend..his bones replicating the sounds of the branch. The squirrel ended up making an Assassin's creed leap of faith jump right and I somehow managed to catch the little fritter. My buddy watched him fall into my arms as he fell onto the floor. Now what makes this story even worse is that this SQUIRREL..whose life I probably saved...DECIDES..to bite on my arm in a frantic frenzy. I let him go instantly and from fear the squirrel felt the need to bite on the first thing he saw to avoid falling. THAT happened to be my man parts. \n\n\nSo here I am screaming around trying to swing this squirrel who is chomping on my pride and joy while my buddy is on the floor barely moving. At this point I'm bleeding from my family treasure as I managed to finally get the little bastard off. The ambulance arrived shortly after, they put my buddy on a stretcher and I went along for the ride but asked not be on a stretcher and to be in the same truck. As we are riding down to the hospital I give my buddy a warm felt pat on his head for being a dare deviling asshole. Hes in deep pain but still musters up the strength to congratulate me. \n\nHe broke several bones, his femur, his shoulder, four ribs and his armHe had some head trauma and a couple of deep cuts but he was in all high spirits. As for me, I didn't get rabies but I definitely was given some stitches (hurt like shit) and had to spend the night over. There wasn't any significant damage to my babies. He is a man of his word so he calls his girlfriend up to bring him his check book so he can write out my winnings. I took the check..with victory coursing through my inner being. It finally sunk in..I won..I WON.\n\nOf course I inspected the check..his signature conceded his defeat...the bank these checks are from co-signed in this defeat. It was like holding a trophy, like winning every fucking major championship at once. I took one final glance at the check and hovered my eyes of the amount and grinned with the upmost relief.\n\n\nIt said tree fiddy.....

The thing is that at that time we lived way out in the country and there were nothing but cow-fields around. She went all around the house, and she couldn't find anyone. That was the beginning of our apprehension.\n  \nA few things about this place: the house was 95 years old, and in one of the closets was written in pencil on the rough-hewn wooden wall was \n\"&lt;thus and so person&gt; died here in 1934.\" We had always felt that there was something 'weird' about the house, so this was just more validation of that weirdness. Another thing was that the doorbell wasn't electric, but rather like a bicycle bell in that it was mounted on the door and a visitor would turn a crank to make it ring.  \n  \nI told her that she was just probably hearing background noise on the Lord of the Rings audio tape she was listening to. But then...  \n  \nThe next morning we had woken up early and were 'actively enjoying each other's company' (having sex) when I happened to think, \"What if there *was* some sort of entity trying to make contact with us, and was watching what was happening with us right then? EVEN BEFORE THE THOUGHT WAS OUT OF MY HEAD, my wife's dog jumps up and starts barking her head off at the bedroom doorway! Fucking fuck! I didn't know *what* to think. I mean, seriously??? Is this real??  \n  \nI'm so freaked I can't continue with my wife, and I get up and go into the bathroom to brush my teeth and get ready for work. I'm really shaken. I mean, \"Hello??...Hello??\" and then *this*??  \n  \nSo I'm brushing my teeth, and I think \"If there *is* something here, what would it look like? And *instantly* in my head appeared an image of a person looking *right at me*!!! I thought, Who are *you*?? What are you *doing* here???\" and the person's thought came to me: \"I can make all this stop for about t'ree fiddy!\" RIGHT THEN I *knew* it was the Loch Ness Monster, and I said \"You get the hell out of here you Loch Ness Monster!\" and the person disappeared.  \n  \nWe've never had a problem in that house ever since.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406674275", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "See, I think I've seen that one before.  There was this one time I went into the coffee shop, and the guy behind the counter (the Barista) looked like someone I'd known from high school.  This was odd, because I was in New York at the time, and I'd gone to high school in Michigan.  \n\nSo I'm trying to place this guy's face, and I realize that my buddy, who actually worked in a Michigan Correctional Facility had told me about this guy that we had gone to high school with that had been stealing cars when we were growing up.  He eventually ended up in the same jail that my buddy was a corrections officer at.  While in prison, apparently this dude was everyone's little \"bitch\" until he finally just snapped.  \n\nHe said he took half a dozen *plastic* knives from the kitchen (apparently they actually kept them counted, but if you worked kitchen duty, you could get away with it) and he used the concrete floors under his bunk to sharpen them.  Then one day, he just lost his shit, took all six, and went around jamming them into people that had screwed with him at the prison.  Then he would snap the plastic off so it was still in the people, and like 2 of the dudes died, but it added 50 years to this guy's sentence.  \n\nSo my buddy tells me that eventually the buddies of the guys he'd killed came after him and just beat the piss out of him.  Supposedly they'd cut off three of the fingers on one of his hands, but he couldn't remember which.  So the guy ends up having to go to a local hospital to get his fingers reattached, since they couldn't handle that at the prison, and somehow managed to escape from the hospital.  And I could swear this Barista was the same guy I'd gone to high school with.  \n\nSo I went up and got my order, and asked him if he'd put a picture on it to see if I could catch a glimpse of his fingers to see if there was any scarring, but I couldn't get a good look.

{"body": "Ooh! you're talking my shit! It's been a while since I studied this so somebody correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThis is really kind of cool. *Most* bacterial infections and viruses are that way. It has to do with the way your immune system works. (which is awesome btw). When a pathogen (something foreign) makes it into your body, let's say a bacteria, it will do what everything tries to do. Colonize and reproduce, which causes infection.\n\nAs it travels through your blood it will eventually encounter a type of leukocyte (immune cell) called a macrophage that will phagocytize (devour) it. Once it engulfs and devours the organism it will use parts of it (protein markers) that can specifically identify the invader to the other cells in your immune system. It does this **by displaying the body parts of its fallen enemies on the outside of its membrane.** \n\nAs it travels through your blood with its gruesome display it encounters natural killer cells and helper cells and \"shows\" them what the invader looks like. Armed with this information the killer cells seek out the invader while the helper cells take the \"wanted poster\" to your lymph nodes where thousands upon thousands of dormant, untrained immune cells await. The helper cell will activate these cells with the information and they swarm out. This activates an immune response and you experience symptoms. Stuffy nose, sore throat, etc. This is your body going into \"lockdown\" mode to prevent new invaders while swarming your blood with these \"soldiers\" to seek out and kill the enemies.\n\nOnce the battle is over these cells remember the invader and may go dormant again with that information. This is the premise that vaccines work on. You are injecting dead, or live but weakened invaders into your system to \"train\" your immune system. when you encounter a full strength version in the wild, your immune system already knows what to do!\n\nViruses are a little trickier. They are smaller, slippery little bastards. Some of them have defense systems against our immune system and some can even survive the macrophages devouring them or kill the macrophage. The main difference with a virus is that it can take over almost any cell in the body. Your cells are like little \"cities\" in their own right that produce energy, recycle materials, and reproduce as well as perform specific functions. The virus infiltrates the cell and manipulates the cell DNA/RNA and uses the \"city infrastructure\" to reproduce itself. eventually the cell membrane (city walls) can no longer hold all the copies of the virus and it bursts releasing all the new viruses into the blood stream to each find a new cell and repeat the process. This is why viruses are so nasty.\n\nMalaria is a parasitic protozoan, a single cell organism. This little fucker is *highly* adaptive and is able to evade our immune system. Remember those protein markers that identify the invader? Well, *all* cells have them, even our own. Ours identify as \"self\", invaders as \"not self\". Malaria has adapted to be able to change its protein markers, like a disguise. It infects red blood cells, kind of like a virus infects other cells except RBCs don't have a nucleus so it's a bit different. Whatever though, the point is they reproduce as themselves inside the RBC and when they leave it they change their identity while in the blood stream until they can enter another RBS and change back into themselves.\n\nSlippery little shits aren't they?\n\nAnyways, I just realized I've written a textbook that nobody is going to read. That's a basic premise on how this stuff all works and obviously I'm really into it. I'm sure I got a few things wrong but most of it should be pretty accurate.\n\nTL;DR Has nothing to do with tree fiddy.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406685663", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Funny story about this: \n\nAbout a year ago, i was in Anchorage visiting a buddy of mine from high school and we agreed to meet at this little cafe there called Carribou Coffee. Now this was summer time in alaska so the weather was pretty mild and people wore less layers and more colorful tshirts. But as soon as i lay eyes on my friend, i could immediately tell something was a little off. He walked way too fast, and erratically, his hands never left his pockets, and he wore a huge, heavy winter parker in what was like 50 degree (F) weather. I dont think much of it because the guy was *that* weird guy from grade school: the one who licked all the dorito dust from the chips, and then put them back in the bag and tried to sell it to people. \n\nSo i see him approaching, walking way too fast, wide-eyed, hands in his pockets, wearing the unnecessary parka, and he  sees me in the cafe, enjoying a cup of coffee. (Let me warn you homo sapiens, that Carribou Coffee is no joke. That stuff will revive a corpse, it is so goddamn strong. It will actually make you say, what the fuck. But anyways) So my friend knocks on the window and beckons me outside. I go outside to meet him with a smile and a handshake and he just tells me we need to go NOW. I ask why, but hes already on the move. Now we're powerwalking like we about to piss ourselves until we reach a long, dark alleyway. It's important to remember that i'm a 5'7\", 135lbs black man so i rarely have a height or weight advantage over anyone, and my friend is a 6'2\", 190lbs male. As u could expect, my instincts are telling me this shit is bad and that that coffee has me thoroughly fucked up. \n\nMy friend starts telling me i have a really good sense of fashion. Repeatedly. We're about jogging down this alleyway and he keeps telling me i have a really really good sense of fashion. I didnt think i was wearing anything particularly flashy, but hes eyeing my clothes now, with *that look*. It was the same lustful look he gave to those goddamn doritos. As Im about to decide to turn around (my mental processing was a little off, that fuckin coffee, i swear to god), we reach the end of the alleyway and there's a cab waiting for us. My friend turns to me and with the most serious expression, he says he needs some money. I hesitate, and he starts to pull one of his hands out of his pocket. I ask him how much he needs, and the cab driver opens the window and yells \"about tree fiddy\". I pull out my wallet and hand the man the money and my friend just nods and gets in the cab and they drive away. Anyway, as you can see, i get the most compliments on my sense of fashion.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406719172", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

You have the coolest job!!\n\nThe two greatest disappointments in my life were the de-planetization of Pluto and the de-dinosaurization of the Brontosaurus. I have two questions:\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, Dr. Marsh discovered the Apatosaurus first, then the Brontosaurus. When we discovered that the Apatosaurus was just a teenaged version of the Brontosaurus, we dropped the name Brontosaurus. Is that some kind of standard protocol in the scientific field, because it was named first? The term Brontosaurus was more widely used, at least by the general public, and still hasn't been completely lost. Also it was bigger and older so we should've kept that name.\n\nSecond question: what are the odds that the Brontosaurus evolved to become an aquatic animal and survived all this time, eventually becoming the modern Loch Ness Monster? ^please ^I ^just ^want ^this ^to ^be ^possible", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406743307", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was studying in my University library sophomore of college. Because of the amount of work I had for my major (CS) I drank about 5 cups of coffee a day just to keep myself going during finals week. So it was Friday the weekend before my finals start and I was working on a pretty difficult programming project. I noticed my cup of coffee had ran out so I finished up the thing i was working on and got up to get a refill in the library side shop. Right as I got up I noticed one of my friends working at the table right in front of mine. Now I have known her ever since freshmen year because she lived in the same dorm that I did. I have also had a huge crush on her for the longest time but I never made a move. So I went ahead and chatted her up and she started telling me all the work that she had to do and how she's been so stressed over the past week because of school and relationship problems and blah blah blah. After a little bit of digging around I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend last week because she found out that he cheated on her with a mutual friend. All the while she was telling me this she was looking at me with those \"come and fuck me\" eyes that even a socially awkward person like me could notice without second guessing myself. Because our university had a tradition of having sex in the library at least once before we graduate, I jokingly brought it up and asked her whether or not if she's already done her part in keeping the school formality. She laughed and said no and I told her it's never too late to do it now. She looked at me, got up and grabbed my hands and took me to a secluded part of the library. She pushed me against a bookshelf and the next thing I know her D-cup boobs was against my chest and her tongue was in my mouth. We made out like this for at least five minutes and the whole time I was rock hard and her hand was caressing the bulge in my jeans. After a while I finally couldn't take it anymore and reached for the buttons on her top to take off her cloths. When her shirt finally came off I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Standing right in front of me was a giant three story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Goddamn you, Loch Ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as Nessie jumped out of the building through the window.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406768775", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "\"Yep,\" I said, even though there was no one else there.  It was more of an affirmation than a statement.  If I was gonna go, I was gonna take at least one of the bastards with me.  I guess.  I mean, no one had ever actually seen one of them, and all I had was this old .45.  The damn thing was over a hundred years old, and the bullets were probably half that.  It had been passed down through my family, and my Grandfather buried it under a fence post when they banned all the guns in 2018.  He showed my Dad where it was before he shipped out when the Third World War started, and my Dad showed me when he got chosen for the last Tithe.  They say it's pretty rare for two generations of the same family to be chosen.  I guess I'm just lucky.  \n\nIt's kinda funny when you think about it, well not really, but maybe if things hadn't turned out the way they did.  I mean, people had been trying to hold off that war for decades, but it came, and everyone thought it was gonna be the end, but it was over almost as soon as it started.  On the second day of the War, the New Moon showed up.  It's not like the other Moon, it's a triangle about the same size as the other Moon, and it's the blackest thing you could imagine.  It's kinda like looking at a hole in the universe, where something ought to be, but there's nothing there.  Nobody knew where it came from, or what it was, or even when it got there.  It just showed up, and just like that, the war was over.  The soldiers and the leaders, they didn't know whether to shit or go blind.  So they just waited, and after about 5 days, the visitors came.  Now, the visitors weren't aliens, they were people, or maybe they were aliens disguised as people, we don't really know, but they came and talked to the leaders, and whatever they said must have been pretty scary, 'cause the leaders agreed to the Tithe.  They never told us what the visitors said, or why the aliens want us, or what happens to us.  I guess that's the worst part.  Not knowing.\n\nI looked at the letter one last time.  I don't know why, I had already memorized it.  All that mattered was that I had to be at the stadium at 3:00 pm.  I chambered a round in the gun and then stuffed it into the pocket of my jacket and walked outside.  It was a brisk, cloudless autumn day.  The air was cold, but the sun was warm.  I was strangely content, but that feeling soon subsided.  When I got to the stadium, I got in the long line that snaked from the south entrance, which moved surprisingly quickly.  I checked my watch as I entered the stadium.  2:47.  \n\nThere were 11,478 people here, at least that's how many should have been here, I didn't bother counting.  Some were in the stands, but most were on the field.  Some were talking quietly, praying, pacing back and forth, but most were staring at their shoes, occasionally glancing around nervously.  I checked my watch again.  2:49.  Damn.  \n\nI looked for a familiar face, but I couldn't find one.  Even if I had, what would I have said?  And the worst thing, besides the not knowing, is that it doesn't even matter.  People cared after the first Tithe.  But that was 40 years ago.  They'll have memorials and all that crap, but no one really cares.  They're just glad it isn't them.  Maybe I can change that.  \n\nI checked my watch again.  2:59.  This was it.  The conversations, prayers and pacing had stopped.  Every eye was locked on the New Moon.  You could almost hear the silent countdown going on in everyone's heads.  Five, four, three, two...\n\nIn an instant I was flying.  It felt like a dream.  The air was still, and there was no sensation of movement.  If I had blinked I might have missed it.    100,000 miles in the blink of an eye, and there I was, face to face with the end of my world.  The being was larger than I had expected.  I hesitated for a moment, but I had to act.  I could feel the fear rising, dominating my thoughts.  I tried to move my arm and reach for the gun but I couldn't.  I was paralyzed, and the fear was taking over, as if it was the only thing I had ever known.  The being stared at me with its cold black eyes.  I sensed that it knew what I was trying to do.  And then the being spoke.  \"I need about tree fiddy,\" it said.  Well, it was about that time I notice this alien was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the plezezoic era.  \"Goddammit Loch Ness Monsta,\" I said, \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy.\"  My adrenalin spiked as the trigger was breaking.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406783353", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I didn't see this happen to me, but it actually happened to me and I was the victim.\n\nIt was quite a while ago, and I was about 11 at that time. Now at that time I had this friend who was generally on quite good terms with me, and I enjoyed his company. His only quirk I hated was that he would refuse to share food with me, and me only. I didn't get it. I would see him sharing food with others - Famous Amos cookies even, yet when I asked for one he never gave me any. \n\nOne day however, the school cafeteria was horribly understaffed, and the queues were so long that the school had to use those stretchy barriers so the queues wouldn't block everyone. But my aforementioned friend, being a good swimmer, had rushed down earlier and had managed to get some food for himself. I tried cutting queues, but I wasn't a very big person and just got jostled out of the queue every time I tried. At my wits end, I gave up trying to find food, and jokingly asked for one of my friend's twinkies. I thought no one in their right mind would give anyone his twinkies, let alone my friend, so you can imagine how surprised I was when he offered me half a twinkie. I couldn't believe what was happening, and I pinched myself multiple times to see if i was dreaming, and that was the only time I ever did that. Finally, after convincing myself I wasn't in a crazy dream, I reached for the twinkie, but then stopped. There's something wrong, there's no way in hell my friend was actually giving me this twinkie, there had to be something wrong, either with him or the twinkie.\n\nI carefully sniffed the twinkie and did a thorough check around it to detect any signs of farts, cockroaches or snot. I couldn't find any, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was up with my friend. So I asked him hesitantly why he was offering me this twinkie. Note that up till this point, I have never dared to ask him why he wouldn't give me his food, for fear of ruining our friendship or breaking my jaw; he was a pretty big guy. So when I asked him that, he just casually said \"It's what friends do, man. Just take it, it's for you.\" After trying to read his strange expression, I warily reached for the twinkie. Just before I grabbed it, he pulled it away. \"Stop.\" \"Why? I thought you were giving it to me because I was your friend!\", I asked. \"Yes, but there's just one thing.\" I thought it was strange, since while he never gave me his food, he never asked for anything from me before, either. Either way, I wanted the twinkie really bad, so I replied, \"What is it? Are you okay?\" \"I...I need about tree fiddy.\" That was when I realized that my friend wasn't just a big guy, but in fact around 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance, twinkie in her flipper.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406813516", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Then suddenly she pulls back, I'm devastated. \n\nShe looks up into my eyes, I'm about to burst into tears. I ask her so softly \"Is it because we are brother and sister.\" She is staring at me, damn she is so beautiful. She whispers back in the most seductive way \"No I need something first.\" My heart flutters. I grab her hand and squeeze.

{"body": "&gt;I don't know... Can you really say you \"know\" a god doesn't exist the way you know evolution is true?\n\nNo, because the evidence supporting evolution is orders of magnitude more convincing. But, I don't need to be that firm with god any more than I need to be that firm with any other being we lack any evidence for (ghosts, elves, Invisible Pink Unicorns). That we lack evidence for them, and can find no logical reason why they are required to exist, is sufficient to allow me to say with confidence, \"No gods exist\" in the same exact fashion that I say, \"No elves exist.\" Same level of certainty for the same reasons, lack of evidence or irrefutable logical argument.\n\nBeing a gnostic anything doesn't mean absolute certainty, it means \"certain within our current knowledge and ability to know.\" Within that guideline I'm gnostic about all gods that I consider to fit a reasonable definition of god. Other definitions like \"the universe plus awareness\" I don't consider to be god. Why do I need to be MORE certain of gods not existing than I am of ghosts, elves, the Loch Ness monster in order to say, \"I'm sure gods don't exist?\" The evidence is the same: none, why isn't the certainty the same?\n\nScience is a process of learning about the universe, which means it's ultimately a process of becoming less wrong, not a matter of being absolutely right or certain of any claim. Far as we can tell, there will always be things we don't understand, which means we'll always be uncertain about some things. Absolute certainty is a goal we are not currently capable of reaching, so why should we use it as a standard for the word, \"know\"?

{"body": "Find Ms. Adams!\n\nMs. Adams was a stone cold fox. I was crushing on her hard. You read all these stories online about lady teachers boning their students, and I was naive enough to think... Why not me? Foolish I know, but I ended up getting REALLY close.\n\nMy attempts to impress her started out innocently enough. I wanted to look like extremelly smart in her class, so I actually studied a lot for that useless class. I mean seriously I know more about useless information about tropical flowers than any 20 year old should ever know. So i commit all this stupid shit to memory, and start answering EVERY question she asks the class. She started to act different towards me, probably because she is happy a student finally took an interest in her otherwise boring ass class. However, horny teenage me imagined my extensive knowledge of sumac was making her wet.\n\nAt this point I wanted to make a move on her but had to get close. I approached her about starting a botany club... I know... contain your orgasms ladies. She agreed, and then gave me the first clue that she was in to me too. She pulled me in to a half hug, where her hand was around my waist just at the small of my back and pulled me pretty close and says \"I'm so glad you took such an interest in my class, it's let me put a lot of interest in to you.\"\n\nAs hot as that was to me nothing happened for a few weeks after that. That is until the day before our schools club fair. I came to her, using preparing our booth for the fair as an excuse to talk to her. To my surprise she said, I'm really busy right now, and I have a meeting right when school lets out, but I'm going to be here late tonight, come by my classroom about 8pm and we can design our booth.\n\nBoy was I pumped to spend some one on one time with her. This just sounded like the beginning of a porno, could this really be happening?\nSo I go back to school at 8pm and she has to let me in the front door because it was locked. When she gets to the door I noticed shes changed, into some very skimpy workout clothes, almost see through clothing, with no bra. My chin hit the floor and I popped an immediate boner. Somehow I am able to navigate the hallway without collapsing.\n\nWe get to her classroom and sit across from each other at one of the lab tables. The sexual tension in the room was so thick, and I just knew something was about to go down. She smiled at me, and said \"So what was it you needed?\" I replied \"I think we need to decorate our booth so that I can attract new members at the fair tomorrow\" and in a sultry voice Ms. Adama says \"It won't be the only thing your attracting.\"\n\nAt this point I'm sure I''m stammering like an idiot, I start to say something when Ms. Adams cuts me off and says \"I need something from you real bad\" All I could manage to say back was \"Wh....whhh..what?\" Ms. Adams gave me the sexiest face and said \"Ima need about Tree Fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this point that I noticed Ms. Adams was actually 88 feet tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I was flabbergasted \"Goddamit Monstah I aint about to get trickked by You. You aint gettin my Tree Fiddy.\"\n\nEmbarrassed I watched her scurry off. I couldn't believe how fast the tension evaporated from the room. Also, I hated myself for getting so in to botany. If there is one point to this story that you can take away it is you will probably never hook up with your teacher, and if you even get close they will be revealed for the psycho they are.\n\nThe second thing you can take away is botany is fucking useless and stupid. Don't waste your time learning anything to impress anyone. Learn things because your interested. Knowledge is only power if you the power is actually useful.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read all of this!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406828911", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
