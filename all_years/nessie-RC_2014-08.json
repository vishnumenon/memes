{"body": "My Grandpa had just died and we were flying to Boston the day after Christmas for his funeral, which was the next morning. We got to the airport and to our gate with no problems, but then when it came boarding time they told us there would be a bit of a delay as there was a problem with the plane. An hour or so later, they said it'd be another 15-30 minutes. Another hour or so later, same thing. Eventually, they said they were just gonna arrange for a different plane to fly us there instead of trying to fix the old plane. Technically, our flight was cancelled but replaced by another flight. That flight kept getting delayed as well though (and again, in small increments). After we were at the airport for 11-13 hours, that flight was cancelled. My dad got on the phone with the airline people and arranged for us to get on a flight early the next morning (the day of the funeral).\n\nThe next day, we got to the airport at a reasonable time. When we walked in, there were several hundred people in line to check their bags. We needed to check a bag as well, so we got at the back of the line. After about a half hour or so, there were still hundreds of people in front of us (which, by the way, is not usual for this airport, but it must have been returning flights for people visiting relatives for Christmas). We eventually had to buy two carry-on bags from the in-airport store (meaning they were extremely overpriced) and stuff everything from the bag we were going to check into those carry-ons and bring said bag back to the car. We then went through security and my dad and I got out first, being randomly put on the TSA Pre-check list. I waited for the others and my dad rushed to the gate, as at this point in time we were just about to miss our flight. When everyone was through, we all ran to our gate (luckily it's not a huge airport) and my dad was stalling the lady taking the tickets because they were just about to close the doors. If we didn't run, they probably would have closed the doors on us. When we got to Boston, my Uncle picked us up and we went straight to the funeral (So yeah, we were on the airplane in our funeral attire).

This becomes faith like belief in God if there is no proof, so lets just believe they had these weapons. Well I can't choose to just believe without proof because my children's countrymen are being accused of deliberately killing 300 people. I'm afraid I need more.\n- And whatever it is, a Russian Military logbook still ends up in Ukraine. The conclusion is self evident. Not self evident to me. A journalist saw something that looks like a missile in Ukraine, I'll go that far. Quite what that proves is beyond me, another leap of faith that this was the missile that brought down the plane? Was it a Buk? Does he speak Russian? There are registration documents for these missiles but  wouldn't describe them as a logbook. The Oracle system they use to log all of these things require a 15 string code, God knows what he saw, touched, read but it is too big a leap to go from missile type thing to killed 300 people. \n- You're equating lack of evidence as the same as proof of non-existence. I am. I have no evidence that the Loch Ness Monster exists, therefore the process of scientific examination tells me it doesn't. This isn't some fine tuning of string theory that requires some forces currently available to man, the US has satellites in space that can see men moving on the ground- remember the bombing of the Al Queda training camp in Pakistan, we saw live on tv people running for their lives filmed from space. These satellites are permanently watching E Ukraine but it cant pick up a missile the size of a sofa accelerating from standing to mach 1 in seconds and hitting a bloody 777. \n- Has that bloke acquired a mate now? And from his in depth knowledge of black stains we can deduce where the sofa sized missile was fired from? Again a Russian military expert is going to tramp round a field under mortar fire to shop his mates to a foreign journalist in full sight of the Russian militia who today, as you reported, have been firing at journalists. And this expert can without any equipment for example tell between the different types of Buk? Does the absence or presence of the IFF safety system change the patten of the stains, what if there has been rain. The plane according to flight tracker flew over the site then turned and flew back, if the plane dumped its fuel tanks how would that look? You don't do an analysis of a stain on the earth and conclude it is Buk in a bloody field with no equipment, dear God.\n- I just thought we had discounted eyewitnesses. I'll raise your eyewitness and give you two who saw the missile fired from Ukrainian military aircraft that were tailing the plane. This is an endless ball of string, we both have 20 eyewitnesses who saw what we want them to see and another 20 soldiers who claimed to have killed 500 opponents. \nGive me a chemical analysis of soil at Snezhne, or as the Telegraph puts it 'Without forensic expertise, it is impossible to tell whether a missile was fired here leaving the earth scorched, or whether the indistinct tracks that lead through the area were made by a missile launcher, an armoured vehicle, or simply farm machinery'. \nHave a good one", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406865550", "subreddit": "MH17", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

See the thread was asking about people's most insane sex stories. The top answer was this truly engaging, well-written story about how, when the poster was sixteen, she had a gradually escalating flirtatious relationship with her mid-forties female english teacher. It started with homoerotic undertones in the homework she turned in recieving A's and smiley faces, and developed into outright cybersex on facebook. Finally, just as the story was reaching its \"climax\" with the girl heading over to her teacher's house for a sexual encounter, everything suddenly shifts gears when it's revealed that, somehow, the teacher was actually the loch ness monster asking her for money or something. \n\nNeedless to say, it was really fucking weird, so I mentioned it to my friend next time I saw him and asked him why the hell he sent it to me. He explained that it's a South Park reference, and that people do it to trick redditors into believing fanciful stories, only to reveal at the very end that it's all made up. When I asked what the point was, he said it was just a funny thing people threw in. I responded with \"that's fucking stupid as hell.\" He got kind of quiet and honestly looked a little hurt. \"I just thought you'd find it funny....sorry dude...\"\n\nI felt bad, so I apologized for snapping at him. He just smiled his relaxed smile, and responded \"it's no big deal man. I'll tell you what, know how you can make it up to me?\"\n\n\"You name it\" I responded. I felt bad, so I figured I owed him one.\n\n\"I'm a little short on bus change today...do you think you could loan me about...tree fiddy?\" Now at this point the story and joke have ended, but I'm throwing in these lines so people who skip to the bottom don't instantly see it.\n\nPoint is, there you go.

Eventually, I threatened to send him to the principal's office, and he cooperated. \n\nA couple hours later, I had the students working on a \"get to know your classmates\" project. The students picked a partner and told the class 5 things about that partner. Paul had picked a girl for his partner, and his 5 facts were completely made up and absolutely mean. The girl began to cry, so I pulled them both out in the hallway and made Paul apologize to the girl for what he said. I told Paul that this was his second strike, and one more strike would send him to the principal's office.\n\nAt lunch, everything was going well. Paul was sitting with a couple other boys, and they were relatively calm. I took a couple minutes to myself, and used the bathroom. When I came out, I made direct eye contact with Paul as I watched him throw his turkey sandwich at another boy a couple tables over. It was a direct hit, and it would have started a food fight had I not intervened as quickly as I did. I pulled Paul out of lunch and took him into the hallway to verbally punish him before taking him to the principal's.\n\nIn the hallway, I began to yell at Paul. I told him he was being very mean and disrespectful to everyone. After a minute or so, I noticed Paul was crying. I began to feel bad for him, so I took a breath and asked him if I could get him a tissue. He looked at me through teary eyes and said \"No, but can you get me about tree fiddy instead?\"\n\nThat's when I noticed Paul was a 500-foot crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\", and I walked away.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406897774", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

You aren't convinced by the evidence.\n\nI take issue however, when you suggest there isn't evidence or it isn't convincing. \n\nEvery assertion I've made can be backed up by at least two, and in most cases a lot more than two, pieces of independent evidence. The same criteria used to build a legal case.\n\nThe Russian connection can't, which is why I don't make it.\n\n&gt; I have no evidence that the Loch Ness Monster exists, therefore the process of scientific examination tells me it doesn't. \n\nBy the same token we can give up the search for life on other planets then, given it obviously doesn't exist.\n\n&gt;equipment for example tell between the different types of Buk?\n\nGiven you're so keen on the process of scientific examination, you should be aware the criteria is falsification.\n\nAs the expert pointed out, all manner of factors play into altering the burn marks, angle of launch, truck position, etc. \n\nSo as long as the burn marks are consistent, that is uphold the theory, then the theory is sound. \n\n&gt;as the Telegraph puts it 'Without forensic expertise, it is impossible to tell whether a missile was fired\n\nAbsolutely, but what we're talking about is turning evidence that strongly suggests the presence of a Buk into indisputable proof.

It was what you could call a perfect weather. Here we usually don't have many things to do and on a date one would rather have a long walk and just talk instead of the more usual \"watching movies/dinner\". So anyways new neighbors had just moved in next doors and they had the most beautiful blonde daughter that I have ever seen. So my parents decide to invite them over for dinner to welcome them to the neighborhood. When they come over their daughter and I had the chance of being in private for a few minutes. Nothing happened at that point but I ended up asking her out. So we go out the following night and we end up having a great time. I learn a lot about her and she was quite talkative and we ended up having a lot in common. We talked so much that hours passed like minutes and we ended up staying out till dawn (we didn't go far from our separate homes so the adults didn't really mind). As the sun was rising I looked deep into her eyes and leaned in for the kiss. As our lips were about to touch I feel her checking my pockets. So I ask her \"what are you looking for?\" in a jokingly manner. She looks me straight in the eyes and says \"I need bout tree fiddy\".

Hope it's okay to tell this story here.\n\nMy parents have always been a bit more uptight, and that had been\na thing to remember ever since I was very young. No loud music, no\nvulgar language, and you were expected to remain decently clothed\nwhile in the house (always difficult for me). There were rules enacted\nthat, while not making sense, should be followed simply because they\nwere the house rules. I never felt the need to toe the line as much\nas my older sister, though. Where I would make sure to use headphones\nwhen listening to whatever wasn't deemed \"speaker appropriate\", my sister\nfelt the inherent need to play the most uncouth music at the loudest possible\nleveld until there was an issue. It got to the point to where this caused\nissues in the household, where my parents would end up fighting because\nof something stupid my sister had done. This was something she reveled in,\nand would spare no expense in making sure that there wasn't one night that didn't\nend in my parents fighting over the most inane situations. It got to the point\nwhen my father put my foot through my sister's computer monitor, after he had discovered\n(through the use of a parent's computer program) that she had been visiting omegle in the\nwee hours of the night to pose nude, I guess. I never got the full story. But that's when\nmy (then-17) sister decided to do the unthinkable.\n\nShe decided to enact an elaborate scheme where she would frame my father in a cheating scandal,\nby slipping a pair of panties she bought from target into my fathers dirty laundry. She even \nset up a dating profile of him in order to make it look like a frequent occurence, and left\nit open on his study computer when he was at work. Well, when my mother found the underwear,\nshe hit the roof. My sister showed her the computer, and my father's fate was sealed. My\nmother packed up me and my sister in the car, and left about 2 hours later. \n\nMy parents got divorced, and I never knew the real story until about 2 years ago, when my sister \ntold me (while drunk mind you) at my friend's going-away party. It felt like my whole world\nstopped for a second, and all I could hear was the slowly-increasing heartbeat that pulsated\nthroughout my whole body. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. After years of us ostracizing\nour father, and this whole time he had been the victim? I wanted nothing more to do with my sister.\nI yelled at her to get out, and she thankfully obliged, otherwise I was close to getting violent. \nI never realized how truly twisted my sister was until that moment, and things stopped being so murky.\nThings were clearer now, like I had been partially blind my whole life and just now put on glasses or something.\nThen I finally saw her for who she was. She wasn't, nor was she ever my sister. She was actually close to 500 feet \ntall and from the paleolithic era. \"Goddamit\", I said, \"You're not getting my tree fiddy!\"\n\nI never saw her again after that party.\n\nTL;DR: Boy founds out his sister is not who he thinks she is.

That's it! I thought, panic starting to make me shiver. I am *losing my mind*. I took a deep breath, and decided to calm myself and face what was to come.\n\nI heard a thin, small voice, seemingly from far away...\"...are you from Earth?\" I looked around fearfully, seeing nothing other than the surrounding brown surface. \"Hello?\" I ventured, feeling foolish. \"Yes..hello.

Little did I know, I had no fucking clue how to interact with other students. \n\n7th-8th grade were a blur to me, I didn't make any friends, but I excelled in all of my classes, including being put in advanced math.

I had become accustomed to being around those of the female persuasion, but I still couldn't talk to them like I could anybody with a dick. I had made a couple of friends during that time, but we were all equally clueless. \n\nWe became good friends during those few years. I was an outcast, I was \"that guy\" during high school. Those few years were good to me. Our circle of guys slowly turned into a circle of friends. The first girl who joined our group was named \"C\". \"C\" was an awesome girl, and she liked what we did. I failed in my attempts to woo \"C\", she dated the guy that was on the basketball team. \n\nMy Junior year, I met this girl named \"L\". \"L\", was an amazing girl, and we hit it off immediately.

So, on the night of prom, I picked up L for the best night of my high school life. We took pictures with all of our friends, and we were so happy! We got into the limo, and were ready for an amazing night.\n\nThis was the best night of my high school life, I had a girl, who I had talked to, who wanted to go with me to prom.

This time tim bought him and his mom protective gear and more lazers and three lazered up body guards and more treats for the dolphin. Then the guy broke out of jail and went to the illegal guy and he built him a super robot suit of lazers to get revenge on tim. so he rampaged across town and killed people and the military sent in troops but they drank too much coffee and died because they were too active and the guy went to tims home but the bodyguards were too scared and they ran away but tim used his money magnet to take their paycheck and their money from his pockets and the guy started shooting lazers all over and tim and his mom and the dolphin fought back and tims mom hit the guy and he fell down from his robot and he was like  ugh and tim and his mom and the dolphin went over to the guy who was lying on the ground and tim was all like y u do dis? and the guy was like i wanted to go to ur party and tim was like why? and the guy was like so I can ask you for tree fiddy and whatdoyaknow, he turned into the loch ness monster and ate tims mom and tim was like http://nooooooooooooooo.com/ and he shot nessie and she fell down but his mom died so tim made a time machine to travel to the past and told himself to let the guy into the party and give him tree fiddy so that this crap wouldnt happen and then the young tim did and everyone lived happy ever after (except for the dolphin, he was bought by a evil guy instead of tim and the evil guy trained him to be evil).\" ignore any time paradoxes pls", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406987373", "subreddit": "MCPEfamily", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My parents divorced when I was 3. My mom saw food as a way to treat my sister and I. It was easier for her to just grab McDonald's than cook.\n\nShe was also a hoarder. Like the show. I grew up in that. We didn't have a kitchen. It was just stuff. I'd eat in my room or on the floor because we didn't have room.

I stayed fat through high school and college.\n\nAt some point, it became my responsibility to get my fat ass into not so fat ass shape. It's ducking hard. I'm use to fast food.

{"body": "Yeah, he should be very proud of himself! \n\nA similar thing had happened to me, years ago. I had just moved to a new city back in the summer before 12th grade. I had no friends, so I just spent my time sitting alone on the computer looking at my old friends myspace updates. They talked about all the crazy shit they'd do, and I just felt left out. I wound up eating a lot, because I had no idea what to do in my new home. I'd stay at home all day, chugging cokes and eating doritos. I'd play games with them, and slowly but surely my friends list kept getting smaller. First went Vincent, then Mitchell, then Bobby, and so on. I was literally watching my friends forget about me. It was quite depressing.\n\nSo I'd gained a ton of weight by the time I started at my new school. I was the loser fat kid, no one really knew or wanted to know. I had no friends, and then one day I looked at myself in the mirror. I realized my weight had gotten out of control, and I decided to remedy that. I started working out hard, and by the second half of the year I had shed about forty to forty five pounds. Unfortunately my situation at that school was still in the dumps for the rest of the year, but I didn't let that deter me. By the time I started college I was back to my original weight of one hundred sixty five pounds. I felt so great not to have weighed what I had ballooned up to, which was about tree fiddy, that my confidence soared up to record highs for me.

{"body": "My time to shine. I would use a throwaway for this, but since the people who know me IRL have already heard this story, here goes...\n\nI was about 13, and I've always lived in rural north Alabama. That's important, because if you were in any size city, you would never notice the faintness of the light and sound. It would just be a flash and a buzz and you would never notice it. My parents were in a huge fight. To show my disapproval, I went outside with my sleeping bag and laid down on the porch. We had a security light on the utility pole that would flicker and go out for several hours at a time. So, it's dark. Neighbors were across a cow pasture, and they only had small lights on their back porch. There was never any traffic after about 8:30. So, I could see for miles and hear anything going on outside. It was spring break, but when you're 13 and living in the sticks, that's usually a pretty boring time. Not this time. After I started getting cold, I was going to go back inside. I don't know if my parents locked me out to teach me a lesson or if I locked myself out. Either way, I wasn't going to face either one of them at 1 a.m. and take the wrath of disturbing their fight to come back inside. So, I decided to take a walk to try to warm up. So, I cross the pasture and head to the road. The road is even darker, because it winds through the woods. There was a little more noise, though. I could hear animals in the woods, and what sounded like voices in the distance. I would never investigate, now, but at 13 I was huge for my age and thought that I was made out of steel. I walked up the road until I could find a path into the woods that had enough visibility from the moonlight for me to explore. I took to walking down the trail, and it helped that it was one that I had walked down several times before to get to a stream to go fishing. I knew it like the back of my hand, but I had never seen anyone else back there. As I walked down the trail, the voices grew quieter. It was confusing, because they were certainly coming from that direction, but the farther I went, the quieter they got. That's when I realized that a white noise was drowning the voices as I crept toward the source. The sound was like tractor tires rolling down the pavement. I was still on the trail lit up by moonlight. I finally got to the clearing where I would go fishing, and there were at least a dozen people dancing around and singing. They were singing at the top of their lungs, but they were almost entirely drowned out by that whirring white noise. I laid down on the cold ground watching to see what was happening. I had never seen these people before. In a small rural community, that's odd. There were no vehicle parked on the road, but these people were there dancing and singing. I had heard that \"devil worshippers\" (that I would later identify as wiccans) were all over the area. I had convinced myself that I had come up on a cult gathering. I watched with great curiosity. That's when in the midst of them, a dull glow started coming from some silver bullet-shaped thing. It was about 8 feet tall and tapered from the top to about 5 feet across the bottom. That's what was producing the noise. It's like this thing had those people in a trance. Suddenly the pale light focused and made a line straight to me. One of the people gained their composure and walked up to me. He asked me, \"Do you know what you are witnessing?\" I told him, \"No. I have no idea what's happening. I was just walking back here to sit by the stream.\" He said that I was called to join them, and they could make me special. I didn't notice that the bullet object was hovering over to him. I told him that I was just going to go home. He told me that I couldn't do that now. I asked him what he wanted, and he said oh, about tree-fiddy. That's when I noticed that he was really a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era. I told him I ain't giving you no tree fiddy, you damn loch ness monster. The next thing I knew, it was almost dawn, and I was standing right in the middle of the road. The silver bullet was hovering overhead with the light still focused on me. I didn't feel threatened by it, or even remotely concerned that it was following me home. I walked down the road, somehow refreshed despite not sleeping a wink the entire night. As day broke, it was like the bullet was just gone. I was almost disappointed that no one was going to see it but me. I had no idea what happened to the others. I walked across the pasture, climbed over the fence, and walked up to our house to gather up my sleeping bag. This time when I checked the door, of course it was unlocked. I walked in, and was never questioned. I don't know if my parents even realized I was gone.\n\nI didn't tell anyone about it for a while. For some reason, I just didn't think to do it. I wasn't afraid, just uninterested in telling the tale. The weirdness of it all didn't set in for months. Needless to say, I don't go walking through the woods alone at night, anymore.\n\nTL;DR Investigated a noise and ran into a cult worshiping a small bullet-shaped UFO.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407090629", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My uncle was getting married for the second time a couple years ago. His first marriage wasn't working out due to financial problems and how his wife didn't have a job and was a total bitch, so when they got a divorced we weren't surprised. \n\nThis next woman he met was pretty good, though. She made 5 figures up around 90k, which meant their jobs together would let them live comfortably. She was pretty attractive (I'd give her an 8) and she was really nice, too. They shared common interests and everyone in our family she met really liked her, so we were happy they were getting married.\n\nYou should also know that we were also worried, because they only knew each other for a year and a half, which is pretty early to start to spend your life with someone, though my uncle was an optimist. \n\nThe wedding couldn't have started worse.\n\nWe all met for the reception at my grandparent's house, which was a big house in the burbs and looked really nice. The soon to be wife (we'll call her J) came late and was in a pissy mood, apparently due to her waking up late. My uncle was able to get her to calm down and get her happy. \n\nCut forward to the I do's. The priest looks to my uncle and asks if he'll spend the rest of his life with her. Obviously my uncle says \"I do.\" The priest turns to J and asks the same. A couple seconds later, she starts crying and shakes her head and she says no, then runs out of there surprisingly quick for being in heels. A couple of the guest went to check on her and it turned out she was really angry. She was keying my uncle's car and just anyone's car in particular, shouting things she shouldn't have, etc. The whole day was a disaster but surprisingly my uncle was in a stable mood and condition and had a great night with his friends.\n\nThe reason she went batshit crazy was how a rumor started that my uncle had slept with one of the bridesmaids just a couple days before the wedding. My uncle was incredibly strict with sex and would not for the life of him have it unless it was with his SO. \n\nThe damage to his car wasn't so bad but he had to get it fixed. I still remember going in with him that day, and he asked how much it was to fix his car. \n\nThe guy working there checked and turned to my uncle and said, \"Tree Fiddy, sir.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407099460", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

It would be a miracle if I could pull through.\n\nBut I used up my deal with the devil on my super-intelligent brain.  Zeus just zapped my brain.

{"body": "I fucking hate anyone even remotely associated with an HOA.  I was outside cleaning off the sidewalk and the HOA twat walked by and made some comment about weeding our front garden.  She thinks she's just going to keep on walking, but I step out and block the sidewalk so I can ask her where she sees any fucking weeds.\n\nShe points to the herb section, where there's nothing but basil, thyme, and sage.  So I tell her she's a goddamn retard and if she's going to be telling people to pull weeds she should at least know what a fucking weed looks like.  As you might guess, instead of realizing she made a rookie error and fucked around with someone who wasn't going to roll over for her usual bullshit, she argued with me about what the plants were.  This went on for a few minutes until my then-g/f, who kept a very meticulous garden in the front and the back that was one of the banes of my existence at the time (who do you think lugged the mulch and shit around?), pulled in.  She got out of the car and after listening for a few minutes, pulled out her phone and messed with it for a bit, then walked over and interrupted Little Nancy HOA, putting the phone in her face and showing her a page full of pictures of herbs.  At that, she had no choice to but fuck off back to where she came from and shut the smelly hole at the bottom of her face.\n\nAs you might guess, this was the sort of person that had to get the last word, so it became a never-ending torrent of letters and bullshit.  Every letter was met with a firm \"you're full of shit and don't know what you're talking about\" laced with as much passive-aggressive venom as one can safely lace into any sort of business correspondence.  After about ten of these, I'd finally had enough, and despite g/f's protests I went over to talk to Little Nancy HOA's husband.\n\nI knocked on the door, and sure enough Mr. HOA answers.  Without threatening to beat anyone to death or burn their house down, I make it very clear to him that her bullshit has to come to an end, and that I expect him make it happen.  He looks me square in the eyes and says, \"I'd really like to help you, but I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"   I said, \"I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!

{"body": "Finally, my time to shine!\n\nWhen I was in 11th grade in High School I took a psychology class, one of our assignments was to do an amateur psychology experiment on some people or someone we knew.\n\nThere was this girl in the class, lets call her Amy, Amy was a really good friend of mine but she was also fine as hell. At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward.  And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.  \n\nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward.  So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\n\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, omg_cats, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\" \n\nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"\n\nEveryone in the hall heard.  The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.\n\nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.\n\nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"\n\nWat.\n\nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying.  \nA few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.  \n\nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.\n\nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered.  I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.\n\n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her.  Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"\n\nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her.  She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.  \n\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"\n\nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\"  I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\n\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.\n\nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear.  This is great.\n\nIt slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time.  After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life.\n\nWe're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\"\n\nI personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time.\nThen she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\"  The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\" \n\nShe says \"I need about tree fiddy.\"   It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.  Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.\n\nI stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.\n\nAs for my psychology project, I never did get it done, and instead dropped the class because of the terrible memories it had given me.\nTo this day I hate reading about Psychology in general.\n\n**tl;dr: Psychology experiments have forever ruined because of one stupid mistake. Also, never trust a shy girl.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407208778", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 329, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have the 37 by 9.5 inch version and i can give you a short review\nPros: Construction is absolutely amazing. This board is a few pounds lighter than any other board of its type i have ever ridden. When you look at it you can see how well Earthwing has done with the new technology. The concave is very nice. The w is great for tucking and also really helps lock you in on your back foot. It kinda tapers out to the front which creates a pocket for your front foot between the end of the w concave and the front wheel flares. its super comfortable. i've found that the kick tail is super effective as well, mainly due to the light weight of the board. Absolutely great for popping up curbs. Board has a tiny bit of dampening flex but nothing to worry about. Had it up to 40-45 and it was fine. \nCons While i do love the concave of this board in general, i feel that the front wheel flares are a little small and could be a little bigger, but this is just personal preference. I also didn't like how narrow the board was at first coming from a dropthrough that was very wide, but i soon found this to actually be a huge benefit in freeriding as i could basically keep my feet in the same place all the time. This really helped me build confidence at higher speed freeriding as i didn't have to think about my feet. That being said it could be a good choice to go with the wider version if you like to have your entire foot on the board.\nAll in all this is an incredible board. I would highly recommend getting it if you are looking for a topmount that is similar to the darkside or nessie.

{"body": "I read one today by /u/omg_cats its hilarious\n\nFinally, my time to shine!\nWhen I was in 11th grade in High School I took a psychology class, one of our assignments was to do an amateur psychology experiment on some people or someone we knew.\nThere was this girl in the class, lets call her Amy, Amy was a really good friend of mine but she was also fine as hell. At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward. And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.\nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward. So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, omg_cats, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\"\nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"\nEveryone in the hall heard. The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.\nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.\nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"\nWat.\nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying.\nA few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.\nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.\nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered. I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.\n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her. Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"\nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her. She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"\nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\" I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.\nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear. This is great.\nIt slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time. After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life.\nWe're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\"\nI personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time. Then she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\" The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\"\nShe says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.\nI stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.\nAs for my psychology project, I never did get it done, and instead dropped the class because of the terrible memories it had given me. To this day I hate reading about Psychology in general.\ntl;dr: Psychology experiments have forever ruined because of one stupid mistake.

He seemed to be fine with leaving the tree.  \nAbout a week later he said he didn't care and was going to cut it down no matter what. We tried talking to animal advocacy groups, but no one could help. And if we tried to keep the kitten and our landlord found out, we would be kicked out. We couldn't figure out a way to fix it.  \nWe offered the neighbor money to not do it, but he said he wanted the tree gone and no money would stop him. We cried and begged, but he told us we had less than a week to get tree kitten out.  \nTrue to his word, five days later he came outside in the early morning with a chainsaw. We woke up the second he started it.  \nWe ran outside and he had already begun to start his cut. I ran at him and he pulled the chainsaw out of the tree, so I jumped between him and it. My friend got on the tree with me, and we tried to keep a barrier around it.  \nThe old man yelled at us and kept revving up the chainsaw, but we held on tight. He even put the chainsaw up towards me to scare me, but I wasn't letting him intimidate me with tree kitten up there.  \nFinally he sighed and dropped the chainsaw on the ground. He yelled, \"Fine!\" But I made him swear to not cut down the tree.  \nTo help convince him, we took the kitten down so he could see how cute it was. As he was holding it, he promised to not cut the tree down.  \nI was so happy I asked, \"Could you do me one more favor?\"  \nHe nodded and I asked, \"Could I get tree kitty?\"  \nIt was about this time that my neighbor realized that I  was eight stories tall and a crustacean from the protozoic era.  \nHe gripped the cat to him and yelled, \"Goddammit Nessie!

I thought wheelbite, that's expected I just jumped the gun a bit and tried riding it before it was tuned in right? Went in side grabbed my tool and tightened it 540° (3r) boom got around my neighborhood fine before night. next day I decide too take it out to a mellow hill near my house. Put it down and guess what? More. Fucking. Wheelbite. I get my tool tighten my trucks another 360° (2r). OK get down the hill fine. At the bottom decide to do a quick slide to stop, set up carve and sharp carve before slide. Wheel bite and tossed from the board. Finally the next day I takes trip to the mall and pick up a 1/4 inch riser to add to my 1/8 inch one. I think to myself \"my problems with this board are finally over.\" So next day go out to my normal free ride hill and test it out. First pushup, no problems, no bite. Next a Coleman, major high side and me sliding on my butt. Well dang. Through out the day I figure my successful slide ratio was 10% good slides 90% high sides, where normally it would be near 95% good slides 5% ice outs.

{"body": "It was Friday, the hands of the clock slowly ambling towards midnight, and I was hunched over the bar as usual. My fingers drew circles in the puddled beer, spilled by some rowdy teenagers earlier in the evening, maybe two or three hours ago. Nodding to the bartender, I signaled for another drink, a simple vodka martini, extra dry.\n\nAs the cold liquid sluiced down my throat, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder. \"Excuse me, but is there anyone sitting here?\" A thin bespectacled man in a cheap suit asked nervously, gesturing to the open stool beside me. I shook my head and turned back to my drink, hoping this would be the one that brought sweet sleep to my eyes.\n\nBefore I could drink again, he asked, \"What brings you here to this dive? A beautiful girl like you belongs in a cocktail bar or a evening party.\" I turned my eyes to the stranger again and shrugged. \"Quieter here,\" I replied, my words soft but tired. \"And you?\"\n\n\"Believe it or not,\" he chuckled, wiping his sweaty forehead with his sleeve, \"I'm supposed to meet someone here.\"\n\n\"A date?\" The incredulousness in my voice must have been too obvious as he wrinkled his nose and sat up straighter. \n\n\"No, nothing of the sort. In fact, it's more of the opposite of a date. An end date, so to speak.\" A small tilt of his head downwards led my eyes to the inside of his jacket, where a gleaming metal spike lay concealed. \n\nI snorted, brushing my long sandy hair out of my eyes before rolling them. \"Oh, a vampire hunter. Costume Nights are Thursdays, pal. Today's nothing special.\"\n\n\"But you don't understand,\" he interjected, placing his damp hand on mine. I immediately pulled away, casually wiping my hand off on a napkin. \"Not just vampires. Any creature, fair or foul, that should not exist. The vampire, the werewolf, the ghost, the ghoul, the zombie...\" His eyes shown with barely concealed glee as he gripped the silver weapon, still tucked tightly in his belt. \"They call me... The Slayer.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Slayer, how very... interesting.\" I began to turn away, my mouth drier than the Sahara as I reached for my drink. \"And are you searching for the Loch Ness Monster here? Perhaps I could direct you to the nearest lake.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he smiled and reached for my hand again. \"You'd be surprised where we find them. Today's creature is a lesser known fable, though some say that it is far more powerful than any common monster of the night.\" He shoved his glasses up as he reached into his pocket, pulling out an aged diary, and opened it. \n\nThe crumbled yellow pages showed a humanoid creature looming over a sleeping child, its hands dripping with dust. A neat cursive scrawl beneath the illustration read 'The Sandman - Lord of Dreams' as well as a long list of notes describing its ability to shapeshift and cause confusion and amnesia in his targets.\n\nI couldn't help myself. I laughed right in his face. \"The Sandman? Really? Of all the possible fairy tale creatures you choose to hunt, you choose the one that can make you forget that you're chasing him? How do you know that you haven't found him already - and he's just shaken you off?\"\n\n\"W-Well,\" the man stammered, \"I don't think I've forgotten anything. The mermaids weren't a problem, neither were the centaurs, though I had some trouble with the pixies.\" I shook my head and leaned in towards him. \n\n\"I'll let you in on a little secret, Mr. Slayer. You've been here before. How's the daughter, by the way? She's really grown up to be a beautiful girl. We've had this little conversation every single time you've shown up. Do you really want to do this again?\" My teeth gleamed as I rubbed my fingers in his face, faint trickles of golden sand swirling around my fingertips.\n\nHis brow furrowed. \"My daughter? You... you know about her? What else do you know? How long has this been going-\" A thud. He hit the ground, snoring surprisingly loudly for a man his size. I took his diary, tearing out the page with his precious collected information on it and pocketing it. \n\n\"Sweet dreams, Mr. Slayer. I believe the score is one hundred and thirty two to zero, my favor.\" A snap of my fingers and everyone in the room suddenly struggled to recall the events of the past thirty minutes. Another snap and I dissolved into a cloud of sand.\n\n-\n\nTimothy Sellers woke up at 7 AM the next morning, in his own bed. He sat up, stretched, and yawned deeply. That was some of the best sleep he had ever had. Padding downstairs to the kitchen, he kissed his wife on the cheek. \"Morning, Morpheia. What's for breakfast?\"\n\nAN: Wow, my first post here on WP.

{"body": "This was two years ago on my way to see my grandparents. They lived on the other side of the state that I lived in at the time. Me and my friend (who was coming because my grandparents were very fond of him.) Since we we're heading for a twelve hour car ride, we decided to smoke a few blunts to make the car ride a little bit better.\n\n Halfway through our ride, we're pretty baked, I get a call from my grandma. She tells me that her husband had just had a heart attack, and that he is in the hospital. Late in the night, we arrive, and decide to go check in on my grandpa. What I didn't know, is that he had passed away an hour prior of our arrival. It tore me apart. I sat next to him for hours crying and beginning for him to come back to life. But he was gone, he died and I had to accept that. I couldn't stay with my grandmother, I didn't want me and my friend to see her suffer as bad as she did that night. We stayed in a hotel, and left the next morning. \n\n\nWe we're both dead silent for the first two hours of the ride, and then I remembered there was a large bag of pot left in the side of the car. As we're driving, we pull out our pipe and start smoking to ease some of the stress. We're starting to finish the bag as I hear police sirens right behind me. I realized that we we're in possession of marijuana, so I freak out as anyone else would. I didn't think this car ride could have gotten worse. The officer comes up to my window, and looks at our stoned faces. He asks us, \"Have you been smoking marijuana today?\" We say yes, and we have to step out the car. He searches our car and finds the small bit left that we have in the bag. He says it is right under the amount to get us arrested. I sigh with relief, but he mentions that we're going to get a ticket for possession. I, not having much money, ask him how much the ticket would be. He looks at me and says \"About 3.50\" I look up and that's when I realize that he was an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "When I was thirteen years old, a girl that I liked and I had decided it would be a good idea to smoke a little bit of weed. She had an older brother who babysat her quite a bit, seeing as how her parents were never home, and this guy being a laid back stoner, she had learned to roll a joint pretty well just through observation and a little bit of practise. In any case, we had a mutual friend who was a year above us and managed to hook us up with some weed because her brother despite all his other misgivings and amorality wouldn't sell his little sister weed (although she tried).\n\nWe went back to mine, she rolled a fatty, and we started at it. This was on a Friday after school, I had a set of keys to my own house, and my parents weren't to be back until at least seven o' clock at the earliest, traffic and job willing, which they never were. It just so turned out that it was a half-day at work; the boss was getting married, there was a party the next day; no one could concentrate and so everyone was let go early through sheer goodwill.\n\nThat's how my mom ended up walking into my room after suspecting smelling something, her curiosity already piqued by the music blaring out of some shoddy speakers.\n\nShe was mortified, sent the girl home, told her not to come back, told me not to talk to her (because I blamed everything on her, because after all it was her idea), and I was grounded for a couple of months, almost because of a harmless toke.\n\nThey decided they would sit me down, and have a long discussion about the dangers of marijuana, how it altered thinking and how it was a slippery slope to worse things. They also felt it was paramount that they were approachable, understanding, and posited only the most salient points in such a way that I would trust their judgement. And they felt the best way to do that was to seem that they knew where I was coming from and had the same temptations when they were my age, that they were just like me. And that's how I found out my mom had once tried smoking crack when she was in college, and dad had just flat out been hooked on amphetamines.\n\nNeedless to say that was more information than I ever needed. And when I told it to the girl that I liked, because obviously I'm going to tell her, she burst out laughing. And replied that her brother popped a few amphetamines from time to time. And she could probably swipe a few of his.\n\nSo a couple of weeks later, on a Saturday where I told my parents I was going to visit a friend and stay over at his house, and he would totally cover for me, I instead visited her house because her parents were all but absent all the time anyway and her brother was staying at his girlfriend's house because apparently he really needed to and it was important (I didn't question the logic).\n\nI really didn't question the logic or decision making that led up to the point where I had a couple of this little green pills in my hand, what had made me decide it was okay. But my dad, in trying to seem like a cool approachable guy, had somehow made it seem not necessarily okay, but not such a big deal either.\n\nWe popped a few and sat back, and slowly and yet all at once there was a feeling, a rush, an ephemeral excitement that rose on the skin and turned everything to electricity. I wanted to stand up and move about, to jog on the spot, but my movements became lethargic and stilted, like I was walking underwater. It was unnerving, and horrible and I felt sick and I realised I might have made a mistake. I started freaking out the experience wasn't a pleasant one and I called my parents to come pick me up. Eventually, my parents found us again, fucked out of our heads, and were needless to say horrified. I thought I was calm and collected at the time, but apparently I was dazed, and talking gibberish. They were screaming something at me, but I'm not sure what, and that was the closest my parents came to hitting me.\n\nThey turned to the girl, and asked for her parents number so they could pick her up. She said it was no use, which it was, and that her brother, the only dependent guy, was off getting his dick wet somewhere, which he was, and that she was stuck here until tomorrow, (because this really wasn't well planned out), because that's the soonest anyone could come get her, unless my parents were okay with letting her hopped little mind roam around her house on its own, and apparently they weren't. So she asked for a cab, and said they can let her on her way to an uncle's house, who was pretty cool and wouldn't mind looking after her. They said ok, and asked her what she needed, and she turned to me and said she needed tree-fiddy. That's when I realised that she wasn't the cute girl who sat across from me in history class, she was in fact an eight story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I said 'get out of here you goddamn loch ness monster', but she was unrelenting, and she swung that giant neck--which admittedly in hindsight was a bit of a giveaway--in protest and was adamant that she wouldn't leave. Mom gave her a dollar, and I said not to, but she did thinking it would leave. Of course it wouldn't, it would just keep harassing us. Eventually we managed to distract it with claims of some tall abundant foliage with which to satiate her giant Paleolithic belly.

{"body": "Ah finally I get to tell this story! It was a cloudy night and I decided to take a road trip by myself to one of the fields right out of town. It was an abandoned field but yet had some nice maze crops. So I park my car, turn on the radio, and lay ontop of the hood of my car. It was so chill and relaxing, I had never felt so out of mind and calm. Every about 2 minutes my radio would give out static and get intrerrupted and then go back to normal. It happened like 4 or 5 times but I didn't think much of it and continued relaxing throughout the night. After about an hour the static goes crazy and doesn't adjust back. So I get back into my car and change the station but all the stations were giving the same static. I pull out my phone and there's no signal even though when I first arrived it had a full bar. Now I'm not a superstitious person so I just ignore everything and get back ontop of the hood. Now this is where it gets weird. I start hearing noises as if something is crawling towards me or something. I look around and there's nothing. Suddenly I see some flash lights turn on through the crops and I started shitting myself. I was convinced that I will be anal probed that night. I started staring real close into the light expecting to see an alien when all of the sudden the same thing that crawled a few minutes back crawled up behind me and tapped my shoulder. Before turning around, I gulped and prepared myself to see the alien. I turn around and this creature is looking me straight in the face. I jump back and scream \"what do you want?!\" and it said \"I need bout tree fiddy\". Well it was about this time I noticed that this alien was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era! I said \"I ain't giving you no treefiddy you goddam Loch Ness monster!

How?\n\nA few years ago I was doing my daily jog towards the city and back a few years ago I always went the short route, this is my story of me switching from the short route to the long route. So I was jogging and I had the sudden urge to go to the long route, I jog a bit longer than usual since I took the long route and I was kind of upset with myself because I was very tired.\n\nHowever, as I was nearing the end of the highway about to enter the city a BEAUTIFUL girl stops by me and says \"Hey, do you need a ride?\" I didn't really need a ride obvious but I was hoping that maybe I could get lucky with said girl, the only problem is is that since I had taken the longer route I was sweating more profusely and was a very disgusting human being.\n\nI get in, we talk a bit and asks if I want to go over to her place.. Well fuck yes I want to go over to her place! She drives us over there and I expect us to get out and small talk a bit, but nope, right when she stops the car in front of her house she tells me that she has a fetish for sweaty men (Really weird, I know), and so we start kissing a bit, after awhile we go inside and things really started really heating him, asking me to do things to her that I happily obliged in.\n\nA few hours later we're lying on her bed and I am amazed at my luck and what had just happened, she turns around looks me in the eye and says \"I need something else\", eagerly (I'm expecting a round two) I say \"What?\" and she replies \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was about this time I realized that this girl was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era, that goddamn loch ness monster had tricked me again.\n\nTL;DR: Fuck Nessie, the longer route is always the better route either way though.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407353146", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh man, this post harkens back to my freshman year of highschool, arguably one of the most cringe-worthy times of my life. Its not exactly a sexual act so much as preventing an embarrassing sexual situation. \n\nSo, for some background, I'm not sure if this is a late bloomer thing or not but puberty was barely setting in for me at the time and anything that was even remotely female looking could give me a hard on.\n\nThat year I signed up for a gym membership at a place not to far away from school to get swole and not-so-subtley check out some nice butts and yoga pants there as many other young teenage boys did. Unfortunately, my penis had a tendency of making itself known very suddenly, if you catch my drift and consequently I'd have to quickly shove my hands in my pants and re-position it to avoid any unseemly obvious bulges. \n \nAnyway, there was this one girl, I'll call her Adrie since that was her name, that also attended my school and as it happened went to the same gym as mine. She and I had always had a fairly decent friendship, I was a talkative smart-ass in most of my classes, who pretty much just liked the attention and she really liked my sense of humor. So naturally, when I saw her at the gym we started talking. \n\nAdrie was an insanely pretty 7 or 8 (although at the time I probably would have rated her a perfect 10) with long, dark brown hair with highlights of caramel scattered in-between like a melted candy bar flowing down a piece of paper. Her hip to waist ratio was an amazing hourglass with just a bit of meat on the thighs and stomach to make her not look like a twig, with a nice C-cup chest as a bonus. All that and an evenly hazelnut tan skin was much more than enough to make young me go absolutely crazy for her. \n\nAt first though, believe it or not, things were pretty platonic between us. We'd be workout partners and occasionally meet up for homework sessions since we'd shared some classes that year. But as kids our age often do, we developed feelings for each other. It was one of those things where I liked her and she liked me but we didn't know we liked each other and were too afraid to say anything.\n\nOne day, we had just finished our workouts and were outside the gym about to go grab some boba drinks a couple blocks down. This was close to the end of the school year and I knew that anything could happen over the summer so I mustered up the balls and was going to tell her about my feelings at the drink place. As we were about to head out, she turns and says she forgot to say bye to a friend and is going to run back in real quick to do so before we go. I said sure, no problem, it wasnt a big deal. But oh boy as she turned around in those tight spandex her posterior swayed side to side as she walked with such grace, that proved to be an instant bonified boner baker for me.\n\nJust my luck, that instant she turned back around, remembering that her friend had already left, and sees me with my hands shoved in my gym shorts, fumbling with my dick to get it into a non-noticable position until the erection died down. At this point, I was like, oh shit oh shit oh shit what do i do. So I decided to man up, and tell her to disregard that and come with me to grab some boba drinks because I have something important to tell her. Now by some miracle she said fine and what followed was one of the quietest and most awkward 10 minute walks I've ever had. \n\nOnce we got to the place I promptly and repeatedly apologized for what she saw and came out with how beautiful and amazing I thought she was, and how I'd like to be in a relationship with her. If I were her, after seeing some guy with his hands down his pants and a raging erection in the ungraceful way she saw me, I'd bolt the hell out of there since the dude was an obvious creep.\n\nBut then I was reaffirmed why I had taken a liking to her. She gave me this smile, her perfect white teeth, and a glint of laughter and amusement in her deep, brown eyes. Straight out of some fucking movie she told me how she had liked me as well. I honestly could not believe what was happening, this was some real sappy teen romance movie shit. \n\nRelieved, I sat back in my chair and apologized once more. Then I asked if I could get her a drink like we intended. Now, I had no idea what she wanted and we usually pay for our own drinks/meals since we had just been friends. But given the circumstances I offered to pay for her. Inquiring how much money I needed, she responded \"Imma need bout tree fiddy.\"  It was at this moment that this whole time I realized I've been talking to an 8 story tall crustacean from the the protozoic era. \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy, Loch Ness monster\" I told her. But I still bought the drink anyway\n\nBut yeah, thats what happened. We ended up dating for close to a year, and split things off when we decided it was better for us to remain friends. I still talk to her occasionally to this day, although she has since stopped going to the gym. I miss that booty.\n\n**TL;DR** **Pre-pubescent surprise erections got me in a relationship**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407362946", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

The woman in front of me called the cops panicking because she thought I was following her and going to rape and murder her. \n\nThe cop has his gun drawn and makes me drop my keys out of the window and then get out and walk backwards and lay on the ground. It was a clusterfuck because the lady was screaming and cussing at me and the cop was yelling at her to get in her car and yelling at me to keep my hands where he could see them. \n\nHe cuffs me and searches me. I keep telling him to look at my license while he is asking me why I'm following the woman. The only answer he gets is to look at my license. He finally looks at it while the woman is still standing there yelling at me and calling me a rapist and a pervert. The wife was coming down to see what was going on. I wish she would have got a photo or video of it. \n\nThe cop looks at my license and the mailbox we are a few feet away from. He looks like someone just told him his kids had been found dead. He tells me I shouldn't follow people and trying to save face for going overboard. Now he wants to search my vehicle. I tell him to get a warrant or get fucked. I told him he could uncuff me, apologize, and let me go home or we could get his supervisor out here to see how bad he fucked up. I guess he realized how much shit his sheriffs dept buddies would give him and he uncuffed me, apologized, and let me go. \n\nThe woman is losing her mind. She is screaming at the cop he is letting a murdering rapist go. One thing I didn't mention until now on purpose. This woman looked like Honey Boo Boo's momma June, except with dark hair.

Don't rape me while I go get my mail. That deputy isn't with the sheriffs dept anymore. He got in trouble one too many times for artificially escalating things. It seems that he was scared as shit every time he pulled someone over and so he acted like everyone was an escaped cop killer out to get him.

{"body": "The age I was when I had my first crush was about 10 years old. It was a girl named Lilly. Lilly was brown haired, green eyed, and was a little tall for our age. I don't know why, but I liked that she was tall. Lilly was very smart, she had almost all advanced grades, only some proficients (this was back in elementary, so they had minimal, basic, proficient, and advanced instead of A B C D and F) and she was in student council. To try and get her to like me, I attempted to smarten myself up, unfortunately, that didn't work. So instead I joined student council and sat next to her during my first meeting.\n\n\n\nRight before the meeting started I tried to talk to her, but I couldn't think of anything to say. So the meeting started without me being able to really get her to her to talk to me. During the meeting we talked about normal things, it was so long ago that I don't remember too many details, but I do remember that we were talking about a fundraiser the school was having. It was a cookie dough sale, cause who doesn't love cookies. \n\n\n\nEvery time they were talking about other things, Lilly would raise her hand and she had great ideas everytime. She even suggested the great idea of a school store (we didn't have one at that time, don't know how many schools had one). She could have been leading the council with absolutely no help of adults, and it probably would have done even better. So the council went on talking about more ideas and such, but I wasn't paying attention, I was looking at Lilly. At the end they told everyone that they would give out cookie dough order forms next week.\n\n\n\nEveryone was leaving to go home, so I tried to talk to Lilly again, and words actually came out those time. I ended up walking home with her, and we talked the whole time. She was a lot more interesting than I had previously thought. She sometimes volunteered with her mom at an animal shelter in the neighboring city. Lilly was an over all amazing girl, and i would be lucky if she would end up even liking me a little. \n\n\n\nFor the next couple days me and her talked a whole bunch, we were becoming good friends. I learned alot about her in those couple days, more than most people learn about their friends in a month. She had a rough child hood, almost all her family was dead, then her parents died in a car crash. She was lucky she was adopted and not just stuck in the system. Her adoptive parents were really into aquatic animals and she loved spending time in water. Lilly was even lucky enough to have an I ground pool in her backyard!\n\n\n\nI was able to get a seat next to her again at the next council meeting, it was about 2 months after my first meeting, and they talked about the sales from the cookie dough fundraiser. They sold a lot more than they expected so there was no need for another fundraiser for a while. There was a new kid who joined council and was introduced to us, his name was Donovan. \n\n\n\nDonovan had become Lilly and me's new friend, and unfortunately she had started liking Donovan more than me. Now that i think back, Donovan was a better kid than me, so I don't exactly blame her for liking him, but I was angry at the time.\n\n\n\n\nDonovan and Lilly were so close to dating that I essentially was a third wheel. Lucky me, Donovan's dad got a great new job in a different state, so he moved away. It was back to me and Lilly, and it was obvious she had started to like me. We spent alot more time together and a lot of times she had gotten really close to me. I eventually got to date her, I even got my very first kiss from her!\n\n\n\nYou may have experienced a something similar, but here is what completely sets mine apart from all others. While I was at her house, we were watching a movie, this was during the two of us dating. I had leaned in for a kiss, but before she kissed me, she said she needed something. When I asked what she needed, Lilly told me to read the first letter of each paragraph , and it was about then that I realized that Lilly was a 5 story crustacean from the Paleolithic era!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407388520", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Reddit posts, believe it or not. I first discovered Reddit at a critical time in my life, about three years ago as a matter of fact. I was in High School, and I had been seeing what I believed to be my high school sweetheart. She was beautiful, long, jet-black hair, a slender physique, but was taller than most girls, and the face of an angel. She had a slight \"scene\" appearance, but nothing off-putting. She loved Katy Perry, whom she admired for her success and positive attitude, and aspired to be just like her. We were young, and would take long walks together and talk forever. Time was fleeting when we were together, and many starlit nights we would sneak out and own the night. We would do everything from make love to causing a ruckus by pulling pranks, to just getting McDonald's together. We were sneaking out almost every night, neglecting our responsibilities, but what did it matter? we had each other. One summer night, she wasn't at the usual meet-up spot. She was never late, and her walk wasn't too far down the road, a 10 minute walk maybe? I waited for fifteen minutes, which seemed to last forever. At this point in my young life, I smoked cigarettes, and noticed I had but one left. Cigarettes come in packs of twenty-two, and I had always shared one with my love as we walked around. It was the only time I had ever smoked, as I really didn't like the taste or smell too much. I decided to trace the path she took to our meeting place, walking slowly with an ear out just in case she had been attacked. The sky lacked a single star, and the moon was dim behind a dark, cloudy sky. The air was wet from the previous days rain. As I inched ever closer to her town-home, I noticed the lights still on, shining through a less-than-sparkling window, I could hear shouting on the inside. As I peered in, I noticed a dirty, glass pipe on the worn kitchen table, and a woman hysterically screaming at my love. In the five minutes I was watching, this woman had screamed red-faced, about everything from the laundry to accusations of prostitution, ridiculing my sweet with taunts, mockery, and promises of personal failure. It was a truly heart-breaking sight that wells up tears in my eyes even as I type this. I had never met the mother, as meeting her family was a touchy subject. Her father was a dead-beat and her mother was a drug-addict, but specifics were never made clear to me beyond these details. I couldn't bare to look any further, so I climbed into her bedroom window, and waited, sitting at the foot of her bed. After what felt like forever, my love finally came in, tearing up. She started for the window at first until she saw me from her peripherals and entered my soothing embrace. I cradled her in my arms, her hair was, for the most part, beautifully maintained, but a little messy from the fuss of the fight. Her make-up smeared from her tears, I kissed her, and then helped her out the window to make our escape. We walked down the road, away from the suburbs and closer to the city. I was confused, as the city was a hot spot for crime and police patrols that would surely catch us. City cops actually did work on a regular basis, and were in top condition to give chase on foot. I had stopped her and asked her what she was doing, and she announced she was going to run away. She had planned to take the bus-line as far as she could go, and just get away from the horrible tutelage of the household which she lived. While her plan was heavily flawed, I supported her out of youthful naivete. She had naturally forgotten her purse from the emotional stress of the fight, but I had my wallet on me, and more than enough money to spare. My job at McDonald's didn't pay much, but without obligations I was free to dispose of my income as I saw fit. We awaited the SARTA (Stark County Regional Transit Authority) bus. We sat the bench, the sky clear of clouds, the crisp air passing us by ever so gently smoking that last, lucky cigarette together, her head on my shoulder. She talked about how she would come back when she made it big. Her plans were Westbound, with California dreams and a twinkle in her eyes that captured the very essence of my being as if freezing us in time. She had no money for bus fare, and I had asked her how much she needed to board. As the bus rolled up to take on my starlet, she said \"Imma need about tree fiddy\". It was at that moment I realized that my sweet was a 5 story tall reptile with razor sharp teeth and fins from the Mesozoic period.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407432061", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This happened when I was in high school, so roughly 8 years, or so, ago. My buddies and I were planning on going on a camping trip in the Rocky Mountains to go do some hunting/fishing/beer drinking stuff. Classic \"dude trip\", or at least it was supposed to be.\n\nThe plan was to stay there for 5 days, camping 4 nights and then leaving on the 5th day. We got there on a Sunday afternoon and set up camp relatively close to the Colorado River up in the mountains. We promptly took out a bunch of coolers out of the car and cracked the ceremonial \"let's do this shit\" first beer. We all got fairly blitzed within the first few hours, because come on.... we were high school dudes on a dude trip. We were looking forward to this moment for months. Now, a bunch of high school dudes being drunk up in the mountains fairly close to a river seems to be a bad idea, and well... it was.\n\nAs it got darker we all decided it was time to get a campfire going because it gets pretty cold in the mountains, and the cold coming off of the river is very noticeable. It WOULD have been a good idea to collect some wood before nightfall, but as I previously mentioned we were all focused on getting tanked rather than focus on survival. Myself and one other buddy volunteered to venture off to collect a stock pile of firewood to be used the first night to help keep us all warm. We grab a flashlight and start to head out to get the wood.\n\nAbout half a mile into our walk, my buddy and I are a little spooked out because we can't see much other than what our flashlight is pointed at and we are still pretty faded from the morning escapades. We start to hear EVERY little sound that the mountains had to offer and quickly point the light in the direction of the noise. Then there was a noise that is very different from the rest. There is a noise that everyone can recognize as footsteps on piles of sticks. At first we think it's probably just our buddies trying to mess with us, but no matter how hard we tried to catch them with the light, we couldn't. We could see a shadow walking to our side and heard the footsteps, but as soon as the light hit them it was gone. \n\nWe decided to stick close to the river so we could easily follow our trail back to our campsite, so the noises were being drowned out by the sound of the water. The footsteps, however, kept getting louder and louder. We started to head back to the campsite to tell our friends to stop messing with us. We walked about 20 times faster than before because the steps started walking back in our direction with us. \n\nUp ahead we could see the tents, but did not see any of our friends. We thought for SURE that they were definitely messing with us at this point, but then all of a sudden we saw their flashlight walking back to the campsite as well from the opposite direction. No where near where we had been walking before. \n\nSuddenly, we heard the footsteps grow louder and louder behind us again and then suddenly this shadowy figure emerged from the river. We heard a faint voice whisper this faint sound .... \"How bout Tree Fiddy\" It was at THAT point that we realized that the shadowy figure following us was none other than that there damn loch ness monster.

{"body": "Actually this is quite popular among women in rural areas of South America. Although it isnt widely spoken about, it is fairly common. Although the species of mouse does not have a scientific name, It is generally called \" ratón limpia coño\". This mouse carries a certain component in its fur that helps thoroughly clean the inside of the vagina. It also helps prevent common infections such as Urinary tract infections and Yeast infections. Mainly, the procedures consist of soaking the mouse in water and then allowing it to crawl inside and outside of the vagina. This should only take around 10-15 minutes, afterward the mouse should be either disposed, given back to the supplier, or thoroughly washed. If not washed, the collected dirt on the mouse can make it very sick and result in the mouse dying. Often times, the suppliers are experts in cleaning the mouse and breeding it afterward. This mouse ranges from 40-50 pesos which converts to tree fiddy and can be found on Thelochnessmonster.bullshit  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407487278", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

She had called our office and informed them I had forgot paperwork so she needed to know where to mail it then drove all night to get there.\n\nOh and then the kicker, after dating for about 6 months(yes Im an idiot) I find out that what I thought was her ex was not really her ex, that she had been going on conjugal visits to see him every other weekend. Thats right, he was locked up in prison on meth production charges and was due to get out in a few months after being there for 5 years but it wasnt a problem since she was going to divorce him before he got out. The conjugal visits arent an issue since that was just sex and I should understand since men need a release......\n\nRiiiiiiiiiight, well I broke it off right then and let her rant scream and throw shit at me in the middle of a restaurant I took her to break the news. Cops show up she calms down and leaves, or so I thought. She waits, follows me back to our hotel then jumps on me in the room saying \"she knows I cant give up her pussy\", like its gold or something. Call the cops back throw her out, change hotels, and leave the area, all done right?\n\nNo, one night back in Georgia I get a phone call from a strange out of state number, then someone knocking on my door.......have the guy living there with me answer it and its some guy she had hired locally to find me. End up calling the cops and get him to tell the story with the entire back story, luckily relatives are in law enforcement so I get all this on record. Then, I come home the next day and see a strange car on the road, walk inside and see beer sitting on my table with the note \"I will always deliver\" go up stairs and this crazy bitch is in one of the beds half naked with roses. I just shake my head, tell her to get the fuck out and go home before I call the cops, she grabs my crotch and tells me she knows I really want her.....\n\nFreaked out I just call my uncle while I sit outside in the car and see her staring at me from the window, he gets there, I tell him whats going on so he comes inside with me. He tells her that she does not have permission to be in the house and must leave now or be arrested. She starts crying and I start to walk over to her, he stops me and tells me to come outside where he says that I should leave, he will make sure she leaves since shes trying to get me to ask her to stay.\n\nAfter two restraining orders filed in Georgia and Missouri the late night calls/threats stop after around 4 years, the bitch even had her ex calling me saying, \"you can't treat the Loch Ness monster like that and that I owed her tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407516120", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": -15, "controversiality": 0}

But the fact that we can verify the identities of the men who wrote the bible and corroborated the stories of the bible does not make them true. There is no evidence of the events that happened in the bible, say for example the resurrection, the crucifixion, etc. There are a very small number of sources known to have been real people who wrote about the same event, but there are equally as many people alive today who claim to see the Loch Ness Monster, fairies, and evidence. Don't get me wrong I'm not attempting to invalidate all of history. Just acknowledging how little information there is for such a lofty claim to follow from it.\n\nBut I would maintain once again that even if there existed direct evidence of the bones of Jesus with holes exactly where they should have been for him to be crucified, and a crown of thrones around his head, you would still have all your work ahead of you to attempt to take that evidence and purport that it supports the existence of God. All of that evidence reasonably could have been created by entirely earthly means, no divine needed. I'm of course not talking about the actual resurrection (seeing Jesus after he rose from the dead) but I don't think it's possible that we could find anything other than a few written corroborations that it happened, which, I would hope isn't enough proof for you to base the existence of an all powerful, all knowing, benevolent being.\n\n&gt;Here is a man worth following. He has earned my trust. So when he claims to be God, and demonstrates power in line with what we'd predict from a god, and confirms the entire Old Testament through his own miracles, I believe him.\n\nEven if Jesus was the best man ever to grace the species, does his greatness inherently come with an obligation to believe him if he says things that are not supported by any evidence?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407566762", "subreddit": "AskAChristian", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

After the paw is soaked, he slides it inside of the female dog to get any sort of unnecessary dirt/grime out. This also helps both animals grow a bond between each other. After the procedure is done, the dogs mate as usual. Many dog owners also have this done in pet shops. It cost around 40 pesos which converts into tree fiddy.

That night happened to be the main director's birthday, and my friend wanted to take me as her date to the bash they were throwing.\n\nWe got to this party, and it was nuts.

Most places you go the meat is the same. You'll occasionally find some exceptional pulled pork but the real difference (and BBQ flavor) is in the sauce. For example, a Memphis/Mississippi sauce is usually thicker and sweeter. A Carolina sauce is more vinegary and less thick. My personal favorite is a Kentucky which is a nice blend of the two. Not too thick, not too sweet, and doesn't taste like it came of a science fair volcano. If you want a quick BBQ sauce at home, add balsamic vinegar, mustard, and ketchup as your base. Add chili powder/ other hot spices as you see fit. Same goes with brown sugar. You can do this in any ratio and you'll get a different sauce with a different area of origin.

{"body": "I did massage work for a while when I was in college and I only have ONE to die for moment in my short but terrible massaging career\n\nI was the typical college student, dead broke and living on Ramen so I never had the privilage of turning down customers. Fat, old, hairy, wrinkly it did not matter they pay I massage. once in a blue moon I would get an Ok looking lady, but they usually kept as much clothes on as possible or flat out refused to undress.\n\nWell, this one time I met this forgein exchange student from Europe in class and she was suprised to hear what I do, being the skeevy little fuck I was I invited her to my dorm for a \"demo\".\n\nI honeslty expected her to be a  flake but when she actually told me \"let's go\" right after class I felt my stomach twist with anticipation and anxiety. Fast forward a long quite walk and we are in my dorm. I tell her that people normally undress for the massage but she did not have to. but before I could even finish her shirt was off and her jeans were on their way out too, I mean she did not give a shit. Northern Europeans know how to party.\n\nShe layed down on my make shift table and I just stood there like an idiot starring for a good 5 seconds. I realized how stupid I must look so I got to work on her lower back. I was to afraid to move from the area in fear that I would scare her away. Ever so carefully I shifted upward millimeter by millimeter slowly working my way up her beautiful toned back. I could feel her back muscles tightenig and loosening as I worked my way around, reminding myself every second not to blow it. Every couple of seconds I could hear a barely audible moan. It was so hard for me to not let my boner rub on her arm as I reached over to the other side. I could feel heat radiating from her upper back only matched by the intense heat flarring up all over my body just wondering if this was really happening. Then just as slightly as I made way up I mentally prepared myself for the harder journey going down. This girl had such natural curve on her body I had no idea what the hell I was doing. I made my way slowly to her lower back again. After what seemed an eternity I was able to place my thumbs on the dimples right above this heavenly woman's glorious round behind. It was do or die, If I waited any longer I was going to bust both my nuts literally, I was going to go for the grab and wtvr happens, happens. Im pretty sure she sensed this because at that very moment she giggled and propd herself up and with a glance back and a smile she said \"If you do that I'M going to have to have to charge YOU\". JACKPOT. \n\nAt the time I was under the impression that I was a quirky bastard so I asked \"How much\" in the sexiest non caring way I could. She straightened out and in a hushed voice she whispered \"Tree Fiddy\" \n\nIt was at this point that I realised that she was actually a 30 foot tall monster from the palaeolithic era. \n\nEDIT: Becasue Spelling\n\n*EDIT EDIT: becasu still can't spell and word", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407637734", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 880, "controversiality": 0}

She was my girlfriend, but was majoring in Biology. So we started to walk across campus to her dorm. When we were about halfway there, my roomate was complaining that he was hungry. So he called the local Jimmy John's place. After he finished his order, he asked the guy why he thought humans had hands. \"I don't know sir, but my hands can do some crazy things.\" \"I didn't need to know that, just bring me my order,\" my roommate said before he hung up. We reached Tina's room, and I knocked on the door, but nobody answered. There was a note on the door that read, *Do not disturb.* I could hear moaning coming from the room. That was not a good sign. I started pounding on her door and yelling her name. Still no response other than the moans. So I asked my roommate to help break the door, after several attempts, we finally broke in.

{"body": "This question reminds me of a conversation I had with my friend the other day, while we were out drinking beer and enjoying ourselves. Since the individual was aware of whom I had a crush on, he started jesting and said if I had ever imagined of having a more physical relationship with her. I obviously said yes. When a follow-up was given to describe the imagination, I stated that I cannot. Since this friend was a man of great intellect he obviously questioned this apparently contradicting statement- if I have seen this person and had obviously visualised having sex with her, why was it not possible for me to describe what it would look like? After regaining composure, I answered that it was due to the fact that, unfortunately, I had never yet had a relationship of such nature; thus, the concept of sex by itself was based on what I had yet heard or imagined, not directly experienced. Thus any imagination I had about the person was indescribable, due to its conceptual nature.\n\nThis is not the case with this question; rather, as it is the opposite, it would be easier to answer the question. This is due to the fact that I am to describe a concept with which I am to *visualise* a *conceptual intercourse* with.

{"body": "I had by 2009 gone to an English \"academy\"(hagwon, whatever you call it) for 6 years. In those times I have witnessed multiple excellent methods of cheating the vocabulary test.\n\nThe vocabulary test by itself was well-renowned to be a pain in the ass. Not only were you supposed to memorise 100 English words each class, you had to stay after if the score was below 90%. Not only that, but students were forced to rewrite all the 100 words 20 times. My friends and I, stressed and frustrated of always having to stay almost until 10 to finish the task, set to work on how we would possibly evade the system. Then one of us had an idea. We agreed that to be an epic and viable plan, and set to work on the following weekend.\n\nThe next test was as usual. We received our test, the teacher proceeded to tease us by holding up the answer sheet and flap it in our faces, and started the timer. 15 minutes were given, 5 extra if begged. Usually we would need that 5 minutes to at least scratch some indecipherable vocabulary. But this time was to be different. We had a solid plan that was going to work.\n\nOur academy was on the 5th floor of our building. The first floor had a huge electronics store, with smaller stores for familymart and a pub. Right across the building was an even larger hospital, reaching beyond twenty stories. This hospital was visible through the window directly in front of the classroom. That was where our plan was displayed.\n\nBeyond all expectations, we had printed out and made a huge vocabulary list of all the words that we had to memorise. The background colour of the printed poster was white-same as the hospital. The font of the words written was also same with those written over the hospital walls. If one didn't look carefully enough, it wasn't noticeable.\n\nDue to the atmosphere of desperation prevalent within the classroom during testing periods, students were only allowed to stare at the floor, ceiling or outside during the test. Thus we were not the only ones to utilise this asset that \"suddenly\" appeared. There were small gasps of shock, but it took half a second for anyone to fully grasp the situation and regain composure.\n\nHowever not all was to pass. There was one student who was a blatant sycophant, one who was seen by all the other kids with disgust and hatred. He wore rounded specs that were too small for his face, and had a smile that revealed his teeth and made everyone shudder. He was sitting with the window behind his back, and was not aware of the current situation.\n\nBut he began to have an idea of what was going on when everyone was just staring out the window. (The teacher was busy on her cellphone, unaware of what was going on around her.) He looked up and saw all eyes upon him. He, finding our actions instantly suspicious, tried to raise his hand to gain the teacher's attention while turning his eyes towards the window.\n\nIt was at that moment when my friend reacted heroically and bravely. He pssted at the Sycophant, and pointed at his cheek. He started rubbing the cheek as if to mean he had something awful on his face. All hesitated for a second, wondering of the Sycophant will buy the trick. He did. Having a face filled with acme, it was not hard to persuade him that one of them had popped. And while he excused himself and went to the restroom to cleanse his face, everyone sighed in relief and finished their test.\n\nThe test was finally done, everyone was happy. But trouble did not come the way anyone would have expected. One nosy old man, around 50 years of age, was walking down the street when he noticed the vocabulary words. Finding this instantly questionable, he looked to the opposite side of the road and saw our English academy. Then, after coming up the elevator, he grabbed the academy Head (a 40-year old woman) and showed her in full view what he saw.\n\nWe had already left at the time; being 8 in the evening, the sun was already down and it was not easy to decipher what was written on the poster. When the Head's eyes became used to the dark and began to see what we had done, she is said to have opened her mouth and yelled \"tree fiddy!\"*\n\n(*:a swearword but more or less the same.)\n\nmore to come- or no?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407674350", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

On my continent, Bismarck was to my west, Nebby to my south and east, and Shaka to the north, but much farther away. Bismarck and Shaka were pretty much non-factors, but Nebby had been doing well for the entire game.

How did you enjoy [reading the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/faq#wiki_do_atheists_believe_in_ghosts_.28or_other_supernatural_things.29.3F)?\n\n----\n\n###Do atheists believe in Ghosts (Or other supernatural things)?\n\nSome atheists do. Many do not. Atheism only describes a person's lack of belief in deities. Everything else is negotiable. Being an atheist does not necessarily make one a materialist, or a rationalist, or a humanist, or an empiricist, or a positivist, or a skeptic- it's just that being those things tends to make one an atheist.\n\nYou can still be an atheist and believe completely uncritically in ghosts, reincarnation, souls, Heaven, Hell, zombies, wizards, unicorns, leprechauns, Bigfoot, spells, curses, auras, divination, astrology, homeopathy, crystal healing, psychics, Ouija boards, alien abductions, UFOs, astral projections, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster, The Lost City of Atlantis, and honest used car salesmen.\n\nMost of those you'll find here are skeptics, however, so they would apply the same skepticism they use with the god question to the paranormal as well. Given the complete lack of any evidence of ghosts, unicorns, or $SUPERNATURAL_THING, don't expect them to believe in it.\n\nIf you have any evidence that they exist, you're welcome to submit it for peer review and collect your Nobel Prize, or at least contact James Randi so he can give you $1,000,000.

{"body": "And here we go. \n\n\n\n\n10 months ago I met a girl on OkCupid that shared a lot of the same interests as me. I like a good looking girl but when it gets down to it I'm more interested in a girl that likes to do what I do. (hiking, fishing, running, gym, gaming, splosions, cool stuff.) \n\n\nSo when, lets call her Alice, sent me a message I was pretty stoked to find out that she was not only in the same area, San Diego, she pretty much did everything I enjoyed and was fairly attractive as well. Lots of pictures of her out on boats, in hiking gear, basket full of XBone games at BestBuy, going to the gym etc etc. \n\n\n\n\nWe decided to keep it reserved to email and IM until we got to know each other a little bit better. She'd send me a message saying she just got done with a crazy workout or just got back from a great fishing charter, and I would keep her up to date on my antics. This went on for about 3 weeks, chatting it up 2 or 3 times a week. Each time would last for about an hour and it seemed like we really hit it off.\n\n\n\n\nOne day, after returning from a group trail run, I logged on and asked her what she had been up to. To which she replied *\"I just got back from a hike at South Fortuna!\"* This struck me as odd because that was where I had just done the group run. It was me, 2 buddies and 3 acquaintances, all guys total sausage fest, no women within miles. The trail was empty that day except for us. \n\n\n\nWhat time did you go I asked? Thinking maybe she went early or later. She said around 11am. Which was very weird to me because that was when we were getting back from our run. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point I feel like walls are beginning to come down, I've always been a little untrusting of people due to life circumstances but I was really hoping for this one. I decided to take the risk and set up a meeting, maybe at least I would expose her lies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh that's cool, I was there today but didn't see you. Listen I know we've only been chatting for a few weeks but would you like to meet up?\" \n\n\n\n\nNo response for about 10 minutes. I knew it, she was a liar, probably some fudge round that took pictures of her skinny friend. But then. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not comfortable meeting people from the internet so quickly, but I think we can meet, can I bring a friend?\"\n\n\n\n\nReally? was this really going to happen? So we agreed to meet a coffee shop/bar near the beach at 7. I was excited but had this rock sitting in my gut that said, *don't be surprised when she comes in on a rascal mobility scooter.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI get washed up, put on way too much cologne, wash it off, spray a little bit more on, then head out.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I walk into the bar I see her sitting there. Alice, or who I think is Alice, blonde hair, tan skin, sun dress. Across from her is another blonde girl dressed more or less the same, but easily 10 to 15 pounds heavier.\nAs I walk in skinny Alice sees me and waves. Slightly heavier Alice then turns, her face immediately goes red. I knew it, son of a bitch I knew it. \n\n\n\n\nRemember I said I don't mind if girl isn't super hot, I just want to enjoy the same things. But due to trust issues I really hate it when people lie to me. I walk over and introduce myself. I kind of ignore skinny Alice and look right at heavy Alice. \"Hi, I'm baconmcmasters.\" I reach out my hand and grab heavy Alice's hand and shake it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI turn and look at skinny Alice who has a confused look on her face and I, with all my genius ask, \"And you are?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe sticks out her hand and says, \"I'm Alice, nice to meet you finally.\" \n\n\n\n\nI could feel the blood leave my head. I imagined that I looked like a complete idiot. After some very awkward footwork and trying to make it look like I was too nervous to meet her so I introduced myself to her friend first we all sat down and I ordered us all some coffee. \n\n\n\n\nHeavy Alice who's we'll now call Amber is a friend of Alice's from work. We all keep talking and Alice and I are hitting it off. She get's up and says, \"Excuse my but I'm going to go order myself a drink, Amber, feel free to take off anytime, I think we're okay.\" My heart jumped.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmber winks at me and then leaves. I sit in my chair just not believing my luck when Alice comes back from the bar without her drink. \"Everything okay I ask?\" She looks down at me and says she forgot her wallet and she's gonna need about tree fiddy. That's when I realized Alice was in fact a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era. Long story short I give her a dollar and leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR** Meet a girl who seems to good to be true, turns out she just wants my money.

So anyways new neighbors had just moved in next doors and they had the most beautiful blonde daughter that I have ever seen. So my parents decide to invite them over for dinner to welcome them to the neighborhood. When they come over their daughter and I had the chance of being in private for a few minutes. Nothing happened at that point but I ended up asking her out. So we go out the following night and we end up having a great time. I learn a lot about her and she was quite talkative and we ended up having a lot in common. We talked so much that hours passed like minutes and we ended up staying out till dawn (we didn't go far from our separate homes so the adults didn't really mind). As the sun was rising I looked deep into her eyes and leaned in for the kiss. As our lips were about to touch I feel her checking my pockets. So I ask her \"what are you looking for?\" in a jokingly manner. She looks me straight in the eyes and says \"I need bout tree fiddy\".

I swore after the first date that I was going to marry her, if I could only get the chance. Thankfully, I did get that chance.   \n\nWe dated for a few years, got engaged, and then finally got married. I won't lie; fighting off the near-constant temptation was damn near impossible. Honestly though, I wasn't too concerned about knowing what to do when the moment arrived. Besides the fact that I was studying for a medical-related track (kinesiology) and therefore had to take classes in that type of thing, I'd done a ton of research. I had a pretty good idea of what to do and what not to do. And even if it didn't go as planned at first, that would be expected anyway...it's not like I'd done anything previously. A wrong move would be entirely expected and excusable.   \n\nI don't know how I got through our wedding day. All I could think about was how badly I wanted to lay this beautiful woman down and make sweet love to her...or fuck her, whatever she wanted. Would she want it nice and slow or romantic? Would she want to be ravaged? Would SHE want to take the lead? The possibilities were endless, and my mind was racing overtime.  \n\nFinally, the moment arrived. All by ourselves in a room. It was finally going to happen. I remember everything...the way she moved, the way she smelled, the way that all of those years of built-up sexual tension was finally going to be released in the most glorious moment of our lives. \nShe lay on her back and opened her legs, offering herself to me...nearly begging me to fulfill her greatest earthly desire. I climbed between her legs. I wanted nothing more than to slide right in, to feel that glorious feeling, but I couldn't simply focus on myself. I slid myself against her, not entering, just teasing. She let out a moan that came from the very depths of her being. Not only was she receiving pleasure, but I was the one doing it to her. Then, with a voice that dripped with desire, she gasped, \"Please. I need this.\" \nI smiled coyly at her, wanting to hear her say the words I had always desired to hear. \"What? What do you need?\"   \n\nShe looked up at me and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\" Well, it was around this time I realized that my beautiful bride was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

I had the day off tomorrow, it was the first time I had a day off of work in 10 years.  \n\n I decided that I would celebrate by watching re-runs of Workaholics and The Office. About half-way through my marathon, I got a random craving for chocolate chip cookie dough. The urge was so strong that I had to get up off the couch, go to the store, and buy some. I decided to just drive. It was about 32F out and it was snowing; it was just easier to drive anyway. It took about 5 minutes and I arrived at my local 7/11. I walked in and I immediately went and found some chocolate chip cookie dough. I went and brought it to the cashier to pay for it. He was behind the counter and he was wearing some sort of hoody. Probably some rebellious teenager that was all emo and gothic. I showed him the cookie dough. He just stood there. I asked, \"Hey, are you there, kid?\" He didn't respond. I said, \"HEY! I WANT TO PAY FOR THIS.\" He still didn't respond. I waited for another 20 seconds and then finally he said, \"I'm going to need about tree fiddy.\"  \n\nAnd that was when I realized that the cashier was actually a 50 foot tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.\nThat goddamn Lochness Monster got me again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407811418", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I went to a mostly academic summer camp in NC (I know, nerd alert) but we had this one-week \"Outdoor Adventure\" optional add-on. It was pretty good, we had a week of cave exploration, rock climbing, rafting, and of course camping. That sounds great, except that I was the only 6th grader who opted for the Outdoor Adventure and it was all 8th graders raging with puberty hormones.\n\nOne night we're camping out somewhere along on the Tennessee/Carolina border, and it was awkward as hell because our group had four guys, four girls, plus me the awkward 6th grader. Of course the girls kept coming over to our tent to whisper to the boys and then they'd go over to the girls tent, and at that point I'd pretty much learned to stay out of it and keep my mouth shut but dammit I just wanted some sleep.\n\nProblem was, I had to take a huge piss. I didn't want to deal with the awkwardness of getting in the middle since everyone basically hated having me around anyway so I just held it. And held it. I don't think I've ever held it that long in my life, one of those where it *hurts*...I was just hoping I could fall asleep and not piss myself before I woke up.\n\nEventually I came to the conclusion that there was no way I was going to hold this in until sunrise, so I stumbled out of my tent. The other kids had flashlights that kept going on and off so I headed toward what I thought was the edge of our campsite...boom, the girls' tent hits me in the face. By this point my eyes are turning yellow and I'm losing control of my bladder, but I somehow managed not to piss myself right in front of them as they shined the light on me. Of course I was caught staring directly at their tent with a deer-in-headlights look, so they yelled and called me a little pervert, but at that point I honestly didn't care.\n\nI'm not sure if this is actually medically valid, but I think I held it so long that I was becoming drunk, or at least hung over. Acetaldehyde buildup or something. Anyway, I was feeling pretty deranged not to mention exhausted so I just sort of stumbled the opposite direction. As soon as I got far enough where I thought no one would hear me I let the stream go, most relieving thing ever.\n\nBy that point I had so much momentum and I didn't really stop before taking that piss, so I kept stumbling around in the dark while I was relieving myself. Bad move. Up to that point I had the giggling sounds and the flashlights to guide me back to camp, but by the time I was finally done (it took forever to stop) they had apparently figured out who was making out with whom. Everything was pitch black and silent, and I had no freaking clue where I was.\n\nI was pretty timid and trying not to rock the boat with these 8th graders (who were all probably hitting 2nd base by that point) so I just walked for a while in the direction I thought was back to camp. Is this how I got here? Is that the same tree I felt before? I had no idea. \n\nEventually, I was too exhausted and pretty damned hungry, so I yelled. Yelled out as loud as I could manage in fact, despite being a little dehydrated by that point.\n\nDidn't work.\n\n\"*Shit, shit, shit...*\"\n\nNo one answered, and I had been wandering for a while at that point. Bear in mind that wherever the moon had decided to go that night it wasn't helping me at all. I still remember the gorgeous night sky, but other than that it was pitch black. \n\nI kept going in what I hoped was a straight direction, thinking I'd eventually get somewhere, and it worked but I wish it hadn't. I found my way to one of the smaller highways after about an hour of wandering around stupidly in the dark. A semi-trailer passed by a few minutes later and I waved him down, seemed like my best option. I was scared shitless though - 11 year old boy in camping gear alone on a backwoods highway. Not good.\n\nI got in the cab without even looking, and it wasn't until the door closed that I realized the driver's neck was so long that it went out the driver's side window and back in from the passenger side, and that he wasn't a normal truck driver at all but a 500 foot tall marine reptile from the Cretaceous period. He just stared at me with his huge beady eyes and I said \"Goddamit, what do you want from me monster?\"  He said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407892905", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 1}

I smiled and said okay, and I picked Fox. We played on the pilotwings stage, which I was happy for since I didn't want to play the yellow devil stage. \"Wow!\" he said, \"Fox is really strong!\". I agreed, and said Bowser was a pretty cool character too. The game feels pretty fun, much similar to brawl than melee though. His mom was watching off in the distance. I made sure to go really easy on him, to let him get as many hits in as possible. He wasn't very good, but what do you expect? As I took him down to his last stock, something wasn't right. I looked to my right. It was Ken all along. He whispered in my ear as he DACUS'd, \"Asia never lose\". He proceeded to 4 stock the rest of my lifebar.

I am 35 myself, and I have been looking for a fuck buddy lately, so when I saw the guy my son brought home, I instantly made them cookies in my waitress outfit, since I work as a waitress. He stayed around until dinner, and they were up in my sons room, playing some video game. I'd generally say that I am okay looking, and because of my recent divorce, I have not really had any luck with anyone other than my vibrator, so seeing my sons friend was pretty arousing. I was going upstairs to tell them that dinner was ready, and I opened the door to find them both without their shirts on, laughing their asses off at something in the video game they were playing. I saw my sons friend, let's call him Michael, without shirt, and I knew at that point that I had to do something about it. I caught him looking at me, and I winked at him and told them that dinner was ready. During the dinner, my daughter came running down the stairs, saying that she was going out with some of her new freshman friends, and I was totally OK with that, because I had focus on Michael. Pretty selfish, I know, but I am sure my daughter can handle herself. During dinner, my son had to go to the toilet, so I was alone with Michael at the table. I started flirting a bit with him, and he realized, and began flirting back. Success, I thought. I slyly gave him my number, and as my son came back, Michael had to go home. I started texting a lot with Michael, and after a few nudes we decided to meet up at our home, while my son was out with his girlfriend.\nHe came at around 5:00 PM, and it was pretty hot outside, so I was on the terrace, tanning. He came through the backyard, and caught me tanning naked, and this is where things get a bit kinky.\n\nHe smiled awkwardly and asked if he could sit, and I said that I had no problem with that, since we already were sure what was gonna happen soon. Soon enough, we started kissing and he began to get harder down there. I started to blow him. He was constantly talking about how good it felt, and running his hands through my hair. About 5 minutes later, he said he was about to cum. It was about this time I realized he was about 500 ft tall and from the paleolithic era, and before he came, he looked me right in the eyes and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\"Damnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I said, my dreams crushed.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407913000", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My dad used to live at a farm, which is abandoned nowadays. We still visit the place frequently, because it's a great place to spend the summer. There are two buildings: the farmhouse and the barn. A few years ago we were once again at the farm with my cousins. We were cleaning the barn of all the old, useless trash that was laying around. We had a big bonfire outside and we burned everything we could in it. It was really huge and it kept growing as we fed it with more and more wooden boards, cardboard, wooden boxes etc. We spent the morning cleaning out the first floor of the barn. It was really dirty, with trash laying everywhere. All the rooms with the milk separators, water pumps, boilers and such were filled with old chairs, fertilizer bags, horse shoes, all kinds of tools, basically everything you expect to find at a farm. When we had cleared the first floor, it was almost dark. Eventually we moved up to the second floor. That's where they used to dry and store all the hay for the animals. It is a high floor, almost 6 meters. When my grandparents finally moved away from the farm, they filled the second floor full of stuff, almost more junk than in the first floor. To this day, I don't understand where they found that much thing. Some of it looked like it didn't even belong to a farmhouse. When we started working with the second floor, me and my cousins went up and threw stuff downstairs where the rest picked it up and took it to the bonfire. After a couple of hours, we had finished the job. My cousins went downstairs, but I noticed an old pile of hay in a dark corner. \"Well, might as well check if there is anything behind that hay\", I thought. As I looked behind the pile, I saw the ghost. \"What are you doing?\", it asked. \"Uhh, just cleaning up the place.\" The ghost replied: \"Hey, can I ask you something\" \"Sure\", I said. \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was then that I realized that the ghost was a 120 meter tall monster from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407939346", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I opened my browser and read an entertaining story and I decided not to comment.  A friend walked by and chatted for a few minutes.  At the end of our brief discussion, he mentioned he was going to grab a cookie and a coffee, so he left.  I turned back to my computer and I found a story about an unemployed guy and his friend that decided to drive from Rhode Island to Colorado to try to see a woman one of them had briefly met.  Partway through that story, a student from a lab I was a TA for walked up to me and wanted to know why I took so many points off his lab project.  He explained why he thought I took off excessive points, and said he felt entitled to get a few points back.  I listened to his side, and it sounded reasonable so I asked “how many points do you want back?” He turned to me and said “I’m gunna need abou’ tree fiddy.” Now that’s about the time I realized this student was actually a 5 story tall creature from the Mesozoic era.

There's a character in a religious text.\n\n&gt;and that people say he was the Son of God.

What I am asking for is the evidence that these claims are true.\n\n&gt; You can see in you daily life the impact that God has on those who TRULY believe (there is a massive difference between belief and belief with action).\n\nNo, I can see impact (both positive and negative) of BELIEF in a god (or rather, different gods of different religions). I am not sure if you do not understand the difference between a god and a belief in one, or if you're deliberately trying to confuse the two.\n\n&gt;You will never have physical proof of God's existence.\n\nI asked for evidence. Proof is not the right term. If there's no evidence, why didn't you go ahead and say so, instead of writing all the above?\n\n&gt;He wants people to come to know Him on His terms, so that those who love Him truly love Him.\n\nYou don't know that, since you have no evidence that a god even exists. When you're pretending to know it, you're being dishonest.\n\n&gt;If you knew there was a God, for certain, and you knew that if you didn't do His will, then you'd be destroyed, would you continue to not believe, and live by your own accord?\n\nAgain, you're trying to confuse two issues: belief in a god, and behavior. If I knew for certain that Nessie exists, the question of whether I \"believe\" in it would be a silly one. There would be EVIDENCE. I would know.\n\n&gt;or would you fall to your knees and worship[ the Almighty God of the Universe? You would be, in essence, a slave. Your life would be lived in fear of judgment, and all your actions would not be of your own decision.\n\nLike all those characters in your old testament, and like the characters God/Jesus appeared to in the new one? Were the disciples of Jesus slaves?\n\n&gt;God does not want slaves. He makes His presence known\n\nWe have already seen that you have no evidence for the claim that the god you believe in even exists, so pretending to know this is dishonest.\n\nThank you for demonstrating the dishonesty associated with religious belief.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407963081", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was 3, I had my first mega kebab, (this is a 5 long shish kebabs joined together to create an amazing feast), but I couldn't handle it. I threw up for 20 mins and my parents even contemplated calling the ambulance but luckily, I was born a kebab-eater and didn't die from the fatal artery exploding dish.\n\nUp until then I only ate one [shish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shish_kebab#Shish) kebab a day and 2 [shami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shami_kebab) kebabs a week. My kebab base line was way above the normal human and my kebab capacity was close to 7 or 8 in an hour.\n\nAnyway, over the years I was able to develop my skills, and began to enjoy eating kebabs. I challenged myself, *believed* in myself. Firstly I started with eating 2 kebabs at once which did end in me choking for a few minutes. Then when I was 8 I was able to eat 3 kebabs in under 20 seconds. Age 14 I was at grand master level - 5 kebabs in 15 seconds averaging at 3 seconds per kebab ^^I ^^did ^^the ^^maths but I felt I needed more.\n\n I had already eaten the mega kebab in a world record time and I couldn't understand what else I needed to do. More kebabs seemed like the right answer. I practiced my skills and was able to eat a kebab in 2 seconds. Again and again I attempted - with a Guiness World record man staring over me - to eat **6** kebabs in **12** seconds, however I constantly failed. It would be a monumental achievement if I was successful. \n\nFinally, the day had came. I hadn't eaten in a week. I trained my throat and performed mouth exercises. My stomach was rumbling and I could feel every heartbeat: **BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM**. The kebabs lay on a plate before me. I licked my lips one final time and dove into the **Ultron Kebab**. Flavour exploded in my mouth and kebab scented saliva flew out of my mouth and soiled the record keepers suit. I munched on the kebabs like a Bangladeshi eats fish. In 9 seconds I had finished 5 kebabs but I didn't think I could finish the 6th because I found it difficult to find room in my finite stomach. My chubby fist reached out and grabbed the piece of meat and I flung it into my oesophagus without chewing. It slid down into my stomach whole. I checked the stopwatch: 11.59 seconds. I cried tears of joy and out of pain of the heat of these spicy demons.\n\nThat day I realised - I love kebabs and I am the kebab master.\n\nI find this embarassing because the kebabs were all 500 feet long and were from the paleolithic era - each kebab cost $3.50\n\nNote: all \"kebabs\" without anything before them are shish kebabs", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407969650", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I only need about tree fiddy.\" I figured she was just asking for enough to get home where she left her purse or whatever and I said, \"sure I think I have some cash in my car, it's right over there.\" As we walked to my car I noticed there was this beast  sitting on the hood of a nearby car! I suddenly realized what it was and said, \"Oh great it's that damn Loch Ness Monster!\" The lady turned to me and said, \"You know him too?\" \"Know him!? That damn monster has been tricking me in to giving him tree fiddy for years.\" Then she said, \"well I suppose I be truthful with you. I don't need the money for gas. Thing is, he said he wouldn't  off my car unless I gave him tree fiddy.\" I became instantly upset and I walked right up to that Loch Ness Monster and said, \"Damn it monster, it's bad enough you go and trick me all the time for my hard earned money but to pick on this poor lady is just low!\"  All he did was sit there stare at me like he had no clue what I was talking about! I was getting mad and started yelling at him to leave and it started to attract some attention of others near by. That monster would not budge. I tried pleading with him and threatening him but nothing seemed to work and I yelled out, \"What is it going to take to get you leave!?\" He said, \"i need about tree fiddy.\" Well it turns out I wasn't the only one being constantly trick by this low life monster. When he said that, several others in the crowd started yelling at him about the tree fiddy they had recently gave him. In our rage we managed to push that slimy beast off the car and chase him away.

{"body": "Back when I was nearly broke two or three years ago, I was searching around online for freelance jobs I could do after/during work to make a little extra cash. Somehow I ended up on a forum where people were discussing ways to make money online. I read a bit but it turned out to be not quite what I was looking for so I went to close the tab. Something along the lines of \"You're better off investing in bitcoin and hoping it keeps going up\" caught my eye so I reopened the tab, but there was nothing more to be said.\n\nMy curiosity piqued, I searched around a bit for bitcoin. Currently trading at about $8, the general consensus from the relatively few people on the web who seemed to know what they were talking about was that it was no longer worth buying--the time to own bitcoin was a year or two prior, when they were being bought for fractions of cents. Nobody seemed to think this magical Internet money held any value or would ever be useful. Not I, however.\n\nYou see, I had very little to lose. I had nothing but a laptop and a car and an apartment I could barely afford to keep, plus my shitty retail job. I decided to go for it and took out a small loan (thankfully, I had and still have near-perfect credit score--another great investment I've made). Within a week, I was the proud owner of around 500 bitcoins--$4000 at the time.\n\nFlash forward half a year and the price starts climbing. At first, by a few cents a day, then by a dollar, and suddenly the price is at over a hundred dollars. I can't believe it. I now have what's potentially $60,000 USD in my possession--and all in one little file on my laptop!\n\nI'm at a standstill--it increased exponentially in price to get to this point. Will it keep going? I decide it will, and lo and behold, it does--until it stops. It remains there for months, and I begin to worry. As the price becomes quite unstable and it fluctuates greatly in price, I sell 50 at $175. This is to become one of the biggest regrets of my life.\n\nNow we're in the latter half of 2013. I haven't really been checking the price of bitcoin as often, despite the fact that my loan is picking up interest. But one fateful day, I look at the price--$243. Holy crap--this is it. The currency will finally take off and I'll be rich! And this is true! By some miracle, it's up another $50 the next day. And the next--up $100! By the end of the week, the bitcoin is at over $750! I decide to sell my remaining 450 bitcoins at the luckiest of lucky numbers--$777. I instantly receive $350,000 to my bank account--or so I think. As I'm closing my laptop lid, I turn around and there's a goddamn Loch Ness monster who demands all tree fiddy thousand so in the end I have nothing and I'm still broke.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408051553", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

He had failed a few attempts at approaching women and his morale was dropping, but I convinced him to give a group of girls across the bar a try. I pretty much dragged him over to these chicks and forced up a conversation with them. They were also a few drinks in and things actually started going surprisingly well. He was hitting on a brunette girl whose name I can't remember and I was hitting on, (unknowingly at the time), Michelle Pfeiffer. Anyways things progressed further and the girls invited us back to their place. We left our buddies with our DD and left in the girls' car. It turned out they were housemates and when we got to their place my buddy went to the brunette's room and I went with Michelle to hers. **NSFW FROM HERE ON** We started making out on her bed and things progressed as they usually do in situations like this. I got her to the point where she was topless and in panties and I had my belt undone. She pushed me onto my back and asked if I had a condom and I responded that I did, (I always kept one in my wallet, take notes kids). I put on the condom as she turned the lights off, and she got on top of me.

{"body": "Also an interesting 'what-if':\n\n\"After compulsory viewing of an atrocity film, 1,000 prisoners at Camp Butner dramatically burned their German uniforms. In an idea seriously considered but ultimately rejected by American military officials, a few prisoners even volunteered to fight in the war against Japan.\"\n\nI could imagine a film that showed a group of German soldiers being trained early on around 1941 by their firm but father-like Drill Sgt. Right before they leave for the front, their Drill Sgt. reveals that he's being sent to Japan as some sort of Officer swap program. \n\nThey fight against America on the Western Front, get captured, get sent to a POW camp, see the films of the Concentration Camps, then by late 1944 or early 1945, volunteer to fight against Japan. (Where I also imagine that this was an alternate WWII where the bombs were never dropped).\n\nBeing former enemies, the leading command had no problem putting the Germans in bloody, front line battles. They bitterly fight their way through Japan, losing many members of their original group, until they reach Tokyo, now in 1946. \n\nStreet by street, building by building, they claw their way to the city center, much like the Russians in Berlin. As they approach the Tokyo Imperial Palace, they find that of the many officers commanding the last troops surrounding the palace, their former Drill Sgt. is one. They fight and defeat the last few troops surrounding the palace, and when they enter, they come face to face with their friend, whom they have not seen in five years. \n\nHe shakes their hands and tells them that he's proud of them, 'his children', and they tell him that they learned from a great teacher.\n\nA few weeks later, they tearfully watch as he is judged guilty by a war crimes tribunal (even though he had no direct connection with any parts of the Holocaust or Death Marches, this US is a lot less forgiving, being that in this WWII the US suffered 500,000 more casualties from the Invasion of Japan) and is sentanced to death.\n\nHe salutes his men one last time as he is marched to the firing squad.\n\nThe story turns to modern day, where the soldiers are being interviewed for their story to be told, wearing Medals of Honor next to their Gold German Crosses.\n\nThe main character, whoever he may be, takes one last trip to Germany, this time to where he trained. He arrives at the location, and sees that it has sinced been demolished and replaced with an empty field, but a single lone framiliar apple tree remains. He sits under it, and thinking about the things he's done and the people he's had the great privlege to do it with, tears up.\n\nThe film then shows an old photo from 1941 of the soldiers and their Drill Sgt., from a happier time. Wistful music plays, fade to black.\n\nDirected by Loch Ness Monster, who you now owe tree-fiddy.\n\nI know there's probably a wrong thing for every line there is, but I just really liked writing this thing out, even if it's horrible.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408077064", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

We projected everything as far as living expenses, food, training gear, supplements, and all the other small bits and pieces. i had a hard time getting a hold of his head trainer since he was such a busy guy. After calling and leaving multiple messages, texting, emailing, i decided to go down to the gym. \n\nI get there, and this guy is terrifying. Easily the biggest man i've ever seen. as soon as i walked in the door he locked eyes and ever broke his gaze. He had this look it his eye, almost animalistic. once i got close enough to speak, i notice he has this tough leathery skin, almost scale like. I reluctantly walked to him, and explained the situation. The whole time this guy is towering over me, emitting an odor i've never smelled before or since. \n\nafter what seemed like an eternity, i ask \"how much are you going to charge for this camp? we need to get our finances planned out\" He stops, stares into my soul with those hollow eyes, and leans in close.

{"body": "Well you're half right and half wrong, but at least you're intelligent and can have a rational mature conversation. Good guess on meth since I've made posts about purchasing it, so you could've been right but today has actually been amphetamine paste I tried from a new vendor on cloud 9 because the picture looked like an old favorite from the past but unfortunately is just average. And I was looking for an opioid anyway, such a very un-meth like substance! ;) \n\nThe verbosity is sadly just a trait I have that has its pros and cons, I don't say much a lot of the time and keep things in but then something irritates me and sets off a long rant where I have so much to say I talk too much. Or if it's something I feel strongly or passionately about I can talk too long. You'll see that a lot in my post history, short ones or long ones. I know when I'm doing it that it's too long but can't help it, I've just never been a short and sweet, brief, quiet person. Just a talker in my genes ;)\n\nAnd yeah I guess intense, what I call passionate, if it touches a nerve which certain human annoying traits really do. Shouldn't let it bother me but easier said than done. Just don't know why people can't be nice and cool. I just hate this whole shtick some want to have where they're dicks, not funny dicks mind u, just dicks. It just comes off so desperate and starving for attention and I try to overlook it but sometimes I'm just disgusted by the whole phony act. Every group has to have the one who wanted to be hated, and plays that whole role, but too many of them is just annoying as shit. I'm really not mad, just frustrated at times, and while it may come off as anger it's really not, compared to some of the plainly angry and mean spirited personalities that sometimes frequent here. A look at my post or comment history will quickly see I'm a nice easygoing guy, and only get irritable when treated in a rude or condescending manner. I love these guys who wanna be tough guy cool aggressive insulting and then are so surprised and indignant when the other person takes offense, like it's their fault for being too sensitive.\n\nIf I make a post about the fairly rare case of so many markets only having 2 single sellers of a certain pretty popular product, it's because I find that, rightfully so, unusual. I can't remember the last time on any number of markets in the past that such a popular product was offered by only 2 vendors out of hundreds. The constant snarky comments just for the sake of being sarcastic because that's the only way they think they can be funny gets old. It's like they think they're a smug David Spade but without the actual funny clever side. It also doesn't help that most are probably ignorant kids who think they know everything. Christ I graduated undergrad in 99, probably when they were in grade school. Intelligence, wisdom, open mindedness, modesty, these things are sorely lacking in some. \n\nWith things I know and have experience with, listen and learn, with the many things I nothing about, I listen and learn. That's maturity. And for god sakes be creative and witty in your remarks, don't regurgitate the same tired phrases just because you can't create ones yourself. I'm not kidding this is like the third time I've heard butthurt in the last few days, for the love of god make your humor at least semi original. I like many things about reddit but this repetitious \"tree fiddy\" or \"This.\" or \"Michael Scott.\" or whatever is repeated ad nauseum by those who don't realize when a joke is overplayed.

{"body": "Mike said I wasn't suppose to speak unless someone said something to me first. The man shook Mike's hand and said thanks. He walked back over to the woman on the table and told me to watch. He stuck his dick in the wound he cut on her stomach. He started thrusting and I squeezed Mike's hand hard. This wasn't fun.\n\nMike looked at me and cleared his throat. The man said, \"You and your bitch can go. Thanks for watching!\"\n\nWe sat on a couch and I told him I wanted to leave. He said we would but I was new and that meant I had to see each room. He said he'd explain later but that we were being watched and it would be less of a hassle to just go with it. We had to spend at least 10 minutes in each room. He said it again. \"We **HAVE** to stay in each room for a minimum of 10 minutes.\" We got up and went to the first room on the right.\n\nThe walls were a different color, not the red of the rooms on the left. This was black.  There was a large TV on the wall with chairs in front of it. Some men and a few women were there sitting. We stood at the back next to a camera. I noticed one of the women was holding a guy's hand. That made me feel better for some reason.\n\nThe screen turned on and there was a girl tied to a chair. A man walked into the frame and held up a sign that said, \"VOTE\". Mike grabbed a control pad like you see at bars to play those interactive games. On the screen were options, \"anal, vaginal, and oral\". Mike said these rooms were where we could view other places like this one and the red rooms were broadcast to other clubs. We didn't have to be quiet.\n\nHe explained that it's just like those trivia games but with sex and more hardcore stuff. Oral had been voted by this time and I saw there were about 200 votes. There were maybe 10 people in this room. I asked Mike how many clubs there are and he shrugged.\n\nThe man on the screen pulled his dick out and made the girl suck it. A second man appeared and held up the VOTE sign. \"Anal, vaginal, oral, other\"\n\n\"What's other?\" I asked. Mike said it's like what that guy in the red room was doing.\n\nOther won. They cut a hole in her breast and started fucking. I went into shock. We sat down in a chair. I heard the woman who was new like me giggle. She fucking laughed!?\n\nVOTE again. This was about 20 minutes in. Mike looked at the voting pad and asked if I wanted to go. I said yes and we stood up as I saw \"eyes\" flash on the screen. The new woman in the front row squealed and said she was excited.\n\nThe next few rooms were more of the same but each woman was a different ethnicity. Then a man with a woman wearing a strap on, then two men, then another woman. Mike said the feeds start at about the same time with an hour in between. They're far enough apart so one is always playing. This one was already in session. Two men were having sex with wounds on a woman's stomach while fingering each other. It had a timer in the corner: 49 minutes.\n\nVOTE came up on the screen.\n\n\"Behead\" flashed up.\n\nWhat? Like, a sex position? Mike told me to close my eyes but I couldn't. She started screaming. Pleading in a language I didn't recognize.\n\nThey sawed her head off while fucking her stomach. They then fucked her severed head and the hole in her neck.\n\nThey finished on her face and kicked her body off the chair. They set her head on the seat and the message, \"Thanks. Next show in one hour.\" Came up.\n\nI had to leave. Mike took me to a couch. He explained how this is what people pay to see. Every time you vote, you have to log into their system and it charges your credit card. He also said that as a new person, I HAD to see each room. \"Why? What if I leave?\"\n\nThey'll put you in one of the shows.\n\nI took a deep breath. We had just a few rooms left. We went into the next ones but left while they were still having sex on screen. The last room had 3 men and one woman on screen. They were clearly drugged and a man was giving them instructions. They were all covered in blood. A second woman lay on the ground with blood pooling around her. They started eating her.\n\nVOTE\n\n\"Man\" flashed on screen. The guy giving directions said something and the woman bit one of the men's dick off. She spat it out and started eating the wound. The other men started wherever they could. We left.\n\nOn our way out, the guy who took our stuff laughed at me and said it's not for everyone. He then gave our stuff back and asked Mike if I was ok. Mike said I would stay quiet and gave the guy some money, \"for looking after our stuff and keeping us safe.\"\n\nI pulled out my wallet and saw a business card in it.\n\n\"If you ever want to come back, that'll get you in.\"\n\nI asked how much I owed for keeping my stuff.\n\n\"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that point I realized this man was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408145800", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "- Question is phrased incorrectly.  In the title you ask what it would take to convince a skeptic that some UFOs are real.  The answer to that is a personal sighting because if there are people out there who still think millions of people spotting unidentified crafts are crazy then it would take nothing less than a personal experience, a sighting to convince them otherwise.  They would have to be extremely stubborn and closed minded.  I've never met one of these people, however.  Most people acknowledge that people are seeing unidentified aircraft.  The contention is the source of these craft.\n\n- That's why I say you phrased it incorrectly.  The body of your text seems to imply that you are actually asking what it would take to convince a skeptic that some of these UFOs are of alien origin, not simply that they exist.  The answer to that is evidence.  Even if there is no evidence linking these craft to E.T. intelligence at least evidence that these aliens are visiting earth would be a good starting point.  If that still in unattainable the next step down would be evidence that alien life have ever stepped foot, flipper, whatever on Earth.\n\n- It's literally impossible to prove that these craft are piloted by aliens without first proving that aliens are visiting Earth.  Their existence here on our planet must be verified before  you can put them in the cockpit of any vehicle.  First prove that alien species have ever visited earth at any time in history, next prove they are still visiting Earth THEN the discussion can be opened that these known alien species on our planet are the ones in the pilot seat.  Until evidence places aliens on planet Earth the discussion may as well be if ghosts, bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster are piloting these craft.  All are equally unproven to exist on this planet.  The only way to convince a skeptic is to provide evidence that your argument may be possible.....or for him to have a personal experience in which he actually meets alien life on our planet.  At that point he would become a believer, even though there is still no evidence.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408158608", "subreddit": "UFOs", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Mike said I wasn't suppose to speak unless someone said something to me first. The man shook Mike's hand and said thanks. He walked back over to the woman on the table and told me to watch. He stuck his dick in the wound he cut on her stomach. He started thrusting and I squeezed Mike's hand hard. This wasn't fun.\n\nMike looked at me and cleared his throat. The man said, \"You and your bitch can go. Thanks for watching!\"\n\nWe sat on a couch and I told him I wanted to leave. He said we would but I was new and that meant I had to see each room. He said he'd explain later but that we were being watched and it would be less of a hassle to just go with it. We had to spend at least 10 minutes in each room. He said it again. \"We HAVE to stay in each room for a minimum of 10 minutes.\" We got up and went to the first room on the right.\n\nThe walls were a different color, not the red of the rooms on the left. This was black. There was a large TV on the wall with chairs in front of it. Some men and a few women were there sitting. We stood at the back next to a camera. I noticed one of the women was holding a guy's hand. That made me feel better for some reason.\n\nThe screen turned on and there was a girl tied to a chair. A man walked into the frame and held up a sign that said, \"VOTE\". Mike grabbed a control pad like you see at bars to play those interactive games. On the screen were options, \"anal, vaginal, and oral\". Mike said these rooms were where we could view other places like this one and the red rooms were broadcast to other clubs. We didn't have to be quiet.\n\nHe explained that it's just like those trivia games but with sex and more hardcore stuff. Oral had been voted by this time and I saw there were about 200 votes. There were maybe 10 people in this room. I asked Mike how many clubs there are and he shrugged.\n\nThe man on the screen pulled his dick out and made the girl suck it. A second man appeared and held up the VOTE sign. \"Anal, vaginal, oral, other\"\n\n\"What's other?\" I asked. Mike said it's like what that guy in the red room was doing.\n\nOther won. They cut a hole in her breast and started fucking. I went into shock. We sat down in a chair. I heard the woman who was new like me giggle. She fucking laughed!?\n\nVOTE again. This was about 20 minutes in. Mike looked at the voting pad and asked if I wanted to go. I said yes and we stood up as I saw \"eyes\" flash on the screen. The new woman in the front row squealed and said she was excited.\n\nThe next few rooms were more of the same but each woman was a different ethnicity. Then a man with a woman wearing a strap on, then two men, then another woman. Mike said the feeds start at about the same time with an hour in between. They're far enough apart so one is always playing. This one was already in session. Two men were having sex with wounds on a woman's stomach while fingering each other. It had a timer in the corner: 49 minutes.\n\nVOTE came up on the screen.\n\n\"Behead\" flashed up.\n\nWhat? Like, a sex position? Mike told me to close my eyes but I couldn't. She started screaming. Pleading in a language I didn't recognize.\n\nThey sawed her head off while fucking her stomach. They then fucked her severed head and the hole in her neck.\n\nThey finished on her face and kicked her body off the chair. They set her head on the seat and the message, \"Thanks. Next show in one hour.\" Came up.\n\nI had to leave. Mike took me to a couch. He explained how this is what people pay to see. Every time you vote, you have to log into their system and it charges your credit card. He also said that as a new person, I HAD to see each room. \"Why? What if I leave?\"\n\nThey'll put you in one of the shows.\n\nI took a deep breath. We had just a few rooms left. We went into the next ones but left while they were still having sex on screen. The last room had 3 men and one woman on screen. They were clearly drugged and a man was giving them instructions. They were all covered in blood. A second woman lay on the ground with blood pooling around her. They had been eating her.\n\nVOTE\n\n\"Man\" flashed on screen. The guy giving directions said something and the woman bit one of the men's dick off. She spat it out and started eating the wound. The other men started wherever they could. We left.\n\nOn our way out, the guy who took our stuff laughed at me and said it's not for everyone. He then gave our stuff back and asked Mike if I was ok. Mike said I would stay quiet and gave the guy some money, \"for looking after our stuff and keeping us safe.\"\n\nI pulled out my wallet and saw a business card in it.\n\n\"If you ever want to come back, that'll get you in.\"\n\nI asked how much I owed for keeping my stuff.\n\n\"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that point I realized this man was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1408210440", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I know I had a girlfriend and it was wrong but I was 22 and didn't have a care in the world.\n\nThe process was kind of funny because we got to pick our hookers over the phone based on hair and skin color. I got a brunette with blue eyes. \n\nSo the hookers start showing up one at a time to our room and as they show up, they disappear with each of my friends into the bedrooms. Of course, mine shows up last.\n\nShe was very cute, don't get me wrong, but something was definitely off about her. She definitely seemed nervous so I figured she might be kind of new to the trade.\n\nWe go to my bedroom and things get hot and heavy very quickly. I got her for two hours which cost about an arm and a leg but it was Vegas. We go on to have some GREAT sex and we actually talked a lot and got along great. We talked about my girlfriend and her past boyfriends. We really did hit it off on an emotional level which bothered me a bit because I knew what it was and I would feel bad paying her to leave.\n\nThe two hours expire and we get our clothes back on. We make eye contact and I realize that this wasn't going to be easy. I kind of liked this girl.\n\nI break the silence by saying, \"So what do I owe ya?\" Which sounded terrible but I didn't know what else to say. She looked hurt but put on a brave smile. She goes on to say, \"It will only be about tree fiddy.\" My eyes got HUGE and I noticed that I had just had sex with that damn Loch Ness Monster!

The kid wasn't all too smart, plagiarized a few essays on ( notably one about Life in the Woods ), and had thus earned himself a failing grade by the end of the year.\n\nNow, considering this is grade school and being held back a year due to failing isn't the way you want your child to grow up, she was understandably a little upset about the whole thing. Well, near the end of the year she walked into my office with her baby blue blouse and her tight red pants, looking a tad bit sheepish holding a plate of cookies. She offered me a cookie, I took one and she did as well as she goes on this little spiel about how her son is so smart, and being held back is going to be devastating for him. She talks about how he'll lose all his friends and, how that would affect his emotional state. All the while I sat there enjoying cookies.\n\nTowards the end of the speech, she comes up to me out of nowhere, licking her lips and telling me I can do anything to her if I'd give her son a passing grade. And by anything I mean ***anything***. I had to stand up and usher her out of the room, explaining how it would be unprofessional for me to take her up on her offer and that I could lose my job. Little did she know that I'm gay, and I wouldn't have taken her up on her offer anyway. She looked disheveled, and began to walk off when she turned around and looked at me with tears in her eyes saying \"Can I please say one more thing before I go?\" I obliged, and Mrs. Cartman told me \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well, it was about that time that I noticed that she was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.

They have stated their intent to support only the latest version of IE available on any given OS from the start of 2016.\n\nLooking at some other popular sites:\n\n* Google is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the most aggressive: their apps already don't even support IE9 any more.\n\n* Facebook still supports IE8, but nothing older.\n\n* Salesforce.com still seems to support IE8, and IE7 for limited features, but are completely retiring support for both from Summer 2015.\n\n* Amazon is the most forgiving I could find, apparently supporting as far back as IE7.\n\nOf course, at the scales these sites work on, even the tiny percentage of visitors using older versions might be worth supporting. I expect someone at Amazon can find out *exactly* how much revenue they get from customers using older versions of IE, and I expect they really do compare that against some estimate of the development overheads they incur by maintaining support for very old browsers too.\n\nBut for most projects, supporting anything below at least IE9 is now legacy work.

{"body": "&gt;That suggests that the claim of disbelief in a deity is somehow scientific or based on deductive logic. It is not, since an argument from ignorance (e.g. \"absence of evidence is evidence of absence\") does not substantiate truth.\n\nYou're getting a few things mixed up here. First, disbelief in a deity *is* \"somehow\" scientific and logical, assuming by disbelief you mean lack of belief. Second, that's not an argument from ignorance.\n\nFirst and foremost: absence of evidence **is** evidence of absence *if* evidence *should* be present. It's easily arguable that any god worth discussing (that is to say an interventionist, supernatural god) would - or to be more specific would have - leave evidence behind. Therefore the lack of such evidence, as with the Loch Ness monster and other assorted semi-supernatural beings, is evidence of absence. Russel's teapot, etc.\n\nMore to the point: we're talking empiricism here, and empirically, what we can't measure does not exist, and what we haven't yet measured is either non-existent or inconsequential. As with all empiricism, this is not 100% certain for all possible futures, but it is true here, now. It is not possible to conclusively disprove the existence of unicorns either, because it's nearly impossible to disprove an existence claim to begin with, but for all intents and purposes we do not believe in unicorns. We're not \"agnostic\" regarding unicorns.\n\n&gt;I disagree, a world view where you can overtly acknowledge that you don't know something and cannot prove it is a distinctly skeptical and scientific standpoint. Acknowledging that something is not known leads to questioning how we can know it and consequently, how to explore and test that idea. That is a worldview that inspires scientific exploration.\n\nNo, it's a worldview called solipsism, and it leads nowhere. You can't be absolutely sure of *anything* beyond \"I exist\", but you can instead assume certain things, axioms if you will, work from there, and at a certain confidence level say \"good enough, next question\". After all, you don't even know that I'm not a figment of your imagination.\n\n&gt;I only object when they try to suggest that it is a scientific or \"default\" position, or that you must belong to one or the other.\n\nWe've covered the former, let's also cover the latter, it's  a short one.\n\nLong story short, you're either a theist, or you're not a theist.

I suspect that's where most of our disagreement takes place.\n\nI understand your position better now, but my argument applies to both equally, so it shouldn't be an issue.\n\n&gt;That is untestable and indeed the absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. Perhaps you've heard that \"you cannot prove a universal negative\" which applies to this scenario.\n\nWell, insofar as one can speak about evidence regarding something fundamentally unfalsifiable, I guess that's true. But discussing whether an unfalsifiable existence claim can be... falsified... is a bit tautological. This is why I said that we are speaking of interventionist, supernatural deities, not abstract, inconsequential creator entities which have no influence beyond being a Prime Mover (i.e. deism), and as such merit no discussion, like the question \"What was before the Big Bang?\".\n\n&gt;We don't know about something therefore it cannot be? \n\n*No*. Not \"can not\". \"Isn't\". The Loch Ness monster doesn't exist, but it *could* exist. That was my point: it's certain for a certain sufficient confidence level based on our current information, but that does not speak for possibilities after new information is revealed. In other words, if a fresh, rotting Plesiosaur washed up in Scotland tomorrow few would deny that Nessie was real, but as it is now, it's a myth. Bigfoot is possible, but we assume no such beast exists, because it would contravene far too many things we take to be certain. Again, this is Russel's teapot.\n\nMind you this does not mean that the only scientifically consistent position is of gnostic atheism. My argument rests entirely on the assumption that we would have had to notice the handiwork of the aforementioned interventionist god via unexplained supernatural phenomena, miracles, etc. by now, but that's by no means a certainty. This is what I mean by confidence level: *I'm* satisfied that an interventionist god would have already been noticed via supernatural phenomena, but others need not be, others may insist on a higher level of rigor, of confidence, and remain agnostic.\n\n&gt;My point is that agnosticism is a real and valid position: one can acknowledge there is neither proof of existence or non-existence so one doesn't know.\n\nOh, most certainly. I think I misunderstood your intent then, I assumed you were saying that there was a third position on the belief axis between atheism and theism, as many do. Indeed, agnosticism is a completely valid position, it just answers a completely different question unrelated to belief.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408249413", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had I.S.S. (In school suspension, you pretty much sit in a room for the entire school day and can't leave) and I had a reputation for being rather disruptive in there. The teachers ended up letting me bring a pillow and blanket to just sleep most of the day so I would be out of their hair. My friend got sent in on the third day and the teachers decided to act hard in front of him and demanded that I throw my pillow and blanket in the trash. I laughed at them and declined.\n\nOne of the teachers then walked over, grabbed them, and walked out the door. I wasn't about to allow him to throw them away, so I followed him and he ended up walking to the principal's office. Principal demanded to know why I had brought them to school, I explained that the teacher's allowed me to, and he then called me a liar. I told him this situation was bullcrap, and he told me not to say that word again. I ended up saying it again a few sentences later, and he got pissed off and told me if I said it again I would be suspended. I really doubted he would actually suspend me, but when I walked out I looked at the people in the outer part of the office and said \"this is a bunch of bullcrap\". The principal lost his God damn mind, and started screaming for me to come back in. He called my mom, and yelled that I would be suspended unless I paid him about tree fiddy. It was about this time that I realized my principal was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I shouted back \"God damn it Nessie! I ain't givin you no damn tree fiddy!\" He actually ended up suspending me for the day, giving me a 3 day weekend so I'd say it worked out pretty well for me in the end. My mom was pretty pissed about it, but more due to the fact that an 18 year old was suspended from a public school for saying \"bullcrap\".\n\nTL;DR I was suspended for a day from high school for saying bullcrap after I refused to throw away a pillow and blanket that my teachers had given me permission to bring.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408255311", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

Upon further investigation, I discover that the 'Loch Ness'-like creature had been ferrying the Crab pokemon across the sea from another land. I resolved to find why and what made this 'Lapras' as it is known, take part in this matter that it other wise would play no part.\n\nFirstly, I waited until the Lapras had swam back out to see, before using my trusted partner Magneton to capture a few of these Krabbys. I then explained to them that I was researching the pokemon that had played 'cruise' to them across the vast sea and to why it did that. Although the Krabby could only reply with pinches and frothing at the mouth (which I first mistook for PokeRabies), I later discover that the Lapras acts as a delivery service, transporting pokemon, items, and other such things across the water for payment. \n\nNext, I devised I would try to purchase the service of Lapras, so I could establish the price at which this pokemon would sell the service across the ocean. Using one of my new Krabbys (my favourite as it froths and pinches less than the others) To explain to Lapras who had returned to shore looking for customers, or so i thought, that I wished to purchase transport to another region. I held out a pokeblock, hoping it would be payment enough, but Lapras whined loudly. Krabby then pinched me, and so i added another, and again Lapras whined. I added yet another, and Lapras whined once more, although less of a ear-pounding wail. I broke another in half and added half of the small block, holding it out to Lapras, which gracefully consumed from my hand, then allowed me to climb on and set sail out of the bay!\n\nIn conclusion, my report states that Lapras, which I have fondly nicknamed 'Nessie', will require tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408301441", "subreddit": "PokemonPlaza", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You know, I really can't say I have any regrets whatsoever. Actually the funny thing is, she became my *wife*. Funny right? Well the story goes like this.. See I had been with my old girlfriend, we'll call her Sarah. Well we were going out as we always did a few times a month but things had gotten kind of bad in the last few months... We were eating at a beautiful restaurant and basically, she had been cheating on me. I only found this out because of her behavior. She was all lovey-dovey starring into my eyes \"I love you\" and whatnot. But then, then she became rigid and her eyes kept darting away from mine. Well, she kept glancing at another man who she had been sleeping with. I found this out when he blatantly walked over to her an started having a conversation with her. As if I wasn't there. \n\"Hey Sarah!! How are you? I had a great time last night.\"\n\"And who's this guy?\" \n\"Oh it's just Protector12..\"\n\"Nice to meet you man! Are you guys related or something?\"\n\"Not really..\"\n\"Well I'll leave you to your eveni-\"\nAt this point Sarah broke down and told me everything. I myself, broke down. I simply stood up and left. Left her crying to her secret little lover. I walked outside of the building and just kept walking. I left the nice part of town and eventually reached the slightly worse part of town. I knew that there were escorts around a local business that was open for them. I walked in to drown my sorrows in beautiful women. And this is exactly what I found. Actually more so *A* beautiful woman. I instantly locked eyes with her. \"What's your name?\" \"Well..\" And I kid you not we instantly hit it off. It wasn't the whole \"I'm giving you money, have sex with me.\" I asked her to just go on a little date with me. She agreed immediately. We went out(not to where my ex was) and had an amazing evening. We had so many amazing traits in common. She uses Reddit just like I do. We made silly dorky jokes for hours. We were having such a great time that we didn't even realize the hours passing. We went back to my place. She drove her own car because she couldn't use mine. I had some of the single most amazing sex I have ever had. If enough people see this I'll definitely elaborate. But long story short: Amazing. I know for a fact she climaxed several times. We woke up next to each other. I stared her directly in the eyes and she whispered: \"I love you so much.\" I said, \"You know I am a bit over on your time?\" She said with a silly grin, \"Oh I know.\" I said, \"I want to pay you with something special.\" She then told me, \"Oh don't worry I'll give you a discount.\" With a wink. \"How much?\" Still smiling. \"I'd say about tree fiddy.\" At this point I realized that she was a 30 foot tall dinosaur from the Paleolithic era. I told her, \"God damnit Loch Ness monster. I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" She was appalled by this and released a blood curdling roar and swam away. I couldn't believe my eyes. I had only scarred her off. I knew that love was meant to be. The funny thing is I found her several years later swimming in the ocean eating the local whale population. She hadn't seen me yet and I absolutely knew that it had to be now or never. I walked up to her and tapped her on the shoulder, she turned around; completely taken by surprised. I asked her to marry me and the rest is history. Ancient History. \n\n3 years tomorrow!!

{"body": "I will gladly concede that, philosophically, answering it and negating it both require some level of rational thinking to come to a conclusion.  The problem I have is that I don't think the debate is either interesting or important for a variety of reasons (which I will list):\n\n* I file the question of whether or not God exists in the same folder as whether or not the Loch Ness Monster or Martians exist.  It seems completely clear to me that God is a human construct created out of ignorance and not something we have any rational means of presuming actually exists.\n* The existence of God can only be confirmed by God therefore no matter how carefully and closely we reason our way within striking distance of God we will always miss and continue to circle.\n* The importance of the question rests solely on whether or not God has any influence on us, it's essentially a question about whether or not we determine the direction of our own lives.  However, absent of any obvious signs of interference I don't see how that conversation can be truly pursued since (as I stated above) it would require direct intervention by God to reveal the hands of God directing our lives.\n* Religions are notoriously intransigent when it comes to answering previously unanswerable questions.  Any answer we find to the question of God would likely be largely ignored or resisted particularly if God didn't fit any of the descriptions our world's religions give.\n* Given how little we know of the universe, and particularly if anything else inhabits it, I find it unlikely that any being worthy of being called God would fit the common descriptions our world's religions give.\n* If we \"found\" God how would we verify it is God?  If we are considering the existence of a being which has the power to influence every facet of our lives it seems unlikely that we would have the means of verifying it is what it says it is.  So even if we do stumble upon an answer we would still be forced to take that answer on faith.\n\nI do understand what you are saying but from my perspective holding a \"trump card\" argument like \"God could be there and just not be showing itself\" doesn't actually reveal any evidence of rational thought on the part of the person making the claim.  Studying a concept philosophically still requires some level of effort, you have to actually expend some energy to defend your position.  Simply denying any headway in the discussion by bringing out a trump card argument doesn't progress it.  So, while the question may still be open I still believe that answering it is entirely a one-way street because one side of the argument has yet to put any serious effort into answering the question (without being completely self-referential).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408369856", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That the government is abducting innocent civilians across the U.S. and using them as undercover agents.\n\nHave you ever wondered why thousands and thousands of people go missing in the U.S. each year and are never heard from again?  I'll explain why.\n\nIn 1968, during the Cold War, the United States government began a not-so-known program involving the recruitment of regular American citizens to begin establishing world dominance in an effort to come out victorious over the Soviet Union.  The program is known as Operation New Establishment (ONE).\n\nONE is highly in depth, complicated, and branched out.  Part of the program involves spreading Western influence across the globe through media, pop-culture, celebrities, etc.  A majority of celebrities are a part of this program, and so far they have been very effective.\n\nOther branches include sending American citizens abroad to work for international countries to gather important economical information that could give the U.S. an upper hand in the world economy.\n\nThere are also marketing teams, information-gathering units, and, although they are in basically every branch of the U.S. government, hitmen who are hired to take down important figures that pose as threats to the U.S.--or, basically, anyone who is not a U.S. citizen that could, or are currently, increasing the power and influence their country has on other nations.  (Politicians are very, very rarely targeted.)\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, politicians and officials high up in Washington debated on whether or not to shut down ONE.  It was decided by a large majority of the U.S. Government to keep the program going and so it continues to this day.\n\nHow do I know about this program?  It is simple:  I was apart of the marketing branch.  This is my story.\n\nIn late 1968 I had just returned home from fighting in Vietnam.  Communism was a threat to America and democracy and had to be destroyed, and fighting it on the frontlines and in covert ops wasn't enough; The U.S. needed to combat the ideology of communism.  This is when ONE was established.\n\nI was contacted by the U.S. government agents in early December of that year and was asked if I was interested in joining a newly launched government program that involved me going abroad and selling U.S. related products like clothing and music branded with with popular musicians in the U.S.  The contract offered to me would pay for literally everything I needed--not wanted--and included a six digit payment.  I had no reason to stay in the U.S. and it seemed foolish to turn down the offer, so I accepted.  A week later I was in Germany with my own small store.\n\nIn the position that I was at the time you may be questioning how I came to know what I do about ONE.  The answer is simple: Someone higher up told me.\n\nWithin a year of my time being in Germany, more and more U.S. citizens began spontaneously popping up with their own small stores and shops, and I began to wonder if they had also been recruited by the government to do what I had been hired to do, though, I didn't actually care enough to ask anyone if my theory was true.\n\nIt turned out that I wasn't the only one asking the same question.  Some time in late 1969 one of the American store owners a few streets down from me came into my store as I was closing down for the night and asked if we could talk for a few minutes.  Not thinking much of it, and actually hoping that maybe he had the same questions as I did, I brought him into the backroom to talk.\n\nAs I took out some wine for us the man asked me why I was in Germany--a very forward question.\n\nSitting down in the chair across from him, I stared deep into his dark blue eyes.  His face was dark and slightly wrinkled, his bushy eyebrows and thick hair were graying; he sat straight, his hands across his lap, confidence radiated from him.\n\n\"I was offered a contract by the U.S. government,\" I told him firmly, keeping eye contact.\n\nHe moved his shirt collar slightly, revealing a small Soviet Union patch.  \"How much did they pay you?\" he asked coldly.\n\n\"Tree fiddy,\" I responded coolly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408385633", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There was a time when i was more adventurous. i loved meeting new people. I would often go to bars and tag along with a random group of people, large enough that anyone would assume i knew someone there, and strike up conversations with whomever. These friendships often faded with the night and i would be left with only the memories of passing friends.  \n    \nRealistically speaking, though, i was lonely. I never kept in touch with people for long and i sought more; i made a post on the subreddit for the city i lived in seeking friendship and only received response from one person, a girl named Evelynn.\n    \nEarly on i could tell that she was different from everyone else id met before; she was like me. She was outgoing and very comfortable socially, but never seemed to have any close friends, only acquaintences.  \n    \nEvelynn and i eventually started dating and we were mad for each other. there was a combination of genuine developed feelings and the comfort of finally living a life with consistency after so long never knowing what variablea life may have thrown our way.  \n    \nFor a short period of time, though, were many trials and difficulties. It may have been shortly after our first anniversary, ot possibly a few months after, but well before the 2 year mark. We fought day in and day out nearly breaking up several times. Im certain that fear was the only thing that kept us together. We had grown so comfortable in our routine that the thought of going back to an unpredictable life was petrifying.  \n    \nI eventually suggested counselling. She was hesitant, but agreed.  \n    \nDays went by when it felt like no progress was being made, but there were always breakthroughs when things seemed to be at their worst. We eventually rediscovered why we had fallen in love in the first place. We would eventually marry.\n    \nDestiny would eventually betray us, though. She was diagnosed with cancer on her 29th birthday, a mere 7 months after our wedding; it took her quickly. I knew id never find a plesiosaur from the paleolithic era like here ever again in my life. She was my everything.  \n    \nYears later ive recovered from the loss. I still have never had the courage to hop back in the dating pool. I am content, for now, with only her memory", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408392915", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "One hot summer a few of my friends hung out at one kids house because he had a pool.  This friend also had a sister.  She was a bit older than us, about 19 or so.  Anyway, we were all playing in the pool with a volleyball.  I kept staying by her side because as she jumped around her boobs would nearly fall out of her top.  This was driving me crazy.  I started to get a semi.  One particular time I may have gotten a bit too close as when she jumped for the ball she came crashing down into me.  Her hand grazed my young boner.  I didn't know if she knew it or not, I was extremely close to panicking.  However, she just turned and gave a soft smile.  Score!  A few minutes go by (felt like hours), she excuses herself to go change.  I think this is my big chance to see those boobs I mentioned earlier.  I wait a few seconds they exclaim, \"I have to use your bathroom\".  Nobody makes the connection and off I go.  I wasn't sure which room would be hers, I just knew I had to catch a glimpse.  I slowly opened a few doors until I finally found the right one.  I knew the cover story should I get caught, \"oops, sorry, had to use the bathroom, don't know where I am, durr\".  I peered through her door just as she was about to remove her top.  She caught me in her mirror unbeknownst to me.  She undid the clasp, then she said \"If you want to see more, I'll need about tree fiddy\".  It was about that time I noticed this beautiful girl was actually the loch ness monster.

{"body": "The incredible thing about reddit is the content, but also the community.  Think of reddit with absolutely no comments at all.  It'd be less than half the site is is now.  No askreddit.  No ama.  Just posts and links.\n\nSo interaction is key.  But look at youtube.  Look at the quality of their comments.  It's like swimming through a porta potty.\n\nSo high quality interaction is key.  Reddit has that.  The fact that the unwashed masses can interact with celebrities (or other people of fame) without (much) moderation, and the whole thing actually works... that's flabbergasting.  It's like we're reversing the internet here.\n\nYou can say that content is king, but there can also be something lacking. It's really hard to build up any relationships with anyone on an anonymous forum like this.  No face to tie things to, no memories of what they've shared before.  You could be arguing with someone vehemently on some thread, and sharing a joke on another, and you may not even realize it's the same username.\n\nI think showing the up/down votes is a little iffy.  It helps if someone is a troll, and you don't want to spend time reading their post.  Or if you hate novelty accounts and want to stop wasting 10 minutes of your life before \"tree fiddy\".  But in the end, if they have a good post I'll upvote.  Bad one, downvote.  Previous rating history doesn't really come into it.  It's more useful to pay attention to or avoid people that I've found interesting/annoying in the past.  If reddit could build in netflix style grouping &amp; preference/personalization into each user's UI, that would be amazing.  Or really bad.  But definitely interesting.\n\nBut tagging is a bit like bookmarking.  I have someone tagged about the crazy blue car he's building and painting himself.  I have another tagged about the PC in a desk he's making.  Stuff like that.  It's neat to see why you tagged someone, then go back and check in.  Gives context.  Let's you build some small semblance of relationship, aside from just a single post.\n\nI think it would be neat to have more opportunity to build up virtual relationships more like we do IRL.  It's like going to a bar, hanging out with people, and everyone just writing down their thoughts on slips of paper and passing them around.  Everyone's wearing a hat &amp; mask.  No one makes any noise.  The comments might be awesome, but you lose something.\n\nI'd love to have some reddit friends, ones that I've interacted with before.  Those interactions would just be more rich than the post-by-post anonymous way it is now.  I'll just have to settle for IRL / in-the-flesh friends for now.

{"body": "I have the 37 by 9.5 inch version and i can give you a short review Pros: Construction is absolutely amazing. This board is a few pounds lighter than any other board of its type i have ever ridden. When you look at it you can see how well Earthwing has done with the new technology. The concave is very nice. The w is great for tucking and also really helps lock you in on your back foot. It kinda tapers out to the front which creates a pocket for your front foot between the end of the w concave and the front wheel flares. its super comfortable. i've found that the kick tail is super effective as well, mainly due to the light weight of the board. Absolutely great for popping up curbs. Board has a tiny bit of dampening flex but nothing to worry about. Had it up to 30 and it was fine. Cons While i do love the concave of this board in general, i feel that the front wheel flares are a little small and could be a little bigger, but this is just personal preference. I also didn't like how narrow the board was at first coming from a dropthrough that was very wide, but i soon found this to actually be a huge benefit in freeriding as i could basically keep my feet in the same place all the time. This really helped me build confidence at higher speed freeriding as i didn't have to think about my feet. That being said it could be a good choice to go with the wider version if you like to have your entire foot on the board. All in all this is an incredible board. I would highly recommend getting it if you are looking for a topmount that is similar to the darkside or nessie.

Before she knows it the door to the basement is closed and family 5 chains her up. She screams, \"What do you want from me?!\" To which the entirety of family 5 replies...\"About tree fiddy\".

{"body": "&gt; I think I see, you are arguing against weak atheism.\n\nPretty much\n\n&gt; I don't need proof, only counter examples. Greek and Hindu gods were the agents behind the weather, luck, fertility, agents behind the things that were out of our human control and helped bring about the creation of the world. The God of Abraham is the agent behind the creation of the world and the things that are beyond our control. What if there really is a God who created the universe, and is pulling the strings of the things beyond our control? What if these religions only saw specs of this real God and ran with their own interpretations?\n\nRight, but there is no commonality between them. What I'm trying to say is that there are no universal characteristics of a god/gods other then maybe being 'in charge' as it were. Although I guess I can see where you are getting at, it being that maybe they are all seeing one part of the same god?\n\n&gt; What if there just are no independent sources? Are you suggesting that things cannot happen if multiple sources cannot verify them?\n\n No of course not, what I mean to say is that usually important things that change the history usually have independent sources. That's why I'm arguing that without independent sources verifying at least a few of these claims, claims that are really important mind you, we can't say that these things happened. \n\nThat being said, even if independent sources do verify that a miracle did happen, religion would still have to prove the divinity of this miracle. for all we know it could be something that we understand now, but not back then. Like the sun being blacked out for example could just be an eclipse.\n\n\n&gt; As for the scientific evidence that it could happen, you don't need any, it is a miracle, by definition they break science. Are you saying miracles cannot happen?\n\n I think I might have not communicated my point here well. While I grant you that by definition miracles break science, what I mean to say is that we would have some scientific evidence that they did at least happen in the first place. Surely miracles leave a physical trace that we can see. Things like mountains moving and such should leave some trace that we can see.\n\n&gt; Lack of proof does not mean the thing does not exist. Just because there is no reason that you can find for it existing, does not mean it does not exist.\n\nYes but why should I even think its possible to exist without any good reason for it? Its kind of like when Laplace presented his system of the solar system to Napoleon, and Napoleon asked why there was no mention of a created, and Laplace replied \"I had no need of that hypothesis\"\n\nReally though, what I'm trying to get at the most is that its fine if we don't know something exists and then discover it at some point. It is not fine that people have been claiming that something exists and we can't find it even after looking for ages. Things like big foot, loch ness monster ect. would be examples (Even though most of these have been proven to be hoaxes).\n\nIf you never see it in your whole life does that make the statement \"electricity does not exist\" true? Same goes with the God claim, if I have never seen or witnessed the existence of God, does that mean god does not exist? And the answer is no.\n\n For this I would have to point to the answer I gave in the previous paragraph.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408505206", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I want to start off by saying that this all happened in a very dark period of my life.  I was drinking heavily 5-6 nights a week and consuming whatever was in front of me.  This lifestyle had led into me making several fucked up decisions and putting myself in some really shitty situations.  Multiple bar scuffles, lots of me trying to put the people around me down, turning most of my close friends away from me, and one urinating in public ticket.  Eventually, my girlfriend at the time got sick of my shit and left.  This only pushed me further down rabbit hole.  I was currently waiting tables at this lunch bistro, and my days soon began to consist of me buying a small bottle of vodka to drink during the shift, then going to a dive bar nearby and getting near or blackout drunk. Rinse. Repeat.  One day I'm at this dive bar, just starting to get toasty; in walks let's call her Ellie.  Let's be real, Ellie was probably about a 6, but I didn't give a fuck.  In my drunken state I decide to send her a drink, and she takes the bait.  We get to talking, and in what seemed about 5 minutes later we are in the bathroom and she is giving me a beej.  Time wise it gets fuzzy I was browned out pretty hard.  There was this clear memory though, where she stops looked up at me and said, \"I'm married,\" which I shrugged off.  After that day Ellie becomes part of the routine.  I'd get to that bar start drinking, and eventually she would come in and we'd get to business.  Eventually we start going back to my place and fucking.  Ellie may have only been a 6, but god fucking her was like being in porn.  She attacked my dick like a fucking ravenous dog.  As this goes on for a couple weeks, Ellie slowly starts to tell me about how she married this guy in Medical School.  Her husband was never around, and left her feeling lonely most days.  She thought that after he graduated it would be different, but the guy was still distant.  I guess I should have felt bad, but I felt at the time that I was just giving her what she needed.  Some sort of physical connection to a person.  In return she was also giving one sort of connection to this world beyond my drinking.  The night it all stopped seemed like any other night.  We had come back from the bar, had some sex and were relaxing in the bed.  Out of nowhere Ellie looked at me with a terrified look.  \"What's wrong?\" I asked her.  It turned out she had forgot to save money to get a cab ride home before her husband got back.  I wasn't worried, told her I would pay for it, and asked how much she would need. She said, \"I'm gonna need about Tree-Fiddy.\"  It was about that time that the beer goggles feel off, and I realized Ellie was actually a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408553073", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I called in, and said it was a code 17; basic re-route to avoid potentially dangerous weather.\n\nWe were approved, and the Co-Pilot and I started procedure 6 (Re-Route).  We brought altitude down, and shifted the plane a few hundred meters to the right.\n\nNow here's where the shit started to hit the fan.  The TSA agent said that there was an active threat on board.  Standard protocol is to lock the cabin doors, and alert authorites.  We did as we were told and prepared to land at the nearest port (About 100 miles away).  At this point me and Mark (the co-pilot) started to get incredibly nervous.  Neither of us had ever been in a situation like this.  I had only been flying for 2 years and this point, and he was a fairly new pilot as well.\n\nWe start descending altitude slightly, and heard a knock at the door, followed by a scream from a younger passenger saying \"he has a gun\".  We opened the door immediately (breaking protocol), and a 2 men walked into the cabin.  The first man was taller, and had a large birthmark on his face.  The second man was also fairly tall, but very chubby.  He shot Mark, and immediately pointed the gun at my head.  I begged for him not to shoot, and asked what he wanted.  He said, I need money!  I immediately asked how much, and he said \"I need about tree fitty\".  It was then I realized that this was not a terrorist, but a 7 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit!

{"body": "I don't know what creepypasta is, but I've actually seen this before and I don't think it's funny. At all. Long story incoming. \n\nYears and years ago I was a regular on an old board dedicated to modding Doom. Well, that's how it started, but because the Internet was new we kind of all became pretty close and it really evolved into just a way we could all keep in touch. We chatted about our lives, complained with each other about school and work, talked about video games, helped each other through hard times. I'm still in touch with a lot of those guys. It was a lot of fun. \n\nUntil something like this started happening there.\n\nIt started with a PM to a user, johnboy229. Obviously, he asked if we had gotten one too but none of us had. It was from a username we had never seen before, the kind of username that was clearly generated by a computer as the numbers and letters were far too random to be the work of a human being. It was simple:\n\n\"I know what you did.\"\n\nThat's all. Five words, one sentence. It was obviously spam, right? We all laughed at the transparency of it -- even though the Internet was still new we were all savvy enough not to fall for something so ludicrously obvious. We also teased johnboy a lot. \"What *did* you do?\" He would just laugh and say he was pretty boring and hadn't ever done anything with his life, definitely not anything worth this kind of attention. We kind of shrugged it off. But the next day, johnboy got the same pm, this time from a different username. It said the same thing:\n\n\"I know what you did.\"\n\nWe told him to ignore it, but it started coming with more and more regularity. He would block the user but another computer generated name would pop up, another pm, all saying the same thing. After a couple weeks johnboy was starting to get a little rattled. We were *sure* it was spam. But none of us got it, just him. What kind of spam targets just one person? He showed us the screen shots of his email and message boxes. Hundreds and hundreds of PMs all saying the same thing. We were puzzled but just assumed it was a virus or bug, the random musings of some weirdo hacker. We reported it, you know, but the admins were never around. The board wasn't big enough for anyone to care.\n\nA month later, johnboy wrote a farewell post. He said that this was getting too personal, and he couldn't do it anymore. We told him to stay, don't like this hacker get you down. That's exactly what they want. Turns out, he had gotten a phone call.\n\n\"I know what you did,\" a voice said. \n\nThen it hung up. He said the voice was obviously computer generated. But he said there was a malice there. Is that possible? We thought he was making it up at this point just for a laugh. *He* was worried, but mostly just furious. How did the hacker get his number? Maybe the hacker traced his IP... We had no idea. We told him just to stay and not give in. Keep us updated. He agreed but said that he was going to report this to the police. The calls kept coming, though. And the emails. And the PMs. That's when his posts started to get a little weird. He began to openly blame himself for things, but really vaguely:\n\n\"What if I did something awful I don't remember?\" he kept saying. \"What if I deserve this?? I really am a shit, you guys. Just a shit person. The only thing I deserve is pain and suffering. Nothing good.\"\n\nHe unplugged his phone (yes, phones were once plugged in), but began to receive calls at work. Twice an hour. Three times an hour. Each time, the same voice, the same sentence, the same five words.\n\n\"I know what you did.\"\n\nHe took vacation. Stayed inside his house for days. The board was pretty much his only social outlet, and he began to post there a lot, maybe out of boredom, maybe because his mind was attempting to hold on to the final, dwindling strings of his sanity. But the PMs and emails kept coming. And johnboy was fraying more and more. I have some of his private messages to me saved still. Here's one of the literally hundreds. They all sounded pretty much the same, all almost exactly like this one:\n\n\"I had a dream about the Accuser [that was what he took to calling it]. I was in a dark room. And there was graffiti everywhere. And it said 'I know what you did' all over. And I woke up and I knew I was guilty of something. This isn't random, Andrew. I did something and I deserve this... this whatever is happening to me. I'm an awful human being. The Accuser, he knows. He knows that I am human slime. My sins will be purged soon enough. I know this. I saw eyes in my windows, were they the Accuser's eyes? I don't know how many times, but I know they were his. I have done something, Andrew. Something I did. I can't live like this anymore. I don't deserve to live. I want to be clean. I want to be purged. I want to be new. But it's too late. It's too late. I can't change my past. I can only hope the purge comes quickly and ends just as quickly. I hope the Accuser is merciful.\"\n\nThey were all like that. Talking about purging and sins and how he didn't deserve anything good, only suffering. I tried to help him but he'd just shrug me off. I didn't know what he did, he'd say.\n\nThen, one day, he told me his doorbell rang. It was 3 am. He went to the door but nobody was there, just a note, scrawled hastily in what looked like human blood. I wish to god I still had the picture of it that he took, but it went down when my old hard drive failed. It was gruesome. One sentence. Five words.\n\n\"I know what you did.\"\n\nHe quit the board, not because he wanted to, but because we made him. We were all a little shaken. We resolved to quit too if anyone received any messages like this one. This had gotten too real, too quickly. The board was fun, but it wasn't worth this.\n\nAfter a few months, we hadn't heard from johnboy. I'm ashamed to say, we kind of forgot about it. Wrote it off. Then another user, doommechx, got an email from someone claiming to be related to johnboy. He forwarded the e-mail to all of us. \n\nJohnboy had committed suicide. Was driven to suicide by this awful person who would not leave him alone. We all grieved, but life goes on. You know? We missed johnboy a lot. But there was nothing we could do for him now. I wish so much I could go back, to tell him to get out of there. How could we have known that it was real? That it wouldn't stop? That it wasn't spam? I live with that every single day of my life.\n\nThen one day, maybe 6 months later, *I* got a pm. It was a computer generated username. One sentence. Five words.\n\n\"Can I get about *treefiddy*?\"\n\nAnd that's when I knew it was the God damned Loch Ness monster.

{"body": "Mike said I wasn't suppose to speak unless someone said something to me first. The man shook Mike's hand and said thanks. He walked back over to the woman on the table and told me to watch. He stuck his dick in the wound he cut on her stomach. He started thrusting and I squeezed Mike's hand hard. This wasn't fun.\n\nMike looked at me with a very concerned look on his face. He cleared his throat. The man said, \"You and your bitch can go. Thanks for watching!\" He was enthusiastic about it. Made it worse.\n\nWe sat on a couch and I told him I wanted to leave. He said we would but I was new and that meant I had to see each room. He said he'd explain later but that we were being watched and it would be less of a hassle to just go with it. We had to spend at least 10 minutes in each room. He said it again. \"We HAVE to stay in each room for a minimum of 10 minutes. Unless given permission to leave.\" We got up and went to the first room on the right.\n\nThe walls were a different color, not the red of the rooms on the left. This was black. There was a large TV on the wall with large chairs in front of it. They were large enough for two but smaller than a loveseat. Some men and a few women were there sitting. We stood at the back next to a camera. I noticed one of the women was holding a guy's hand. That made me feel better for some reason.\n\nThe screen turned on and there was a girl tied to a chair. A man walked into the frame and held up a sign that said, \"VOTE\". Mike grabbed a control pad from an empty chair. They were like what you see at bars to play those interactive games. On the screen were options, \"anal, vaginal, and oral\". Mike said these rooms were where we could view other places like this one and the red rooms were broadcast to other clubs. We didn't have to be quiet in here.\n\nHe explained that it's just like those trivia games but with sex and more hardcore stuff. Oral had been voted by this time and I saw there were about 200 votes for that option alone. There were maybe 10 people in this room. I asked Mike how many clubs there are and he shrugged.\n\nThe man on the screen pulled his dick out and made the girl suck it. After a few minutes, a second man appeared and held up the VOTE sign. \"Anal, vaginal, oral, other\"\n\n\"What's other?\" I asked. Mike said it's like what that guy in the red room was doing.\n\nOther won. They cut a hole in her breast and started fucking. I went into shock. I sat down in a chair. Mike sat next to me. I heard the woman who was new like me giggle. She fucking laughed!?\n\nVOTE again. This was about 20 minutes in. Mike looked at the voting pad and asked if I wanted to go. I said yes and we stood up as I saw \"eyes\" flash on the screen. The new woman in the front row squealed and said she was excited.\n\nThe next few rooms were more of the same but each woman was a different ethnicity. Then a man with a woman wearing a strap on, then two men, then another woman. Mike said the feeds start at about the same time with an hour in between. They're far enough apart so one is always playing. This new room we walked in to was already in session. Two men were having sex with wounds on a woman's stomach while fingering each other. It had a timer in the corner: 49 minutes.\n\nVOTE came up on the screen.\n\n\"Behead\" flashed up.\n\nWhat? Like, a sex position? Mike told me to close my eyes but I couldn't. She started screaming. Pleading in a language I didn't recognize.\n\nThey sawed her head off while fucking her stomach. They then fucked her severed head and the hole in her neck.\n\nThey finished on her face and kicked her body off the chair. They set her head on the seat and the message, \"Thanks for watching. Next show in one hour.\" Came up.\n\nI had to leave. Mike took me to a couch. He explained how this is what people pay to see. Every time you vote, you have to log into their system and it charges your credit card. He also said that as a new person, I HAD to see each room. \"Why? What if I leave? This isn't fun, Mike. I want to go.\"\n\nIf you leave, they'll put you in one of the shows.\n\nI took a deep breath. We had just a few rooms left. We went into the next ones but left while they were still having sex on screen. The last room had 3 men and one woman on screen. They were clearly drugged and a man was giving them instructions in another language. They were all covered in blood. A second woman lay on the ground with blood pooling around her. They had been eating her.\n\nVOTE\n\n\"Man\" flashed on screen. The guy giving directions said something and the woman bit one of the men's dick off. She spat it out and started eating the wound. The other men started wherever they could. We left.\n\nOn our way out, the guy who took our stuff laughed at me and said it's not for everyone. He then gave our stuff back and asked Mike if I was ok. Mike said he trusted me and that I would stay quiet. He gave the guy some money, \"for looking after our stuff and keeping us safe.\"\n\nI pulled out my wallet and saw a business card in it.\n\n\"If you ever want to come back, that'll get you in.\"\n\nI asked how much I owed for keeping my stuff.\n\n\"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that point I realized this man was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408749164", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The III's were no joke, that's for sure. However, the II's in this case have full powered armor, shielding, near instant reflexes, and top-class augmentations on their side. Had the III's been outfitted with the same Mjolnir armor the II's were in, this battle would be a clear-cut victory for them. However, this changes things completely. The III's would follow their training, behaving as a more standard SPECOPS group would. \n\nThe Spartan III's would separate into fire teams ranging from roughly four to eight by my best guess. The II's, however, would likely organize into groups of three due to their superior capabilities, and the fact that this would allow for even distribution of force with eleven fire teams. The Spartan II's would not engage directly, using guerrilla hit-and-run tactics. \n\nThe III's would have the advantage of stealth modules, but I doubt this would give them any distinct advantage, considering they'd lose the element of surprise as soon as they engaged. Also, the stealth is not nearly as perfect as the covenant's, which have been easily spotted by II's in the past. \n\nThe previous ten years of experience the II's would have engaging both humans (giving them some direct insight into engagement against human enemies and weaponry) and covenant (thereby experiencing combat against a technologically superior enemy, plus deployment against stealth Sangheilis) would give them quite an edge when coupled with their training. On the other hand, the Spartan III's would only have the benefit of experience fighting better equipped, physically capable, and shielded enemies, which definitely wouldn't hurt, but would only go so far.\n\nAssuming that they are the only ones on the battlefield, meaning no civilians or other intruders, and that they are equally equipped for their numbers, I'd have to give the II's the edge. Not only have they proven in the past that they are supremely resourceful, even when drastically under-equipped, they have also proven very capable when engaging larger, better equipped combatants. Direct me to one three-man group of capable Spartan II's that would be unable to engage fifteen elites on familiar (as in non-covenant) ground without any prior engagement rules and come out on top. \n\nThe Spartan II's would engage on their own terms and whittle down enemy forces while ensuring they maintain their own force's cohesiveness and inertia, while the III's would be attempting a seek and destroy type tactic against the II's. This would mean their greater numbers would be an influence in single engagements, but overall, their superior force would mean very little.\n\nAssuming the III's take six man teams, and the II's take three man teams, the II's would only need to win approximately 80% of the engagements (assuming a loss for either side means total victory without casualties) to come out on top. I believe this is totally achievable for the Spartan II's, and the III's would end up losing.\n\nThis is all just an educated guess by a fanboy. Yes, I did favor the Spartan II's highly. No, I do not bear a grudge or distaste for Spartan III's. Do I think this is by any means a logical or conclusive decider in the II vs. III debate? Absolutely not. The II's had better equipment, training, and position in this conflict. It takes a soldier of great skill and capability to turn smaller numbers into an advantage, but the II's could pull it off if at all possible. For those who think that the III's would all bunch together and be an amorphous blob of 300 stealthy super-soldiers moving as quickly as a single running III and capable of firing in all directions at once, and that the II's would have to fight them head on in one big, open area firefight: well, this isn't for you. \n\n\n\nTLDR: Tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408752555", "subreddit": "halo", "score": 46, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Back when I was 21 and just coming into the fit guy I am today I had a date with this girl. We had met off POF which was the only way I was comfortable talking to girls for a long time. At this point in my life I thought this experience was kind of normal but now that I have had a few more years of dating/relationships I see how bat shit crazy this girl was. So first night I invite her out she stands me up and texts me the next day about something with her aunt needing to buy shoes or some shit... who knows..\n\nShe seemed like a great girl online and well I was new to this whole social interaction thing. So the next night we meet up at a taco bell. She looked pretty similar to her pics except this scar on her cheek that looked like the one out of the Butterfly Effect when the girl gets cracked by that wooden plank with the nail... anyways we are there for literally hours talking and talking about everything... video games, life, school, work, you name it. I didn't even care we weren't doing anything. I'm nervous as fuck and as we leave I give her a hug and an awkward bye. I thought to myself \"FUCK I FUCKED IT ALL UP, back to forever alone\"\n\nThe next day we are texting and it's like 1am and I said how much I had a great time and she was confused and thought I didn't like her. So she asked what I was doing and I tell her i'm in my hot tub (was totally being honest risking phone death for this girl) She asks if she can join me and I give her the address. She shows up almost 2am and we hot tub. I don't know what hot tub water does for girls but it was like the biggest aphrodisiac I have ever seen. She jumps me, bikini comes off and shes grinding me under the water. Well water isn't great lube but what the fuck do I know. Shes riding me and to this day have never felt more pain in my life from the pain in the rubbing. But this nerd is getting laid!\n\nFast forward a week and i'm still talking to her and she mentions how she can't hang out specifically today and can't talk to me or anything. I was weirded out a bit but okay. So I go over the next day to her apartment and she shows me a bunch of stuff she just got, most of it is really kinky lingerie. Turns out she has a sugar daddy in the city and sees him like once a week. This was weird to me because I was secretly thinking to myself about how she wasn't that attractive to have one but mmm okay.... I should have ran there.\n\nShe then finds out I am half german and had exchanges there and demands I only speak to her in german when we have sex. I try it out but it really wasn't working for me. Keep in mind I had just lost a ton of weight and coming into the realization that I was attractive to girls. A girl could pretty much do anything to me and I would try to look past it.\n\nWe take a drive down to her \"favorite part\" near this lake around 2am and its literally just like a boat launch area and I get mad because there was a toll on the way there. Out of nowhere this other car appears and i'm a little weirded out because well its 2am in the middle of nowhere. So a guy walks over and she invited her ex because she wanted him to see her with her new \"german\" guy... what the fuck do i know... maybe she was into the aryan race.. who knows.. We both get out and now standing on this beach and he approaches from the water, all of a sudden as he appears he turns into the Lochness Monster and asks for about tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408794539", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh shit story time! It's long but its definitely worth it! Alright so me and my friends were walking down main street at like 2 in the morning because we were stupid teenagers with nothing to do. We pass this ally and theres some dudes smoking weed and they called us over. We were nervous at first but it was some older dudes we've seen around before so we thought why the fuck not? We went over and they gave us some weed (it was my first time so i was a little excited) and we talked for like an hour. They said we could hang out with them some time and said they'd keep in touch. About a week later i get a text from the guy and says they're all hanging out at some dudes house and gave us the address. We go over there and we're all drinking and shit when the older guys make us an offer. They want us to sell weed at the highschool and they say we will get a cut of the profits. We were the average highschool delinquents so of course we did it, and we did it well. About a month passes and we didn't get caught. This is where it gets really interesting. After dropping off our regular profits one day, they ask us to stay a little longer. They wanted us to take all the money to the guy above them because apparently they couldnt do it that day. We do it because so far these guys didn't screw us over or anything. We get to the address and a big black dude opens the door says \"who the fuck are you?\" We tell him we were there in place of Michael (One of the guys we had been selling for), and he takes us inside. There are guns on the table and drugs everywhere and the 3 of us were about to piss ourselves. He walks us into another room with a fat black guy and Says \"Hey boss, that boy Michael sent these kids to do his dirty work.\" We all knew at that time we were definitely in too deep. We give the fat black guy the big of money and he starts counting it. After he's done, he stands up and asks us if we're trying to fuck him and wants to know where the rest is. We thought we were about to die. I asked him how much is missing and he says \"About tree fiddy.\" It was about that time I realized the big fat black dude was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408866855", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Not only did we show up to this poor old lady's class hyper from lunch, but we were an AWFUL group of kids. Im a smart ass, but when im with my equally smart ass friends we can be unbearable. Plus, add in your typical school assholes, jocks and such, it was not a good time for her.\n\nThe teacher was an older woman. Rather fat too. While I was a bad kid all the same, some of the others really dug at this lady. It caused her to leave the school around December - all thanks to my class. We had substitutes for a few weeks, one of which was close friends with her, and let us know how we should all feel bad for starting her depression again, and causing her to become an alcoholic. I do feel pretty bad, honestly.\n\nKids always told the subs, \"Beware 6th hour! They're spooky scary and will make you quit your job!\" They werent wrong. Even the subs said fuck it, and quit subbing that class after a day or so. It always started the same, the sub would come in and say \"Ive heard bad things about you kids, but it'll be different this time.\" It never was.\n\nUntil one day, our new teacher arrived. This was a big man. Built. Rich as fuck, apparently had his own company or something that made him fat stacks. He walked into the class 5 minutes after it was supposed to start, walked to the front and wrote **\"Coach C\"** on the board. I still dont know the man's name. He was just \"Coach C\", or even \"C\". Oh but there was reason behind it. But that would all make sense come May.\n\nNow, Coach C just grins. Some kids start into him, bitching at him for being late. Coach C walks over to this kid, laughs, and says \"Get the fuck out.\" The kid got the fuck out, with very little fight. This was when we learned that Coach C was NOT FUCKING AROUND. This dude was serious. We were scared.\n\nHe tells us, \"Im only here for one reason. I dont care about your behavioral issues, although it will not be tolerated.\" He kept it very mysterious, but we knew shit was real. The fear amplified.\n\nThe next few months of school, we fucking learned physical science. The fear kept us in line, because who knew what this man could do. We heard stories and rumors about him being a murderer from some rural lake town. Regardless, we all made good grades for the next few months. Unfortunately the damage was done and most of us had to retake the class, myself included. \n\nI have a fairly small school, in a fairly small town, so it wasnt uncommon that on the last week of school, hardly anyone showed up. On the very last day, I got to Physical Science, and it was just me and Coach C. I expected him to give us work like he had before, although there were no more grades.\n\nI sat down as far away as I could, and he went on with his business. At one point he walked over to me and looked down. I was on my phone, and I was caught. Of all the times to get in trouble - the last day of school... I wasnt too pleased.\n\nI was sick of it. Coach C had pushed us around, and i wasnt having it. I said, \"Coach C... Tell me. Why do you do this? You make us scared, for what?\" He smiled, and I remembered - he told us he had a job at this school. *To fix our behavior problems?*, i asked myself? No. He told us that wasnt important.\n\nAnd suddenly, it all clicked. The look on his face, body, his eyes.. It hit me. I suddenly realized why he was Coach C. I realized he wasn't a teacher at all, he was a giant 500 feet tall crustacean from the paleolithic era! He looked down at me with those big red eyes and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\n\n\n\n**Side Note:** This story is actually entirely true, except that we did know Coach C's name, dont recall what it was though. He really was this massive hardass, who told us he was here for his own reasons. The only difference is that when I walked into his class alone on the last day of school, instead of him fussing at me for having my phone, he didnt care and went back to what he was doing. I asked what his reason was, and he simply told me \"To better myself as a salesperson and a business official. I seem to have done something well.\", and the bell rang. That was the last time I saw Coach C.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408910904", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Story time:  \n\nOnce I was out in Vegas with a few friends. College graduate trip, that sorta deal.  \n\nSo we get out on the strip, have a few drinks, and hit up a casino.  Now I'm not a gambling man usually, but I had some graduation money (about 3k or so) and was itching to trade it in for some more. We hit the slots, the blackjack, and the poker, but nothing was as tempting as the craps table.   \n\nNow let me tell you, when you're buzzed and have a little money to spend, you like to show off. So we're causing a little ruckus at the craps table, and a small crowd is starting to gather. This one chick is eyeing me and I can't help but smile. My confidence growing, I beckon her over to blow the dice, and I mean she is hot. Brunette, 5'7, tight green dress that showed off her small perky tits and generous ass. I mean she could bounce quarters off that baby.  \n\nSo she comes over, strutting in her heels, and blows on the dice, then blows me a kiss. I'm just a small town boy, but this chick..phew! She's something else. She winks at me and blows me a kiss as I bet 1000 on my roll. And I win! My crowd is going wild, the table host is loving it, and this hot chick is all over me. Life. Is. Good.  \n\nSo this girl, let's call her Amanda, she leans over and gives me a kiss on the lips, and whispers in my ear: \"why don't we take the party somewhere else?\"  Now I'm no dummy, I knew this was a scam to get some money. So I tell her I wanna bet one more, and I put that extra thousand on the table, and give those bad boys a roll. A 3 and a 4, just as predicted, and I mean Lady Luck is on my side tonight boys!  So I grab Amanda, kiss her on the lips, give the extra cash to my friends, and I leave with her.  \n\nWe get back to her place, and she tells me the real deal, which some of you may have guessed: she's a prostitute.  But she is a high end hooker. Not some run of the mill Duluth street walker, but a classy broad who fucks for dough.  So she tells me that she was on a night off, but can cut me a discount if I want to have a little fun. She likes my accent, and is a gracious host.  Pours me a drink, and one for herself. We get to taping, and she is a pretty cool lady. So I tell her we can play a bit. She asks what I want, and I say a blow job.  \n\nSo she unzips my pants, pulls my member out of my boxers, and starts going to town. Now I'm average size, but she's on it like a fat kid slurping down a hot dog.  So she's twirling her tongue like a linguistic ballerina, and I can't hold it back. I blow a load in her mouth like a long overdue Yellowstone. She swallows but it's leaking out of the corner of her mouth. Her eyes are shut with ecstasy and her smile is to die for.  \n\nSo we clean up, and I go for my wallet, and I ask her how much it is. I'm willing to pay whatever for this experience. She looks in my eyes and says with a voice so sweet, \"for you babe?

{"body": "Funny story. About 2 months ago Guy Fieri was having a little BBQ. Apparently he had this popping new potato salad recipe and wanted to show it off. Him and Nick knew each other for years, and for some reason he always felt the need to show off to Nick (I guess he never thought he'd \"make it\" until Nick acknowledged his success), so he dialed Nick up and invited him over.\n\nNick, knowing how much I liked potato salad from a previous podcast I did (Potato Salad Weekly, nick was a long time fan of the show...well he was at least until my Co-Host made the announcement that no potato salad should ever lack pickles. That was the last episode Nick watched. Even though he stopped listening to show, we kept in touch. Trading potato salad recipes and such), invited me along. \n\nAt the time ParkerVCP had this vagrant named Max who would just hang around his map dev server. We all thought he was just this crazy old man because he was constantly screaming about shift registers and pigs. We felt bad for Max, he really had no place to stay, and with all his yelling about pigs, we assumed he'd enjoy some BBQ, so we invited him along.\n\nOn the way to the BBQ (I was driving by the way, not that it has anything to do with this story, but I like to point out the fact that Nick is Asian and can't drive, as often as I can) we seen some guy on the side of the road. He was drawing this complex design in red chalk, and kept lighting it on fire. We seen this, and had to pull over to see what he was doing. When we got near, we noticed he kept mumbling to himself \"see, what did I tell you about redstone dust? it's useless, it's all about the command blocks. You could do amazing things with command blocks, only amateurs use redstone dust\".\n\nAfter hearing that, I was ready to pull away, but Max jumped out of the car. \"Non-sense\" he cried. \"You can't make a shift register in command blocks! We don't have the pigs to do so\". At this point, I was ready to ditch both of them, but Nick made me stop. \"They're on to something\" he said, while inviting them both back into my car.\n\nA little upset that Nick would keep inviting these crazy people into my car, I went along with it. It wasn't my BBQ, I was just Nick's guest. Who am I to say who can come or not? So we continued onto Guy's house.\n\nWhen we got there, it was a bit strange. We assumed there would be a ton of people, but there wasn't. We could smell the BBQ coming from behind the house, but didn't hear or see anyone. Moesh (he's the guy we picked up on the way. While driving Nick was able to calm him down by promising him the car wasn't running on redstone, and didn't need re-balancing. He was then able to get his name) looked scared, but I calmed him down again. I told him \"Don't worry little moeshy poo. Guy is a big star on the Food Network, you have nothing to be afraid of\", but I was lying. Something was off. I was expecting lots of people, but I seen none. Hesitantly we approached his door. \n\nWe heard a big booming voice coming from behind the house \"Come on in, things are popping in the back\". Feeling a little better about the situation we enter his house, and make our way out to the back door. \n\nAs we walked out the back door, we heard that booming voice again. \"Did you bring the money, Nick?\" That was about the time we noticed that Guy Fieri was actually a 500 foot tall plesiosaur from the Mesozoic era. \"Dammit, Guy. I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409065121", "subreddit": "Minecraft", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The last eleven years of my life have been worthwhile watching.\n\nAt 20, after two years of deep depression I tried to kill myself, failed and resolved to get better.  I was on antidepressants for a year then, against the advice of my counsellor, I quit them, got a job at the other end of the country and saved money to go overseas.  I worked 14 hour days, saving everything I earned.\n\nI got hired for the Camp America program out of a recruitment fair in Auckland, worked there for three months and had my first \"romantic involvement\" of my life that was more than a few encounters, I lost a shitload of weight and started feeling good about myself for the first time in years.\n\nI moved to Canada to play rugby with a cousin I hadn't seen since I was twelve and, after losing so much weight, found I was really good, despite having not played in a year.  I learned a trade and was making some good money, I made some really tight friends, had my first long term relationship, we moved in together, and I brought her back to NZ to meet my family.\n\nShe left me immediately after getting back to Canada, plunging me back into depression to the point I was selling my stuff to get a plane ticket home when my three tightest friends held an \"intervention\" of sorts and convinced me not to go, which was the turning point in my life.\n\nI spent the summer living in a house with six other guys, drinking booze, chasing women and having a great time.  That fall, my close buddy and I decided to get our own place and grow up some, that November I also met a new girl.\n\nIn February, she had her godfather die in a car crash, an old friend die due to an undiagnosed kidney disease, her car was written off in the parking lot while she was inside working then the rental she had from her insurance got T-boned at an intersection.  To top it off, we got pregnant and she miscarried.  That St. Paddy's day, I was told that although I had taken a lower pay rate in exchange for sponsorship to Canada, my boss had not actually filed any paperwork and I was going to be sent home in two weeks.\n\nThis girl and I hated the idea of a LDR but agreed that it was worth a try.  After *six days* back in NZ, I had a new visa for a year and I was back that Summer.  We moved in together, I proposed and we went house shopping.  We couldn't get a mortgage until I was a Permanent Resident, so we went to find out about applying for PR status. I wouldn't let her sponsor me in case it ever became a question in her mind at any point in the future but after finding out that my new boss had fucked me just like the last one, we decided to do it ourselves.  \n\nWe went to a consultancy firm and the rep stole $1200 from me and fucked off - leaving me out of status again - and by the time we found out, it was two months before the wedding and we decided to keep it quiet and announce it at the wedding.  We moved to NZ together that summer and took whatever jobs we could get.  My PR came back 13 months later and we surprised my best friend at his wedding, he had no idea we were coming despite me blabbing to just about everyone.\n\nMy last company had a change of ownership and I got my old job back - after we landed on the Monday, I started work on the Wednesday.  We bought a house that September, I got promoted to a nice office job and we got pregnant right away.  Our son was born this past April and we lived happily ever after.\n\n\n\nNo Loch Ness monster, but it would have fit in there somewhere.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409067063", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

It first aired on the [Fox network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company) in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) on May 2, 1999. In the episode, [Mr Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Burns) is jealous of megastore owner Arthur Fortune, who is beloved by the people of Springfield. In order to win the people's love, Burns gathers the help of [Homer Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson), [Professor Frink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Frink) and [Groundskeeper Willie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundskeeper_Willie) to capture the Loch Ness monster. The episode was rated TV-14-DL.\n\n&gt;The episode was written by [John Swartzwelder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swartzwelder) and directed by Mark Ervin. The idea for the episode was pitched by the *Simpsons* writing staff, who wanted to make an episode in which Mr Burns becomes a \"thrillionaire,\" a millionaire who goes on thrilling adventures. Although it would originally be green, a mistake in the overseas animation led to the Loch Ness monster looking pink, a mistake that was ultimately too expensive to fix. In its original broadcast, \"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\" was seen by approximately 7.26 million viewers, and finished in 43rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following the release of *The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season*, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/TfFYh61.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:John_Swartzwelder_Brighter_Sharper.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Groundskeeper ^Willie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundskeeper_Willie) ^| [^The ^Simpsons ^\\(season ^10)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_\\(season_10\\)) ^| [^King ^Kong ^in ^popular ^culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_in_popular_culture) ^| [^Lenny ^and ^Carl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_and_Carl) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ck0ym1t) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ck0ym1t)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409067705", "subreddit": "pokemon", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If you must know - My daughter was born with a debilitating birth defect.  It primarily affects the lower thoracic region.  The doctors gave her 2 months to live. \n\nAfter living at the hospital for 6 months, she was finally well enough to go home. However, with the heart issues she faced, there was little to no hope that she'd develop as a normal child would. \n\nOver time it became apparent that even the simple tasks we all take for granted would be hard fought battles for her. Things like learning how to drink from a sippy cup instead of a bottle were huge achievements.    \n\nHer heart trouble itself was causing a lot of physical developmental disabilities.  When she was 6 (long past when most kids learn to walk), she was finally crawling pretty well. But I cried every time she'd try and walk - she just wasn't strong enough to support her own body. \n\nEventually, we sought help outside of her normal group of doctors.  One in particular was in Colorado. He thought a strict regiment of physical training would help get her through the disabilities. \n\nShe finally learned to walk at 7 1/2 years old, but then life took another horrible turn for her and I - my wife was diagnosed with cancer. And the cancer was sufficiently advanced that there wasn't much to be done. \n\nAll my wife ever wanted was to see her daughter run like all the other children. To laugh and giggle, and to not be in pain. \n\nShe died 6 months later. \n\nMyself and my daughter were determined to make her mothers dream come true. Eventually, we had to look outside the US to some doctors in the UK. \n\nThey decided new prosthetics could be fitted   That would allow her to stand better. \n\nIt was a god send. She was finally able to walk without pain. \n\nAfter years and years of hard work (and strength training), she got to the point of unassisted walking.  She set her sights on running next. \n\nOver the next 4 years she finally was able to hobble/run. \n\nOn December 9th, 2004, she ran for the very first time. It was incredible. Her mom would've been so proud. \n\nI went back to the doctors and asked them what I could give them in return for making her dream come true - they said about tree fiddy.  It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.\n\nOf course tamp4x - Miracles can happen, but even tree fiddy won't save a troll like yourself. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409081936", "subreddit": "triathlon", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

One day in science class a girl who sat in the back of the class, I think her name was Ann, was heading to the bathroom and when she passed Lequira on her way up Lequira took her pencil and stabbed her in the side.

Well the teacher called security and when they arrived to take Lequira to the office she had a full blown meltdown, yelling about how \"she deserved it\" and random curses. When one guy tried to get near her, Lequira took the desk in front of her and swung it at the guy. Not a very effective weapon, the guy easily dodged it, but she let go of the desk, and I couldn't do anything as I saw it coming towards me. BAM the desk hit me right in the side of the head, Lequira was still screaming, now being dragged out by the security guards, and I just started laughing at the insanity of it all.

{"body": "I remember when I was in Vegas a few years ago, I saw Dwayne Johnson in the casino I was staying at. I started to walk towards him, hoping for an autograph or photo, but I was stopped by a large Russian security guard.

They're not the same thing.\nIf you're saying \"crow family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.\nSo your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people \"call the black ones crows?\" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

{"body": "Fuck all these logical explanations. I'll tell y'all what really happened.\n\nSo, one day, circa 3000 B.C.E. in ancient Egypt, JFK emerged from his time machine that he stole from the soviets. He looked around to discover he was where else, but the Martian mother ship. He walked through the dank hallways glowing with green slime until he reached what he figured was the bridge. He walked through the beads hanging from the doorframe and came into earshot of the Martian commander. The alien teleported to face him. JFK had made a deal earlier that year that he would build the pyramids as a testament to the otherwise unseen Martian rulers. JFK had in his hand the keys to a crane that the aliens could use to build the pyramids. He was going I trade these keys for a chance to see his country win the space race 5000 years later. \n\nFast forward to when JFK is back in modern day USA and the Martians are just about to finish the pyramids.\n\nJFK had forgotten one thing. Gas for the crane. The Aliens ran out of gas, so they waited 5000 years to hire Lee Harvey Oswald to shoot JFK whom they then stole the time machine from. With the time machine, they went back in time to finish the pyramids, waited another 5000 years, killed JFK again, then destroyed the time machine. \n\nNow here the Martians are, on earth, with no place to go but down into the ocean. They promptly did so. Once they reached the bottom of the ocean, they felt a sense of longing. They wanted to love. Upon this realization, the asexual organisms that the Martians obviously are began to breed. They bred and bred until they had something near 1000 spawn by yesterday. One day, though, they were haunted by a thing of the past that has only been rumored about up until now. An ancient debt they owe. When they first entered the ocean, they made a deal with a great beast who rules the ocean. Should they never pay back this debt, they would have to surface, exposing their luminescent bodies to the air above the ocean. This is the event that we have witnessed in the photos posted. The reason this happened is because they were caught by surprise by the great beast, unable to repay the debt they owe. Nessie swam up to them and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409099431", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Funny story,\n\nIt was 2003 and I was working my first job at a golf driving range.  I worked the late weekend shift, so I was always responsible for closing the facility.  This driving range was around some Marsh land so the bugs were horrible.  I literally have seen moths the size of hummingbirds!  Needless to say, the mosquitoes would suck on fresh shit for a drop of blood.  We actually had these net-suits we'd wear while shagging (collecting) the balls from the range.\n\nSo it was a fairly foggy night and I was out driving the tractor in my net-suit, picking up golf balls after the final golfer left and we closed.  My coworker, Arturo, was the only other dude there with me.  I am snagging balls at the far back fence where only hulking tryhards happy gilmore fuckers hit to, when I see some of the shrubbery moving.  Naturally, I stopped the tractor and said \"Arturo?\" but I only heard a grunt in reply.  I figured the boss had asked him to hand collect the golf balls that made it through or over the fence (because Arturo was Mexican, and my boss was a racist dick).  Anyway, its about this time that a huge shape starts to move toward the fence from the shadows.  I'm string hard at this point.  I go to start the tractor back up, but just before I do, a gruff voice calls out to me, but the words are not making sense to me.  Then it happens, I shit you not, out walks a Bigfoot looking thing.  I'm frozen at this point.  It walks right up to the fence.  I can literally smell it's breath.  It let's out a guttural roar before asking if I had any spare change, 'bout tree fifty worth.  It is at this time that I notice a long tentacle looking thing coming out from the bottom of what I would call a Hollywood quality Big Foot suit.  The tentacle stretched back out of sight in the direction of the lake.  At this point I realized it was that damned loch ness monster trying to get my three fifty.  I shouted a few slurs and finished up my job with a chip on my shoulder.\n\nAnd that is why I still 'Want to believe'.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409108433", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The year was 1986, we had just moved into a house my parents just bought. I was 6 years old, my brother was a newborn. \n\nWhen we moved in things already seamed strange. I had started speaking to an imaginary friend. He was German, and didn't speak Spanish and I didn't understand him, I called him Pepe. (I didn't know English at the time)\n\nPepe wasn't friendly, but brave little me stilled tried to play with him. He would yell a lot and liked to scare my brother. Every time he showed up the room would get cold, so I always knew when he was trying to sneak up on me. Then one day my brothers bottle disappeared. My parents didn't think anything about it since he would throw it all the time. \n\nOne day Pepe scarred my brother really god, and my mother yelled at me thinking that I did it. That's when I told her about Pepe. That only made her mad because she didn't believe me. Pepe thought it was funny that I got in trouble. \n\nA week later I woke up from my nap to the sound of my mother screaming and her pulling on me. When I opened my eyes I saw my brothers bottle next to me on my bed... Full of spoiled milk.. And Pepe trying to feed it to me. \n\nWhen I told my mother that Pepe was trying to feed me the bottle this time she believed me, because she tried to pick up the bottle and it was \"heavier than a car\". That's when I first hear of ghosts. \n\nMy parents ended up getting a priest to come over. Still remember him. His name was Father John. \n\nHe started by throwing holy water around the house. That's when Pepe came out. \n\nIt was at that moment when I noticed that Pepe was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes...  I was so scared but I sucked it up and asked \"What do you want from us, monster?\" And the monster bent down, and said, \"I need about tree-fitty.\" \n\nSo I told my parents and my dad said, \"I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!\" \n\nThat's when Pepe disappeared and I never seen him again. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409176224", "subreddit": "OKBestFace", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is a story I do not often tell. I promise, sincerely, that this has scarred me for life and although I have looked into psychological explanations for what I heard and natural explanations for what occurred, they remain unsatisfactory.\nWhen I was a child, I was scared of the dark. I swore to my mother I heard voices in it. They were not evil, but they were not familiar and so they scared me. It was not uncommon in the middle of the night for me to wake up and hear \"whispers\" as I would call them when asking my mom. She figured they were just \"bumps in the night\" and typical kids nightmare material. I tried often to explain to her that it was more than that, that they sounded different from one another the way people's voices do.\nOn some nights I would get so scared from these \"whispers\" that I would sleep in my mom's bed with her. It was an added bonus that the bathroom was directly outside of her bedroom door for my late-night tinkles.\nI should add at this point that when walking out into the hall to go to the bathroom, you looked directly down the stairs that would lead you into my living room on the first floor (as my mom's bedroom was on the second floor).\nOn one such night, around Christmas, I awoke and felt the need to relieve myself. I walked out from the door and distinctly heard the phrase \"Look!\" and to my astonishment, a red light, almost like a spotlight, was cast upon the wall at the very bottom of the stairs. The light had no other source, it was by itself, and I was transfixed by it.\nBeing a little kid, and it only being a few days from Christmas, I KNEW what this light was. IT WAS SANTA!!! How else could he get into my house to know I was being a good boy. I was so excited I began walking down the stairs to greet him, picking up my pace after the second step as it began to creep off the wall and fade into the darkness in my living room.\nThat's when I heard him. A very strong, masculine voice. Different from the first. Not at all like my father's (not to say he isn't masculine, it was just distinctly different). It said \"Stop! Right now. Go back up those stairs and get your mothers purse.\" \nI listened, turned around, retrieved my mother's purse from a hook she kept it on just inside her room. What happened next I am not sure I would believe if someone had told me this same story. After reaching the top of the stairs, I heard a very loud CRASH.  I looked around and the light began to take shape. It was hard to make out at first, but slowly dimmed as it grew larger and larger. At the same time the head like structure of it hovered over me. It bent down and I heard it whisper, \"I'm going to need about tree fiddy.\"  It was about this time that I could see the the light had taken the shape of a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era.  I ran back to my mother's bed where I jumped straight under the covers and stayed there the whole night.\nWhen we awoke the next morning, the poinsettia lights (little Christmas flower lights that glowed red) my mother had put on the railing down the stairs were pulled straight down to the bottom of the stairs, some broken from what seemed like a forceful tear, laying in a single pile. The dry sink in my living room had fallen from the wall. My mother could not explain it! My father was worried we had been the victims of a home invasion. My sister was crying.\nThere was nothing missing, nobody had broken in, there did not seem to be any reason this had happened. And then I saw it, and I kept quiet about it because I was so afraid that I could not force words out of my mouth.\nThere, on the edge of the wooden dry sink which had been facing up, were three indentations where the finish on the wood had been worn, almost as if in a forceful grip. Something down there had GRABBED IT AND THREW IT DOWN. That was what the bang was.\nI was mortified. After that day I never heard a single voice again. I do not like to imagine what was waiting downstairs for me that night, if it was anything at all, but I can tell you that the reality was that something had physically acted upon two things in my house near the bottom of that stairwell.\n\nAdapted from /u/momsdayprepper [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1m49bh/what_is_the_scariest_ghost_story_you_ever_heard/cc603q4)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409205024", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Wait for fucking any freak situation to happen and just cry and scream, probably\n\nEdit: sorry, this happened to me lately, my friends and I were climbing and one of my less experienced friends fell a good 20 feet. Oh shit. We started climbing down to him... But this girl we were with is just fucking WHALING. Now don't get me wrong, this was scary shit. But he needs help, now. Screaming and crying is just making things worse. Anyway, We're making our way to our friend, \"hold on buddy were almost there, try not to move too much\" I tried to yell, over this girl who's just going ham. I finally get to him, okay good he looks like he landed on flat dirt, no rocks that's good. \"Okay we're here you're gonna be fine. what hurts?\" he  was able to gasp out that his arms both we're throbbing in pain, and that he felt stiff. I'm getting my first aid kit out of my bag by this point. I can see his other arm has an obviously broken humorous, and he had a 3-4 inch deep cut on his forearm, but I'm more worried about a neck injury with a fall like that at the moment. The girl finally stops screaming and goes into a \"oh my god oh my god\" hysteric sob. Jesus. Alrighty, after a brief check, I'm confident he has no major neck injuries and we get him sitting up against a tree. My other friend had put a big gauze pad from my kit over his forearm and wrapped it in med tape, but he had lost a lot of blood already and was loosing color. I got him some water, and got him talking and calmed down, we don't have service out here so were on our own at least for now. The bitch had finally worked herself into a calmer state, and started over toward us, but I guess she just noticed the puddle of blood or something but went right back into the screaming. Is this some kind of prank? Oh my god who brought her. Alright so the scene is safe, our friend is stable, but needs medical attention, we are a good hike from the car so we need a splint or something to immobilize the arm. My friend and I took off our t-shirts and we're able to tie them together to make a pretty good sling, I just threw my hoodie on and we're ready to go. \"Ready to walk buddy? You're gonna be fine\" he struggled up, clearly still in a lot of pain. I talk through some other pains he feeling, and I think he's good to walk, so with one of us on either side, we set off. Oh shit, I forgot about the girl that can't handle herself. This guy had his bone poking against his shirt not 10 minutes ago and he's walking just fine, but nope she sees some blood and she's out. \"Come on we gotta go, look everything is fine, he's gonna be fine\" she's just a mess at this point, smeared eye liner coated her cheeks, hey eyes were red and puffy, but also, something was off.... \"Can you make it?\" I asked. No reply, I offered her my water, but she declined.... Alright now seriously wtf. \"Come on we need to go\" what she said then just pushed me over the edge \"ima need about tree fiddy....\" It was then I realized she had actually been a 35 ft tall crustacean the whole time. \"Damn Nessie you ain't getting no tree fiddy\" I said, and left her there.

{"body": "Throwaway because, well, it's obvious\n\nThis happened during the summer going into my junior year of high school. I had been going to this family camp (sleep away camp with my entire family, basically) for almost my entire life, since I was about two, and the same people usually go the same session every year. Naturally, I got to know the people in my session really well. As the years went by, I started doing the typical teenage boy thing and began to take interest in teenage girls. \n\nEver since the summer going into 7th grade, there was this weird sexual tension between me and this one girl (who we shall from here on out call Katie) I had known for quite some time. I had become quite close with her family over the years to the point where I would be in their cabin at night playing cards with the dad and it wasn't unusual for me to just be chilling there with Katie throughout the day. \n\nToward the end of camp in the summer before freshman year, we finally made out a bit and it was great. Boy, oh boy was it great. I had finally done it! I wanted to make out with her for so long and I finally had. Well, camp ends and we don't talk much over the year. \n\nThe next summer, we pretty much made out whenever we had a private moment. One day, we went to her cabin when nobody else was in there, and decided to take it farther. We went to her room (which she shared with her sister), things got hot and heavy, clothes were taken off, and I was quite excited. I thought I was going to lose my virginity or at least get head for the first time! \n\nAll of a sudden, we hear the cabin's front door open. We look at each other and in a moment of panic, she bolts into the bathroom just outside of her room. I am now lying completely naked, hard as a rock, under her sheets when her father walks in the room. \n\nI see Katie, completely naked, poke her head out the bathroom to see her dad walking into to her room. We made eye contact and she gave me the most petrified look I've ever seen. \n\n\"Hey throwaway-bc-obvious! What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Oh you know, just chilling\"\n\nAt this point, I was sitting propped up against the headboard, with my knees up, still hard. \n\n\"Where's Katie?\"\n\n\"In the bathroom.\"\n\nHe goes to the bathroom. \n\n\"Katie?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"You all right?\"\n\n\"Yeah\"\n\nAnd for some unknown reason, her dad just accepts the fact I'm just lying in his daughters bed, shirtless, while Katie is in the bathroom. He says, \"all right, see you guys later\" and leaves.\n\nKatie rushes into the bedroom and is apologizing so much she's almost in tears. After a few minutes she calms down and we start going at it again. This time, she almost immediately starts giving me head and it was amazing!! My 14 year old mind didn't think anything could possibly be better. \n\nWell, apparently we didn't hear her older, hotter sister open the front door. Lo and behold, she comes into the room where Katie and I are and in shock drops everything she's holding. Katie stopped, turned around, and said the most surprising thing ever- \"wanna join?\"\n\nHer sister looked at us and responded, \"Absolutely, but it'll cost about tree fiddy!\"\n\nAnyway it was at this point that I realized that both of these girls were actually dinosaurs from the Proterozoic era and that I was actually just a large bird. It was rather confusing at first, but it made sense when I saw Cleopatra and Hitler shaking hands in the corner. I immediately came. \n\nTL;DR fuck it, just read it ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409221507", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Scout**: BONK!, Atomizer, Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol, Wrap Assassin, Shortstop and Candy Cane. (Didn't stick any primaries in there cause the stock scattergun is really good anyway and the others can be a bit of a pain or hinder the basic scout.)\n\n**Soldier**: Liberty Launcher, Battalions Backup, Righteous Bison, Equalizer and Disciplinary Action. (The basic soldier is pretty reasonable, some increased projectile speed may help, not alot I could really add since a shotgun can be really helpful at times. The Equalizer may be good when low on health, but the DA could be useful for getting to the front lines quicker.)\n\n**Pyro**: Degreaser, Scorch Shot, Detonator, Axtinguiser, Homewrecker and Back Scratcher. (Degreaser should prove useful for beginners and so should the scorch shot if they're not a good aim with the flare gun, the detonator is a good option too. Axtinguisher for finishing off opponents quickly, homewrecker for helping engineers and back scratcher for the increased health pack bonus and damage.)\n\n**Demoman**: Scottish Resistance, Scottish Handshake, Tide Turner and Eyelander/Nessie's nine iron. (There's not a lot of options for a starter demoman, stock loadout is usually decent enough for starters. Tide Turner and Eyelander to introduce the new player to demoknight when they're ready to.)\n\n**Heavy**: Sandvich, Natascha, Killing Gloves of Boxing and Fists of Steel. (Sandvich is a must have and everyone knows that, Natascha isn't the greatest at damage output but slowing down targets can be really useful for new players, guaranteed crits after killing someone or resistance from most types of damage can be really helpful and effective.)\n\n**Engineer**: Frontier Justice, Short Circuit, Southern Hospitality, Jag. (Guaranteed crits after your gun goes down feels good, so the FJ can be really useful for new players, the short circuit can be used to get rid of projectiles very useful they just have to know when to use it and not to deplete metal, the Southern Hospitality and Jag will be useful for killing spies easier and building quicker, the damage reduction on the jag doesn't matter as it usually crits alot.)\n\n**Medic**: Overdose, Crusaders Crossbow, Kritzkreig, Solemn Vow, Amputator, Ubersaw. (The Medic as quite a lot of useful things to help himself and teammates, the crossbow, solemn vow, amputator, ubersaw do just that. These weapons will help gain uber, see enemy help, heal multiple teammates and heal from long distances and escape quickly from situations.)\n\n**Sniper**: Bazaar Bargain, Huntsman, Jarate, Razorback, Bushwacka and Tribalmans Shiv. (The BB encourages headshots, and that exactly what you want them to do, the huntsman lets them be more mobile if they want to. Jarate and Razorback can be useful against spies and the Bushwacka and Shiv increase in that usefulness.)\n\n**Spy** Enforcer, Diamondback, Spycicle, Cloak and Dagger and Dead Ringer. (The Enforcer rewards you with a damage bonus and the Diamondback rewards you for doing your job, the Spycicle will help with the anonymity of the spy and give the user an nice statue to look at after work. Giving them different cloaking options will prove hand in future.)\n\n^Or ^just ^buy ^200 ^Ham ^Shanks ^and ^Frying ^Pans.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409262344", "subreddit": "tf2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The train got in late, I hadn't booked any accommodations, and it was raining when I arrived.\n\nI must have looked sad or lost, because an old man came up to me studying a map and said something in Polish to me.  I didn't really understand, but through gestures and him pointing on the map, I worked out that he was inviting me to his house.  I was on this trip to get just these kind of experiences so I took him up on the offer.\n\nWe got to his house and his wife had a pot of flaki on the stove ready for us.  He had an English/Polish phrase book at his house, and his wife spoke some English and they really were a very warm and welcoming couple.\n\nThey didn't have much, but the old man had some collectibles and trinkets on a hutch near the table that I kept glancing at.  I noticed one of them was what looked like a Faberge egg.  I assumed it was just some knock off.\n\nWhen dinner was over, his wife started to clean up.  Not wanting to be an ungrateful guest, I jumped up to help out.  I tripped, stumbled, and fell over a chair, knocking the trinkets to the ground.  Including the egg.  \n\nThe old man gave a bit of yelp, and I know I heard the word \"Faberge\" in there.  I couldn't believe it. I was so embarrassed.  As the blood rushed from my face I wondered how priceless that was and what he had gone through to get or keep it.\n\nI looked at his wife with wide eyes.  \"Was that expensive?\" I said/mimed.

I was 16 and she was 15 at the time. \n\nMy teenage years were frustrating to say the least. We only kissed and as expected, I was always ending up giving up just to have her hold my urges. I saw her body develop. I saw her turn into a woman. And I wanted that body. She also turned into a sexy, suggestive woman that would just torture me with care and love but always stop me at the right moment. \n\nI knew I needed to marry her. Love was replaced with obsessive lust. The only thing I wanted in this world was to have God's, family's and society's green light to make her mine. And so, my plan was set, a plan forged by teenage hormones and sleepless nights. \n\nBy the time she turns 18 the plan was already underway and the wedding was being planned. Finally the day arrives. I see this young, beautiful, immaculate and still teenage lady at the door of the church. My heart was beating with excitement, but more than anything, the realization that my virginity would be over was inundating my senses. I spent the whole ceremony with my eyes lost and my brain fantasizing about what was about to come. The priest asked her first. She said ''I do'' and from that point it was all set. He asked me, I said ''I do''. \n\nWe went out, had a typical expensive party with everyone around. She got a little bit tipsy and that was okay, but I couldn't drink a drop of alcohol because I wanted to savor the moment with my senses at full. Finally the night comes, we go up to our room...As soon as I close the door I start ripping her wedding dress... I had waited too long. Way. too. fucking. long. In the heat of the moment somehow she managed to stop me and asked me if before we consume the act, she could borrow about three fiddy.

{"body": "There are four mistakes on this bike, two of them potentially fatal especially in combination. \n\nMistake one was removing the steel front fender that was acting as a minimal fork brace without replacing it with a real fork brace.  This de-stabilized the front end and can cause headshake/tankspapper types of events.  Cost of a fork brace: $150 max.\n\nMistake two was moving the fork tubes up in the triple trees, which points the forks closer to straight down, speeds up the stering and de-stabilizes the front yet again.  Cost to repair:  near zero, if you have basic wrenches and a $20 winch strap to lift the front end off the ground.\n\nWith both those issues?  Holy shit no.\n\nMistake 3: pod filters on CV carbs.  Odds of getting the jetting right is about like your odds of playing poker with the Loch Ness monster.  Cure: either find or make an airbox (both kind of tough) or if you have the scratch pay $550 to user Murrayf on the CX500 forums who will ship you a pair of pre-jetted Mikuni VM34 full race carbs, custon intake runners, quality pod filters that VM34s are compatible with and proper cables, at which point all your carb issues vanish, throttle response will be right now and you'll gain at least 5hp :).\n\nMistake 4: tires.  Those look like 40 year old tech and work like 20 year old tech.  Go ahead and use 'em for now but next time, Avon Roadrunners.  Oh, and when you swap tires, for best results graft in a 17\" Comstar rear from a 1978-1982 Goldwing rear :).  It's a pain because you also have to splice in the matching Goldwing rear disk brake parts.  Or, keep poking Ebay or junkyards for an 18\" rear rim from the 1978 CX500, less work and in some ways even better.\n\nFinally, take this, you need it bad:\n\nhttp://motorbikemondays.com/2014/03/how-to-build-a-cafe-racer-guide-pdf-by-jim-march/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409385428", "subreddit": "CafeRacers", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Sex for us ends when he finishes.\n\nHonestly, this is what worries me. Because, I can understand having different sex drives. I can understand having mismatched sexual interests. You can't really have any control over those. I can even understand the fact that he's not going to be able to be able to keep having sex once he has an orgasm. Biology sucks.\n\nWhat I do *not* understand is how someone could have a fantastic orgasm and just roll over and not offer any form of reciprocation and feel totally fine with that. It just seems so selfish and completely disrespectful to your needs. It's like he's using you to masturbate himself, rather than have sex with you as a person, you know?\n\n**New rule starting today:** He doesn't get to have an orgasm until you do. Period. If he's getting close, he needs to let you know so you can catch up, and he needs to slow down. If he orgasms before you, he MUST give you an orgasm, too. This is honestly basic decency. If he complains about it, just say that at least he's being guaranteed an orgasm (unlike you)! And if he's not willing to, or he starts slacking off again? Seriously, this is in and of itself grounds for breaking up with him even if he's fantastic in every other way.\n\nNow, onto the kinky stuff! As someone who spends a lot of time in the BDSM community, it always baffles me when I hear of someone being pretty much 100% vanilla. I mean, they exist, but they're like the Loch Ness Monster. And sadly, it's possible you have yourself a Nessie. Try doing stuff with spanking, and really make a point to show him how much you like when he does it. Maybe he'll start doing thing like that more and unleash his kinky side? Maybe show him some videos/books of the kind of thing you would like, and start talking about what he'd like?\n\nI'm a generally optimistic person, but I have a feeling he'll halfheartedly spank you a few times and then go back to busting a nut and rolling over like he always does. If(/when) that happens, I think you need to consider the possibility that maybe he's just not going to provide you with that enthusiastic, rough sex you like so much. And if that's it, you really need to go elsewhere to find it and dump him.\n\nEdit: Formatting stuff", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409465663", "subreddit": "sex", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

Been dying to tell this story...\nSo a cousin and me used to talk all the time about sexual stuff, (she's Female, i'm male.) and used to get into talk about masturbation. Well, one day she has a friend over, and it's getting pretty dark out, and my cousin says that her friend wants to Masturbate with the two of us. Lets call her X. Being the horny teen I am, I accepted, and we went out back onto the trampoline.\n\n&gt;I suggested we go into my cousin's room instead, where it would be easier to see, and it wouldn't be so cold.\nWe went into her room, where they proceeded to sit in front of the door and put their hands in their pants. They tell me that X would have sex with me eventually, if we got to know each other first. She also claims she's done it before. I was in another corner, scared shitless, trying to get some form of an erection. A few minutes later, they get bored, and start texting and what not. Kinda mad, I told them I needed something more to get hard. So, they proceeded to hump and twerk on each other.\n\n&gt;There we go.\n\n&gt;Finally hard, I turn around and show them my manhood. They start giggling like little girls. Well, turns out it was all a big joke to make me look like a pervert. Yep. That made me mad.\n\n\n&gt;At this moment in time, we heard a knock on the door. You probably expect/hope that a 500 ft monster was asking for Tree fiddy.\n\n&gt;Nope, it was my brother. He was telling me to come home, because my parents had just got an Ice cream cake from Dairy Queen.\n\n&gt;The real kicker to the story? It was my birthday. Yep. I sat at the table, eating cake, freaking out that my cousin and X were going to tell everybody about what had just gone down at her house. I Facetimed her soon after, and they said that they were not going to tell anyone. X just wanted to know why i'd do that with my cousin. \"I wasn't jerking it to my cousin. I was there because YOU were.\" Both of them decided to pretend it never happened.\n\n\n&gt;Yeah.
