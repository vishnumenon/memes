{"body": "Thank you so much for your generosity in hosting this! What a wonderful chance for us to possibly own such an amazing and gorgeous collectible. &lt;3\n\n- I am verified! Look at that little bottle, being all cute and pink and stuff. :)\n\n\n- I'm located in the USA, but I am so glad the Intl ladies get lovings too!\n\n\n\n- My nomination goes to incredibly thoughtful /u/lochnessie15. Now, her nomination is for even more than what she contributes and gives to this sub. Her history of being an active, enthusiastic, and generous polish addict is one thing, but this girl went above and beyond for me. After a very serious injury and stress in my puppies life, I went through an incredibly tough time dealing with unknown vet visits and surgeries because my little fur baby was going blind. When the vet finally found the issue, hubby and I got slammed with a $3,000 vet bill which put me into an incredibly serious no buy. Nessie watched all of this unfold around the subs and silently stalked me from afar. Then one day out of the blue, a package showed up from some extremely generous mystery person I've never heard of (the owner of Black Sheep Lacquer!!!). After some serious researching and sluething to discover the identity of my sender I learned that Nessie took the time out of her life to think of little old me. This wasn't just seeing my name in passing on Reddit though, Nessie had nominated me for a \"pass it forward\" on a completely unrelated blog site to some girl who didn't even know me. That means that some person I've never met or done any incredible act for took time out of their life to think of a complete stranger during their time of need. Not only did she somehow think I was deserving of this, she stealthily took the time to track down my name, address and likes in the chances that I won the pay it forward. Turns out I was the winner of some internet stranger's kindness, and it honestly could not have come at a better time. We have been struggling a lot lately with the bills and the emotional stuff with Minnie, and getting such an incredibly beautiful and thoughtful care package because of Nessie's kind heart really goes to show why she deserves to win something like this. She's not just an angel here on this sub, she is an angel in her personal life as well. &lt;33333\n\n\n- [This](http://imgur.com/a/9xyA8) is currently where my little precious bottles are stored! I actually found this buried in the garage waiting to be thrown out but saved it just in time! Like a pretty wooden version of the Helmer. :3 This album also shows you my work space... Which is infinitely less cool. I do dog sitting full time, so I needed a work area that was open in the house where I could monitor the pups, and we don't eat here so, WORK SPACE! Clearly, it's been worked on currently. :) And the place where I would store my beautiful new polish would be that wooden box. It's super heavy and beautifully crafted so it feels swanky and rich, BUT GET THIS. The inside is lined with deep red felt which TOTALLY reminds me of the Louboutin style. Clever, right?!?!\n\n\nThanks again for giving us the chance, and I hope Nessie is able to receive her generosity back! &lt;3\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409533076", "subreddit": "PolishGauntlet", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

So I muster up the courage and ask one of my friends. She says yes. Now I have to prepare for the dance. \nThe next day, I go to buy my tickets, and there is a huge line. So I wait, and wait, and wait, then I finally get the tickets. \nThe next day, I go with my date to go get a dress. When we get to the store, there is a huge line going out the door. So we wait, we wait, and we wait. Finally, we get to the front and buy a dress. \nAfter this, they go to men's warehouse to get me a suit for the dance, and there is a huge line going out the door. So we wait, wait, and wait. Finally we get in and buy a nice suit. \nThe next day, I remember that I need to order a corsage. So I goes to the local store and there is a huge line. So I wait, wait, and wait until I get my order in. \nNow it's the day before the dance and I wake up and realizes that I forgot to order a limo, so I call up the limo rental place. All the lines are busy so I decide to go into the place. When I get there, I sees the line stretching out the door and around the corner. So I wait, and wait, and wait, until finally he was lucky enough to get the very last limo. \nSo now it's the night of the dance and when they get to there, the school is doing mandatory drug testing, so there is a huge line getting into the dance. So we wait, wait, and wait. Finally we get to the front and we both pass their drug tests. \nNow the dance was going pretty good for about a half an hour, until I really, really had to go to the bathroom. So I take off to go, and I see this huge line going out of the bathroom. I wait, wait, and wait until I finally take care of my business. \n\nWhen I comes out of the bathroom, he notices that a crowd has formed around my date. She had just randomly passed out. Someone says to him, \"Hey, you're her date, go get her some punch.\" So I goe over to the punch table. I bring it back to her she regains consciousness.

{"body": "Nessie's post was half-assed, but so was yours.  \n\nFirst, you are too authoritarian in your conception of what constitutes a good study.  You say it must be \"highly cited\", which is pretty difficult to find for an abundance of things.  I think that you want a high citation rate so that you can avoid arguing arguments if such a study is actually found.  There are a huge number of reasons why a study might not be \"impactful\", but you will *always* assume that that reason is because of lax quality.\n\nAfter looking for approximately 5 seconds, I found the following study on that page:\n\nhttp://cjb.sagepub.com/content/36/1/41.short\n\nNow, it might be paywall blocked for you, and if that's the case you'll have to trust that I (or someone else with university wizard powers can verify it)  am reporting the results faithfully, but this study concludes that \"genetic factors accounted for 40 to 56 percent of the variance in low self-control and between 37 and 62 percent of the variance in drug using peers\".\n\nThat's a pretty high genetic estimate.  I wouldn't classify it as \"*much* more important than environmental factors\", but it's a pretty damn large role.  There might be problems with the study, but at least it's a starting point from which to delve into it once both parties find some sort of access to it.  I doubt there are any huge systematic errors, as it's a standard twin study.\n\nNow, outside of merely responding to you, I will post the results of some studies on the heritability of self control:\n\nhttp://cjb.sagepub.com/content/36/1/41.full.pdf+html - Posits a heritability of between .4 and .56 for low self control and a heritability of between .37 and .62 on drug using peers.\n\nhttp://cjb.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/08/10/0093854809342859.short - Examines the effect of the 5HTTLPR polymorphism on low self control.  It finds that the polymorphism has a low effect on the phenotype per se but a stronger variation occurs when certain environments are present.\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418820701864599#.VASdXrxdWKw - Some *very* interesting conclusions are drawn in this study about the relation of parenting practice to child behavior.  In short, they conclude that it is mostly child behavior that influences parenting practice and not the other way around.  It does, however, buttress the theory that delinquent peers are a key factor in crimes.  Genetic estimates are between .25 and .4 for low self control, between .25 and .66 for delinquent peers, and between .22 and .44 for delinquency and adult criminal conduct.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409587989", "subreddit": "science", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

Also, I promise you, if you read this short story, there will be no \"tree fiddy.\" \n\nI was 20 and I slept with a professor of mine who was 42. \n\nSparing all the details of how it happened (she appreciated the fact that I was creative, smart, and willing to bang since she was in the process of divorcing her husband), I have to say that it's a combination of experience and effort. \n\n- She knew EXACTLY what she was doing every inch of the way. She worked out every position so I could get her deep. She was skilled at oral (there was only one better than her - someone who was 22 when I was 25). She had a Ph.D in biology and I feel that her knowledge of the body was a key asset to how she treated me in bed. I think she was familiar enough with porn to get really dirty. When we had sex, she ripped the condom off of my cock and sucked me the rest of the way after she came. \n\n- Effort. She was very fit (hour a day at the gym, something I was NOT used to), and it paid off. If I was on top, having her ride me, or getting her from behind, there was an incredible amount of effort on her part. She also woke up up twice one morning for blowjobs. \n\nNow, I don't want to sell myself short either. I was told \"holy shit I haven't been fucked like that in a long time...I needed that.\" Her husband was just a boring older dude, and I was the kid with the fake ID who played guitar that she probably never got to be with when she was in school. \n\n***\n\nOverall - sex can be incredible no matter who you're with. They just need to be willing to go the extra mile to learn and you've got to be willing to communicate with them.

You have to understand here that I am a 5'11, overweight white boy with a beard(Being honest with everyone and myself. If I said slightly overweight, I would be on /r/fatlogic ) so I am not the most attractive to women. \n\nSo one day, I was walking downtown after dark. I heard the sound of some drummer on the street echoing in the night and the wind and the people around me, whispering and I just kind of felt uneasy because of what was going on with me. At this time, I had a friend, a sort of friend, who was coming in at about 12:30 am flight back from a summer trip to Liberia(She went hunting with her uncle and this was many years ago, before the Ebola stuff), and it was 11pm at night. At this time, me and her were close and I wanted a relationship, but she told me to wait.  And man I loved her, I loved her more than anything in the world yet she still would hold her emotions from me. We enjoyed each others company, I took her to her first rave and she did a lot for me. All seemed to be going well, but I guess she was just not ready at that time, even though I felt ready. \n\nWell, at this point it was walking just to clear my mind of her when I met an old man and we struck up some conversations outside of a Denny's. He seemed to see I was not in the best of moods and asked me what was up. I explained to him my situation. He turned to face me, looked me directly in the eyes, grabbed my shoulders and said \"Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you\"\n\nI checked the time and it was 11:45 pm. This man was right, if I showed up to meet her at the airport, it would show how much I cared for her, especially this late at night. So I call a cab and jump in, telling the cabbie to beeline to the airport.\n\nSo finally, we get there and it is 12:20. My friends flight is almost in and I want to get going. So I turn to the cab driver and ask him how much the fare would be. He turned to me and said \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was at this point that I noticed that this cabbie was about 8 stories tall and was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

So we wait, wait, and wait. Finally we get in and buy a nice suit. The next day, I remember that I need to order a corsage. So I goes to the local store and there is a huge line. So I wait, wait, and wait until I get my order in. Now it's the day before the dance and I wake up and realizes that I forgot to order a limo, so I call up the limo rental place.

So now it's the night of the dance and when they get to there, the school is doing mandatory drug testing, so there is a huge line getting into the dance. So we wait, wait, and wait. Finally we get to the front and we both pass their drug tests. Now the dance was going pretty good for about a half an hour, until I really, really had to go to the bathroom. So I take off to go, and I see this huge line going out of the bathroom. I wait, wait, and wait until I finally take care of my business.\nWhen I comes out of the bathroom, he notices that a crowd has formed around my date. She had just randomly passed out. Someone says to him, \"Hey, you're her date, go get her some punch.\" So I goe over to the punch table. I bring it back to her she regains consciousness. So I asked her if she needed anything, she looked into my eyes seductively and said. I need about Tree Fiddy. It was at this time I realized she was a 7 story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "&gt; Not that the evidence has anything to do with whether or not it is necessary. The moon isn't necessary. It's okay to accept the existence of contingent things.\n\nWow, we are not using necessary the same way.  I meant something is unnecessary if its existence offers no greater understanding of reality.\n\n&gt; But if inference and induction are okay in the case of the existence of Alexander the Great, why might they be unacceptable in the case of moral realism?\n\nThey would be okay.  But if for instance, we had evidence that something else explained all the records of Alexander the Great, like a prolific forger, we wouldn't go on assuming that he existed.\n\n&gt; That is, moral realism describes the way all humans (except a very tiny minority who later in life reject moral realism) view the world, it is not a cultural artifact, and it is not incoherent.\n\nNo, science described the way all humans view the world.  Moral realism is a claim about the existence of mystical normative laws.  Even if the laws did exist, there would still be no explanation for how humans would be aware of them.  Moral realism in no way explains human behavior.\n\n&gt; If effectively all humans do indeed treat morality as though moral realism is true, then yeah, that counts as some reason to suspect there's something to moral realism.\n\nNot really, and especially not in the face of scientific explanations of that very same phenomenon.\n\n&gt; Disagreement is not a problem for moral realism, but for specific metaethical theories. Moreover, if disagreement is a problem, it's a death knell for any ostensibly objective fact.\n\nOnly supposedly objective facts that are only evidenced by \"almost everyone believes in this thing\".  Luckily, that's not the evidence for anything else (except maybe god and a few others).\n\n&gt; I guess big bang cosmology and evolution aren't objective, amirite?\n\nHow is that even close to the same thing?  I'm talking about the strength of the claim \"moral realism is obvious\".\n\n&gt; Who sounds like the theist now? You're quoting verbatim theistic arguments that in an atheistic society or universe, heinous immoral acts would be commonplace.\n\nDo you really think those are the same?  We have evidence about what happens when the legal system breaks down.  Police strikes, war, etc.  \n\nAre you really denying crime increases substantially when there is no legal deterrent?  Or are you just being difficult?\n\n&gt; I know. You want to have your cake and eat it, too.\n\nSo we're not allowed to debate the existence of anything without diving into epistemology?  Makes for a rather boring subreddit.\n\n&gt; If you insist on evidence for all claims, then you can start with the existence of an external world, and explain -- with evidence -- why you reject global skepticism. I'll wait.\n\nI don't reject it so much as continue to explore alternative lines of inquiry.  So now your argument that moral realism is true is that if we can know anything is true, we might as well assume moral realism and god and the loch ness monster?  Am I getting that right?\n\nIs it really\n\n&gt; I don't see that principle as being prescriptive. Your mileage may vary. However we rewrite the principle, it need not be prescriptive at all.\n\nThen neither is the \"resultant prescription\".  You're just equivocating on \"should\".  \"Should\" in the advisory sense is not the same as \"should\" in the obligatory sense.  That's a common trick moral realists use.\n\n&gt; You are responding to me, so I assume you are not a solipsist.\n\nThat's a silly assumption.  Do you not respond to other people in your dreams?\n\n&gt; I expect you can produce evidence which refutes solipsism or at least supports the existence of other minds.

{"body": "&gt; I meant something is unnecessary if its existence offers no greater understanding of reality.\n\nThen you should be more clear. Goldbach's conjecture is necessarily true or necessarily false, yet by your reckoning it is also unnecessary.\n\nIf moral realism is true, it seems as though it pretty clearly offers us an opportunity to better understand reality. If it is false, then we are mistaken, and mistakes also seem to offer us a better understanding of reality. As it seems to be true from the human perspective *and* it is widely accepted by *bona fide* philosophers (not without some disagreement, obviously), I see no reason to accept your unsupported rejection of it.\n\n&gt; But if for instance, we had evidence that something else explained all the records of Alexander the Great, like a prolific forger, we wouldn't go on assuming that he existed.\n\nGreat! We don't have evidence of a prolific forger when it comes to moral realism. We simply have moral disagreement, which is not at all unexpected in anything other than nihilism.\n\n&gt; Moral realism is a claim about the existence of mystical normative laws.\n\nYou're using 'mystical' as a pejorative, and incorrectly to boot. Moral naturalism is realist, and requires no mystical aspects. Divine Command Theory is subjectivist and therefore anti-realist, yet clearly requires mystical aspects. Denying realism does not necessarily yield non-mystical results, and affirming realism does not necessarily demand mystical results.\n\n&gt; Even if the laws did exist, there would still be no explanation for how humans would be aware of them.\n\nMoral epistemology is a problem, but it is not limited to realism; subjectivist views are likewise threatened by moral error. Of course, metaethicists work very hard to explain things like moral knowledge (with varying degrees of success) to build a picture of the true moral framework. I don't pretend to know which ethical theory is correct (if any), but I presently endorse (tentatively) ethical intuitionism with caveats allowing for some moral claims to be e.g. subjective, etc.\n\n&gt; Moral realism in no way explains human behavior.\n\nThat is not its goal.\n\n&gt; [It is not really the case that if all humans effectively treat moral realism as true, then we have some evidence and reason to suspect that moral realism may actually *be* true], and especially not in the face of scientific explanations of that very same phenomenon.\n\nThis is a very confused statement. Your argument works just as well for moral naturalism, which is realist. Obviously, we should not simply accept moral realism without investigation, but we should not simply reject it because you are uncomfortable with the idea that there may be insufficiently understood natural laws which define morality. Surely the fact that we don't have a grand unified theory of physics shouldn't prevent us from accepting quantum mechanics or relativity.\n\n&gt; [Disagreement is a problem for] Only supposedly objective facts that are only evidenced by \"almost everyone believes in this thing\". Luckily, that's not the evidence for anything else (except maybe god and a few others).\n\nRight, because we reject disagreement as a meaningful obstacle -- and rightly so -- when it comes to objective facts. Yet you brought up disagreement as somehow problematic for moral realism. It isn't.\n\n&gt; How is [big bang cosmology or evolution] even close to the same thing [as objective facts or the objectivity of moral claims]? I'm talking about the strength of the claim \"moral realism is obvious\".\n\nThat's because of your prior commitment to the objective existence of other minds, an objective external world, etc. If you want to complain about the strength of the claim, 'moral realism is obvious,' then perhaps we should consider the strength of the claim, 'the objective existence of other minds is obvious,' or, 'the objective existence of an external world is obvious.'\n\nSome things we consider to be obviously objective have no real support other than the fact that they seem *obvious*.\n\n&gt; We have evidence about what happens when the legal system breaks down. Police strikes, war, etc.\n\nWe also have evidence that these things don't *necessarily* happen (read: historical/anthropological evidence), and we have evidence from contemporary theorists that an anarchist utopia is possible. Neither of us needs to accept these as particularly likely (and I am in no way an anarchist or libertarian), but the fact that there are people who currently believe an effectively stateless society could be peaceful, and the fact that we have anthropological evidence of more or less stateless societies which *were* peaceful, seem to belie your claim.\n\n&gt; Are you really denying crime increases substantially when there is no legal deterrent?\n\nNo, I'm denying that this is a necessary outcome. I also think it's a red herring, so I'll leave it alone.\n\n&gt; So we're not allowed to debate the existence of anything without diving into epistemology? Makes for a rather boring subreddit.\n\nI agree that would make for a rather boring sub, but if you want to deny moral realism because of the inherently subjective nature of its 'evidence,' I'm going to hold you to that standard when you try to detail just what counts as acceptable *evidence*. If the human experience and the rather broad acceptance among *bona fide* philosophers concerning moral realism do not count as evidence on your view that moral realism is at least a live option, then I'm going to require you to explain just how you can count anything you don't directly experience as evidence, and I'm going to require you to refute global skepticism and solipsism without begging the question.\n\nOf course, you're the one who brought up moral disagreement, and epistemology is indeed crucial when discussing moral facts, so yes, epistemology will be part of the discussion if we are going to discuss moral knowledge.\n\n&gt; So now your argument that moral realism is true is that if we can know anything is true, we might as well assume moral realism and god and the loch ness monster? Am I getting that right?\n\nYes, that's it exactly. Spot on.\n\nPerhaps before you tip your fedora too much you might recognize that if your criteria for rejecting moral realism are also applicable to sacred cows you accept, you're being inconsistent. The argument I'm presently advancing is rather the opposite of your vacuous-yet-pithy response: if moral realism is false because we don't have a satisfactory explanation of it, then why do we reject global skepticism or solipsism?\n\nYou're applying different standards, and it's disingenuous. You don't have to *accept* moral realism, but you don't get to simply dismiss it on such inconsistent grounds.\n\n&gt; You're just equivocating on \"should\". \"Should\" in the advisory sense is not the same as \"should\" in the obligatory sense.\n\nI was not using 'should' in an obligatory sense. If I had meant an obligation, I would've used words to make that clear. I simply meant that given the principle and the game-theoretic outcomes, a person *should* select a winning strategy. Is she *obligated* to select a winning strategy? Obviously not. Persons may choose to lose, they may make errors in their game theory calculus such that they mistake a losing strategy for a winning one, and they may simply be irrational.\n\nIn fact, I think *you're* confused as to what it means for something to be an obligation. An obligatory act is not one we cannot help but perform; it is simply an act which is such that we would have done something wrong if we did not perform it. This could be a moral error, a legal error, or simply a prudential error, or obviously any combination of these. If we adopt a principle regarding winning a game, and we correctly apply game theory to our options, we *should* select the winning strategy. I would not even complain if you said we were *obligated* to select it, but I think that's a bit much. It's simply the strategy which naturally follows from the principle and the possible outcomes.\n\n&gt; [H]ow is [the refutation of solipsism] related to my comment anyway?\n\nIf you cannot see that your requirements of moral realism (being a 'necessary' addition to our epistemic framework, in a demand for parsimony, and having explanatory or predictive power and evidence) are impossible to meet with respect to global skepticism and solipsism, then we may be unable to proceed. I'm not asking for special treatment, but moral realism is not the sort of thing for which these demands are meaningfully appropriate, and if you would apply those demands consistently, you would collapse into solipsism and skepticism. Rather than applying demands inconsistently, let's abandon them and simply be a bit more honest. Whether or not you accept moral realism (which I don't at all demand), surely it is not a dead topic.\n\n---\n\nIf you *do* think moral realism is dead, please write the book declaring it so. I'll read it. If you really think your argument is sound, submit it in essay form to any number of peer-reviewed ethics journals. Even if you managed to get such a paper published (which I highly doubt), you would obviously receive loads of responses picking apart your argument in ways you had never imagined -- as I said, most philosophers actually accept (or lean toward) moral realism.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409679470", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Tell me about it.\n\nMi primo murió de cancer de pulmón, cuando era chico. El primer videojuego que jugé en mi vida me lo mostro el. \n\nEs muy curioso (para no decir horrendo) ver como a alguien se lo va llevando el cancer. Semana a semana te das cuenta como progresa la muerte sobre la persona, y que poco de ella va quedando.\n\nLa última vez que lo vi el pobre pibe estaba hecho pelota, pero aún así al verme se agarro los tubos que le salían por todo el cuerpo y me grito: \"neubi! Mira! Soy el Doctor octopus!!\"\n\nEstabamos rodeados de gente en el cuarto del hospital. El y yo nos reimos, pero solo a mi me retaron. Estaba mal celebrar un chiste aparentemente.\n\nLa cuestión es que después de la muerte de mi primo, o poco antes, o cuando nos enteramos que el tenía cancer, no sé que familiar me dio un discurso acerca de los peligros del cigarrillo, y de lo terrible que era estar adicto a el, y como fumar es equivalente a una muerte segura.\n\nEra un pendejo impresionable a los 8 años, y aún cuando yo no recordaba haberlo visto fumar nunca, se implantó en mi cabeza la idea que llevarse un cigarro a los labios era igual que apoyar un revolver en la cien. Ver a alguien fumando me ponia nervioso, podés creerlo?\n\nEl resto de mi infancia fue sin tantos incidentes, pero como crees que reaccioné cuando todos mis amigos (2 pibes) empezaron a fumar? Estaba aterrado. Mis amigos se iban a morir por desición propia, e iban a morir de una manera horrible. Les imploraba que lo dejaran, los tentaba con sobornos, los amenazaba, lo que sea. Hubo una vez muy particular en el que yo me encontraba muy muy enojado conmigo, con mis amigos, con la vida y con todo, que al encontrar a un pibe que ni conocia fumando en el baño de la secundaria, no tuve mas remedio que cagarme a trompadas con el (resultó ser un buen amigo luego, lo ayude a rendir matemática y se pudo recibir).\n\nFueron meses medio jodidos para mi, me maquinaba yo solo y me sentía horrendamente culpable al no poder influenciar a mis amigos, enojado con esa droga tan estúpida, y frustrado ante lo injusto que es todo. Fueron los eventos en una visita a la casa de mi tía, donde vivía mi primo, lo que lograron darme una perspectiva mas grande, y un poco de paz.\n\nAquel día, al entrar en la casa de mi tía, encontré un atado de cigarrillos a medio terminar en una mesa de té. En un arranca de ira, lo agarré y lo revoleé con todas mis fuerzas, y simplemente me quebré y rompí en llanto. Esa mierda había matado a mi primo y también se iba a llevar a mis amigos, y todo era tan pero tan injusto.\n\nDebo haber balbuceado algo por el estilo, que mi tía reaccionó, me detuvo y me dijo: \"neubi, Pablo, tu primo, fumaba un atado por mes. Los médicos nos dijieron que si bien tuvo influencia, el cancer lo contrajo por un defecto genético.\"\n\nAlgo se relajó en mi en ese momento. El cancer era algo ridículo, el cigarro, la vida, todo era muy ridículo, creo que lloré y reí por un buen rato, hasta que mi tía me dijo: \"neubi, Pablo siempre te quiso mucho, a el no le gustaría verte sufrir así por el. Sabés que cosa me gustaría que hicieras por el?\", lleno de lagrimas, mocos y emoción le pregunté: \"Que te gustaría?\", \"I need about tree fiddy\".\n\nIt was around this time I noticed my aunt was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Nahuelito Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nPero al menos, pude de hacer tripas corazón y madurar un poco al respecto, y entender que no podía cambiar a mis amigos, si la necesidad de cambio no nacia desde ellos.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409692810", "subreddit": "argentina", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

He had the nice TV cable package so all those fancy channels, we were watching. Now, Tim's mom had never spoken more than a few words to me but I saw her acting a bit strange that day. I thought nothing of it and went back to watching TV and eating junk food with Tim. Now, Tim had to go take a duece, so that just left me and his mom in the living room area. (Just to clarify, I am a guy and so isTtim)\n\nNow Tim's mom suddenly came over and sat down on the couch in a very....seductive way. She had a short mini-skirt and touched me and said \"Hey boy, want to have some fun.\"\n\nBefore I could respond, she tackled me and I was pinned down on this very nice leather couch.

{"body": "The best place I have ever been was a rest area off of I-5 down in Southern California. And there is an amazing story to go with this.\n\nAbout 3 years ago, I was close friends with this girl. Let's call her Sammy for the sake of being anonymous and such. Sammy and I were on a road trip from San Fran down all the way down to San Diego to go catch a concert. Now, we left at a horrible time, around 2pm and we got caught up in the horrible traffic that plagues all of California especially on the highway like I-5. And this day of all days was just bad, there were more wrecks that usual and shit just seemed fucked up in general. So we were stuck in traffic for several hours and we both needed a break from the stop and go so we got off at the next exit that just so happened to be a rest stop.\n\n By the time we got out, we had been in traffic for almost 5 hours and the concert was already started and there was no way in hell we were going to make it there to see any part of it, so we decided to take a break at the rest stop and head back home from there.\n\nAs I exit my car and stretch, I take a walk over to a ledge nearby on the other side of the rest stop and see the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.\n\nOver this cliff, there was a meadow, full of wild flowers and dandelions, tall grass up to your waist at least. There were a few trees scattered here and there but for the most part, it was mostly smaller vegetation. It was like smallish rolling hills, and the sun was setting right above the hills and the sky was turning that bright orange slight pinkish right at twilight. Honestly the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.\n\nAt this point, Sammy comes up next to me and puts her arm around me. This is odd because she rarely touches me or initiates anything, I am usually the one to do that sort of thing. So I am surprised when she also starts to speak.\"Hey bro\" Sammy says to me.\n\"Yeah?\" I respond, my heart fluttering. \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was at this point that I noticed that Sammy was about 8 stories tall and was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

I told him that Obama and McCain were both loosers that lied and of course he got all defensive and angry.

{"body": "&gt; According to this theory, we have at least two independent sources. These are Mark and Q, which we no longer have. Matthew and Luke both drew on Mark and Q, while also adding their own original resources. John is entirely independent. \n&gt;\n&gt; So, there are at least 3 substantive corroborating accounts of the resurrection. On top of this, we can determine that the author of Luke was a good historian, based on Acts, which he also wrote. The shared authorship is basically undisputed within the field of history. Many secular historians consider Acts historically reliable, and no criticism of it really holds water. See here for a more in-depth discussion.\n\nWe have a couple problems here.\n\nFirst, the \"Q\" concept is far from accepted truth so you probably shouldn't cast it like it is. Whoever wrote the gospels now attributed to Matthew and Luke had clearly read Mark, but the idea of there being a second source we've now lost is not at all an established fact. I've heard people arguing for it, and I've heard others arguing against it. I don't have a particularly strong opinion either way, but it's certainly not established truth.\n\nSecond, the gospels were not written by people who had traveled with Jesus. This isn't a contentious point. The earliest gospel was Mark's, written some time after 70 CE. They are not eyewitness accounts, disagree with each other in a lot of significant respects, and are simply not susceptible of being labeled anything resembling accurate history. They're precisely as historically reliable as the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Epic of Gilgamesh—and at least those aren't comprised of multiple versions that contradict one another.\n\nThird, criticism of Acts holds water like an Olympic pool. This is one of the most obvious pieces of sensationalized mythology in the entire New Testament. There is nothing resembling any sort of consensus among secular historians that Acts is reliable. Richard Carrier gave a pretty nice presentation demolishing Acts, and I'm sure you can find others with minimal effort.\n\n&gt; We also have Paul. From Acts, which most historians consider reliable, Paul killed Christians, then had a vision and became a Christian. \n\nI covered the point about Acts being historically reliable, so I won't belabor it here other than to say \"Citation needed.\" It has more jailbreaks and shipwrecks than the Princess Bride, so you're not starting from an ostensibly-defensible position with this one.\n\nBeyond that, discrepancies between the manner in which Acts describes Paul and the manner in which Paul describes himself in the six (arguably seven) of his legitimate letters is just one of many reasons why Acts is not a reliable text. To take Acts as authoritative on the thoughts or actions of Paul puts you on extremely shaky ground.\n\n&gt; Paul records in 1 Corinthians that there were 500 witnesses to the resurrection.\n\nOne guy saying 500 people saw something is not equivalent to 500 people saying they saw something. It's equivalent to one guy saying *he* saw something. Paul concedes throughout his letters that his only sources of information about Jesus and his activities are Scripture and private revelation—he never mentions speaking to an eyewitness or meeting anyone who knew Jesus. He never even places the events of his Jesus story on Earth.\n\nAnd of course, this doesn't even get into whether people who hallucinate visions are reliable witnesses to events. A lot more than 500 people have claimed to see Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster. I'm pretty sure thousands have claimed to be abducted by aliens. One guy saying 500 people saw something that violates our entire understanding of how the universe works isn't exactly compelling.\n \n&gt; Contemporary criticism of the New Testament is very harsh in some aspects, but never do we see an early opponent of Christianity deny that the tomb was empty. Two notable sources, the Toledot Yeshu and the writings of Celsus, clearly attempt to discredit Christianity, but never deny that the tomb was empty. Not strong evidence, sure, but part of the larger case for the resurrection.\n\nDenying that the tomb was empty wouldn't really make sense for someone who didn't already accept the Jesus story. Why should we accept that there was ever a tomb in the first place? The birth, life, and crucifixion of Jesus are not established facts—not by a long shot.\n\n&gt; So, we have multiple corroborating accounts, both primary and secondary sources, and all claim to be history. We have evidence that there were many more witnesses, and that Jesus' tomb was empty. This is, in my opinion, the strongest evidence for the divinity of Jesus, and therefore the truth of Christianity: Jesus rose from the dead.\n\nWe have no primary sources whatsoever, so I'm frankly just not sure what you're even talking about. And depending on how you define \"secondary source,\" we arguably don't have any of those either. If by \"secondary source\" you refer to the work of someone who themselves had primary sources available—like a biographer who interviews friends and family of the subject—there's nothing like that. All we have are derivative sources—i.e., the author of Matthew read Mark and decided that it'd be cool if the story included a bit about how the Jesus character was born, without any eyewitnesses or anyone who knew eyewitnesses ever being consulted at all.\n\n&gt; Christianity is entirely internally consistent.\n\nOh dear. And then we come to this.\n\nI expect this point is going to be the conversation-stopper. Even the resurrection story itself can't be coherently constructed without ignoring or modifying gospel accounts of it. The four stories don't even line up as to who was there, what time of day it was, whether they told people, where they went, etc.\n\nIf you're starting out by insisting that Christianity is internally consistent, I don't have high hopes for the intellectual honesty of this conversation. I don't mean this as an ad hominem because I'm talking specifically about what you *said*. But I do think our only hope of reaching an informed consensus about the legitimacy of the resurrection story depends on an honest assessment of what the Bible accounts are and are not.\n\n&gt; Then it produces prophecies. A few hundred years later, a man comes along and fulfills these prophecies. To prove that the religion is more than just nice human philosophy, he rises from the dead.\n\nAs a final note, there are some issues here as well. I'll go on record right now as saying the Bible does not contain a single confirmed instance of a validated prophecy, by which I mean the following:\n\n1. The prophecy must have been made prior to the event it predicts—me writing a book today wherein I set the scene in the 1950s and have one of the characters predict 9/11 is not a prophecy.\n\n2. The occurrence of the confirming event must have extra-biblical verification. It's not at all surprising that the author of Matthew might have read Isaiah and crafted his story to fit. For instance, the fact that the gospel authors had Jesus born of a virgin gives us some indication that this is precisely what was going on. If they weren't trying to make their story fit Isaiah—and using the Septuagint to do it, no less—there would be no ostensible need for Jesus to be born of a virgin anyway. The Hebrew word that the Septuagint translates as \"virgin\" doesn't actually entail virginity at all—it just means \"young woman\" or \"maiden.\" In any event, the point is that it doesn't count as a prophecy if the Old Testament says something will happen and then the New Testament says it happened, with no extra-biblical verification of either account.\n\n3. The prophecy must be set forth specifically enough to permit real evaluation of whether it was successful or not. Nostradamus has no place here. Predictions that there will be wars, or people will be scattered from their homelands, etc., do not qualify as prophecies. Vagueness is not a substitute for actual applicability, and most \"Biblical prophecies\" are less specific than something I might find in a fortune cookie. A good example of a specific prophecy would be where the Lord says that the city of Tyre will be destroyed and never rebuilt EVER (note: It was rebuilt and exists today).\n\n4. The prophecy cannot be self-fulfilling. For instance, a prophecy that the Jews would one day return to Israel and become a nation again would not be especially compelling because they specifically set out to *make this happen* after WWII *because* they believe God promised them that land. Not to mention that absent some indication of timing, a prophecy like this would also fail item (3) above.\n\n5. Related to (3), the prophecy can't have been something that was going to happen anyway. For instance, I could predict the end of the United States of America right now and *eventually* I'm going to be right. Prophecies of this sort are also generally structured so as to be incredibly vague, which is why I point out the relation between (5) and (3).\n\nSubject to these reasonable criteria, I don't think there is a single instance of a legitimate biblical prophecy that we can confirm to have been accurate.\n\nPutting it all together, I reject the contention that either the gospels or Acts are historically credible, and I don't think there's a decent case to be made that they are. I don't see any reason for believing that any Jesus ever existed in the first place, so citing his purported resurrection as evidence for Christianity doesn't really get you any farther than you would get in citing Gilgamesh's besting of Humbaba, as depicted in the Epic of Gilgamesh, as evidence that the Epic of Gilgamesh is historically accurate.\n\nThis is exactly what OP was talking about.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409712626", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well you see one day, I went out to an Applebee's with my best friend in the world and had THE WORST waiter I have ever seen in ANY RESTARUANT. Still is to this day my best friend is just a friend and I am trying to get him still ;-; let's call him Jack to keep it anonymous.\n\nSo me and Jack head on into Applebee's and we sit down in our booth. As soon as our waitress came over, we could tell she was in a bad mood. When she asked for drinks, she started snapping her finger while my friend was looking at the drinks, so that was the beginning of the restaurant experience. We ordered some boneless wings and our main courses and the waitress hurriedly jotted it down and walked off, with obvious attitude in her step, she was obviously being sassy to us.\n\nSo our wings come and they are hot and spicy, when we ordered honey bbq. So we flag down our waitress to informer her of the problem and she simply says \"Sucks to be you, doesn't it?\" At this point my friend and I were pretty fed up, but we decided to wait out longer. \n\nSo our entrees finally arrive and the food was not cooked how we ordered. My friend got a steak that he ordered medium that was very well done and my my chicken strips did not come with any sauce, so again we flag down our waiter and informer her once again. Her reply: \"uhh uhh! I wrote down EXACTLY what you said and I gave it to the cook. Not my problem.\" At this point, we were absolutely done with giving this waiter a chance so we asked the bus boy to get us the manager. \n\nThe manager comes over and we explain the situation. He apologizes to us and comps our dinner and appetizer, and gives us half off on our drinks. He then pull the waiter aside into the kitchen and I assume gave her some sort of discipline. Another manager, the general manager or some other manager I would assume, then comes over and asks us if we need anything else and I say I would like to know what the cost of our half off drinks plus tax was, so he says he would get right on it. So the manager comes back with our bill and I ask him \"How much is the damage\" and he replies \"Imma need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt then dawned upon me that the Manager was about 8 stories tall and was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

We sail over there to help the man. We come about 5 feet close to him , and we say that if he wants a ride he'll have to leave his boat there. He agrees, and so we throw him a rope. He climbs aboard, and we ask him if he's hungry. The man says yes, in a groggy voice. We give him a bag of Cheetos and make him a ham sandwich, as well as a bottle of water. After the man was done eating, we ask him if he wants us to give him a ride to shore. He says, no, but there's one thing I really need.

Plus, I was getting chubby so and it would help me work out all the stress and shit.\n\nWell the first day we set up comes around and Jim is nowhere to be seen. I had to go drive to his dorm and knock on the door until he got up. It was 2 in the afternoon. So we went to the gym and he was pretty sluggish and decided to do next to nothing other than slowly walk on a treadmill. Needless to say I was pissed.\n\nNext day, same deal. Jim was not there. Had to wake up his ass again. Same slow sluggish workout and it was really not helping me at all. So finally, after about 2 weeks of this I knock on the door and final end it. \"Dude, screw it. I am done with you and your crap. I am working out on my own, I'm done with this.\" and he replies from behind the door \"but dude...I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt then dawned upon me that Jim was about 8 stories tall and was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "The shaft descended into darkness further than I could see.\n\nI had stumbled across it while surveying some penguin colonies with my research team. None of us were able to source its origins, it was a stateless landmark. We thought it was some forgotten bunker or even the top of a lost submarine, but upon opening it we realized it was much more.\n\nAt first we just shouted down the tube. The icy wind hid any echoed response we might have heard. We dropped a few bits of ice only to see them clatter down the steel sides of pipe and ladder that scaled with it. We agreed to leave it alone, and so we did. Or at least, the others did.\n\nI couldn't ignore it. I knew the others were curious too, but nowhere near as much as me. *What* was it? No one had been building here, and the ice is dated back at least 350 years. I went back to it often, dropping fluorescent glow-sticks down it in an attempt to see the bottom, but to no avail. I couldn't visit it in the night or I'd freeze to death, so I had to sneak breaks in during the little sunlight we had.\n\nFinally my curiosity got the better of my judgement. I promised myself I wouldn't go down it, but I couldn't resist the temptation of finding out what secrets the hatch might hold.\n\nWith a bag of supplies suspended to my back, I clambered down the pipe. I opted to leave the latch open lest it freeze over during a storm. I climbed down the ladder for at least 20 minutes before I took any break. I took out another glow-stick and dropped it. With the darkness above me and the howls of the wind now quiet, I was able to see it go much further than from the surface, but still *nothing*. No sign of a bottom. No clang of the stick hitting any metal, or splashing into any water. I tied a glow-stick to my place on the ladder and began to climb back up to the surface.\n\nI continued these expeditions almost daily. Every day I'd climb further, faster, and for *nothing*. No rooms, no changes in the design. Just a steel tube drilling down into the glacier. After about 2 hours of descending it became too hot for my acclimatized gear. I'd leave it tied at the same spot every time, waiting for my return ascension. It was warmer, but it made it a lot easier to climb without all of that gear. But even with the added nimbleness it seemed my efforts were futile. That was until about 1 month after my initial journey.\n\nIt was the end of my descent, about 3 hours down. I was getting ready to go back up when I did my routine glow-stick drop. I had been neglecting to do it to stave my disappointment, and I didn't expect anything to come of it. I dropped it lamely and began to climb back up when from below me I heard a distant *clink*. I stopped immediately. My entire body froze up. I didn't imagine it. It had hit something. I looked over my shoulder and down to see a faint light far below me. Any thoughts of the surface world left me.\n\nI fumbled down the ladder as quick as possible, letting myself drop 10 feet at a time, scraping my hands against the cold steel as I slid down. My excitement was palpable, my heart was in my throat. A month of explorations would finally have meaning. The light grew closer, I could see the bottom where it lay, and then suddenly my feet rested beside it. I had reached the bottom of the ladder. I picked up the glow-stick, and saw much more space than I imagine I'd see. I through it as hard as I could, and from the low light I was able to make out the shape of the room I had found.\n\nIt was a rectangular room, the size of an average living room I guess. The walls, floor, and ceiling were of the same metallic material as both the ladder and tube that led me there. I took out my flashlight and shone it around. The bright light blinded me for a moment, but through my squinting eyes I was able to make out a door straight ahead of me. It had no handle or hinges visible. Only upon me walking closer to it did I see the panel directly right of it. A flat metal sheet with a single unlabeled button on it. My heart was beating faster than it ever had before. In all the time I had been between the steel walls of the tube I had never felt fear, not once. But now I had the option. To see what was ahead, or return back to where I came from. No one would blame me for it. My curiosity was quenched, I'd found the bottom. I could climb back to the surface and live a long life with the knowledge that the hole ended somewhere. All of these thoughts raced through my head as I extended my hand outwards and pushed the button.\n\nFor a moment there was silence. I stood back expecting something horrible, something unimaginable to happen, but after a few seconds the doors simply slid apart to reveal a brightly lit room much smaller than the one I was in now. I was not turning back. I stepped in and looked around. Before I am able to take in any detail the doors close behind me. I slam my hands on them, attempting to pry it open but there's no use. I stand back and begin to panic. What if I was trapped here? No one would know where I went. I would die here alone and be forgotten. The room shakes. I brace myself along the wall as I feel myself beginning to descend. The sound of the mechanics were very quiet, though by the feeling of the blood rushing to my head I knew I was falling very fast. I nearly pass out before I feel the elevator slow itself down. Shortly after I feel it rest to a halt. The doors open, and I step out.\n\nI am in a room of unimaginable size. I can't see the roof or the walls, only the elevator shaft behind me piercing into the sky. The only light comes from the open door behind me and the pedestal about twenty meters in front of me. I slowly walk up to it to examine it further. There's no turning back now, even if I could make it back to the surface before the night's freezing storms consumed me. I walked right up to the pedestal to find only two things on top of it. A small switch, and a folded card that says \"The world.\" I pick up the card to look more closely as I hear the sound of footsteps coming from beyond the pedestal. I drop the card and back away slowly before seeing a figure emerge from the darkness. My eyes widen in horror before I realize what I see.\n\nI see myself.\n\nHe looks at me, into me. I tilt my head and he does too. Is it mocking me? No, it has a look of intrigue as it surveys my face. I find my voice and call out to it.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I pathetically yell.\n\n\"Who are *you*?\" It curtly yells back, almost annoyed.\n\nIt walks around the pedestal and towards me. I fumble backwards and fall onto the cold stone beneath me. It is steps away from my cowering body.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I manage to squeak out at it.\n\nThe creature crouches down and stares at me with reptilian eyes. It leans in, over my body and whispers into my ear.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNow it was about this time that I realized that this supposed clone was actually a three story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\n\nI scramble backwards along the ground and stand up. I yell \"God *damn* it monster you aint getting my tree fiddy!\"\n\nI turn around and return back to the elevator that brought me down here. As the doors slide closed I can see the creature looking downwards in defeat. Within a few minutes I am back to the ladder, and a few hours later I reach the surface. But there is no light to greet me. The hatch is open to reveal a storm unlike one we had faced yet here in the antarctic.\n\nI can only hope someone comes and finds me here. I am too weak to climb down, and too cold to hold on for much longer.

{"body": "We were in the middle of a twelve hour watch on one of our patrol boat, it was a very calm night, flat glass all around. We've been on the water about 5 hours and nothing happening, like always. Suddenly, out of no where we feel this massive bump, rocks the whole boat and we lose power! Not good. There's no boats anywhere around at all, nothing to make a wake and we were sitting at a depth of about 50 to 80 feet. Definitely did not run aground. For security sake I can't say where we were but let's say it was in a safe area of the Middle East. We looking around for anything at all, nothing, pitch black water and the lights of the port in the distance. We get the engines back up and soon explain it as and underwater current, it doesn't sit well with us but our only other explanation is a monster. Another hour goes by and our engines fail again, no explanation again. Just as we're looking at the engine hold on the back deck we feel another massive bump, not a wave or a current, a bump with a solid object. We look in the water because we must have run aground, nothing just pitch blackness, get the engines back up and we're still at a depth of 55 feet. Now we're freaked out, we even arm up with our rifles and sidearms. As we are about to call the situation in our crewman notices one of our mooring lines go slowly over the side, foot by foot until it pulls tight against the post it's secured to. The boat is moving, backwards, quickly, being pulled by the starboard aft (back right) line. We're panicking now, our crewman grabs the hatchet on board and goes to cut the line when suddenly the line goes slack and we stop moving. We're freaking out now, armed to the teeth, power down, no comms, and no one has cell phone service. We have 4 hours until our relief comes. Will we be there to be relieved? 2 hours goes by with nothing else happening, but we're still on guard. Whatever it is we're not going down without a fight. Engines come back on with an hour and a half to go. We use our spot light to try to see anything in the water although we're terrified that we will see something. Then off the port side (left) we notice a huge bump in the water. An enormous object was coming right at us, fast from about 100 yards out. As it nears it slows down, comes up out of the water. Giant eyes on a huge reptilian head about 15 feet out of the water. It opened it's mouth revealing what looked like a thousand sharp teeth, and it made a sound. \"Can I get about tree fitty?\" It was about that time that I recognized this mighty being as the Loch Ness monster, using all his courage our crewman shouted out \"Goddammit Loch Ness monster, we out here tryin work and you gone bother us about some goddamn tree fitty? You go on an git yoself a job and stop bothering hardworking folks for they money!\" He left and we had a big laugh and later when we got off we got drunk and banged hookers. I got the clap.

{"body": "I circumnavigated the globe from the ages of 23-25 on a 43-foot sailboat. One of the freakiest incidents we had on board was when we were leaving Singapore in the middle of the night. Aside from the constant game of frogger dodging freighters, our path was fairly straightforward.  \n  \nAt about 3am, I was alone at the helm, with everybody else asleep down below. Suddenly, I hear a beep from the radar, which had been set to warn about anything within a quarter mile of our vessel. Looking around, I couldn't find anything obvious within that range, so I put the boat on autopilot and went down below to investigate.  \n  \nTypically, other ships show up as little blobs, but for some reason, the radar was registering a long, solid line, the length of the screen, directly in front of us. And it was getting closer... fast.  \n  \nHeart racing, I went back on deck to see what could possibly be registering such a bizarre signature. Eyes slowly adjusting, I looked into the dark, peering as hard as I could to make out something, anything... and then I saw it.  \n  \nNot more than 100 yards ahead was a 20-foot-high, unlit, rock-solid wall. Right there in the middle of the ocean, looming and, by this point, making its presence known by the sound of waves lapping against it. I was absolutely petrified. Mind you, this was before chart plotters were widely used, and we were navigating with paper charts. I was utterly confused, and supremely terrified.  \n  \nI called all hands on deck and we stopped the boat dead, pulled down the sails and started the engine. Slowly, painstakingly, we picked our way through what was by that time increasingly apparent: a full-on construction zone. Our charts were only 2 years old, but apparently, Singapore had undergone a monumental land reclamation (or perhaps \"newclamation\" since it was never there to begin with) project in the meantime.\n  \nEven once we found our way out, nobody slept for the rest of the night. To this day the image of magically appearing dark walls in the middle of the ocean haunts my dreams.  \n  \nFor those interested, [here are some images of the area](http://imgur.com/a/dn91u) from google maps, which I snapped on the same day, but at different zoom levels.

To date, there have been numerous reports of a ghostly \"Lady in White\" in and around the Inn property and the surrounding Big Moose Lake.\n\nLess of a haunting but within the \"legends\" category, the wilderness around the town of Whitehall has a long history of Big Foot sightings. These sightings allegedly go back hundreds of years to local indian tribal legends and into more modern times. In the 1970's there was a relatively well documented encounter (as far as these things go) that was the subject of an episode of Monster Quest.

{"body": "So there I was, sailing a cargo ship through the gulf of Mexico.  We had just come through the Panama canal, shipping various goods to the East Coast.  I was but a lowly deckhand, performing countless different tasks along our journey.  One of my primary tasks was as a lookout (turns out there are an awful lot of things to see out on the open water).  My buddy Mike and I had a habit of passing our time when we weren't on lookout talking about the various flotsam we'd see on our shifts because, what else would we do?\n\nAnyway, one evening I got off my shift, and Mike and I met up in the mess as we usually did, but Mike looked like he had seen a ghost.  I asked him what was up, but he seemed dumbstruck.  We went and grabbed some food, and sat down and he started to tell me what had happened.\n\nMike said he was out on his shift on the stern, where he usually spends most of his time watching the wake boil out behind the ship.  He told me that today, around noon, he noticed something in the wake.  Now, it's not uncommon that we have dolphins hanging out behind the ship, following in our wake for as long as they feel like hanging out, but Mike said this was different.  He told me that as he watched, *whatever* it was seemed to get closer and closer to the ship, and it was much much bigger than he expected.  This was no dolphin.  I should mention at this point that the ship has a tendency to go at a pretty good clip when we're in open water (20-25 knots), so usually the dolphins and whatnot only follow us for five to ten minutes and then fall back, as they can't keep up that kind of pace for terribly long.  But Mike said this thing was actually getting *closer*, however slowly.\n\nMike told me that as it drew closer, he was able to make out some vague features, but he couldn't really tell what it was.  It seemed to have multiple \"humps\" on it, and from what he could tell it was large - like, whale large. At this point, he was pretty freaked out, and I could tell he was genuinely shaken.  Mike is not a guy to get easily shaken.  He continued, telling me that he got out his binoculars and tried to get a better look at this *thing* that was now maybe a few football fields behind us and approaching slowly but surely.  He said that he was just barely able to keep his hands steady when he saw what looked like a very small head come out of the water much closer than the rest of the thing.  At that point, it disappeared completely under the water, and he didn't see it again.\n\nI asked Mike when this was, and he told me it happened right before he got off, maybe twenty minutes ago.  I naturally told him we needed to get back on the deck.  Mike seemed nervous about it, but agreed.  Since he was so shaken, I thought it might be best if I bought him a drink.  I went to the vending machines, and picked out a non-caffeinated beverage, and reached for my wallet.  Mike came up behind me as I realized I must have lost it, and was groping for it in a panic.  \n\n\"What's wrong?\"  Mike asked.  \"I think I lost my wallet!\"  I was already a little nervous about *whatever* it was behind the ship, and I know it's stupid, but I was a little overly upset about having lost it.  \"Don't worry about it man, I'll get the drink and we can get back up there,\" Mike said.  In a bit of a daze, I agreed.  \"How much is it?\"\n\n\"About tree fiddy.\"  Well it's about that time Mike realized I was an eight story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era!  \"GODDAMNIT LOCH NESS MONSTER, I AIN'T GONNA GIVE YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" Mike yelled.  He ran out of the room and slammed the door behind him, so I found the nearest porthole and jumped back out in the ocean to keep following the ship.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409805895", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In my childhood, I was walking my dog, a husky and Labrador mix, through my small neighborhood. This neighborhood is surrounded by trees, trails, a lake, and acres of woods. We walk down the same trail every day, and it leads to the lake. My dog and I circle the lake a few times, he does his business, then we leave. This occurs every day. One day my dog picks up some scent that catches his fancy, possibly a dead moose or some other dog's piddles. Either way, he takes off into the woods. I chase him, eventually finding him near an abandoned looking trailer and beat up pick up truck. Having followed my dog for the better part of an hour and never having relieved myself following a hearty breakfast with a literal gallon of milk, I find myself needing to water some bushes. I decide, \"Hey, this trailer looks abandoned and this pick up truck is rotted through, no one lives hear and even if they did, they wouldn't deprive a 14 year old boy of the basic necessity of making lemonade rain!\" So I recklessly enter this seemingly abandoned trailer to find it actually abandoned, and set about finding the bathroom. I walk to the back of this creaking, rickety old trailer and open the door at the end of the hall, stopping only to notice pictures of an elderly couple strewn throughout the trailer. Reasonably creeped out by the smell of rotting garbage and the obvious signs of vandalism, I decide to venture into the closed bathroom anyway. I open the door, undo my pants, and prepare to tinkle. Glaring up at me from the toilet is the rotted and disfigured head of a very large goose, with a raccoon gnawing on the eye sockets. I scream and sprint out of the trailer, pants still undone. Any sane person seeing a child run out of a trailer with his trouser snake flailing in the wind would've reasonably called the cops, but there was no one around. My large, dopey dog caught up with me as I ran, tripping occasionally over my half down pants. I decide, instead of rationally pulling my pants up, that taking them off will help me outrun this demon raccoon. So I ditch the pants in full stride, hearing it close in on me. My dog has already run ahead home, so I am alone, being chased by the biggest raccoon I've ever seen. Something in my head clicks, and I spin to meet this raging beast. Without thinking, I 360 no scope this raccoon right in the face with the fastest stream of piss the world has ever seen. Any closer, and there would have been no fur left on this monstrosity. Clearly befuddled as to why a fourteen year old two legged naked coon would firehose all over it's face, the beast ran away. When I repeated the story to my father later, he told me all the raccoon had wanted was tree fiddy.

{"body": "This happened a few years ago now.\n\nAt the end of junior year in college I was offered the opportunity to work on an Alaskan fishing boat for the summer (like the ones on Deadliest Catch) so I decided to take it. A buddy I had at University was going with me (his dad was the one who set it up, personal friends with one of the crew members.) It was a really great experience, except for one night...\n\nIt was about half-way through the five weeks we were to spend there. We were on a return trip from a decent haul, a ways off the coast of Unimak Island. I was dead tired, 14 hour work days on a fishing boat really takes it outta you, but I was on look out duty with one of the regular crew members and still had a few more hours 'til my shift ended. I remember being able to see every star in the sky and was in awe of the beauty around me when I guess I nodded off. It wasn't for very long though. My crew mate, Ryan, woke me up with a start. Something happened while I was out and I could hear people yelling from the other side of the ship. We ran over to check it out.\n\nAs it turns out something really weird had jumped up outta the chop and onto the boat. Nearly smacking one of the other crew in the head (that was why he was yelling.) Anyways, this thing was weird. If I had to guess, I'd say it was almost 4ft in length. It was defiantly alive. It had this really gross, gray skin and big beady eyes. It wasn't like any fish I'd ever seen before or since. For a moment it just sort of laid there, gasping for air. None of the crew knew what it was either. After much poking and prodding and once everyone on duty had a look we decided to toss it back. That's when it got really strange. As I went to pick it up it sort of flopped around, almost as if to turn to me. That was about the time that I noticed its big red eyes staring right back up at me, and then it *spoke*.

The most freakish happening me and me scurvy crew had on board was when we was leavin’ Singapore, full o’ plunder ‘n’ pissin’ needles in the deeps o’ night. Aside from havin’ to skirt around the men o’ war like a pond frog, the capn’ plotted us a straight course. \n\nThree spins o’ me hourglass past the witchin’ hour, yai was alone at the wheel, with me mateys passed out from the grog down below. Out o’ nowhere, I head a wailing from me navigational contraption, which I’d bedeviled to start singin’ if anythin came within 2 furlongs o’ me ship. Lookin’ about, yai couldn’t see a thing through me spyglass, so I put me pet monkey at the wheel and decided to beat the truth out o’ ye olde contraption. \n\nAs the day is long, other ships shop up in the witch’s bauble as spiralin’ dots, but on this black night, yai saw only a long, unbroken line, length o’ the glass, right offa our bowsprit. Yand it was gettin’ closer, fast.\nMe heart a poundin’, I climbed back to the wheel to see what curse o’ the deeps could be showin’ up that way. Me eyes squintin’ in the dark, I peered out to descry somethin, anything…and then yai saw it. \nNot more than 100 yards in front o’ us was a 20 foot high, unlit, rock-solid wall. Right in the middle o’ the sea, loomin with waves crashin’ against it. Yai was scared outta me boots, a fine pair o boots I had stolen from a dead man in Tortuga. Mind ye, all we had to go on was a set o’ charts a few years old, as the current ones from London had been carried overboard by chainshot. Yai was utterly confused, and capitally terrified. \n\nYai rang the ship’s bell to get me mateys on deck and we dropped anchor, struck the sails, and started up the spinny-spinny. Slowly, excruciatin’-ly, we drifted toward what was by that time clear to a blind man’s eye: a full-blown buildin’ yard. Our charts were the devil knows know old, and in the meantime Singapore had undergone a monumental buildin’ project (or perhaps rebuildin’, since I have it on good authority the old ones were burned by rouge Mormons) for new whorehouses along the coast. \n\nEven once we sailed out way out, nobody slept for the rest of the night, staying up drinkin’ bottles o’ rum and playin accordions in the forecastle. To this day, an unbroken line o’ brothels risin’ from the deeps and welcomin’ me in is in me favorite dreams. \n\nFer those wid nothin' better to do, [here be some images o' the area.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bYvO3.jpg) The project was new, or maybe our charts were older 'n' time. Arrrr. \n\nEdit: A few o' ye lubbers have asked for more context to me story, so yai'm tellin' ye to shove off. \n\nEdit2: If yai meet this Lovecraft feller ye keep blabberin' about, I'll run him through wid me cutlass. \n\nEdit3: Many of ye fools were expectin me sea story to be about ye olde Loch Ness Monster beggin' fer a piece o' eight.

When I started tending, I was about 21 and about 1 year away from completing my degree in actuary sciences when I started tending to make extra money. \n\nWell, the bar I worked for got popular real fast with some of the best DJ's coming in and everyone for miles would come for the music. We had Daft Punk even come on in once. We were all making major boku bucks, like thousands a night, even the bus boy because the people who owned the place were making so much, they decided to share with all of us.\n\nI want to say that for the better part of about 3 years, we were rolling in the dough and I had made so much money that I had a nice fat bank account and I quit college because I thought I would be doing this for the rest of my life, not so much.\n\nAfter the place died down and the DJs got too big name for our venues,  it settled down quite a bit. However, due to the fact that I worked there for 3 years I was making a fair bit of money (14.75 and hourish at the time) so I decided to keep tending for 7 more years until one night that made me quit right on the spot.\n\nIt was about 1am on a Saturday and the bar was pretty quiet. Had some regulars there and a few suits from the around business have a late night drink. About 30 minutes before last call, a man in a suit walked in and order a drink, forget what it even was now because I served many drinks that night and i was tired. \n\nWell, he kept on ordering other drinks as well. Beers, shots, jello shots. I finaly cut him off after he was clearly intoxicated and he was pissed, more pissed of than I ever have seen a man before about drinks. He pulled a gun out of his waistband and held it to my head. I at this point put my hands up and told him \"Cmmon man, don't do anything you will regret\" He replied with \"You're gonna give me about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt then dawned upon me that this guy was about 8 stories tall and was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.  I said \"I ain't got no tree fiddy you goddang lochness monsta!\" and just left without saying a word, never going back to that place ever again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409854510", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Although it changes only \"something\" /the decision of those who base decisions on its \"existence\"/ still every user of this expression \"god\" feels their something equals everything and so their \"god\"-fantasy fulfills their expectation and behaves like \"truth\".

{"body": "Had the craziest night of my life doing this. It's a little long, and will get buried, but I think it's worth it:\nI once called a number I found in a restaurant in my area, &amp;amp;amp; it sounded like a pretty cute chick. I got a sudden rush, and told the girl to meet me at the park. I thought if she wasn't good looking, I'll just keep walking because we had no clue what eachother looked like. \nSo I was creepily walking around this one bench I told her to sit on, waiting for her to show up. I'm not sure if I rushed over there, but it seemed like I was waiting forever, so i thought she was just going along with it on the phone earlier. Just as I thought she had the last laugh, some smoking hot brunette with amazing tits and this look that made my balls swell sits down. Not too sure if this was her, I walk up to the bench, slowly, pretending not to notice her at first. She was a good 8.9:/10. \nI approach the bench and sit down. I asked, probably creepily, if she was the girl I talked to earlier on the phone. She says her name &amp;amp;amp; confirms that it's the same chick. I immediately get rock hard. This girl is going to have me inside her. \nWe stir up some random chit chat, her asking me if I call every random number I find. Tell her that it was a shot in the dark thing and I was bored. She casually slides closer to me, saying she is really bored also.\nShe wants it. She wants the D. I even asked her if she wants the D. She says she wants it. She says she wants the D.\nAfter the blood came back to my brain, I asked her to if she wanted to take a hike in the woods, with some alcohol.\nOf course she was down.\nNext we got some bottles of vodka, some quick gear for out the woods, and i was on my way to get laid by a smoking hot drunk chick. This is where it gets really fucked up. On our way to my campsite, walking and talking  i was happily as can be. And then complete darkness. I got fuckin knocked unconscious by a random log flying at my head. \nI wake up with my hands tied around my back, and tape around my mouth. I look to my left and the girl, let's call her Vanessa, is tied up as well. She's still knocked out. I look up and see these ratty looking guys going thru my shit. I start swarming around and trying to yell, and got there attention. I think I they thought we were dead, cuz I scared the crap out of them. As quick as they turned around and saw me, they were gone. Already running far away from us. \nI roll over to my pack, and found a knife. It was a fuckin bitch to cut the ties, and it seemed to take forever. As soon as I'm free, I run over to Vanessa and cut her ties. Attempting to wake her up, the guys from before appear out of nowhere and tackle me to the ground. One dude had a big stick, and the other was on top of me. We were rolling around a bit, and I felt in danger of my life, so I did the only thing I could do. I take the knife that was still in my hand and I plunge in into the guys thigh. He instantly fell off of me, this giving me a chance to get up. \nThe other guy swung with the log, but somehow I caught It mid swing and tackle him into some bushes. I pummel his face in until he stopped moving.\nWhen I was finished with dude #2, dude #1 was getting back up. I wound my leg up as hard as I could and punted the guy right in the chin. \nI'm in disbelief, thinking to myself I just killed two people. I didn't notice Vanessa sitting there staring at me, most likely watching me kill them. She had that look that made my balls swell. Who knows what was going on in her head, but she picks up the 3 bottles of Vodka we brought. I grabbed her and tried to hurry her on, telling her we have to go. She, out of breath, was trying to get me to fuck her right then and there.\n\"Are you fucking insane?!\", I yelled at her. She kept insisting a bottle in my hands, trying to pull down my pants, not saying a word.\n\"What the hell? What do you want?\"\nShe gasps for air and mutters out:\n\"I..... BOUT .... 3/5ths... D?\"\nIt was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as I ran away from the crazy Dino.\nTLDR: crazy bitch be trippin.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409891996", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 145, "controversiality": 0}

Firstly, the previous night, I had accidentally set my alarm clock to PM instead of AM, so I ended up waking up super late and missing the first hour and a half of my shift, so my manager was pissed at me and I felt like an idiot. I work at the customer service counter at Target. So this older woman with a huge perm and gaudy jewelry comes up, trying to return a couple of blue rays that she had purchased for her son. Her face is all flushed and she's obviously really upset, telling me that neither of the blue rays work. She's probably in her late sixties, and keeps referring to them as \"video discs\". So I'm talking in a calm voice and trying to be as patient as humanly possible, and after talking to her for a couple of minutes and trying to help figure out why they would not be working, I gather that she doesn't actually own a blue ray player, but, in fact, owns a DVD player. I try to explain this to her, she does not understand at all and just gets more upset, and she just starts shouting in this really thick Southern drawl \"A VIDEO DISC IS A VIDEO DISC! YOUR SHITTY DISCS BROKE MY PLAYER!\" and on and on. At this point, my manager, who is already pissed at me, comes in from his lunch break and begins grilling me as to why the woman is upset. At this point, people have stopped to gawk at this crazy lady. She keeps cutting my manager off and is still yelling at me \"THESE DISCS BROKE MY PLAYER!\" My manager asks her to calm down and to explain what the problem is, and at this point, I notice that she's a Loch Ness Monster.

Must just be because the kids are lazy and don't love you enough, right? After all, you took a *course.*\n\n&gt; I know now that we both had an unhealthy fixation on “raising you right.”\n\nThis is demonstrably not the case. You haven't given a *shit* about her this whole letter. It's been about you the whole way, and if you had a fixation on *anything,* it was revolving around yourself.\n\n&gt; Again- I am sorry.\n\nNo you're not. You took a course for that.\n\n&gt;  I only wanted the best for you. \n\nThe battlecry of every terrible parent *ever!*\n\nIf you wanted the best for them, then they would HAVE the best. If you wanted the best for them, you would have stopped and *asked what that was.*\n\nYou only wanted *what you wanted for them,* whether they wanted it or not. What THEY wanted was irrelevant.\n\n&gt; I only wanted you to grow up healthy and happy.\n\nWell, she didn't. So... where did you go wrong?\n\nThis isn't a rhetorical question. Get out a fucking pad and pencil... probably a LOT of pads and pencils... and start going over everything YOU did.\n\nNot that you will, natch, but honestly why trumpet that you wanted something when it's plainly never what you were working towards?\n\n&gt; Yes- I wanted you protected from all the bad people and bad things in this world.\n\nShould have put her up for adoption then.\n\n&gt; I was afraid of so many things and I over protected you because of my own fears.\n\nSomething something all of my failings as a parent were because I tried too hard something something my greatest failing is I have no failings.\n\nThis isn't helpful or useful. There is no such thing as \"Trying so hard I failed.\"\n\n&gt; Yes- I “ignored or minimized” your feelings at times.\n\nSuch as in this letter?\n\nIt's not 'at times'. It's happening right now, *as you acknowledge it was wrong.*\n\n&gt; At the time, I was being told by other moms that I shouldn’t give in to my children’s emotions.\n\nAgain, who were these parents you were hanging out with, the Dahlmers?!\n\nThe Addam's Family knows better than this! and you would too if you had spared half a moment to actually seeing the effect it had. No one blindfolded you and stuffed your ears with cotton. you could see exactly what you were doing and *exactly* what it was doing to your kids.\n\n&gt; “Children need to learn self control, etc…” I now know that you needed more opportunities to be who you are and express your frustrations without being punished for it.\n\nThat's nice, probably true, and also *waaaay* too late.\n\nSeriously, it sounds like you're listing out the things to try with your NEXT set of kids. There's nothing here for your CURRENT kids.\n\n&gt; Again- I am sorry.\n\nNo you're not.\n\n&gt; Yes- I was horrible at not having consistent rules! Again- I am sorry.\n\nThis is reading like a laundry list of things you're apologizing for in order for things to be 'okay' again, honestly.\n\nTo be perfectly frank, none of this MATTERS now. It's the foundation, the groundwork of the relationship with your daughter. It's a mess, but really, it can't be changed. What has it taught you about yourself, what you do and what you are, that needs to change? What was the cause of all this? this isn't something you 'try harder to do better next time', you went in the *complete opposite direction* of your target goal.\n\nIt sounds like you're just listing off the grievances that someone else has told you about. It's like you weren't even THERE. What did you see? What did YOU perceive was going on with your kids? That's absent. Just  bunch of parenting techniques blindly thrown at a wall, not even bothering to lift the blindfold to see what stuck.\n\n&gt; Yes- I spent too much time trying to be your “friend.” Especially in the last few years.\n\nWhat, you needed to be *meaner?!*\n\nDefine that. What does it mean to you? I'm pretty sure I know what the op means by that, but what do YOU think?\n\n&gt; This one, I am still perplexed with because, I always enjoyed being “friends” with Mimi. \n\n*Who the fuck is Mimi!?*\n\nWhen did SHE arrive at this party?\n\n&gt; She was so fun to be with. I loved her dearly and I knew she loved me. We enjoyed spending “girl” time together so much. I have simply wanted to have the same experiences with you. Again- I am sorry if I have not approached this the right way. \n\nNo, irrelevant, *all of this.* Your relationship with someone else has *no bearing* on your relationship with your daughter, and just indicates again you're blindly applying something you saw somewhere else to your situation with her without actually taking HER into account.\n\nAnd you want her to feel GUILTY that she wasn't as much fun as 'Mimi' was. That's a great apology right there.\n\n&gt; Yes- I have at times put down your Dad. However, I have tried to be as honest with you as possible about my true feelings and experiences and I know it has come across as putting down you dad.\n\nWhich generally means that you're telling her a lot of shit *she doesn't need to know.*\n\nIt's between you and *Dad.* She doesn't need the intimate details of your relationship woes, or to try and figure out which authority figure is going to get her in the least trouble following.\n\nHonesty is irrelevant. you save that for when the kids ASK. YOUR job was to provide a consistent and safe authority structure, not sabotage it from within.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, you are right! I need to take full responsibility of my own failures and not blame them on your dad.\n\nSo.... you were lying then?\n\nSo how exactly are you going to enact this going forward then? Resolutions are great, but given the severity of the situation, I'm thinking we could use an action plan or two.\n\nAlso, I suspect this is going to be a lot easier since all of this crap is *past tense* anyway.\n\n&gt; Ultimately, just know, I do believe you have 2 parents who love you and care deeply about you.\n\nReally? Who?\n\nI'm not just being snarky here. You didn't state that YOU were those parents, you just said that you *believe they exist.* I would think if it was you that you would *know.*\n\nIs this like the Santa Claus thing all over again?\n\n&gt; Your dad is a good dad.\n\nThen why did you spend so much time when your kids were growing them up trying to convince them he wasn't, as you admitted to previously?\n\nYou admitted you did it, you never said *why.*\n\nSeriously, there hasn't been a single admission of guilt in here that hasn't had a pure and noble motivation and a frickin' *angelic choir* in the background. It comes across about as authentic as my Loch Ness Monsterskin wallet.\n\n&gt; I know he is heart broken over you right now as I am.\n\nHow about we hear that from him, and you not tell us what other people feel, because it's irrelevant?\n\nSo, i guess op needs to feel *double* as bad because she's broken *two* hearts. Yours, and the one you apparently ripped out of her father's chest and therefore get to speak for as well.\n\n&gt; Yes- I was always concerned about you growing up too fast. The last thing any parent wants for their daughter is for her to grow up fast.\n\nActually, I can think of quite a few things that really should rank as less desirable on the list than \"Outgrew her frilly pink play dress sooner than expected.\"\n\nSeriously, this is actually pretty messed up. Yes, some parents reminisce about 'their little girl', but at the same time they cherish the journey, and all of the steps in between, not see it as some horrible creeping nightmare that is *literally* worse than the child dying.\n\n&gt; As a parent I will always remember you as that sweet, adorable little girl, full of life and creativity- wearing adorable Gymboree outfits and bows in your hair\n\nMeaning you never saw anything past that. Your mental image of her is at the point where she was most what YOU made her to be. The clothes YOU put her in, the bows YOU put in her hair. How can you acknowledge anything of what she's become since if your memory drops off at this point? If everything from here is downhill?\n\n&gt; Yes- I was always hoping that you would be an extension of me and your dad. It makes sense that most parents want their children to be like them in many ways.\n\n*No.*\n\nThat's not how that works. Normal parents DON'T want their kids to be an extension of themselves. They want them to *be their own people.*\n\nThe purpose of your kids is not to continue *you.*\n\n&gt; Otherwise, we wouldn’t try and teach you how to “act like us” in certain situation.\n\nWell, *this* phrase is fulla nightmares.\n\nNot how to act appropriately. Not how to act 'like a &lt;blank&gt;.'\n\nHow to 'act like us.'\n\nYou take that 'extension' thing pretty damn literally, don't you? AND it's kinda scary that you don't see a *problem* with it.\n\n&gt;  I do know however, that we are not perfect and there are many things I don’t want you to be like me in.\n\nSo... \"Be like me, unless I decide I don't like it, at which point it's bad and wrong\"?\n\nWith consistent guidance like that, how could things *possibly* gone so wrong!?\n\nIt's not even \"Do as I do\" or \"Do as I say, NOT as I do\", it's \"Do as I do, except if I say different, but only in certain circumstances NO DON'T DO IT NOW! DO THE OTHER THING! *NO, NOT *NOW!!** THIS IS SO EASY, WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THIS!?\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409954781", "subreddit": "trolledbynarcissists", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I was polite enough during our conversation, but was honestly only paying half attention. \"I've been looking for you all my life.How adventurous are you?\" she asked in a sultry voice that  almost made it seem like she was the first woman I ever met. \n\nI looked at her and everything fell away. Everything I'd ever learned, everything I'd ever loved, everything I'd ever hated, and everything else in view simply left my mind. Even the music in the club seemed to all but fade.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Can I show you something amazing?\"\n\nI agreed and we left. We took a cab to the edge of the city, where it seemed like there was a drawn line, separating all the trappings of the city of vice and the incomprehensible vastness of the open desert.\n\n\"There are only two things in this world to keep going...\" she said \"one  of them is this place. It's my favorite spot in the world. I can come here and almost see, here on the edge, both sides of the coin at once. I can see the marvels of mankind, and the marvels of nature at once\"\n\nAfter that, she went silent for a few minutes. It was almost deafening. I had to ask...\n\n\"What else do you need?\"\n\nShe turned and looked me dead in the eye and said \"Imma need about treefidy.\" It was about that time I noticed she was an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. \nSo I ran.

{"body": "it is definitely a unique situation where you would need one.  My wife was pressuring me into having a baby not too long ago, and I had less interest in that than women's basketball. She flat out refused to take birth control or any kind of preventative measures, her mind was set on that baby.  Now living with her means that if I stay in the hospital for any amount of time, she is gonna know and obviously inquire about why I am there.  So the option of a professional vasectomy flew right out the window.  I thought me and my wife were going to have to divorce because I ain't be wantin a little rug rat.  But one nights I was browsing the deep web and stumbled upon the home vasectomy kit, and my mind was just like Nagasaki, I mean a huge bomb just went off.  I'se got this mate that used to do tattoos in jail for extra ciggies, so I knows he got a steady hand.  So I call up my man Steve and tell him I would give him like, a whole carton for the procedure, he countered my initial offer with a whole carton and a bottle of whiskey.  I was like 'steve, you're breaking my balls' and he was all 'not until I get me ciggies and whiskey'.  So realizing I had no other options I went out and bought these things.\n\nI had to formulate a plan cause I know it would take some time to heal.  So I figured I would just pretend that everything was normal with me and me wife not having any sex for like a couple weeks, til things was all back to normal, then I could be like 'okay, honey, let's try our hardest to make a baby'.  Brilliant plan I thought.\n\nSo anyway, Steve comes over one night when my wife is at work (she works a night shift).  And I knew I should have been concerned when he started mashing that whiskey like a mad man, but he convinced me it helps keep him steady.  He gave me a few shots because he said it might hurt a little.  It hurt like fuck.  The pain was worse than like being forced to have to raise a thousand hellen keller style mush babies.  I think he botched the wrong tube, but whatever happened blood was pouring everywhere and we's both pretty mashed up by this point.  We ends up driving to the hospital cause we can't afford no ambulance, but heres the messed up part, me had to drive cause Steve was too mashed.  So I am driving myself to the hospital with blood pouring out the balls or wherever, and steve is just incoherently like o shittat man. We finally get there and go to the front desk and start screaming \"my feckin scrote\", they immediately put me into a bed and I got anesthesia, when I came to there was a giant crustacean hovering over me,  and he said, Imma need about tree fiddy.\n\n1/2 balls, would not recommend.

So I was 16 at the time and I was on my schools football team and all of the players were doing this fundraiser where we went door to door selling cards of coupons for 20$. The whole fundraiser was supposed to raise money for new pads, helmets and jerseys for the team the next season. Now this fundraiser was in early May and where I live, at that time it is a good 100 degrees outside everyday. Anyways, I was going around door to door in the scorching heat trying to sell these cards when I knocked on a door and a woman I had never seen before opened the door. She was probably in her mid 20s or early 30s had brown hair and brown eyes and was drop dead gorgeous. The thing about her that caught my eye first though was what she was wearing. She had obviously just gotten out of the shower and she was in an untied bathrobe that went about halfway down her thighs and was open in the middle showing off her breasts. My mouth dropped open and I was just staring for a good 10 seconds before she asked me what I needed. I looked up at her and apologized and began my sales pitch while trying not to stare at her. About half way through she interrupted me and said \"Sweetie you look very hot, why don't you come in and get a class of water\". Me being as thirsty as I was, I said yes and walked in and as she was grabbing me a glass, her entire robe fell off. I had no idea what to do. I just sat there staring at her and I guess she knew what I wanted because after a few seconds she said, \"Sweetie, I'll let you touch them but I need you to do something for me first\". I responded \"Oh anything. What do you need?\" And she said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" That was when I realized that she was actually a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era and I screamed \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy, you goddam lock ness monster.

You know we don't have an accurate time frame for them or even a general clue what the fuck the original creators of the Bible meant. Doesn't help that they're a bunch of self-absorbed cunts that won't give up what they meant: I'd bet my own testicles they don't even know.*\n\nEvan nodded, but he didn't really agree: what a spineless punk. \"Yeah, well, I figured it out! I've been doing some research into all of it, and-\" *NO. Not this again. Last time you did some \"research\", you thought burning the witches made sense even though people aren't flame-retardant like we are. Everyone caught on and that cost us some credibility with our viewers. Look, you're good at this stuff, you are: making them believe that aliens sporadically visit them and implanting people with false memories was a brilliant move; it was, I should've given you a raise for it. But, then you do shit like this, and it makes me wonder where you went to school for your degree. So, let's just wait on the pompous cunts to tell us when, alright?*\n\nI could tell Evan was somewhat upset by my remark, but I didn't have time to deal with his ego. *Look, I gotta go yell at some halfwit janitors about forgetting to feed Nessie and Bigfoot. But, afterwards, I have a 20 minute lull period, if you want to grab a bite or something.* Evan pretended as if he was considering it, I knew the fucker would say yes though. \"Yeah, that sounds good.\" I feigned a smile. *Great! I'll see you in like 10 minutes.*\n\nFucking janitors.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410164856", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, my friend and I walk into Subway. There's a decent line inside. I step behind *him*. When I say *him*, I mean the most smug, inappropriate man ever. I didn't know people could be this passive-aggressively rude in public. So he gets to the front of the line and asks for a sandwich on italian herbs and cheese. Then, the rudeness begins:\n\nEmployee: What kind of cheese do you want?\n\nMan: WHAT KIND? I WANT EVERY KIND OF CHEESE YOUR MORON.\n\nEmployee: Okay, sorry about that.\n\nMan: PERSONALLY, I THINK YOU SHOULD SMOTHER MY SANDWICH IN NACHO CHEESE.\n\nEmployee: We don't really sell that here sir.\n\nMan: YEAH AND YOU DON'T SELL SPAM EITHER, SO I HAVE TO BRING MY OWN.\n\nAt this point, I already felt bad for the employee. We exchanged looks and I could tell how he felt. The man continued to order more sandwiches until the Subway was nearly out of meat. As I was behind him, he noticed that I had ordered the veggie patty on my sandwich. This made the rudeness continue:\n\nMan: Ugh, disgusting. If it didn't die squealing, how can you eat it?\n\nEmployee: Sir, would you please calm down?\n\nMan: [*unintelligible roaring as he wolfs down ham and meatball sub*]\n\nI couldn't believe my eyes at how mean he was being to me and the employee. Anyway, he got his food, I got my food, and we both sat down at tables in the restaurant. Then, he got up, rubbed his belly, farted loudly, and rode his mobility scooter to the bathroom.\n\nThis is where I hatched my plan. This was kind of evil, but he deserved it. I took four leaves of lettuce from my sub, snuck over, opened up his subs, and placed two leaves into each sandwich. I quickly got back to my table, and acted like nothing happened. He came back, belched, and resumed eating.\n\nI was so happy how this turned out. He scratched his balls, then dipped four of his subs at once into a bucket of gravy and took a bite. His eyes widened. He opened up his subs and realized there were vegetables in there. He immediately stood up and vomited all over the table, then began running around the restaurant, thrashing and flailing his arms, knocking over chairs and creating a huge mess.  The employee ran over, begging him to stop.\n\nEmployee: Calm down sir!\n\nMan: CALM DOWN?!?  YOU WANT ME TO CALM DOWN???\n\nEmployee: Yes, please!\n\nMan:  I can calm down, but I'm gonna need something from you first!\n\nEmployee:  WHAT? ANYTHING!!\n\nMan: I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\n\nWell, it was about that time that I realized that he was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Protoerozoic era.  Ultimately, he ended up throwing out the rest of his food and walking out of the Subway in a huff.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Man was a jerk at the Subway, and I got my revenge by putting lettuce in his sandwich.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold!", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1410190395", "subreddit": "thatHappened", "score": 35, "controversiality": 0}

Apparently they had their little stunt going for a couple months and she didn't even give me any reason to believe something was going on. Not only that but I also found out she was stealing money from my back account. I was absolutely crushed and started eating, a lot. I completely let myself go and ate whatever I wanted. I could tell everyone knew what I was doing for I was gaming weight quite quickly. Knowing that everyone could see me getting fatter just added more stress on my shoulders and because of that I kept eating. The timing of my decent was even bad because spring just started so everyone started wearing shorter clothes and everyone was trying to get their beach bod. Seeing how good everyone look made it even worse and on top of that girls scout cookies started coming back. Obviously delicious cookies + emotional eating me = negative progress. I would have a box or two a day and just got fatter. I finally saw myself walk by a mirror holding a couple boxes of cookies. At that moment I realize I need to stop. I decided once the rest of my cookies get delivered I would finish them then get my life back on track. Fast forward to the day the last of the cookies arrive when I find out that my ex-girlfriend was a scout leader for the girls delivering my cookies. She shows up to my door with a couple little girl scouts and is taken by surprise by how big I got. She mustered up a smile and asked how I had been, I just looked down at my stomach letting her know exactly what happened. She apologizes and asks if I still want the cookies. I almost said no but thought I could have one last box, not to eat but to crumple in front of her to let her know what she did to me. I asked for a box of shortbread cookies knowing that those were her favorite kind. She obviously knew I picked those kind for a reason, then she said,\"Imma need tree fiddy.\" \nWell it was about this time that I looked up and noticed that my ex girlfriend wasn't a girl scout leader at all. She was actually around eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I looked up to her and said, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't given you no tree fiddy!\" After she blew her cover she ran away and I realized that she planned my whole demise just to get money. I also realized that Lessy (her name was Lessy) should be the one to feel bad. I whipped myself back into shape and got my life back on track then I found the most perfect girl of my dreams. We have been together for almost half an hour now and I couldn't be happier. \n\n\nShortened Version: Got addicted to eating and later found out my girlfriend wanted me to become fat so she could end things with me and not feel bad about herself.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410229634", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "This is true. I spent my summers from university backpacking in various mountain ranges in America - from the Cascades to the Adirondack, I've done them all. It was a glorious way to spend time with my friends, my family, and one time even my environmental professor.\n\nI recently underwent a whole midlife crisis, during which my therapist suggested that I get back into hiking. So this past summer, I took a week off of work, packed up the mini van, and drove my wife and two teenage kids to the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nI was ready to have a great week of bonding with my family, but my kids thought otherwise - \"What do you mean, I can't snapchat my friends?\" \"I can't even check in on Foursquare, what is this shit?\" My son and daughter were absolutely distraught that we were actually away from civilization and cell phone service/WiFi for an entire week.\n\nGradually, my kids got more and more upset with me and my wife at the lack of wifi. They spent the entire time lagging behind, causing me to become frustrated with them. So one morning, they refused to leave their tent. I begged and pleaded with them to no avail, so I sent my wife (their stepmother) to take care of them. She came back crying, saying that the kids were so upset that they started using racial slurs (my kids are white, my wife is black).\n\nSo, I decided to teach them a lesson - if they didn't want to come with us, fine. I set a map outside their tent for the next two days, and told them to meet us at the rendezvous point where our cat would be waiting for us. My wife was still very disturbed by the incident; before we left she went to confront the kids about it one more time. I only heard a part of the conversation:\n\n\"Raquel, Charlie, can we talk?\" \"No. Go away.\" \"If you don't accept me as a parental figure, that's fine. But using derogatory slurs is never okay. Now, I'm willing to accept an apology, but first I need something from you.\" \"What do you need?\" \"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nI ran outside, but it was too late - it turns out, my new wife was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Russel's Teapot. \n\n\"Russell's teapot, sometimes called the celestial teapot or cosmic teapot, is an analogy first coined by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) to illustrate that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making scientifically unfalsifiable claims rather than shifting the burden of proof to others, specifically in the case of religion. Russell wrote that if he claims that a teapot orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, it is nonsensical for him to expect others to believe him on the grounds that they cannot prove him wrong. Russell's teapot is still referred to in discussions concerning the existence of God.\" \n\nI don't have to disprove you, and since as I stated I am an Agnostic Atheist not a Gnostic Atheist I am not making any claims. By your logic I would need to prove that dragons and unicorns never existed before dismissing the claim. \"What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.\". Otherwise dictionaries would be full to the brim with all the claims in the world that can't be disproved. Big Foot and the loch ness monster would be taken as fact. \n\nAnd how can you be \"relatively confident\" there are no hyper intelligent ducks? You claim that god gets a pass because he is \"beyond the universe\"- but that is stupid. There are also similar claims made that are \"beyond the universe\" such as the whole universe being a computer simulation, the universe being in a marble,  etc. Something being unprovable and unknowable is not a shield which instantly proves it to be true (or makes dismissing the claim magically become a claim). Christians themselves dismiss hundreds, if not thousands of creation myths and gods too which are also \"beyond the universe\". Why would your god be special? If I add in that my ducks are cosmic ducks who have ascended to a higher plane of being- then that too gains the immunity status which you think is so important for a god claim. Hell, whole religions have been spawned from people just making shit up and laughing about it, I bet one day if the flying spaghetti monster doesn't die down people may one day start actually believing it is something other then a comment on the state of religions.\n\nNo, because as I said, agnostic by definition means I don't know. If a god did come down and prove himself to me or I was given actually evidence to his existence then I would change my mind. There is no claim, just the dismissal of one. When I started researching other beliefs and philosophies as a child I settled on the fact that none of them had the sufficient evidence for me to believe in them. I didn't go and be like \"THERE IS NO GOD\"- I just dismissed the claims of the many religions I had researched. Same way you dismissed my ducks (well until I informed you that they were ascended, obviously that means it has an unbreakable shield in front of them now. Go ducks.)\n\nAlso, once more\n\nAgnostic is not making a claim\ngnostic is. \nmid 19th century: from a-1 ‘not’ + gnostic.\n\ngnostic = to know\n\na+gnostic = to not know.\n\nSO no claim.

Mrs. Ross, my teacher in my first 3 years, told us on our first day of Art I \"If you understand it, it's not art\".\n\nI struggled with this idea. I knew from this that the Mona Lisa was meaningless to me, because it seemed pretty understandable, you know, pretty girl, smile, atmospheric perspective in the background and all. So I gravitated to surrealism. Dali. Magritte. \"Leci n'est pas une pipe\", whatever that means. I wrestled with my appreciation for the art while also trying to avoid thinking about it too much. If I understood it, I would lose appreciation, it would lessen the art form. \n\nOne could say I became sort of an art thief by my Junior year. I would snap up artwork from friends when they were none the wiser (Locker combinations were no match for me and my excellent 30 yard vision) and I would examine the art for about a minute, then stash it in a portfolio folder. By a few years, I had maybe two hundred stolen art pieces. A few suspected me, but no one ever approached me. \n\nSmiling at me on the last day my senior year, Mrs. Ross told me to come see her after class. Of course I came in to see her, she was quite attractive, and I learned so much about her. She handed me a glass of Dr. Pepper, which I quickly drank. It tasted saltier than normal, but I didn't mind. She smiled at me and told me she thought I was an excellent student. She unbuttoned the top buttons of her blouse. I saw her cleavage dipping low. \n\nI asked her what was going on, and I clutched the portfolio closer. \n\n\"You know, this blouse is a bit itchy, I think I'm gonna take it off.\"  She finished unbuttoning her blouse and I smiled sheepishly. This wasn't how I expected third period to go, but I could handle it. I set down the portfolio. She reached into my back pocket and pulled out my wallet. This surprised me, so I instinctively reached for it again. I was dizzy. She said \"It's okay, I'm just gonna grab a bit of cash to buy a condom for us\". I asked her how much that would be. She said \"About tree fiddy\". It was at this time I noticed that she was about 494 feet too tall for the average art teacher, and happened to be from the Paleolithic era. I lost motor function. I stumbled and fell to the ground shakily slurring the words \"Gdiamiit lock lock monstor\" and I was out cold. \n\nI woke up in the morning in a tub full of kidneys. She had removed my ice cubes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410265436", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was wondering through the woods one day starving. I happened upon the enticing scent of pigs. My nose perked up and I could tell there was a group of them, and they were young. I slowly peered through the bushes and much to my delight they were in fact young, plump, and triplets. My mouth began to salivate! \n\nThey had recently constructed houses of different materials. Two of them were borderline mentally slow, and built their houses out of straw and sticks. The third was smart and used bricks. Well I saunter over to the first pig. He runs inside to hide. \n\n(Obligatory detail for you all. When I was a pup I fell in a puddle of nuclear waste, giving me super lungs that could blow with hurricane force.)\n\nI walk up and say, \"hey! bitch pig let me in!\" He says no, of course. So I blow his shit down! He runs to his brother house made of sticks. I go over to that house and say, \" Pig bitches let me in!\" They say no and, I blow their shit down! \n\nFinally they run to the third brothers house made of bricks. I repeat said process but when I try to blow it down. Finally the third pig says, \"I'll make you a deal I will let you in, but only if you do me a favor!\" I agree. The pig tells me all I have to do is give him $3.50. It is about this time that I notice the third pig is an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I said, \" God damn it monstah I ain't giving you no three fiddy!

{"body": "I really wish I could have recorded my event. This happened a while back - I was fairly new to the game, and it was my first trip out to NWAF. I was playing solo, and had previously read up on the various 'hot spots' to acquire the best loot. I had come up from the southeast corner, where the hangars were. I had only rounded the corner into the second hangar, when I ran smack into an M4 pointed at me. In a split second, I thought 'This is it.' and simply accepted my fate. However, no shots rang out. No black screen. Instinctively hoping for a shot at life, I raised my arms up and surrendered, hoping for a resolution. The gas-masked figure pointed his M4 to the floor and then back to me, repeatedly. He barked 'DOWN' in a stern Russian voice, and thus I did so immediately. So far so good...I'm still alive, I thought.\n\n'I check you', he commanded. After a few minutes, he was finished with his inspection. 'Up', he demanded. I was on my feet like a fresh army recruit. 'Eat, is good' he stated, as he dropped a fresh kiwi by my feet. Is this right? I thought people at NWAF just kill and loot everything. I kept feeling that this was a trap of some sort. Fearing my life however, I did not hesitate and shoved that kiwi down my gullet. The Russian nodded in agreement, and then motioned for me to follow him. 'Come, come.' He was having me tag along! Was he truly being friendly? Or was I some sort of prisoner by means of pseudo-kindness?\n\nSuddenly, a shot whizzes by my head as we make it to the control tower. 'DOWN, blyat!' he exclaims. We hole up in the lower section. I'm huddled in a corner, no weapons whatsoever, hoping this new friend of mine can pull some sort of miracle. No sooner do I think that, when he turns to me, yells 'STAY!', nods, then runs OUT of the tower. This is it, I think. He's suicidal. He's gonna die and then I'm next. More shots ring out. I'm still not used to the weapons but I think it's a Mosin. Wait, I think i just heard shots from another location, but it's not the Russian. Oh man, what is happening out there? I don't risk looking. It's escalating into a full-scale war outside. Right then, I hear automatic gunfire. Lots of it. It must be him - he had that M4 rifle, but I can't be sure. More cracks of Mosin fire. He's gotta be dead by now. I contemplate just running like hell.\n\nAfter what seems like an eternity, the gunfire seems to stop. Yep, they probably killed him, and they're closing in. I make a break for it, but a figure appears by the doorway and blocks my exit. It's too late, I'm dead - wait, no...could it be? The Russian stands before me - he drops a Mosin rifle at my feet. 'Yours...take. Come, come, more.' He points to the distance, to the other side of the airfield. My savior has returned and apparently trusts me enough to hold a weapon. I've never shot one before, but I pick up the Mosin and follow along. There must be more loot he wants to show me. It must be whoever he killed. We make it to the other side of the airfield. I find a sprawled out body. He looked highly geared. I check for loot - some of it is ruined, but I get a canteen and a ton of food and water, and some Mosin ammo. As I finish up, I turn to my right and there are FOUR more bodies. What happened here. The Russian points to them, and says 'More...take it. Yours.' He slaughtered them all...I sort of feel awkward about this, but I take what I need and we go. He takes me down by the tent area and points again. SIX more dead people. What the hell. Is this guy a hacker? I have no idea how he took out so many. But I loot anyways. \n\nAs I finish my last body, I hear the sound of handcuffs. You son of a...the Russian double crossed me. Why? I think to myself...why now? Before I can utter a word, he turns to confront me, his shadow blocking out the sun. He bends down, and I wait to hear my death sentence. I hear a dark and brooding voice, and as I close my eyes to accept my fate...'I need about tree-fiddy.' Then I look up, and it's a damned 500-foot Loch Ness Monster. I immediately go into third person, and realize I'm a damn tree. 'I AM GROOT', I exclaim, and break my chains of oppression and destroy the monster. I stare at his body, and realize, I have now taken his place. I am no better. I now need tree-fiddy.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410275525", "subreddit": "dayz", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It almost sounds like a lie just thinking of typing it out but it is completely 100% true, and I promise no tree fiddy.\n\nSo, I was just getting out of a five year relationship, and I lost pretty much everything...stuff...place to live...my jeep(it was in her name and she made a new key a week after I left and just drove it away).\n\nI was sleeping on couches of friends for about a week or so, and happen to be explaining this to a buddy while having a beer at a local bar(on his dime thankfully).  This somewhat attractive lady, who at the time was 37(I was 24), was a regular there, and happened to overhear me.  We had spoken a few times here and there as we were both regulars there.\n\nShe offered to let me crash at her place on the couch for a month or two while I get back on my feet, which I gladly accepted.\n\nFast forward a week and I am at her place watching some tube and drinking a few beers with her.  We get on the topic of my ex and our sex life.  The topic leads to why it was so bad and I said something stupid like \"I know it can't be me...I mean...it's not like I am small or anything\" and the look on her face...I can still see it now.  Like a slight smirk with a hint of curiosity....so....\n\nI just unzip and whip it out.\n\nShe slowly reached in and started playing with it, and ended up giving me the best blow job I have ever had.  We ended up being fuck buddies the two months I lived with her.\n\nBest part, she actually moved out of the place and I took over the lease, so not only did I get taught many valuable sexual lessons from an experienced woman over two months, I got a new place to live.\n\nTL;DR Got the best blowjob I have ever had and a new place to live.\n\nEdit: a letter", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410297783", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "We're ultimately talking about the definitions of words here so there's no objectively \"right\" answer. Words are just defined by usage. Of course, that doesn't mean we can't have interesting conversations about the pros and cons of certain potential usages.\n\nTo me, theist/atheist is binary so you have to be either one or the other. Basically, get out a piece of paper and write down the name of each god that you think exists. When you're done, you're an atheist if you have a blank piece of paper and a theist if you don't.\n\nThe gnostic/agnostic divide is a little harder to deal with because we have to start by clarifying what we mean by \"gnostic.\" For instance, I readily concede that proving something *doesn't* exist is impossible. Absolutely no one can *know*, in the sense of having 100% infallible certainty, that there are no gods. \n\nWith that said, however, I think believing in gods on the basis of the present state of the evidence is pretty irrational. I claim to know there aren't gods to the exact same degree of certainty to which I claim to know there's no Bigfoot or Loch Ness Monster. I remain forever open to new evidence, and am always willing to re-evaluate my position should any arrive. If forced to make a prediction, however, I'm fairly certain the verdict is in.\n\nArguably, I'm a gnostic atheist because I think the present state of the evidence compels any rational person to, at least pending new evidence, accept that the proposition \"There are no gods\" is most likely true. I think I'm justified in saying \"I know there's no god\" to the same degree I feel justified in saying \"I know there's no Bigfoot.\" But on the other hand, I'm arguably an agnostic atheist because I don't claim absolute certainty, concede we can never rule out the possibility of undiscovered evidence, and remain forever open to revising my opinion should changes in the state of the evidence warrant.\n\nTo ultimately answer your original question, I think there are a lot more variables to consider on the gnostic/agnostic spectrum, but that a binary treatment of theist/atheist works just fine.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410307856", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;In polytheistic religions, there is still a creator god, the patriarch or matriarch of the universe.\n\nYou seem to be suggesting that there's always one creator god, but this isn't true. Shintoism for example; there are two initial creator gods. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto:\n\n&gt;The generation of the Japanese archipelago is expressed mythologically as the action of two gods: Izanagi (\"He-who-invites\") and Izanami (\"She-who-is-invited\"). The interaction of these two principles begets the islands of Japan and a further group of kami.\n\nCreation stories are simply too disparate, and can't even agree on the number of gods, much less the other details. Even if you find certain religions' creation stories strikingly similar, there are many that are irreconcilably different.\n\nThe Norse mythology we know is already a Christianized one:\nhttp://haberdasher.hubpages.com/hub/The-Christianization-of-Norse-Mythology. And even still, your examples aren't particularly convincing, Thor and Christ die in drastically different ways. In terms of creation, where is Niflheim mentioned in Genesis? You mention two very general similarities without taking into account the countless differences in the creation stories.\n\nEven if you believe there are a hundred similarities, the differences are too great. And it takes very few differences to show that two stories are describing majorly different things. How can a religion in which there is only one god be reconciled with a religion in which there are many gods? These are vastly different existence claims. And the two religions promote incompatible values and beliefs.\n\n&gt;Most UFO \"abductees\" are extremely eccentric, paranoid, and oftentimes referred to as crazy.\n\nThose who claim to be UFO abductees are generally normal people, free of mental disorders, you can listen to them describe their experiences perfectly lucidly and candidly, e.g: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6SCYhoYWh4. And I could apply this argument to many groups who are not crazy (but are obviously mistaken). Countless normal people have claimed to see/experience Yetis, the Loch Ness monster, ghosts, etc. If you're committed to believing any existence claim that a large group agrees on, you would be committed to some outrageous beliefs, which demonstrates that this isn't a reasonable basis for belief.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410347986", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was about 8, I was in trouble for...something..., so my dad took away the NES controllers for the day. It's summer vacation for us kids, so he goes to work for the day and my 13 year old sister and I are home alone.  We spend quite awhile looking for them, until we find them in a dresser drawer in his room. We excitedly pull them out and play NES all day, then put them back before dad gets home.\n\nHe comes in, says ok punishment is over, blah blah, and we all walk to his room. My sister and I stand by him with eager anticipation as he opens the dresser drawer. Instantly his face goes from happy to pissed. \n\nTurns out there was one obvious (in retrospect) detail my sister and I had overlooked. When he put them in the drawer, he had neatly and tightly wrapped each cord around each controller. When we put them back we just threw them in the drawer with loose cords strewn about everywhere.\n\nWhen his face changed, I got a gut-wrenching feeling of \"oh shit, this is bad\". He just said \"go to your room\", and I sit in there, crying. I know the whoopings are coming.\n\nA minute later I hear him whooping my sister. Over the snap of the belt and her cries, I hear him yell \"you're grounded for a month!\"\n\nHonestly the worst part was the just sitting in my room, waiting, knowing what was coming. I can't even remember getting my whoopings.\n\nIt was then, while this giant beast of a man was whooping me that I realized he wasn't a beast, but a 100ft tall giant loch ness monster, and he said he would give me the controllers back only once I gave him tree fiddy!\n\nJust kidding, this did happen. I was only grounded for a week because my older sister was the one in charge and she should have known better (actually it was just because I was heavily his favorite). This decision was later overruled by my mom who said we had to have equal punishments.\n\nLesson being: for kids, pay more attention when you're sneaking stuff from your parents. You spoiled kids these days with your fancy wireless controllers don't have to worry as much.\n\nParents: if you're gonna take something away, lock it in a safe, because we WILL find it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410348672", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was beautiful.\nNot only did we have so much in common, but it was like we were the same person. I'll never forget the night we both knew we were in love. Well, at least that's what I thought...\nA few years back, I started dating girl, let's call her Amber. We both hit it off pretty quickly. It started off as a simple friendship that gradually became more and more passionate as time went by. We started to hang out more, always calling each other, random hugs, it was just puppy love. Soon this relationship started to become more intimate and we started spending more time alone, rather going out on dates in public. One thing would always lead to another, and not much later, we began to make love. The sex was wonderful. It was the first time I had been able to look somebody in the eyes while we made love and knew we both were meant for each other. \nFast forward a few months, I don't know what hit me, but I knew this was the one. I knew she was the woman I was destined to be with. I knew I had to do something, but I wasn't sure what to put out there. I didn't want to scare her off. We weren't even together for that long. It had only been maybe 6 months. But I knew I had to do something, and I wanted it to be romantic. I began to do my research and looked over what other couples had done that was special to them, and could possibly work with Amber. I knew she enjoyed going to nice restaurants, walking around the city, shopping, going to the beach, etc... But I just couldn't figure out what I could do that might really swoon her. But that was when I figured it out. I was going to take her out to the fanciest restaurant I could, and I was going to buy her a ring. I was going to marry her. It was going to take some time, but I knew this was what I needed to do.\nI began to start saving up for this moment. I picked up a second job with my uncle helping him with his construction business, mowed lawns, spent less time out shopping and more time working. It was stressful. This put a real damper on my future with Amber. We planned to move in together, but working as much as I was, and putting the majority of those paycheck toward car payments and phone bills, I knew I couldn't afford it, especially since I was trying to save up for the dinner and the ring. I told her we couldn't move in together, and she was distraught. And it only went downhill from there.\nBecause I was working so much, I stopped having time to see Amber and had less time to plan out a future with her. We began talking less and less, and she soon became distant to where I felt like I was talking to a complete stranger. I wasn't sure what to do at this point, but I knew I had to keep these jobs to support myself and my dream of one day marrying this girl. The more I worked, the more distant she became. This is when she started making new \"friends.\"\nShe started going out more at night with friends, meeting guys at bars and frequently communicating with them. She clearly hadn't told them she was in a relationship, because I could see the texts they would send her, asking to grab lunch, or go out on a date sometime later on in the week. I was losing her. She became more interested in these other men and I started to lose my focus. My hopes and dreams of marrying her were pretty much out the window. She stopped wanting to see me and started going over to hang out with these other guys. Pretty soon I knew it was hopeless for me to even try.\nA few months later, I was still fighting to keep this relationship alive, because I knew I loved her, and although she was still distant, I knew I could get it all back. Not much later, I was finally able to afford everything. After all the stress I went through these past few months, I finally managed to save enough money to buy her a ring and take her out for a wonderful dinner. I made the reservations right away for some fancy Oriental restaurant I knew she would enjoy. I went out right away and picked out the ring I had been looking at this whole time. I had it engraved and everything with our names inside of a little heart. \nAbout a week later, it is finally the night. It's the night I get to take her out and I can confess my love to her and show her how much she truly means to me. This was my only hope to regain any form of confidence in our relationship to make things work out. I drove to her house and picked her up. She opened the door, and I swear I had never seen a more beautiful person in my whole life. The way her dress hung to her ankles, how she did her hair, it was like looking at an angel. She was too perfect and I knew I couldn't mess this up. \nWe arrive at the restaurant, and get ourselves seated and comfortable. The conversation flowed very well, and it wasn't long after that we both felt we were back on the same page. It was just like old times. We held hands across from each other, and we looked into each other's eyes and smiled as if we were a couple of teenagers in love. It felt perfect. The meal finally came out and it couldn't have been a more wonderful dinner. I don't want to go too much into detail, but you get the idea. The dinner was incredible. We both finish and just sat there for awhile looking at each other again. I knew this had to be it. I had to ask her to marry me right then and there. My nerves were on a whole different level. Hell, I started to feel sick. I felt myself become weak and my mind was racing beyond anything it's ever been before. But I managed to calm myself down. I got down on knee.\nShe knew exactly what was to come. She covered her face and almost began to cry. I knew I was in the clear, and everything would have gone just as planned. \n\"Will you marry me?\" I asked.\nShe sat there stunned, and this smile became more and more of a crooked grin. It just started to disappear, and I couldn't have been more confused. I wasn't sure what I did wrong. She was staring off behind me, and I wasn't sure why, until I turned around. One of the guys she was talking to from the bars was there, let's call him Mark, and apparently they had a date, because he looked pretty unhappy. He grabbed me by my shirt and asked what the fuck I was doing. I told him I was her boyfriend and that I was going to marry Amber. He became belligerent and tried to make a scene in front of the whole restaurant. It was insane. But Amber didn't move. She didn't seem shocked at all. She just sat there. The waiter casually put our check on our table, and it was then I knew this whole night was ruined. Not because of the way Mark reacted, but because of what Amber did. She just sat there, lost in her own world.\n\"Are you alright? What's wrong?\" I asked.\nNo reply.\n\"Amber, what's wrong??\"\nStill no reply. She just stared off into space.\n\"Amber! What is with you?! What do you want?!\"\nShe looks over to the table and grabs the check.\n\"Ima need about tree' fiddy.\"\nIt was in this moment I realized she was no longer my girlfriend, but Amber was actually an 8 story tall protozoan crustacean. I grabbed my shit and I noped the fuck out of there.\ntl;dr: got damn loch ness monster\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410358128", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's some basic pointers off the top of my head, someone is bound to find one of these interesting.  \n• If you use Auto Reload holding M2 with postpone your reload until you let it go. This is especially useful for Scouts that don't want to waste a shell by prematurely reloading the Soda Popper or the Force-a-Nature.  \n• If you are using a Headtaking weapon (Eyelander, Hitman, etc.) and kill an enemy using the same weapon you will get all of the heads that they have collected. This also works for the Airstrike. Their is currently a glitch where killing an Hitman Sniper or an Airstrike Soldier while using the Eyelander/Nessie/Headtaker will grant you their heads as well.  \n• The Vaccinator is currently bugged in a way that makes the Medic and his heal target immune to critical hits. This includes headshots.  \n• The Pomson and the Bison can light Huntsman Arrows on fire.  \n• If you are just bumbling about during Setup Time and have nothing to do, quickly jump to Engineer and level up your team's teleporters to Level 3. This will give your team a good edge because your Engi will now focus on setting up his nest.  \n• The Holy Mackerel will not say FISH KILL in the feed if you kill a Dead Ringer Spy. The Cleaner's Carbine will also not grant Minicrits for a DR Spy kill, and Spies who feigned death with the DR will not drop weapons that grant ammo/metal. If you kill a Spy and his weapon does not give you ammo he is Dead Ringing.  \n• The Disciplinary Action has the longest Melee Weapon Range in the entire game, more than any of the Demoman's swords.  \n• The Huntsman does significantly less damage if the string is pulled back too long. You can tell by looking at how shaky the Sniper's hands are.  \n• A Level 2 teleporter will teleport people twice as fast than a Level 1, however a Level 3 will only shave off 2 more seconds of recharge time. Level 2's are a necessity, Level 3's are a luxury.  \n• The Demoman's Explosives resistance granted by his shields do not protect him from his own explosions.  \n• If a Soldier is on fire while using the BASE Jumper he will not float down. This can actually be used on command with a Cow Mangler charge shot.  \n• Payload carts will not move any faster than X3. If you have X4 or onward it will move the same exact speed as 3.  \n• Vaccinator and Kritz Ubers can be used while capping points or carrying Intel Briefcases, unlike the regular Ubercharge.  \n• If a Heavy is holding a Sandvich and dies, the Sandvich he drops will heal any player who grabs it instead of granting ammo like weapons normally would.  \n• The Jag is currently glitched in a way that negates it's only upside. You only save half of a second of buildtime for building a Sentry Gun, which is pretty much completely worthless. Check the wiki for a video comparison of it with the Stock Wrench.  \n• The Neon Annihilator will crit any player who is wet, not just any player who is underwater. This includes players who have just exited water, who will have water drops coming off of them (which can also give away an invisible Spy btw), and any player soaked in Jarate or Mad Milk.  \n• Bleed effects can stack, so if a Scout uses the Flying Guillotine and the Wrap Assassin at the same time you will take a staggering 16 damage every second.  \n• If you hit someone three times with the Gunslinger, the third hit will be an assured Crit. It does not matter what team the player is one, so long as you hold down M1 for two hit the third will Crit. There is currently a glitch where holding down M2 will 'store' the Critical hit, meaning if you hold M1 for two hits on a friendly player and hold M2 so your third consecutive hit doesn't go away your next attack is an assured Critical hit.  \n• A Sniper using Darwin's Danger Shield can survive a fully charged body shot and an uncharged headshot.  \n• The Scout is at his fastest speed while maxing out the Baby Face's Blaster. Using the Crit-A-Cola while still having Max BFB boost will not increase your speed.  \n• Eventhough it isn't listed, the Airstrike grants 25% less damage taken from Rocket Jumping.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410368778", "subreddit": "tf2", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Are you saying that if werewolves did exist, there would be less reason for people to say that werewolves exist, then in a world where they don't? \n\nNo, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that we have a many things people say exist that are (1) known to be fictitious, (2) believed to be real with no other evidence than the claim, (3) known to be real, and (4) thought to be real but with insufficient evidence to establish it.\n\nBecause it's easily possible for people to believe in things that are not real (see ghosts, loch ness monster, elves, magic, chupacabra, etc.), we can't say the odds of people believing in real things is higher **necessarily** than believing in false things (see also confirmation bias, personal experiences, faith healing, crystal healing, copper bands, sliver nitrate, penis enlargement, jumping to conclusions, etc.). We are BAD at looking at things and getting the right conclusion off the cuff.\n\nIf there are 10,000 known gods that mankind has believed in. And after analysis, we find 20,000 variants (assuming here that like the Christian god, believers can have god-claims that are far apart enough to justify distinct varieties (such as Trinitarians vs non)). And over the course of human history there have been 80 billion believers. So of those 20,000 gods, even if we pick the largest bucket of believers (1 billion (I think that's a stretch as Christianity and Islam god claims are sufficiently different to justify multiple gods per set of believers)), then we have 1 billion believers who were right (or at least close enough to right to win), and 79 billion who were wrong. Worse, what if god is nothing at all like anyone has every believed? Then its 80 billion to 0. Which is why I'm arguing that just because people believe in something it doesn't make it more likely to exist. And that it existing (but with us lacking any physical evidence to guide our belief) doesn't change the odds that believers are believing in what exists. \n\nAssume a god exists, but it's nothing like any god we've ever believed in. Does that gods existence change the likelihood of humans believing in it without some evidence to guide our belief? Same thing with elves. Maybe somewhere in the universe there are elves. Maybe they are even something like one of our elf beliefs. Does their existing (in some remote galaxy without interacting with us in any way, or providing physical evidence of their existence) in any way change the odds of whether people will believe in them? From my perspective, 0 interactions and 0 physical evidence = no change in the odds that believers will believe.

{"body": "Story time! Gather 'round.  \nI was at this bar, right? Good ratio of girls to guys tonight. I wasn't drinking that night because I was dd which was nice for a change. I walked up on these two girls who were obviously together, and we hit it off. They were definitely the hottest girls in the room. They told me they wanted me to go join them at the apartment they apparently shared, and I couldn't believe it. \"I'm going to get a threesome with these hot bitches? Sweet!\"  \nNext thing I know, I'm in the back seat of their car. One of them is driving, and I'm making out with the other. She tells me to lay down, and she starts sucking my dick. Next thing I know, she pulls my Dick out of her mouth and slams her fist into my balls.  \nI scream out in pain as the girl says \"Did you like that?\" I wanted to say \"no,\" but the only thing I could say was \"Ah! Fuck!\" Apparently, she took that as a \"yes,\" and SHE DID IT AGAIN! What was I supposed to do? I was in a moving car! I was scared that a third round was coming for me any minute. I rolled over and fell into the space between the back seat and the front seat as I contemplated my escape.  \nThe girl flipped me back over, and she was naked. She climbed on top of me, and my dick couldn't help but harden up (fuck college hormones). She slid a condom on me, and she just started fucking. I didn't know if I was being raped or if this was going to be one of those stories that always ends with \"that was a wild night.\" Apparently, I decided to just go with it and fuck her. It was amazing sex, but my balls still hurt too bad for me to come.  \nWe get to their apartment, and I'm thinking \"After that performance, I don't know if I should race then to bed or run for my life.\" They convince me to follow them to their place, and the next thing I know, I've got four beautiful boobs pressed against my face. It was amazing. Then I felt my hands going behind my back. I felt rope being tied around them. \"Oh shit. Now what?\"  \nThe girl I fucked in the car goes to the other room, and the other (hotter) one slips on my still-rubbered dick. \"Maybe this will be fun.\" I don't remember ever seeing the other girl come back around (probably because the boobs in my face were far too enticing for me to see anything else), but I sure felt it when she falcon punched my nuts. Good God, not again!  \nI wanted to run away, but with my arms tied I couldn't get up. The girl on top of me was still riding my dick, but it was rather hard to enjoy. Then, another uppercut to my little friends. My God, how much it hurt. I'm not even sure if this girl on top of me realized what was going on. I started kissing her hoping that it would distract me enough to enjoy this sex.  \nNot when a third one hit. I went soft (which I can't believe didn't happen sooner), and the girl quit riding me. She turned around and saw what her friend had been doing. I remember her saying something along the lines of \"I told you not to do that anymore!\". She replied \"I'll stop when I get my money.\" Puzzled, I said out loud \"What money?\".  \nShe quickly replied \"I need about three fiddy\". It was around this time I realized that those two were not girls at all. It was an 8 stories tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned loch ness monster had gotten me again!

{"body": "&gt;Do atheists believe in Ghosts (Or other supernatural things)?\n\n&gt;Some atheists do. Many do not. Atheism only describes a person's lack of belief in deities. Everything else is negotiable. Being an atheist does not necessarily make one a materialist, or a rationalist, or a humanist, or an empiricist, or a positivist, or a skeptic- it's just that being those things tends to make one an atheist. \n\n&gt;You can still be an atheist and believe completely uncritically in ghosts, reincarnation, souls, Heaven, Hell, zombies, wizards, unicorns, leprechauns, Bigfoot, spells, curses, auras, divination, astrology, homeopathy, crystal healing, psychics, Ouija boards, alien abductions, UFOs, astral projections, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster, The Lost City of Atlantis, and honest used car salesmen. \n\n&gt;Most of those you'll find here are skeptics, however, so they would apply the same skepticism they use with the god question to the paranormal as well. Given the complete lack of any evidence of ghosts, unicorns, or $SUPERNATURAL_THING, don't expect them to believe in it. \n\n&gt;If you have any evidence that they exist, you're welcome to submit it for peer review and collect your Nobel Prize, or at least contact James Randi so he can give you $1,000,000. \n\n[From the FAQ of your beloved /r/atheism](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/faq#wiki_do_atheists_believe_in_ghosts_.28or_other_supernatural_things.29.3F)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410438832", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Cap brings his grandmothers 150 year old recipe for tasting, and they both agree it is delicious.  The ear of corn surprisingly has a chili that is even better, with a mouth watering tangy spice.  The Hulk realizing he is beat decides to eat his entire pot of chili and then eats the ear of corn!  In an amazing feat of digestion, he shits out the corn laced chili into two bowls and hands them to the witch and RDJ.  Both are more than a little put off by what they just witnessed but are intrigued by the fragrant aroma coming the bowls of corny shit chili.  Hesitantly they both take a spoonful to their mouths, pausing to smell it first.  RDJ shrugs at the smell and after making the Obama \"not bad\" face he eats it.  The witch follows suit and they both look at each other and realize they must have another bite!  They dig in, spoon after spoon of shit corny soupy hulk goodness is better than the last.  Before long they have both finished their bowls and are begging Hulk for more!  Hulk obliges by bending over in front of them and spraying them with an enormous blast of corn chili diarrhea.   The witch stands full on towards the hulks prolapse anus with her tongue out of her mouth as if she getting blasted by an exploding soft serve ice cream machine.  RDJ grabs the witches hat collecting as much shit as he can in it and licking from the Hulks ass as it drips off his giant green balls.  When there is no more shit to be had from the hulk RDJ and the witch begin alternately vomiting their own consumed corn chili into each others mouths back and forth so that they can continue to taste it as long as possible.  In doing this they both become completely aroused!  Both of them are thoroughly covered in shit as RDJ rips the witches clothes off and begins eating her out.  The Hulk decides to join in with the witch sucking him off as the Cap quietly masturbates in the corner.  After a marathon session of fucking and licking ever bit of shit and cum from each other, Robert Downey Jr and the witch both shit into the hulks mouth again.  The hulk pisses all over them to clean them off and turns around shits their own shit back onto them!  After another session of shit chili sex corn sex the witch announces that she is pregnant!  She casts a spell and her belly grows instantly and she begins labor.  The baby comes out and it is green, but they don't know who the father is because even though hulk is green so is the witch.  As a concession they decide to ask Captain America what to name him and he says:  The Aristocrat!\n\nAnd that is how the Loch Ness Monster became the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

The highlight of the trip wasn't the French Quarter or the food but the half-day we spent on a tour of the swamps.\n\nOur general idea is to start in Glasgow but we expect to be in Oban by the end of the first day, after that we plan to see the country clockwise - Mull, Skye, northwest coast, Orkney, follow the coast around through Wick, make the obligatory stop at Urquart to look for Nessie (the most touristy thing we have planned actually), then through Cairngorms, Perth, Dumfermline and circle back to Glasgow.  The trip is years away but it is the reward we've promised ourselves for my completion of my graduate degree.  We're both in our mid-40's so this hasn't been easy, the trip is the prize for 6 years of hard work and sacrifice.\n\nUllapool is on the list, Fort William isn't but we've got no 100% firm plan.

{"body": "I'll make the dirty joke. \n\nThis story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago.\n\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\n\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty. Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute. A few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok. So, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\" Now it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\n\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\n\ntl;dr: Haha.. Bangkok.. what a funny name.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410527284", "subreddit": "ClubTeen", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was an only child growing up in rural kentucky, and after my parents divorced when I was only 6 I lived a fragmented, lonely life. Weeks at my dad's house were filled with lots of ranch work, because dad was really far behind on the mortgage and couldn't afford to hire on more help. I didn't too much like weekends at my mom's house because she was working two jobs, both as a server, so she could make ends meet.\n\nThere was a horse at my dad's ranch that we called 'Sage' because she had a beautiful gray coat that, in the correct light, could be percepted as a beautiful shade of her namesake. I said before that I lived a very lonely life, so when Dad unloaded Sage from the trailer that first time and she nuzzled at my hand I knew I had found my first friend.\n\nBetween feeding the animals and moving logs, I would always steal away to the stables or pen to spend a few minutes with Sage. We would play a game where she mimicked my actions; if I ran around the yard, she would follow and match my pace. A few quick head bobs, and she would return in kind. My favorite trick was to jump up in the air and watch as Sage reared her legs like a fierce stallion.\n\nMy childhood came to a shattering crash one October morning when I woke to the sound of a shotgun and dogs barking. I bolted upright in bed and yelled out for my dad, and when he didn't respond I tenuously crept from my bed and shuffled my way through the house, clutching my own self tightly.\n\nThats when the world around me flooded in and I heard a sound that made my stomach turn - the pained, agony filled cries of a mare and the verbose, damning curses of my dad. Disregarding shoes, the cold weather, and the possibility of imminent danger, I ran outside into the cresting sun.\n\nMy body was immediately wracked with dread. My father stood there in the stables. Doors flung wide. Buckets, rakes, and shovels were scattered. And blood. Blood everywhere. A coyote lay in the yard, riddled with buckshot.  That wasn't all. I knew it. I could sense it.\n\nAs I crept up to the stable doors, I caught a glimpse of Sage laying on the ground and I broke into a sprint for the last 12 feet. Dad turned, with a tear welling in his eye, and held up his hand, motioning for me to stay back. I ran past dad, dropped to my knees, and began sobbing harder than I've ever sobbed in my life. I lifted Sage's heavy head in my hands, and her limp neck poured blood from a fresh, warm gash torn by a hungry coyote. Between sobs, cursing the world for all its evils, and refusing to believe my only friend in the world could possibly die, I turned to my dad and begged him, implored him, demanded of him *How? How can this happen?*\n\nMy father took a knee beside me, slid a hand over my shoulder, and brought my head into his chest. He kissed the top of my head, squeezed me tight, and whispered, \"Imma need bout tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410558053", "subreddit": "standupshots", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You have a lot going on here, and I'm going to word vomit a bit here. The reason you are asking the question is that you believe that most of the genome is evolving neutrally, I think. Kimura's (nearly) neutral theory was revolutionary because it gave us a null model for testing for evolution. But we do know today that it doesn't apply to most organisms at all. A primary example that comes to mind is [this 2005 Nature paper by Peter Andolfatto](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7062/full/nature04107.html) which showed that the majority of non-coding DNA is under significant selection. \n\nIn the paragraph you pasted below a bunch of things struck me, one thing is that Kimura stated in that excerpt that rates of selection do not correlate with effective population size. We now know they do, [here is a recent review of selection within plants that shows how purifying selection is highly correlated with effective population in plants](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110512-135851) (Bigger Ne = more selection). This pattern holds true for positive selection in animals too. \n\nAnother thing that throws a wrench in Kimura's assumptions is the presence of selection from standing variation, called \"soft sweeps\". All of these models new beneficial alleles arise from mutation alone, and there fore start at very low frequency, but we know this isn't true. [Here is a summary on Haldane's Sieve on a paper on soft sweeps in Drosophila from Dimitri Petrov's group] (http://haldanessieve.org/2013/03/11/our-paper-soft-selective-sweeps-are-the-primary-mode-of-recent-adaptation-in-drosophila-melanogaster/)\n\nBut on your specific question of how many sites could be simultaneously selected, I'm not sure we know. Everything you're talking about here is positive selection, and as a general rule we think that most positive selection happens so quickly that we can't even see it in action, we can only see the effects after the fact. If this is generally true, then you wouldn't expect many alleles to every be under selection at the same time, because they are all sweeping to fixation in the blink of an eye and therefore wont overlap in time likely. Obviously there are ways this could be false, like a species adapting to a new environment that poses many challenges. So it might be interesting to see if there is actually an upper limit on the number of sites being selected in a system like that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410585209", "subreddit": "evolution", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Do you understand that a resume is pretty much like the loch ness monster? There are stories of it's existence, but no actual evidence.\n\nWhat I mean by this is that the idea of a resume is great, but there are no standards. Each field has some random hard to find out set of rules and ideas for what a resume should be. One page, two page, font type, font size, spacing, how to display years worked at, listing addresses, bullet points, how much self promotion should be done, where your contact info goes, references? Not sure. Might as well guess.\n\nMy highly educated girlfriend, who makes me feel stupid when it comes to book smarts, is paying someone $350 right now to remake her resume. Literally move stuff around on the paper, and change some of the wording, so she can go from public sector to private sector, in the SAME FIELD. Oh and this is just to keep her options open for work in case of an emergency. Like we have to relocate for family illness, etc. If she tries to use her public sector resume, it will likely get shoved under a rug. Also, if she wants to apply to several industries in the private sector that all fall under her degree, she has to remake it again, for every industry.\n\nSo, with that said, I am glad some companies want to hire people that don't know exactly what they are looking for in a resume. They basically tell you, this is the important information I want. Fill it out if you aren't a moron.

I cant seem to hide my virgin boner so they start giggling. the girl I had a crush on pull my boxers off revealing my dick.. she then looks me in the eyes and starts to slowly suck up and down my cock while the other girls feel my muscles and like my nipples... it was the best night of my life. things were getting really hot and she decided to try somethin new. she gets on top of me and tells me \"are you ready, big boy?\"... I knew what was coming. she guides my manhood and slowly goes up and down teasing my cock with her pussy lips. im about to explode. the feeling starts to get normal and I dont feel like cumming but it feels amazing so I start bucking up and down following her rhythm. im lasting longer than shes expecting. the other 2 girls are busy playing with each other so I pay no attention.. her tits bouncing up and down like fleshy pendulums.. she looked like a goddess. she starts moaning and screaming, her screams and moans keep getting louder. im bucking as hard as I can trying to please her as hard as I can.. I cant hold it in ny longer! with a huge spasm and grunt I explode inside her and we both cum and spasm at the same time.... she gets off of me and puts her head on my chest and we r both heaving and puffing  from exhaustion.

Even if he does not know how to properly operate a shotgun or beat a man to death with bare hands. **Heavy type: Sandvich Amush**\n\nEngineer Nambrik was a normal man, that is until the fateful day his inheiretance caught up with him. As is normal with all engineers, his neck had a major growth spurt that left him with horrifying stretch marks. To save his pride, and to hide his strange nature, he wears an unassuming scarf to blend in with the normal hatless engineers of Teufort. **Engineer style: Classic Reserved**\n\nMedic Namrik is a fearful man who once saw a man get a paper cut and was completely terrified of the prospect that blood comes out of humans. Armed with the least threatening weapons while still adhering to Mann Co.'s Minimal Armanent Programs, he decides that maybe that heavy should take care of these guys. **Medic Type: Extremely passive, I mean ffs, you have an amputator and stock syringes**\n\nSniper Nambrik decided that hiding in the shadows was the best idea ever. So he decided th cover his entire head with as much black cloth as possible to blend in, because \"that's where all the important stuff is\". Never mind that he'll get heat stroke when sniping in the desert. Never mind that in spite of his camoflague ablilities his torso is still glaringly red and perfectly shootable. **Sniper type:Standard Professional**\n\nSpy Nambrik is a perverse fellow. Slowly hiding and stalking his vicitims, he's a real creeper. Whenever he gets caught in Ladies' Bathrooms, he pulls out the old \"I'm a cop routine\". Never worked out for him. Luckily his diguise ablities keep him safe. Until, of course a wayward crocket kills him. **Spy type: Passive stalker, right behind you**(How much longer are you gonna camp?

I was driving on some secluded backroads because I was on a burn run with some friends... I saw something run out from the trees right infront of my car and I swerved to avoid it. That's the last thing I remember. I don't even remember what I was even spooked by... I guess if there's one thing to take from this story, it's \"Don't do drugs.\" Anyway... the car flipped, which blows my mind because if I recall, I wasn't going any faster than 40mph. I don't remember much other than waking up in the hospital... let's face it you know shit is bad when you wake up in the hospital. The doctor on duty came in to see me shortly after I came to. It's a little hazy but I remember he seemed somehow more animated than a regular person. The problem was even though I could see his lips moving, I couldn't hear anything. In movies and shit you always see people freak out over this sort of thing - and maybe I was still out of it... or maybe the weed was just really good (haha, jk... dont do drugs, seriously) - but it didn't even click for me. I just passed back out shortly after he came in. It wasn't until I awoke the next time that I realized something was seriously wrong. I couldn't hear. I had to get explanations in writing. It was the scariest moment of my life. To realize that a gift that you never fully appreciated had been taken from you forever. The doctor initially took time to (legibly!) write notes to me about my condition. He explained I had experienced anoxic encephalopathy due to the crash. I had landed in a small puddle that was just deep enough to cover my airways. They said when they found me they thought I was dead... turns out I was for a few minutes. The brain damage wasn't all too severe... I mean, overall I can still function. But one of my lobes were deprived so badly that it has caused me to become legally deaf. My sense of smell is kind of iffy too but that's a whole 'nother story. So yeah, I was legally dead and used to be able to hear. Do my dreams still have sound? Well, they never really did come to think of it. So no... But you know there is one more strange thing. Come to think of it, I had a dream recently... I relived the events. And I clearly saw the thing that spooked me... Now I wouldn't believe it either if anyone told me, but I believe this to be true. The thing that jumped out at me that night?

We shared everything together and I loved her (or thought I did) completely. Then it came crashing down in one instant.\n\nRight after we graduated we moved in together. It was a small, cramped 1 bedroom, but it was our place and we snazzed it up as much as we could. At the time of this story, we had been living in this place about 6 months and tensions were starting to run high. One day she came home from work later than usual one day with a small faint bruise on her neck that clearly looked like a hicky. My heart sank and my mind started racing. I wanted to ask her about it, but not in accusatory way in case I was wrong. I casually brought it up as best I could, and she gave me worst death glare imaginable. I asked her about again when didn't reply and she blew up on me unleashing a tirade of things she was unhappy about in our relationship. It completely broke my heart. \n\nOn the verge of tears, I asked her we could salvage what we had and if there was anything she needed from me to make it better. She turned around and stormed into the bedroom, locking the door behind her. I remember just standing in confusion about what just went on. I knocked for about 5 minutes before she slowly unlocked the door. When I opened it, I saw that she had lacerations all over her face from a razor blade. She had cut her face up in some form of a stress response. She just kind of sat there mumbling to herself. I tried getting her attention, but to no avail. Eventually I go frustrated, go down to eye level with her and firmly asked her if she needed help. She looked me dead in the eye and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was at that time I realized she was a five hundred foot tall lizard from the Paleolithic era.

They have to give him shots and weigh him, make sure he's generally healthy. When the nurse finally came over and I asked her quite angry \"What. The. Fuck. Have you done with my son?!\". When I heard what she said, my entire world fell apart. He wasn't healthy, they had to put him in an incubator thing. I broke down and asked her; \"Is there anything I can do to save him?!\". They let me see him and right away i could tell he wasn't mine. They said could give him an operation and at that point I couldn't help it, i can't believe what I said. I asked how much it would cost. After discussing it with the other doctors she came back and told me \"Well.. We could operate him, but it would cost around tree fiddy.  I told them to go ahead with it. I didn't speak with my wife, i just went back to the cafeteria to process. I had to call my brother to figure out what to do, he gave me some sound advice i stole this from chanderlurist. I ended up forgiving her and i'm honestly happy with my family.

{"body": "Side note: I've no idea what Scottish lingo is like. So if I'm way off with Gramp's speech, let me know for future reference.\n\n***\n\nI loved my grandpa, but at times he could come off as... well... he was crazy quite frankly. But he was a wonderful story-teller.\n\nHe was from Scotland, and thus was a self-proclaimed expert in Scottish lore. Most of it was well-known Gaelic legends (the Loch Ness monster and stories like that), but there were some stories that he seemed to make up.\n\nToday, sitting out on my front porch in a rocking chair of his creation, I was reminded of one of those stories.\n\nWhenever he came to visit, before his passing, he would join me during the occasional mornings when I gazed out at the mountains. A glint would show in his eyes on those mornings, and he'd launch into a vague mythological tale that I'd heard many times before.\n\nThis particular tale was associated with the mists that came down the mountain, and the last time he told it was within the last couple of months before he died.\n\nWe were sitting outside, taking in the beauty and peace of the Cascades. Our coffees were steaming, keeping us warm during the chilly morning. Mine had cream, but Gramps' was black; he'd never had a sweet tooth. It was dawn, and the smell of the wilderness gathered around us, as if to listen to Bobbie's upcoming fable. The mist had picked this morning to crawl down the mountains.\n\nThe new sun reflected off of it, adding a rainbow to the the spectacular view in front of us. The mist made the greens of the grass and leaves seem like emeralds. It almost felt like Scotland.\n\nI looked over to my grandfather; he was in the rocking chair. He'd stopped swaying and had taken on a stoic look. It was unusual for him; he'd usually share his stories in a jovial-fashion saved for just those occasions. To see him sitting still made me a little uneasy.\n\n\"Gavin,\" he started in his think Scottish accent, \"have I ever told ye' about the mist of the mountains?\"\n\n\"No, grandpa, you haven't.\" I always told him this to keep his spirits up. His focus was still on the mist slowly creeping toward us.\n\n\"Y'know, these mounts aren't so different from the ones back in Scotland where I grew up as a wee lad. What are they called again?\"\n\n\"The Cascades, Grandpa.\"\n\n\"The Cascades, eh? That has a nice ring to it. It makes sense. That mist a-cascading down. Well, back in good, old Scotland, the mist had meaning. It wasn't just a regular phenomenon of the nature. Sometimes the mist — quite similar to this morning's actually — was mystical.\"\n\nThe mist had seemed different that morning now that he'd mentioned it; it had an unusual glow.\n\n\"With the mist came an ancient creature known as the banshee. Or more commonly known as the bean nighe.\"\n\n\"Beignet? The donut?\" I asked, knowing I was wrong. I always enjoyed pestering him with this, though. After all, the name was almost homonymous.\n\n\"No, not a blasted donut, laddie! She's a fairy.\"\n\n\"Like those small little creatures with wings. Like Tinkerbell?\"\n\n\"What the hell is a Tinkerbell? No. She's the same size as you or me, and she ain't got no sissy wings. She's a creature of fate. They say, once you see 'er, the ending of your book is coming near. She's appears to some as a precursor to the Cù Sìth, the hound that collects yer soul.\n\n\"The Bean nighe appears in a host o' forms. To most, she appears as an unsightly creature. Webbing between 'er toes. Her chebs hanging all the way down to the webbing. A long, nasty tooth sticking out of her mouth. And a single nostril on her drooping nose. She's a hag dressed in a sickly green dress. It is said she originates from the souls of women who never made it through labor.\n\n\"In English words, she's known as the Washer o' the Ford. She washes the bloodied clothes of the doomed. If someone approaches 'er with peace in their 'earts, she trades them. After you answer three of her questions, she answers three of your questions\n\n\"There are some who say,\" he chuckled at what he was about to say, \"that someone can acquire a wish from 'er. But in order to do so, you have to muster the courage to approach her while she's washing the clothes of those who are nearing death. Then, you have to suckle from her breasts and tell her that you are her foster child.\n\n\"There a lucky few to whom she appears as a gorgeous enchantress, the epitome of beauty to the viewer. It wouldn't surprise me if she had followed those Scottish immigrants to this country. Creatures do that. Everyone associates them with geographic areas, but it's the people they're attached to.\n\n\"But she is merely a story. I've never seen her, so there is no way she could be real.\" There was Grandpa's signature stubbornness. \n\nHis eyes hadn't moved since the beginning of his fable. \"Now, I'm going for a walk, sonny. I'll be back later. Don't wait up.\"\n\nBobbie then started limping toward the mist as I got up. I collected our now-empty mugs and went back inside to sleep some more.\n\nThe next time I saw my grandpa was around noon. He came hiking back with a cane that I'd never seen before. It was a smooth, mahogany walking stick embossed with two women, one old, one young; the two forms of the bean nighe that he'd mentioned earlier.\n\nI asked him about it, and he said that he'd found it along the edge of the trail. He'd then spent the next few hours carving out the images. He left the next morning to go back to my parents, but not before giving me an unusually long hug with a tear in his eye.\n\n\"I don't say it enough, boy, but I love ye. Stay safe.\"\n\n\"I will. I love you, too.\" And with that he left.\n\nThat was the last time I saw him. He died a few weeks later from a heart attack. This had taken place about a decade ago, but I could still picture that day with complete clarity.\n\nThis dawn was a carbon copy of that one. My coffee looked the same, and the same mist was making its way down the mountain. I smiled as I recollected the mornings spent with Bobbie. I really did miss him.\n\nThat was when I saw her. An alluring young women stood at the edge of the mist. She was dressed in a vibrant green dress that matched the grass; it trailed behind her disappearing into the fog. She was about 200 yards away, but I knew who she was immediately.\n\nThe bean nighe.\n\nSuddenly the realization of what had sparked my grandfather's tale many years ago became apparent. \n\nShe'd probably come to warn me of death, but for some reason I didn't care. In that moment, I only thought of one thing. I got up from the same chair my grandfather had, placed my mug on the side table, and began following the same steps of Bobbie.\n\nI was going to collect my wish.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410900136", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Old but still great:\n\nYesterday was my 19th birthday, so me and my buddies decided to celebrate by going to the bars at my college campus (minimum age is 19). I usually don't drink too much, but, since it was a special occasion, I decided to get really *******\t wasted. We pregramed a lot before the bar, since it's difficult to obtain alcohol in a bar when none of us are 21, plus it's really expensive so I wasn't trying too hard to get my friends with fake IDs to buy me some. I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my ******* mind. \n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this really sexy chick dancing by herself. Being drunk as ****\t , I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance sexy? Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up grinding hard/making out a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes. \n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated. We were making out a lot on my bed, and we took off each others shirts and things were really escalating. I had her panties off, and I was starting to think me losing my virginity was a sure thing. I could tell she was really into it. She said \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". I figured she meant me going down on her, and me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\". Then the question came: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said \"I aint givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money! Get out of my goddamn apartment!\" \n\nWorst birthday of my life.\n\n\nsteamcommunity.com/id/thumbmuscles", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410907474", "subreddit": "GiftofGames", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well I mean in Christianity angels are in the same spiritual realm that God occupies. Angels, demons, Satan, The Trinity (God, Jesus, Holy Spirit), Cherubim, Seraphim etc... They all exist in the spiritual realm. Obviously demons and Satan are in Hell and the rest in Heaven. But they are also active in the earthly realm as well. That is all Biblical. Idk what the imaginary realm would be really besides like ghosts, bigfoot, loch ness monster type stuff. \n\nI guess that carries into the next question too. We just go by what is in the Bible. But oftentimes the Bible is perverted to twist into a personal belief. And that is apparent throughout history, and Christians are not the only religion guilty of it. And as a Christian a lot of that stuff breaks my heart. A big issue right now is homosexuality and people have the impression that \"God hates fags\", which is not Biblical. Literally the only rule for being a Christian can be broken down into one word: Love. Luke 10: 25-28 \"25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”\n\n26 “What is written in the Law?” he replied. “How do you read it?”\n\n27 He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’[c]; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[d]”\n\n28 “You have answered correctly,” Jesus replied. “Do this and you will live.”\n\nThat's it. So I think the vocal people and the ones that give everyone the impression that Christians are ignorant dicks aren't doing Christianity the way Jesus intended. Obviously there are so many things said in the Bible and if we were face to face I could talk all day about all the \"inconsistencies\" in the Old Testament, and \"how can God/you preach love when he sends people to Hell for not doing what he says?\" But to answer your question in the most simple way is just to love people the way Jesus demonstrated. Try your best every day to act like Jesus and follow Him and love him and others and that's all you can do. I hope that answered your question somewhat.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410910481", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt; ISIS is Islamic if that's what they claim to be but they are also not Islamic by the definition of the religion.\n\nThis is the point I was making. Whose definition of the religion are you using? If members of ISIS adhere to all the same tenets of Islam that 'true' Muslims do, how can anyone deny that they are Muslims simply because we do not approve of their behaviour? There is no Muslim or Christian alive that follows every commandment of their respective holy book, so if you want to be consistent then you should hold them all to the same standard, in which case no one would qualify as a Muslim or Christian.  \nIt would be like the LGBT community announcing \"we no longer recognize this person as being gay because they committed this awful crime.\" It's asinine.\n\n&gt; As stated through many polls, many people consider themselves atheist but also believe in some kind of entity, or spirit, or energy, etc. By definition they are not atheist but because they mark themselves as such then they are.\n\nYou didn't cite any sources for that, but I'll take your word for it. Regardless, the one and only requirement to be an atheist is to lack a belief in any gods. Beyond that, atheists can believe in anything they like - ghosts/spirits, spiritual energy, karma, homeopathy, the Loch Ness Monster, etc.  \nI've no doubt that many atheists do hold some strange and unjustifiable beliefs, but as stated, the only requirement to \"join the club\" is the absence of belief in a deity.  \n\n&gt;&gt; on what criteria is legitimate membership determined?\n\n&gt; To the best of my knowledge, most religions have some sort of initiation ceremony eg Baptism in Christianity\n\nIf this is the only criterion on which to determine religious affiliation, then members of ISIS are indisputably Muslim and Obama is incorrect. It would also mean that many Christians-turned-atheist would still be considered Christian as there is often no means to annul baptismal records.  \nHowever, I think you may have misunderstood my question. What I actually meant was this - If Obama and others feel they have the authority to determine who is a 'true' Muslim and who is not, on what grounds do they make such a judgement?\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410910513", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The break in the routine was sufficiently large to convince her that she did in fact need to adhere to her routine in this given situation. Therefore, she acts \"hysterical\" not only because her routine has gone back to being a subject of obsession, but also because the break in that routine is at least partially her fault. Proclaiming \"you made me use my last sugar packet\" is her way of displacing responsibility onto someone else, and you can tell she's displacing responsibility because she didn't ask for the refund. \n\nIf the incompetence of OP was what her thought pattern started with, rather than \"I(sic) tastes nothing like my morning coffee,\" I would be more likely to believe that she actually blamed anyone other than herself for this event, and less likely to believe that her primary source of concern is the break in routine caused by herself. Perfectly fitting the routine, for her, would involve walking up to the counter, ordering her medium roast hot coffee, and the cashier saying \"I need about 3.50,\" then rearing his 50-foot-tall neck and going back to the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "It is like being lost in the desert for 12 years, sustaining yourself only with the few drops of water you're able to squeeze out of plants every couple of days. You learned long ago to carry on, to keep pushing yourself forward, but the lack of water (and food) has whittled you down to a bag of skin and bones.\n\nOne day, in the distance, you spot something impossible: a vending machine. As you get closer, you can work out the letters on the front, and your heart skips a bit. \"SURGE\" it says. You rub your eyes a few times, refusing to believe them. You've fallen for mirages in the past, and your heart just can't take another disappointment. Still, you are unable to stop your feet from carrying you forward. As you get closer, it becomes crisper, clearer. Your heart starts to pound, your mind starts to believe. Finally, after what feels like a lifetime, you're standing in front of it. Fog is billowing out of the tray where beverages are dispensed. You reach out for a moment and touch it, the nerves in your fingertips affirming what you already know in your heart: It's real. After 12 long years, it's here. You press one of the buttons, and hear that distinctive clunking as it dispenses. As the ice cold beverage comes out of the machine, you see the desert around you turning green, plantlife spreading like wildfire from the machine. You crack the top and a torrent of water rushes past you, forming a river. As you raise the can to your lips, the hair on the back of your neck stands up, and your body becomes covered in goosebumps. As that sweet nectar touches your lips, and splashes onto your tongue, the world turns white. After a few moments of ecstasy, your vision focuses on a large shape in front of you. It's the loch ness monster, and he says: \"That'll be about tree fiddy.\" That, sir, is how it was.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410997424", "subreddit": "nostalgia", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Every claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nFaith is one of the few reasons that people give that I wouldn't really argue with. If you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. \n\nI could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. \n\nBesides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god? So, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410998764", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm voting yes for a few reasons. I'll admit, I'm not hugely politically minded, so there's a lot I don't know, but I still feel it's important to vote and have my say in what I feel with what I do know.\n\nThroughout the whole campaign, I've felt that the No side of things have made little effort to truly convince people that it's the right thing to do. There's been a lot of scare mongering going on recently, with banks and big businesses claiming that they'll leave us if we do to independent, which is hugely childish in my opinion. Up until recently, it felt like a lot of English politicians weren't taking the whole thing seriously at all, then suddenly once it became apparent that the Yes vote was taking a small lead, they started to care and came up to Scotland to say their part to convince the Scottish citizens to stay in the UK. I've personally felt quite undermined as a country during the campaign. It's as though the nation is being treated as a child demanding to stay up later at night, when in reality, this has been a very serious matter from the start. \n\nAs someone explained earlier in the thread, the Devo Max option is really what most people would have been happy with, but it was scrapped, because it was assumed by the English government because they didn't seem to want to change anything and didn't think the Yes voters were actually a big enough threat to make any change happen. Then at the last minute, it sort of sprung up again once the realisation hit. It's been pretty pathetic. I even heard recently that there were \"reported sightings of the Loch Ness Monster down in England\". I truly hope that was just a poor joke.\n\nI totally understand and appreciate why people will be voting yes and no, for different reasons. I would never argue with anyone over it, as everyone has their different priorities. But just seeing the events through this campaign has made me realise how much of a joke we seem to the current UK government, and I don't want to be run by people who see us as that.\n\nIt really has been a long run for us all here and I wish everyone in the country the best of luck for their side come Friday morning. There's been an incredible amount of passion from both sides and I hadn't noticed until very recently that this whole thing is actually being noticed by the rest of the world. No matter what happens, I'm sure we'll get some good benefits and then get shafted later down the road, but that's politics. I'm just hoping that Thursday night is going to be a fun one to remember! Rumour has it that some of the pubs are staying open until about 7am when the votes come in on Friday morning, so I look forward to that!\n\nTL;DR Aye.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411003386", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Applause and Braavosi murmur filled the playhouse as the troupe of mummers bowed deeply on a stage that somehow seemed to tilt. Near the edge of the pit, a girl with a thousand league stare sat still as a statue, her cup untouched. At her side a knight smiled at the costumed girl who blew a kiss in his direction. He drank the last of his Andalish sour and grimaced.  \n\"Would that we understood their tongue at least...\", he said and turned towards the girl who averted her head and ran her fingers through tousled hair. The cold had claimed the tip of her nose, and while Ser Justin did his best not to look, she never failed to notice how uncomfortable she made him.  \n\"I see the way you look at them. The girls. I saw it often enough in Kings Landing.\"  \n\"My lady...\", he began.  \n\"I used to dread those looks. How silly of me. There are far worse things to dread.\"  \nAround them, some patrons prepared to leave, while others prepared to eat and drink. Especially the latter.  \nSuddenly the knight tensed up and slowly placed a hand on the hilt of his sword, his eyes fixed on a stout serving wench seemingly heading straight for their table. As she approached the knight rose and stepped between her and the girl.  \n\"You have the wrong table.\", he said with a voice cold as ice.  \nThe wench frowned, she seemed to know but a little of the common tongue of Westeros. Finally, with a smile, she set down her tray.  \n\"Cake of lemon, gift from Mercy, mummer girl!\"  \nSer Justin scanned the room, but the mummers were nowhere to be seen.  \n\"Oh... and where could I give my thanks to this.. Mercy. Will she be around?\"  \n\"If quick, room for other clothes up stairs, end of hall, many big rooms.\" The wench pointed at a door next to the stage. \"Only thanking!\", she laughed, and left.  \nSer Justin Massey bit his lip and gave the girl a quick glance.  \n\"Go to her.\"  \n\"Would that I could, but my place is here, it's the honor of a knight to protect his lady.\"  \n\"I'm not your lady, and I'll be fine. No one will recognize me.\"  \nThe knight fell silent, looking down at the table.  \n\"To be sure, no one will bother me, not anymore. Go.\"  \n\"Well... as my lady commands. I will be back in a few heartbeats, before your cake is finished. Please do eat something at least.\"  \nHe left in a hurry, and as the door closed behind him she was startled by someone standing next to her, a girl her age dressed in a brown wool tunica and heavy boots, the very same that had blown a kiss from the stage.  \n\"Ser Justin went to look for you.\" the girl said.  \n\"Just so.\" The mummer replied, and climbed into the opposing chair silent as a cat.  \nA few moments passed while the mummer stared into her eyes.  \n\"Mercy?\"  \n\"Mercedine really, they call me Mercy. What do they call you?\"  \n\"I... I don't know, if...\"  \n\"You don't know your name?\", the mummer asked amused, tilting her head.  \nTears welled up in the girls eyes. \"I do, I do know my name, I am Arya of House Stark, I remember my name, I do.\"  \nMercy's smile disappeared and she blinked a few times.  \n\"That, I did not expect,\" she finally said, \"what brings you here Arya of House Stark?\"  \n\"My father was killed. I had nowhere to go. I've seen and done things I don't want to think about. But we escaped.\" She stared at the lemon cake. \"I feel like the ghost of a complete stranger.\"  \nMercy said nothing, but reached out and touched her cheek. \"Your knight will be returning soon, I should leave, but remember, when the winds of winter blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. I can help you survive. Valar dohaeris.\"    \n\"Before you leave, tell me true, how much do I owe you for the lemon cake?\"  \nMercedine pondered this. \"About tree fiddy.\"  \nShe rose and left.

However, his parents were two revolutionaries that despised the clear-cut definitions that the Qun imposed on them, and openly rebelled against the society they were born into. The idea of \"Asit tal-eb\" - \"it is to be\" - dictates that everything in the world has a purpose, and everything is symbiotic to eachother. Armurhan's parents detested this notion, and, both being bull-headed warriors, set out with a mercenary band and set sail for Orlais - problem being, his mother was already pregnant. On the trip, the mother went into labour... a week from Rivain, with limited supplies. \n\nArmurhan was born, a rather big guy(for you), and was raised on the boat, travelling around Rivain with the merry band of mercenaries. After one night in Afsaana, the young Armurhan stumbled back to the docks and into his parent's cabin. \"What the fuck do you want\" one exclaimed. \"I need about tree fiddy\" It was around this time they realised Armuhan was a giant Old God from the Exalted Age. Armurhan's mother jumped out of the boat and said \"by the Qun what on Thedas is that creature\" he stood above them looking down with these big purple flaming breaths and i can't be fucked to carry on\n\nHope I win", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411073296", "subreddit": "dragonage", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I waited in line for about 14 hours for a product once.  The only time I've ever done anything like that.  Of course it was for an Apple product.  The new (at the time) Macbook Air.  The one that Steve Jobs famously pulled out of the envelope.  I had seen and owned Windows based netbooks at the time but nothing even remotely as powerful as what the Macbook Air seemed to promise.  The store was still open for that days business and some employees came out and gave me some t-shirts and stickers and talked to me about the Macbook Air.  Kinda cool.\n\nI was literally the first person there.  Had 2 different shifts of security guards for the shopping center bug me, but they ultimately let me chill.  I waited for about 6 hours in a little folding chair I brought.  No one else showed up.  I started to get hungry and there was a 7-11 right around the corner.  So I went and got some noms.  I would guess the entire trip took about 20 minutes.  \n\nWhen I got back there were like 50 people in line.  I had left my chair when I went to 7-11 and it was still there near the entrance to the Apple store.  I walked up with the intention of picking it up and taking the walk of shame back to the end of the line.  But when I got to it, no one seemed to bat an eye so I thought \"what's the worst that can happen?\" and sat down.  No one cared!!!!  It was definitely not the reaction I would have expected in this particular area.  Tons of snooty people that are usually incredibly rude to anyone who didn't wear thousand dollar suits.  And there I was in sweat pants with a bag of Doritos.\n\nAnyway, the day comes and the doors open.  They had a whole...presentation to the way they greeted everyone.  They gave us some basic rules about respecting each other and not rushing in.  Said they had enough stock that no one need worry.  Surprisingly they didn't mention a one per customer rule.  I don't think anyone bought more than one but I don't think Apple would have said no.\n\nSo I go in and talk to a sales rep and they tell me all about the Macbook and Apple Care and accessories and general salesman stuff.  I tell them I just want the Macbook and suddenly they aren't so nice.\n\nThey would NOT take no for an answer.  They kept pushing the Apple Care on me to the point of basically telling me I was stupid if I didn't buy it.  So I caved.  It wasn't really a BAD thing to have but I could just barely afford it.  I wasn't happy about how pushy they were but we walk up to the counter and they start telling me about other services.  One on One and other stuff... \n\nI flatly refuse.  Get my shit and get out is all I'm thinking at this point.  I pay for the Macbook and Applecare and a few other things.  The total is more than I've ever spent in cash on any one purchase in my life.  I start heading out and at least 3 different employees are just waiting to leap on me with other sales propositions.  \"Aw man you aren't getting the speakers!?\", \"Dude have you seen the cases we have?\"  Why would anyone want a case for the beautiful Macbook Air?\n\nI'm so excited and can't wait to see my new Macbook in person.  I was unwrapping it before I even got out of the store.  As I take the lid off of the box and tuck the bottom box into it to get a look at the Macbook, one of the employees bumps my arm and I drop the fucker.  Huge dent in the bottom right corner that is still there to this day.\n\nI tell them I want another one and point out that the employee knocked it out of my hands.  They don't give a single fuck.  \n\n\"Good thing you got Applecare\" they say.  \n\nI argued with them for about an hour and by the end had talked to three different people all claiming to be the one with whom the buck stopped.  All of them tell me the same thing.  I can get it fixed through Applecare.\n\nWhatever..I'll fucking use it for a little while and eventually I'll get Applecare to fix it.  That shouldn't be so bad, right?  Except there's a fucking deductible.  I ask how much the deductible is and the guy says \"I need about tree fiddy\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411109764", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You approve the repair and he replaces the o2 sensor. You get your car back and all is right with the world. The next day you head to work and the check engine light comes on again. You take your car back and the mechanic doesn't know what's wrong because he is an idiot. He doesn't know how to diagnose the car. Now you have to find a new mechanic and pay him to properly diagnose the problem. As it turns out, it was a vacuum leak caused by a cracked hose.

{"body": "sorry I'm not the best communicator. I definitely meant to say that i was paleo and started to feel bad when i stopped. I know that the paleo diet requires one to eliminate certain foods, but no my friend, it's not an elimination diet where one eliminates one category at a time to gauge response. as far as i know the paleo diet is a modern nutritional diet designed to emulate, insofar as possible using modern foods, the diet of wild plants and animals eaten by humans during the Paleolithic era.[1] Proponents of the diet therefore recommend avoiding any foods that are thought not to have been available to humans at that time, including dairy products, grains, legumes, processed oils, and refined sugar.\n\nSo realistically, while paleo offers the benifit of eliminating certain groups of food and you can see how that makes you feel, the motivating factor behind the entire diet in the first place is the fact that our distant ancestors literally fed upon this diet for a significant portion of their evolution, therefore it makes sense that we are evolved to eat this way. It's not an \"elimination experiment diet\". it's the way 99.99999999% of your genetic contribution subsisted.\n\nI literally just copy pasted that definition from wikipedia, but don't worry this isn't a college essay, so no MLA citations are needed. \n\nSo i know that if my body is saying \"no\" to rice or beans or whatever then maybe i should just stop eating those foods...but i ate those items for 26 years before paleo without problem. My body CAN handle it. My question is how do i get back there. I do not want to be paleo forever. I have my reasons. No, I did not develop some weird disease during those two years on paelo. This is not an episode of House MD. \n\nNice smoking analogy. Its always nice when people compare being healthy and getting unhealthy to getting healthy and then becoming unhealthy.\n\nBut honestly, I appreciate your well thought out response.

{"body": "&gt; Is it such an evil thing to say that serial rapists for example must face some sort of punishment (system of punishment) and that rape is morally reprehensible (criteria by which we are judged)?\n\nThis doesn't answer the questions I asked you.  At all.\n\n&gt; By not choosing to believe in God you are choosing hell.\n\nI don't choose not to believe in gods.  I also don't choose to not believe in unicorns, leprechauns, bigfoot, nessie, etc.  I don't choose my beliefs, they're not an act of my will.  I don't believe in any of those things because I haven't been convinced, and I can't choose to be convinced.\n\n&gt; God is not involved in your life does not follow from this sentence.\n\nProve God is involved in my life.\n\n&gt; One does not have to accept claims for them to be true.\n\nVery true, and accepting a claim as true does not make it so.\n\n&gt; I never said he was in there for life.\n\nBut you have said that hell works that way, I'm just evening up the analogies.\n\n&gt; God being all knowing and all loving would not punish people with hell who did not deserve it.\n\nBut God being all-knowing would mean he would know that someone who is born will end up in hell, even before they are born, so he is responsible for them going to hell since he created hell in the first place and he allowed them to be born.  And if God is all-loving that means he should not allow someone to be born if he knows they will end up in hell.\n\n&gt; No, free will always allows for evil acts to be committed.\n\nSo free will doesn't exist in heaven?\n\n&gt; They are wrong, heaven is a place where our wills are freed from committing evil based on our free will in this life. \n\nSo, nobody will commit evil acts in heaven because their will has been altered to not allow them to, yeah?  I don't see a distinction.\n\n&gt; Likewise hell is a place where our wills are enslaved by sin based on our choices to embrace sin in this life.\n\nSo free will is also altered in hell so nobody is allowed to do good things.  Awesome.  That means free will only exists until death, then it's taken away.\n\n&gt; Yes, eternal punishment which they deserve, considering they are given quite a fair warning to avoid ending up in that situation.\n\nThey are given warning, I would argue you use of \"fair warning,\" but they have no demonstrable way to distinguish between the hundreds of other warnings from hundreds of other religions.  What method is used to determine which one should be believed?\n\n&gt; Here.\n\nIt basically says that all sins are mortal sins because everyone has God's morality written on their hearts, and this means that nobody has an excuse when they commit a sin.  Nobody can say they didn't know, and when someone says this that means all sins are mortal sins.  Is there a distinction between mortal sins and sin that aren't mortal sins, according to you?\n\n&gt; I would hope you aren't going to hell.\n\nYou said that those who hate God go to hell, I don't hate God, that must mean I'm not going to hell, yeah?  I don't steal, cheat, rape, murder, lie (honesty is easier and quicker, lying is too much work), or anything.  Why will I be sent to hell?\n\n&gt; Likewise God can exercise mercy or justice at his own discretion.\n\nThis means that he's not perfectly just or perfectly merciful, because both of those necessarily entail fairness.  If God exercises those qualities whenever he feels like it that takes away the important element of fairness involved.  God can choose to punish one person and reward another even though their actions are the same, all based on his discretion.\n\n&gt; No its because Jesus satisfied the debt of mankind on the cross so that justice was served that God was then able to apply mercy and extend that act to all peoples.\n\nIt doesn't extend to all people though, it only applies to those who worship and have faith in Jesus.  Must I supply verses for you to show you?\n\n&gt; God being perfectly loving and having perfect knowledge knows whether justice or mercy are most appropriate.\n\nSo if one person is an atheist who donates to charity and volunteers, while another is a Christian who only preaches the bible and does nothing else, what is the proper punishments or reward for them?  How do you know?\n\n&gt;  God is not diminished by any crime committed against him. However, it is an offense that requires some penalty to be paid because we are in permanent debt to God for our very existence.\n\nHow can a perfect being be offended, exactly?  The way I see it, a perfect being is unable to be offended, and thus would not demand a punishment be served.  Punishment necessarily entails a transgression, and if there is no transgression I see no reason for punishment.\n\n&gt; This ordering of the universe is done for our benefit not God's and to ignore it would make our existence less, not God's.\n\nThat's an egotistical look at the universe.  Where do you see anything that implies that things were meant for us?  I can put water in a cup and I'm sure the water, if it could think, would assume the cup was meant for it, but that doesn't make it so.  What evidence supports that anything was meant for us?\n\n&gt; God is responsible for creating the system of punishment and reward. We are responsible for whether we deserve punishment or reward.\n\nGod created the punishment and reward, God created the criteria by which souls are judged to those places, and God (being all-knowing) knows who will end up in either place, correct?  If God knows all that means he knows who will end up in which place, which makes him ultimately responsible for anyone who is punished or rewarded based on his rules.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411256508", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I live in a city next to Springfield (blah blah Mavs bandwagoner). Been to a Cold Stone Creamery next to the hall and an overrated burger restaurant.\n\nFunny story. Last year on New Years me and about 9 of my friends went to a college in our city to play at the indoor courts (snow outside) but it was closed. We called another college, also closed. We had a brainstorm session and some one said that they have indoor courts at the HOF. No idea if this is true or how it works but I was doubtful. Instead we broke into a church that used to host rec league games.\n\nWhile we were playing, 5 priests or ministers or whatever (I don't go to chruch!) came in dressed in their holy clothes. This quintet of geezers looked up to see us trespassing on their property. We thought these fogies were going to call the cops. Instead the leading holy man (keep in mind they're all like 60 - 70, they looked like my 6th grade science teacher) said to us, \"OK, you guys can stay, but you have to beat us 5 on 5.\" We all bust out laughing and accept. Cool guys.\n\nSo there is 10 of us, we pick our best 5 (I'm the tallest so I'm automatically in). These guys are the greatest shooters to ever play the game. They're slow as hell, so you think we could just stick to them off-ball, but they were setting the meanest picks and running elevator door plays and all kinds of fancy shit. Some one always ended up hitting the open J.\n\nBut we were young and fast and wanted to stay. So we kept up. The game was to 15 (win by 2). We were able to compete because we got pretty much every board. These guys must've shot around everyday in their priest clothes. Eventually the score was 13 - 13. It was their ball and some old randy hit a dirk fadeaway. It was wet as hell. 14 - 13, them. This is full court, so it's our ball. I get the ball in the high post. I do this move with my back to the basket where I fake a pass to some one cutting to the hoop, wait for my man to try to defend the pass, then go up for the J. I should've just used my size and speed, but eh. It missed, and the head priest FLIES THROUGH THE AIR to get the board. He was temporarily possessed my michael jordan or some shit. We collectively shook our heads laughing as we jogged down to their end of the court. But no. Little did we know he was about to go from MJ to J-Wall. Usain Bolt style, he sprints down the court and DUNKS IT IN!\n\nHe says, \"Game...vestments\" all Dave Chapelle-as-Prince style. Our minds were blown and mouths agape. \"Run it back?\" He says. We laugh, \"what do you wanna play to??\" and he says \"How about..tree fiddy?\". Needless to say, I then realized he was about 500 feet tall and form the paleolithic era. Classic Nessie.\n\nIn all honesty, we played for a few hours and left the place as we came. I accidentally left my favorite ball there.

That would require a time machine or a whole new planet that hadn't discovered either. \n\n&gt;The list goes on.\n\nYou mentioned a single thing, hardly a list, and a conjecture at that.  Keep trying.\n\n&gt;In fact, all our ideas and morals probably end up coming from myth. \n\nConjecture, I'll need a source for that.\n\n&gt;We hate something so much and so blindly that there can't possibly and good, use, or relevance.\n\nIt has nothing to do with hate.  It has everything to do with growing up and accepting that there is no magic in this world.\n\n&gt;If you do your research you will learn that the FSP was created as a satire and never intended to describe anything real, and Peter Pan was created as a work of fiction. \n\nIf you do your research you will learn that all religions were created as a way to explain the unexplainable, and have no basis in reality.  Gosh that was easy, and almost (but not quite) as condescending as when you did it.

I'm sure you read about straw men somewhere and think this is an example, however, it is not. \n\n&gt;but all I can expect from you are fallacies I see.\n\nWow, project much?  This is coming from the guy that has used only fallacies where I haven't resorted to a single one.\n\nYou haven't even addressed the fact that you keep talking about myth and religion when we are supposedly discussing the existence, or possible existence, of a god, any old god.\n\n\nHere are a couple of gems I wanted to address in a different order.  You go from this:\n\n&gt;You can't understand what makes a person tick in psychology without knowing how they view the world.\n\nto this:\n\n&gt;This is a young and ignorant stance that (based on very limited info) I would take to imply you came from an oppressive background.\n\nYou don't know the first thing about me, and most certainly not about my background.  It doesn't take being oppressed to realize the truth when you see it.  It also doesn't require entertaining fantasy to realize reality.\n\n&gt;I fail to see how I am less rigorous for refusing to accept a dogmatic paradigm against topics that very blatantly matter. \n\nIn the same way that a laboratory that doesn't ensure that contaminants cannot enter the environment is less rigorous than one that does.  \n\n&gt;You're the one using straw men fallacies and making jumps in logic without solid evidence,\n\nI haven't made a straw man fallacy yet, and it's exactly the lack of evidence that determines my logic, without any leaps.  I don't believe in god for the same reason I don't believe in the Loch Ness monster (p.s. before you say it's a strawman, it's not, maybe you should actually look that term up).  A lack of evidence, what you are accusing me of is not having solid evidence of a lack of evidence.

{"body": "I grew up with a Quiverfull family for most of my childhood, so I have lots of first-hand experience here.\n\nQuiverfull is term to describe a conservative Christian movement that primarily involves having as many children as possible, literally to the point where one's uterus falls out. (Yes, that does actually happen.) \n\nQuiverfull revolves around the idea that truly godly families will trust the Lord Almighty with their family planning. Abortion is, of course, completely off the table. But things like the pill are seen as \"chemical abortions.\" Our parents and pastors all taught us that when a woman was on birth control,  there were thousands of tiny dead infants in her uterus. \n\nHowever, the dislike of birth control is not, by any means, the only aspect of being Quiverfull (which is mostly rejected as a label by people we'd describe as Quiverfull). It's not even the most important aspect. \n\nQuiverfull also tends to involve some mix of home education, extremely modest dress (I grew up covering my elbows, my head and wearing ankle-length skirts), the practise of \"courting\" (semi-arranged marriages worked out by a young man and a girl's father), and something called \"Christian patriarchy\", wherein the father is viewed as the head of the family. His wife must obey him in every aspect, and his daughters should not move out until he has chosen a suitable husband for them.\n\nQuiverfull children are typically educated either at home or at a school run by their church (typically Independent Fundamentalist Baptist, although many denominations may have Quiverfull members). The books most commonly used are Accelerated Christian Education, Abeka Book and BJUPress. (I've used them all). \n\nAll of these textbooks teach extreme Young-Earth Creationism (including the idea that dinosaurs breathed fire). Many also teach that slavery, apartheid and the Trail of Tears were good things, that no transitional fossils have ever been found, that dinosaurs aren't extinct (and the Loch Ness Monster is one), that the KKK were totally the good guys, etc. \n\nChristian patriarchy (which is practised by virtually everyone in the Quiverfull movement) is the idea that God designed the father to be the spiritual head of his family. He is primarily responsible for the wife’s and children’s physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. With this responsibility comes divinely granted authority, and his wife and children are expected to obey him without question. \n\nHis authority over his daughters extends to his choosing her husband. This is done through courting or betrothal. Each family does the courtship/betrothal thing differently. Typically, if a young man is interested in a girl, usually someone from his church, he will consult with his father who then approaches the father of the girl in question to discuss the possibility of a potential match. If the girl’s father is in agreement, he will then talk to his daughter. Provided she does not object, we then enter stage Courting, or a betrothal is arranged. While they are courting the couple are never to be alone, and they exchange their first kiss at the alter. A courtship is typically brief, lasting two to five months. A betrothal is sometimes longer, as it tends to be arranged earlier, but not always. Breaking a betrothal is sometimes viewed as the equivalent of divorce. At the time of marriage, the father's \"ownership\" or authority over of the girl is transferred to her husband. \n\nA wife is created to be the \"helpmeet\" of her husband. Typically she would not work outside the home if at all possible. She would obey him in every matter without question, and should never express unhappiness with him. Her primary duty is to be a homemaker and serve her husband in every way. \n\nA girl or woman whose clothing is considered \"immodest\" is guilty of what is usually referred to as \"defrauding\" her Christian brother, by tempting him with impure thoughts in relation to a body which is not rightfully his to possess. Quiverfull females usually wear only skirts or dresses which cover their knees. Some cover their elbows and up to their necks as well. \"Headcoverings\" are very common. I wore one, in the form of a bandana-like headband. \n\nChildren are viewed as being born little bundles of sin, and this is seen as something that must be beaten out of them by their parents so as to save their souls. Most of the QF people I know used Michael Pearl's To Train Up a Child. Yes, the one that teaches you to hit kids with lengths of piping until they are \"totally broken.\" (his wife, Debi Pearl, wrote a book called Created to Be His Helpmeet, which is also extremely popular in QF circles)\n\nQuiverfull families also tend to hate the government, view the End Times as just around the corner, not have TVs, not allow their children to use the internet unmonitored, not allow their children to ever have a facial expression that is not a smile, be skeptical of modern medicine, etc. It is also common for older girls (ten or up) in large Quiverfull families to be primarily responsible for raising and educating at least one sibling.\n\nOf course, there are some Quiverfull families who don't homeschool, or who allowed their daughters to wear pants, or use mainstream medicine, etc. It's not a denomination, there's no statement of faith. \n\nNo Longer Quivering and Homeschoolers Anonymous have more information.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411352042", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 38, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hollywood values and all. Methane hydrates do indeed lie on the sea beds, in kilometre thick beds. I have proposed using methane hydrates as a way to move enormous sackfuls of methane, keeping giant plastic containment bags below the thermocline. \n\nOne modelling worry is how you re-heat a glaciated Earth.  You get into ice ages through Milankovic cycles (how the Earth orbits the sun, its ellipticity and so on) but getting out is not straightforward. A snow-covered  shiny, you see, so reflects sunlight. The role of hydrates in this is interesting. \n\nWhat keeps a hydrate stable is less its temperature - once it's below 4.2C, the universal temperature at the bottom of the oceans, dictated by water's minimum density at that temperature. What dictates its stability is *pressure*. In a snowball world, a great deal of ice ends up on the land. Finland was under a couple of kilometres of ice a hundred thousand years ago, Scotland a kilometre or so. (So much for the Loch Ness monster as a survived dinosaur. ) That means that the amount of water in the seas is lowered by a corresponding amount. (The seas also contract because the surface layers are colder, but that is irrelevant to what follows.) \n\nThe effect on pressure of the water now resident on land is to lower the depth at which hydrates are stable. That may be a few metres or so, but that is a mighty amount of methane. Over the next 10,000 years, it diffuses out and starts the warming trend. Gas measurements from ancient ice cores seems to support this. Bing, result. \n\nAs a BTW, CFCs (chlorfluorocarbons, refrigerants and solvents) are vastly potent greenhouse gases.[ The Economist magazine has just published a startling review](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21618680-our-guide-actions-have-done-most-slow-global-warming-deepest-cuts) of the actual effect of our various policies on climate change abatement. [Summary here](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21618781-quickest-way-cut-greenhouse-gases-expand-montreal-protocol-paris-montreal). By far, far away the biggest impact has been the Montreal protocol, aimed to cut CFC emissions. Which somewhat prompts me to wonder if the introduction fo the CFCs in the 1950s (when temperature records began to climb) and their phasing out (the current slowdown) may not be related.

{"body": "Let me tell you a story about a goldfish that my friend had, who was lovingly named Spencer by his family. Now Spencer was just your average run of the mill gold fish that their youngest kid won in some stupid carnival game or something. So they take this thing to their house right, and got it a bowl on the way, some fish food, a little plastic castle that even the fish thought was fake, and some pebbles because goldfish don't give two shits if it's pebbles or sand, have the attention span of a 4 year-old on a sugar high without his ADD meds. Anyways, they take it home and set up the bowl on the counter in their kitchen, even put it next to the window to confuse it's pea sized brain even more, because even this dumb fish knew that something wasn't right about the scenery around it. \n\nNow the kid who won it, let's call him Joey, was a pretty forgetful child. He once forgot his socks when he went to the supermarket with his mom and she lost track of him for a few seconds, yes, his **socks**. And the best part? When they find his socks (which are in the shampoo aisle, why was he even there?), he loses them again not 15 minutes later, this dumbass loses them again, and this time they find them in the flower section of the supermarket (that was more understandable because the mother had to go buy some hydrangeas for her brother's anniversary). But how does a kid lose his socks? I mean, it's a whole ordeal, you have to take off your shoes, take off your socks, put your shoes back on, and forget that you even took them off in the first place. And I don't know about you, but the inside of a shoe feels much more different without a sock on than it does with one on. To be fair though, he was 6, but I don't remember being that stupid when I was 6, and I don't think my mother would have let me if I was.\n\nSo judging by how forgetful Joey is, you can assume that the fish died before they even got home due to neglect, right? Wrong. This fish lasted a whopping 8 years of wretched existence and grew almost a foot long. It outgrew it's bowl at 6 inches, and they had to get a new, bigger aquarium, which took way longer to maintain. Joey loved his fucking fish though. He would clean the aquarium every week. It took him hours to clean, but he would do it anyways because he loved Spencer so much. They even won a few more goldfish over the years at the Topsfield Fair (I don't want to give too much away but we lived in Massachusetts and there was a huge annual fair called the Topsfield Fair that may people went to, this family went every year). So they would put the new fish in the bowl, right, but it would die within a few days because Spencer, the fucking monster that he was, ate all the food that they fed to the fish, killing them. Goldfish aren't known to eat other fish in the tank, but this behemoth sure as hell killed them anyways by starvation. About every other year a new goldfish would be sentenced to a week of torture and death by starvation and would be pinned in the fucking infinigon (a circle has infinite sides, the fish bowl was a circle) with this Grim Reaper of a fish. \n\nI was friends with Joey's older brother, and when I was about 16, and Joey was 14, the goldfish was on his last legs. They got a new tank for it almost 4 years ago at that point, and was looking pretty decrepit by the time the fish was a senior citizen playing bingo at the local plastic coral reef. So I go over his house to play some Mario Kart or Super Smash or whatever other Nintendo game was out in the early 2000s, and the fish, despite being almost 8, is still swimming around acting like a retard like it was the first day they got it. Granted it was almost time for it to bite the dust (or pebbles), it looked as jovial as it could be. I am sitting with my friend in the living room playing on the GameCube and I start to hear some rattling in the kitchen, and then a splash of water. I think to myself, huh, I guess someone spilt something, and keep playing because I was demolishing my friend in Melee. But then I hear more splashes, and more splashes, getting increasingly vigorous the longer time went on. And the frequency increased too, it's as if the splashes calculated the slope of an exponential line and splashed at intervals according to the slope. I knew it wasn't water at this point, so me and my friend run downstairs to investigate.\n\nSure enough, the fish had used it's own .5kg mass to butt itself against the side of the tank closest to the edge of the sink, and fall down in a mighty tidal wave of water, and was flopping around like a drunk soccer mom in a muddy field. We go over to help the fish because Joey would be livid to find out that the fish they so adoringly raised was dead, and this thing sure as hell wasn't fitting down the toilet. But as my friend picked up the fish to bring it to a bowl that I had previously filled with water, he realizes that this is no fish at all, but it was actually a 500 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era, and as my friend's once strong arms collapsed under the weight of the monolith's gargantuan stature, he looks over to me and says, \"I need about tree fiddy\". Just at that moment Joey bursts in the front door with a Rambo style costume and proclaims to the monster, \"Damn you lockness monster I aint giving you no tree fiddy,\" after which he began to shoot twin M16s, each bullet making it's hole in the scales of the once vibrant fish, killing it. My friend and I stand there in awe processing the events that just transpired, poured ourselves some Coke, and got back to playing GameCube.

{"body": "&gt;You say you think this or you think that. That isn't enough to justify your arguments, you can think anything.\n\nLol and what if some string theorist at Princeton or something proposes a theory that he has no evidence, or any currently feasible experiment to test it, or even currently any experiment at all to test it (he is anticipting some other discovery on say quantum gravity or something). Would you go and tell him that he should stfu cause he has no evidence? You realize he is making a hypothesis? You realize I am also making a hypothesis right now?? I am not \"justifying\" my arguments per se?\n\n&gt;The big bang theory does not state what happened before the big bang, or does it state the big bang appeared from nowhere. Also scientists do not claim that the big bang magically popped into existence. The general opinion is that we do not know what happened before the big bang, however there are many hypothesis on what could happen. To support them, evidence is required.\n\nI am not saying it does, wtf, why are you under the impression I am somehow convinced that there is evidence for what I am saying and not providing it, or that I can't see how science (as in experimentaly testable tested and verified knowledge) \"makes no claims\" about this stuff. \n\n&gt;The reasoning of how we appeared here is sound. We live in a world that supports life as if there wasn't such a world we wouldn't be here to tell the tale. It may seem extremely unlikely that there could be such a world, but with billions of years and trillions upon trillions of planets, it becomes likely.\n\nThat sounds incomplete to me. I didn't even talk about unlikelihood. I am using a conjecture that if something exists it will do so for a reason/need (in a metaphysical sense)\n\n&gt;What basis are you claiming isn't logical? I don't see what isn't logical here?\n\nI am talking about the fact that unless you stop at somewhere and claim that \"this is the way it is and I can't make any reasonable claims about anything else\", any attempt beyond some point will lead to things that can't be logically described. Like I said above I am making hypotheses right, here are 2 predictions I pulled out of my ass yet they could give support to what I am saying (if they happen within the next 100 years like I expect)\n\n1) Science accumulates enough observations of physical events, and upon their examination it determines a paradoxical result like \"any physical law/theory attempting to justify all the phenomena we have encountered globally would have to be non falsifiable\". Something like an infinite parameters being crucial, or something like goedel's theorem except applied to the laws of nature\n\n2) Observation of a physical process that seems to be (or somehow proven to be? Idk what advances in formal logic will happen by then) non algorithmical and any attempt for it to be modelled as a random process also poses logical problems in defining probability spaces etc.\n\nIf any of the above 2 happen it won't be evidence for what I am saying but it will suggest something similar, don't you agree? Will you stop asking for *evidence* now? It's not like I am talking about the Loch Ness monster so that it is currently feasible for that evidence to exist. And keep in mind that like I said there are scientists/physicists that have similar notions.

My Christian friend Chad invited me to church, which I'd never been to growing up atheist in New York. I reluctantly agreed, but I must admit I was somewhat unnerved. \n\nOn the way, Chad gave me the rundown on grace, faith, works, and all that stuff. It sounded really nice. I guess you could say God was opening my heart. When we arrived at the church, it took us an hour to find parking. It looked like a mall, really. Inside, we passed through metal detectors and my friend Chad had to remove like 4 cross necklaces and 3 dog tags stamped with with bible verses. We passed through the gift shop and into the stadium, and my jaw dropped. I'd never seen so many people. There must be something to this, I thought.\n\nWell, the sermon that followed  was a fireball. I felt something inside me I'd never felt before. The man on the stage spoke with such fervor and conviction that I knew what he said was the truth. Raising his voice to a glorious crescendo, he spoke these words that cut straight to my heart:\n\n\"What can Jesus Christ do for you, my friends? Ask and you will receive. Then you will know what you can do for Jesus.\"\n\nI felt the call. I cried out in my heart, \"Jesus, what can I do for you?!?!?\" I looked to the thumbs-up, surfer dude white Jesus picture on the wall. And the picture spoke back to me in a mellifluous voice unlike anything I'd ever heard. It said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAt that moment I realized that the preacher was a crustacean from the Prosperity Gospel.

{"body": "TL:DR I've had a very weird experience with greyhounds in coats.     \n    \nOh man, this reminds of this time my step dad got a dog whistle for Christmas. As soon as he opened it, he spent an hour on our porch blowing it as hard as he could while he laughed and listened to the dogs in the neighborhood go nuts. It was one of few times I actually saw him rolling on the ground in laughter.  \n  \nAnyway like 5 hours later, we hear a whining and clawing at our back door. My step dad turns on the porch light to see what we can only assume is a half frozen greyhound in a puffy coat. After a quick argument between my stepdad and mother they decided to let the dog in to try to figure out where it came from. They opened the slider door and the shivering dog came flying in. He bolted around our house for a good 5 minutes knocking over everything in site while my step dad chased him at full speed trying to get the dog to calm down. Eventually the struggle ended in our upstairs bath room.   \n  \nMy step dad, out of breath and as shaken up as the dog, somehow managing to get this squirming little skeleton to calm down long enough to find its collar under its puffy coat. There was the initials L.N.M. on the tag and a phone number on the backside. We decided that since it was Christmas day and that it was getting late that the number should be called right away as not to ruin one of our neighbors Christmas.   \n  \nSo my step dad called and called and called and called. No answer. We ended up calling for the better part of 6 months. No answer. 8 months later, someone FINALLY picks up the phone. My step dad listens as a man with a raspy voice says,  \n\"I think you have something that belongs to me.\"  \n-\"Yeah, No duh, we have been calling for months and leaving messages. Why all of a sudd-\"  \n\"Put him on the phone.\" The raspy voice said.  \n-\"Th.....the do-\"  \n\"THE PHONE GOD DAMN IT, GIVE IT TO HIM\"  \nMy step dad, not knowing what else to do put the phone receiver to the dogs ear. An audible tin can sound of the man talking on the other end could faintly be heard.  \nThe dog let out this low and sad sounding... almost yawn I want to say, into the phone. \nHe turns to my step dad, and no lie, looks him dead in the eyes and says,  \n \"I'm gonna need something from you...\" \nAll of us, in a complete shock start to scream. My mom nearly faints at the sight, grabbing me and my little sister up in her arms. My step dad in utter disbelief responds with,  \n \"W-w-w-whatever it is, i'll give you, just please tell me how you can talk!\"   \nThe dog thinks for a second, looks at my step dad and says   \n\"I'll tell you, but you have to meet my demand.\" \n\"ANYTHING!\" my step dad says.   \n\"All I really need is about tree fiddy.\"  \n   \nIt was at this time that my step dad realized that no, in fact, this was not a talking dog, but a 50 foot tall fish lizard that typically inhabits large bodies of water.   \n  \n\" YOU GET OUT OF HERE YOU GOD DAMN LOCK NESS MONSTER!\" my step dad protested. Chasing the giant prehistoric reptile out of our house with a broom. \n  \nIt was honestly one of the weirdest Christmas' of my childhood.

{"body": "This is a great time to share a story.\n\nWhen I was in 2nd or 3rd grade, my parents took me to a local amusement park. At the time, the two things I absolutely obsessed over were Pokemon and baseball. Sure enough, we found one of those \"throw the baseball into the mitt\" games, and after begging my parents, they let me give it a shot.\n\nMy 8 year old self couldn't even come close to hitting the mitt. After the third shot went way off the mark, I started to tear up. My dad, a pitcher in college, then stepped up, smiled at me, and proceeded to hurl a nasty fastball straight into the glove. Knowing my favorite Pokemon, he picked out a large Dragonite plushie for me.\n\nI immediately fell in love with the plushie, who I named Huey. During my playtime, I would pretend that I was a Pokemon trainer. We would fight against trainers and Gym leaders alike as I went on my \"quest\" to be a Pokemon master.\n\nA few months later, on October 9th, 2002, my father was killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver. My life took a turn for the worse. I cried myself to sleep every night, my mother turned to alcohol and eventually started dating a man who abused her. Every night when they fought, I would curl up into Huey's arms. He would make me feel safe, a companion that would protect me from harm. \n\nOne night, I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. As I returned to my room, I noticed Huey, previously on the floor near my toys, was now sitting upright on my bed. Figuring that I probably moved him without thinking, I walked toward my bed to get to sleep.\n\nThen he looked at me.\n\nMy heart started beating a mile a minute. I thought I was in a really strange dream. As I slowly walked closer to Huey, my best friend, my Pokemon, his mouth began to move, and he started to say something.\n\n\"I...I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that's when I noticed that Huey was 10 stories tall, and a monster from the Paleolithic era. I grabbed my baseball bat and defended myself as the beast lashed out, and right before he struck, Huey was gone.\n\nI've moved on and am living comfortably on my own now, but I'll never miss my father, and most importantly, my Huey.\n\nTL;DR: Miltank.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411521114", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

I had also acquired, by some dumb luck, a girlfriend.  \n\nFast forward about a year, we've steamed up the van, my house, her house, our friends bathroom, the usual.  \n\nAround September '05, the heads on the minivan have cracked because I'm half-retard and didn't know cars need oil.  I'm now driving a 1995 Red F150, and we've lost one of our favorite fuck spots, that luxurious back seat.\n\nSo, I show up to my girlfriend's house to hang out there, which, up until that point would be hanging out with her family playing ps2. Her whole family had bonded over Tekken and Tony Hawk, sweetest thing I've ever been witness to.\n\nAfter a bit of PS2 with her family, I go outside for a cigarette, which 90% of the time, were solitary.  This time, my GF followed me outside and before I could light my smoke, I heard her say into the house:  \"We're going to Blahblah's, be back in a bit.\"  She closes the door, I say, \"we are?\" \"She says \"nah, I just wanted to get out\"  I ask if she wants to go smoke some weed, she says \"sure\", so we make our way to the local school playground by her house.  \n\nThe playground was standard fare for the time, not the intricate wooden structures I grew up getting hurt on, this was plastic, steel, and cold.\n\nWe smoke some, then start fooling around.\n\nWe're mid doggy, on the cold steel stairs, both our pants around our ankles. My dick poking through my boxers, another young stoner couple approaches on our left. She sees them first and without saying a word to me(at least she was courteous to wait for an outstroke), abruptly grabs a belt loop, and pulls her pants up.  I then realized why, and saw the couple from my peripheral. However, I was not as lucky.  \n\nWhen she pulled up her pants and I noticed the couple, two things happened.  She scurried behind an obstacle, and I tried to put my boner into my boxer waistband.  I grabbed my dick, opened my boxers to close it in place, but I was too slow.  \n\nMy cock poking through my boxers, the couple walked up to us, red-eyed and said: \"Imma need about treefiddy.\" It was then that I realized that this wasn't a stoner couple at all, It was that damn loch-ness monster!

{"body": "This is weird, but I've always had my deceased cat follow me around in my dreams ever since she was run over when I was 10. I know it's Lilith, because she's had a very distinct fur coat: pure snow white, except a pitch black tail. She's never been a prominent feature of my dreams, she just likes to wander around in the background, and I notice here every once in a while. But she always shows up in darker dreams. I don't like to think that I have nightmares, because I actually enjoy scary dreams like someone else might enjoy watching horror movies. So when I had dreams with darker elements, her silhouette became much more noticeable and she would even interact with the characters and objects in my dream, like a ghost who might have a stronger connection from the metaphysical plane. \n\nThe scariest dream I has came the night after she died. Lilith was run over by a drunk neighbor of ours (dealing with that man is another story), so it makes sense that the most traumatizing dream I've had in my entire life involved me getting run over. The dream was just one of those weird dream where you are sort of existing in a setting and nothing is happening around you. This particular setting was street from my small hometown. I was crossing the normally, somewhat busy street, but there was nobody and no cars. I checked both ways before crossing, and the entire place was deserted. I started walking when a black cat crossed my path, Lilith. As soon as I saw her, I looked to my left and an eighteen wheeler materialized out of nowhere right beside my traveling at bone crushing speed roaring as wind moved and its horn blew. It hit me, and I woke up screaming.\n\nI eventually got over the experience and I haven't thought much of it since, even with Lilith reoccurring in my dreams, until about 2 months ago. An average day about 10 years after Lilith died, I was walking to one of my classes on campus, when I noticed a cat who looked exactly like Lilith. Cats with white bodies and black tails aren't as uncommon as you'd think, so I've seen plenty of them in my life, but something about this particular cat looked eerily similar to Lilith. I brushed it aside, because I was running late, but the cat walked up to me and rubbed herself against my jeans and started purring. I felt like she knew me. I bent sown to pet her, and as soon as her black tail brushed my hand, I felt light headed and I heard a loud sound like fog horn in the back of my find. That's when she looked up and me with he big red eyes, made eye contact and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411530187", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think I know of someone who has gone through this exact situation. Apparently, this guy (friends coworker, pretty much elderly) lost his wife to kidney failure about three years ago. He had gone through his entire marriage not knowing that she had an identical twin. My friend never really found out why this was so, but i can only assume that they might have had some sort of grudge against each other since she wasn't around for her sister's illness.\n\nSo, about a month after her death, a week before her funeral the guy gets an email from a woman claiming to be his wife's sister. He refuses to believe her until she sent proof, which ended up taking most of the day. They start chatting for a bit and suddenly the big surprise gets thrown out there. He asks to meet her before the funeral, to share pictures and stories about his wife's childhood. \n\nAccording to my friend, guy didn't really feel anything at all until he actually physically saw her the next day at the bus station. Apparently they had aged pretty much the same and even had an identical fashion sense. (both of them wore the same saphire earrings) \n\nHe was floored for a few minutes, but got over it pretty quickly. No attraction at all, though I guess that might be because of his age lol. He was, however, pretty curious about her relationship with his wife. So after they go back to his house, he got to asking some questions, namely why he had never seen her before. She starts looking all uncomfortable and shifty and just ignores the question. I assume at this point the guy was weirded out by the entire situation, but he ask's her if she needs anything and she just barely whispers;bout tree fiddy. It was then that he noticed the scaly texture of the woman's skin, which he had previously ascribed to her smoking habit. He refused to tell my friend anything else about the encounter, though he did shout goddammit at multiple points of the story which i assume is a bad sign", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411533335", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The fact that you belive this problem because rational reasoning supports it is just the point I'm trying to prove. But you say rational reasoning does not support alien life, and I disagree with you, I think it does. Alien life is often a confusing term; it is nothing more than lifeforms we do not know of (yet). Some scientists believe that they in 1996 found  fossilized bacteria from a metorite from mars that hit Antarctica 13,000 years ago. If these bacteria really came from Mars, then thats bulletproof evident that alien life existed on Mars many thousand years ago.\n\nEvery species of animals and plants and microorganisms on earth is a lifeform. Any form of plants or microorganisms on another planet qualifies as alien life, they doesn't have to be green martians that are planning on invading earth and enslaving mankind. It could be nothing more than a bacteria swimming the ocean of Saturns moon Titan. Or it could be giant civilizations of green martians. We don't know. But the fact that there are life here on earth, and possibly used to be life on Mars, indicates that it is possible. And with the observable universe containing an estimated 300 sextillion stars = 300 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 stars (and thats just the part of the universe we can observe), and each of these stars have a given number of planets orbiting around them, then yes, logic reasoning does support that there are alien life out there. Probably millions of examples of it too.\n\nI NEVER said that other entities can be proven false (by the way, by following strict scientific rules, you can't prove a positive either, just do experiments that give you a result that strengthens a hypothesis/theory). Santa Claus, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, Flying Spagetti Monster, God, ManBearPig and the Tooth Fairy may all be very real. That does not mean that I believe in them. There are no experiments, neither theoretical or practical, that indicate they may be real, which there are when we are speaking about alien life (theoretical experiments through rational reasoning and mathmatics, practical experiments with the discovery of the fossilized bacteria on the meteorite from Mars. \n\nI absolutely agree that beliefs are very powerful tools and should be used responsibly. That's why I said earlier that you have to take everything someone tells you with a pinch of salt, and not believe anything without evidence, which I don't do, and never said or indicated that I do. But it is not possible to have as a principle that you only believe the things you can experience first hand. With this reasoning, you do not believe that Saturn have rings, or that Neptune is round, or that the ocean is more that a 100 meters deep, because you have not experienced this first hand, but you have seen pictures of it, and people have told you and given you a reasonable explanation for it. (If you have a telescope and have actually seen Saturn or Neptune with your own eyes, or if you are a proffesional scubadiver, then forgive me, but I think you get the point).

{"body": "I know how that feels, my closet used to scare me a lot at night, too.\n\nEver since I was little I would hear noises coming from inside that closet. My parents told me that it was just the house settling, or that there was a problem with mice in the house, but I knew they had to be covering something up. So after mustering my courage for weeks, one afternoon I decided to make a mission deep into the darkness of my closet.\n\nI worked for a week to make a set of armor for myself out of cardboard, and dug up one of my toy swords. Finally, after mentally preparing myself, I pulled open the closet door with ferocity, shouting “DIE, EVIL CLOSET MONSTERS! DIE!” You can imagine my relief (and disappointment) when I found that there were no monsters inside the closet for me to duel with.\n\nFear quickly turned to horror, however, when I realized that this must mean that whatever was inside my closet could appear and disappear at will. They must have been ghosts! I thought I couldn’t stop them… but I knew I had to try anyway. I began plotting, thinking of the best possible plan that a five-year-old with an hyperactive imagination could come up with.\n\nThat night, I donned my armor and toy proton pack, walked around my room on a path in the shape of a cross, and drew a few pentagrams on the walls for good measure. I could almost hear dramatic background music as I walked up the seemingly-infinite few feet between me and the closet. I turned the light on, opened it, and yelled a terrifying cry of battle towards whatever dark forces lay inside the closet.\n\nThe only things that haunted the house that night were my screams. I ended up getting grounded for a week for everything I had done. In my mind, it was totally worth it. The noises were even gone for one night. But I knew that I had only angered whatever was inside that dark abyss when I heard them come back, louder than ever, the next night. I had to take desperate measures. I had to do the one thing that no five-year-old boy would never do. I had to ask my older sister for help.\n\nAt the time my older sister was going through some weird Wiccan Goth dark magic phase, which I really didn’t understand but I knew it had something to with evil magic and ghosts. As much as I was annoyed by her, if anyone could stop a ghost infestation it was most definitely her. I walked up to her all-black room, and asked if she knew of any way to get rid of the ghosts in my closet.\n\nShe smiled a mischievous smile, and replied “I’ll be able to get rid of the dark creatures inside the portal to Hell known as a “closet”, but like all good things it comes with a price.”\n\nI was starting to get a little scared. What would she need to power her black magic? One of my body parts? Toad entrails? One my body parts transmuted into toad entrails? But what she said shocked me to the core, more than anything else she could have asked for.\n\n“I’ll need about tree fiddy.”\n\nWell, it was about that time I noticed that my sister was actually an eight-story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic Era. That goddamn Loch Ness Monster had got me again! “Dammit Loch Ness Monstah, I ain’t givin’ you no tree fiddy!” I yelled as she disappeared into a pile of three and a half pentagrams.\n\nTL;DR: My sister once tried to trick me into paying for her to get ghosts out of my closet.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411608574", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ah ok, that's probably the reason. Most built in microphones will not be as good as the microphones you buy in stores/online. They pick up the sounds of your laptop fan and other noises. It's alright if you're a beginner just trying to start but it'll quickly need to be replaced as some people might not even consider following you if there's an annoying sound constantly playing. \n\nSince I haven't heard your microphone then all I can say is that if it doesn't sound like your ears are about to bleed then feel free to use it for starters(test this with a friend or some viewers). But I suggest you get a dedicated microphone for streaming.\n\n----\n\n**Microphones my friends and I have used**\n\nIf you're able to buy a microphone then the ones that my friends and I have experience with are the following:\n\n* [Blue's Snowball Microphone](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-iCE-Microphone/dp/B006DIA77E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411607712&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=blue+microphone)\n\n* [Blue's Yeti Microphone](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-USB-Microphone/dp/B002VA464S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411607712&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=blue+microphone)\n\n[Here's a video that show's off both microphones and an extra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24JQKOhBDRI)\n\n**Other Microphones**\n\nI've heard that these are also good, though I have no experience with them.\n\n* [Blue's NESSIE Microphone](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-NESSIE-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B00BUIA362/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411607712&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=blue+microphone) : [Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68oLRnwrhXc)\n\n* [Samson's Go Microphone](http://www.amazon.com/Samson-Mic-Portable-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B001R76D42/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411607883&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Samsung+microphone) : [Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InhS6xOoPwc)\n\n* [Samson's CO1U microphone](http://www.amazon.com/Samson-Limited-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B00E4WWLWA/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411607883&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=Samsung+microphone) : [Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEOz77WB7Lg)\n\n----\n\n**Some tips for your microphone**\n\nI suggest you get a [pop filter](http://www.amazon.com/Nady-MPF-6-6-Inch-Microphone-Filter/dp/B0002CZW0Y/ref=pd_bxgy_MI_img_y)^[1] for your microphone if you decide to buy one. Then, if possible, you should also get a Shock Mount^[2]  but that isn't as crucial as the pop filter. \n\n1. Pop filters are designed to stop Plosives from being heard when recording. Plosives are puffs of air that emit when saying words that start with certain letters, such as P or B. They can ruin a recording for people that over-exaggerate the begging of some words. [Pop filter Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urf46JjE5ys)\n\n2. The best way I can describe a Shock-Mount is a if the mount is a cradle for your microphone. Any bumps or small movements to a Microphone *NOT* using a Shock-Mount will cause it to be heard in recording, meaning you'll hear all these small sounds in the background. [It's easier to just show you what a shock mount does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1D_quSjfcc)\n\n----\n\nThere's a bit more to recording your microphone, like sound proofing, but that's for another day. I just wanted to give you a list of microphones and some tips that could help you out if you're a new to streaming/recording. \n\nGood Luck! As I said before, if your laptop's microphone doesn't make your ears(or a friends' ears) bleed then go ahead and use it for how ever long it takes you to save up and buy a better microphone. But I suggest you not wait too long if you have the choice.\n\nEdit: Markup\n\nEdit2: Grammar\n\nEdit3: Reworded the first section's title.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411611512", "subreddit": "Twitch", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "His antics completely remind me of some of the stories my stepdad used to tell of his High school/College years.   \n**TL;DR My step dad gets his entire football team back for torturing him in the most classic way**\n  \nOne of my favorite stories he told me growing up happened about 3 weeks into his Freshmen year of college. He had been picked up as a kicker on a full scholarship to play for the 1982 University of New Hampshire football team. Now you see, my stepdad was by no stretch of the imagination a large man. He stood at about 5'7'' in his prime. Maybe 125 soaking wet. But as a kicker, he was flawless, as long as the other team never made contact with him.   \n  \nAnyway, its about 5 weeks into pre season practices. My step dad is getting completely dogged by his teammates. They filled his helmet with shaving cream. They would tie the laces to his shoes every.single.day. One of the line backers even hung him by his pads from a locker and left him there for hours. My step dad was completely humiliated.   \n  \nAfter weeks and weeks of this the first game was upon the team. My step dad decided this would be the day he made a stand. He was going to prank his teammates for all the shit they pulled on him. He knew he would have to do something completely over the top to redeem himself, or he was simply adding fuel to the fire. So my step dad proceeds, and I shit you not, to pull off one of the greatest pranks of all time. \n\nMy step dad buys this 2 part chemical meant for temprarily measuring moisture for different commercial applications. When these two parts touch one another and come in contact with water they turn from an invisible clear to a beet red color. The night before the first game my step dad checks the weather. Forecast was a typical New Hampshire rain shower mid day. It should land perfectly some time right after half time, at least he hopes. \n\nThat morning he gets to the school early and sneaks the chemicals into his locker. It wont be until after school that he can execute his master prank. \n\nRight before most classes lets out, my step dad made his way to the locker room. The game was scheduled for 4 so he had to be quick. One by one he removed all he jerseys, carefully painting on one chemical, then the other directly over the top of it. He hung them all up and snuck out undetected.   \n  \nSo its a minute or so into the second quarter. My step dad starts to feel this light drizzle. His heart starts to race he knows that with just a little more rain hes going to be a legend. When described to future generations, they wont even believe he existed. \n\nIt starts to pour as the team lines up at the scrimmage line. Everyone slowly gets soaked right at the snap. There's a pile up at the line. The teams stand and instantly the entire crowd in unison just starts to crack up. \n\nThe entire team looks down, all but my step dad, to see giant red markings on their shirts. My step dad runs to the sidelines. He knows this is his only chance to get this right.

{"body": "When I was like ten or eleven I stole a pack of lighters from my local grocery store. I didn't really need them for anything, just thought they were interesting I guess. Well my mom found them and questioned me about them. I told the cheesiest shit of how I was holding them for a friend. I told my mom a friends name thinking she wouldn't do more than tell me not to hangout with them any more, but she called my friends parents and told them. So obviously I was caught and decided to lie again by saying that I actually found them outside the store claiming that someone must of dropped them. My parents for some reason decided to go detective and drive me to the store to show fee where I \"found\" it. Once we got there I tired to play it on some more, but realized I was at a dead end. My patents took me into the store and had one of the cashiers get the manager. So the manager comes out and asks what we needed and my mom told him everything. As she was telling him, he just glared at me the whole time, down to my core. The manager went off a lectured me about shoplifting, how I could go to Juvenal Hall, it was immoral, ect. Once he was over he demanded that I pay for it since they were already opened and partially used. I apologized and said I would pay and never bother the store again. Neither of us knew the price so we had to go to the isle the lighters were on. That made it even more awkward because I had to walk with two obviously frustrated adults around the grocery store while I looked guilty the entire time. Once we saw the price he looked at me and said that because I stole them I would have to pay more. He paused briefly then said, \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\" Welp, it was about this time that I looked at the manager and realized he was eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleazoic era. I looked up to that manager and said, \"Dammit monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" He turned around and went back to his office after he realized who he really was. I did feel about about the whole situation, but in the end I was able to keep the lighters and got in zero trouble(probably because my mom was in to much shock). My advice to the youngyins out there is to not shop lift, because you will get caught and it will be bad.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411627624", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm a little late, hope it doesn't get buried.\n\nI usually go to bed later than everyone else in my house, so I'm normally awake a couple of hours after everyone goes to sleep. Anyway, I was in my room on reddit/YouTube/clash of clans as usual, and I think it's time to go to bed. I turn off my PC and the lights and climb into bed. Just before I go to sleep I hear a rustling around the tree outside my bedroom window and I just brush it off as my cat and her tree-climbing shenanigans.\n\nYes, I was wrong. I was woken up after a branch came off and scraped my window as it fell down, accompanied by quiet scuffling along the path. I got up, shaking because I had no idea what was fucking around outside my house, and turned on the light. After doing so, I heard quick shuffling away from the window.\n\nI was young, so I don't remember it all, but what happened after is I ran to get my dad, who in turn ran to get a cricket bat. I went to my room and looked under the blind to see him walking around to see what had happened.\n\nHe came face to face with a tall man dressed in black clothes. I will never forget what he looked like - he was huge. Maybe the tallest person I had ever seen, and his face, the only part of him not covered in black fabric, was haunting. He had dry, wrinkled skin, almost scaly, and he had a certain movement style - he bobbed slightly from side to side, kinda like a slinky. This guy was weird.\n\nHe spoke in a croaky voice, told my dad to step back or he would draw his weapon. (thankfully he never did.) my dad, cricket bat in hand, took a step back and asked the man what he wanted.\n\"I... I need about tree fiddy\"\nI finally figured out how to describe this guy. He wasn't a guy at all, he was a 50 foot tall crustacean from the paleozoic era - it was the Loch Ness fucking monster! My dad said to this beast; \"Get off my lawn!

{"body": "Settle in ladies and gentlemen, this is a doozie.  I promise there is no three-fiddy or loch ness monster.\n\nSo back in 2003/2004 my girl and I were on OkCupid (because it wasn't just a dating site then) and there was this girl that had always caught my eye - but of course I never did anything because I'm not like that.  2005 my fiancee breaks up with me rather spectacularly (6 years will do that to ya) and a few weeks later I'm out at the goth club.  \nI see this girl, and our eyes meet.  We do that \"I know you from the internet but we've never met look\" and I chicken out and go into the bar area (where she can't follow, being a few years younger).  By the time I come out she's gone, and I can't find her.  Shucks!  I look on OkCupid, but she's not there anymore.  I emotionally kick myself and every few months I think about this girl.\n\n~time passes~ and I'm flipping through some Facebook photo's someone has posted a year or two later and she's in them!  But she's not tagged, and I don't hang out with this person - so it'd be weird to ask.  I think about her for another few months, before it starts to fade again.  All the while I'm dating other people.  \n\n~2009/2010 I'm shitting around on okcupid for world matches and she pops up, in Japan.  I send her two messages, which are ignored, and at that point I give up.\n\n2012 she shows up in my Pittsburgh matches but I figure she's not interested and I let it rest, finally at ease with the missed connection that haunts my mind.\n\nLate 2013 the goth scene has picked back up a bit where I'm at and my buddy and I are just out having fun, dancing, scoping out the scene, when he comments on a girl that looks 'too pretty to be here' or some other such guy-to-guy 1 a.m. in-a-club comment.  My jaw drops. Is her.  Well..10 years later I guess I get my chance. I go over, talk to her a bit, try to explain that one image of her seared in my brain without coming off like a creepy stalker, and agree to talk later.  \n\nShe's terribly interested in what about her stuck in my mind, so we meet up for drinks and we spend a good 3 hours just talking away about stuff and things and it goes great.  She's got a boyfriend **natch* but apparently that's half a second from imploding.  I ask to kiss her, she agrees, and it's pretty wonderful.  She mentions giving him a new year's deadline to shape up or she's gone.\n\nSo I get back from Christmas vacation (my job gets the whole week off) and her Facebook status is 'single' so I figure this is a go. I call her up, ask her out, and she agrees.  I pick her up, and less than 5 minutes later she informed me that her resolve of breaking up with her boyfriend had lasted all of 72 fucking hours and I quote \"He made a case for it and I really wanted it to happen because I think I still love him\". That's important for later.\n\n So I'm thinking to myself \"well, fuck me. Eh, at least I can have a good time since I'm already here anyways.\"  We go to this super divey bar from 11-2 and she proceeds to get hammered and tell me way too personal information.  I'm only drinking very very very very lightly because I'm driving.  Other than the one odd incident though it's a very good time and hey, what's 2 red flags when I've been basically single for 4 years.  She asks if I want to go to this after-hours thing and well...I work nights and I'm having a good time so sure.  This girl is touching me, and leaning on me, and dancing with me, squeezing my muscles, telling me how good I look and the only thing I can think is \"you have a boyfriend and you're drunk so no\".\n\n**This is where shit gets real**\n\nSo we get there, and it's like this secret hipster garden.  So many pomp fades, beards, horn rims, and plaid you could drown in it.  She introduces me to a friend of her's who is there, and then gets a drink.  Some dude immediately starts hitting on her and she is all about it.  I try to talk to her a few times and she blows me off for this other dude who (tl;dr) she eventually fucks in the bathroom downstairs.  I would have just left, but I had this moral obligation to give this girl the ride home that I promised her in the middle of winter at 3 a.m. Lest you think ill of me - I did actually try to stop her twice but she was insistent that this is what she wanted to do.\n\nSo I just want to drive this (insert bad word of your choice here) home and we get outside and she calls her boyfriend, and asks him if she can come over - apparently he just lives down the street.  He basically tells her 'go home you're drunk' and she hangs up, starts flailing her arms about like a child and bitches and complains about how 'he doesn't lover her' and 'he's not trying' and 'he doesn't care'.  Remember, way back at the beginning of the night she says she really loves him and wants this to work, also that whole bathroom fucking thing from 10 minutes ago.  I drop her off, and for all intents and purposes we never speak again.\n\nTL;DR:  My slutty pumpkin turned out to actually be really slutty and gave me the best bad date story I could have ever hoped for.

Eutychus was raised from the dead by Paul (Acts 20:9, 10).\n\n\nI am not certain the resurrection is false. I am certain that I have never seen any evidence of it. Even the evidence presented by the bible is scant. By the same note, I am not certain Sasquatch does not exist, nor the Loch Ness monster. I am not certain the sun will rise tomorrow, or that when I let go of my pen, it will fall down to the floor, rather than up to the ceiling. \n\nI'm pretty damn sure, though. Why? Based on my understanding of physics, chemistry, biology, and general science, based on my 40+ years of living in this universe and experiencing reality, I'm 99.99999% sure of these things.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411667139", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The article you pointed to compares the ratio of nutrients in wild fruit to selectively bred fruit.

I think \"gorged\" is more than a bit of an exaggeration, but it gets to my point here. You need to look at the concepts behind the diet. If we take the tenant that humans are essentially the same now as they were during the paleolithic era, then we can apply human desires of today to back then. \n\nA hunter-gatherer finding a beehive full of sweet honey is the equivalent of a modern human gorging on a pile of candy. Humans didn't loose the ability to instinctively know what a good diet is. The cave man didn't know he was following the paleo diet, he was eating what was available to him and he just found this awesome sweet candy. We are following the paleo diet and are doing so for specific reasons, so we should strive to understand why these \"rules\" result in a healthier lifestyle. \n\nAre honey and fruit healthier than modern processed sweets? Absolutely, but there isn't a physiological need for humans to consume fructose in large quantities.

{"body": "Sorry for my poor English. \n\nWhen I was fourteen I had just transferred schools and I was very concerned about fitting in with the my peers. One day I was sitting alone at lunch and a young girl came up to me and asked me my name. I introduced myself and we began to talk. The background in her phone was a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. I asked her what they meant and she said it was just something she liked. I didn't thing much of it and over the next couple of weeks we continued talking and soon became fast friends. \n\nAbout three months later I was at her house and she wanted to watch and America TV show. I wasn't familiar with the show but I liked her and wanted to be with her so I agreed. We went to her room and started the show  it was called American horror tales or something like that. \n\nAs we started watching I got just a really bad feeling. I don't know if you've ever been in a situation where you just know you should t be there but this was just wrong somehow. I started to uncomfortably look around her room and I saw the pair of handcuffs from her phone. One side was attached to the bed. By now I was very uncomfortable and I needed a minute to think. I asked if I could have a soda. She said sure and went to go get it for me. While she was gone I started snooping around her room. \n\nI opened her closet door and there was a large black rubber suit hanging there. It was full body even the head was complete and there were chains attached to all of the limbs. I looked at the floor and there was red brown blotches in the carpet. I had seen enough. \n\nI heard her door open again she was standing there in nothing but her camisole and underwear. I didn't care. I ran the fuck out of that house and all the way home as she called for me. \n\nI never talked to her again and we moved soon after. A year later (recently) I was in Facebook and I saw that a kid from that high school had died. I looked into and apparently his body was found in an abandoned house in the girls street. He was in that suit. Well what was left of him. He had been strung up across a room and the chains on he suit had been stretched until his arms and legs popped off and he bled out. Inside the suit his body had been carved up with the words \"g gong in the first season\"   I'm told that the kid had started hanging out with the girl shortly after I moved and he had gone to ger house the day befor he went missing. \n\nI needed to know what had happened so I went back to the town last week to see what I could rustle up in the way of information. I went to the girls house to see if she was idk acting weird or something? I'm really not sure what I was looking for. She opened the door and looked glad to see me. I came in and we started talking. I brought up the kid and she looked at me like I was crazy. \n\n\"Do you seriously not know?\" \n\n\"Know what?\" I asked. She took my hand and led me to the bathroom. I was really scared now but what could I do? We walked In and before she turned me toward the mirror she said \"now there's just one thing. \" what's that?\" I replied. \"I'm going to need about tree fiddy\". With horror, I realized that I was eight stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. \"Damn you!\" I cried. \"Damn you Loch Ness monster!\" In horror and shame I swelled and writhed and slithered out of the house and down the street and away into the ocean never to return. \n\nI'm just so glad that I didn't have sex with that girl when I had the chance. I could have hurt her so badly and I definitely would have wrecked her gimp suit. \n\nTL;DR almost killed a girl with my enormous penis\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411710218", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

One night I get the Skype call, and when I answer it I'm surprised to see that the background has changed and that he's clearly no longer in the living room. He tells me that he's decided to sell the Xbox as he's pretty sure my sister is going to be divorcing him, and hell lose half of everything he has. Turns out he's now at a complete strangers house trying to sell the Xbox, and called me to demonstrate its capabilities to this particular individual. He stops by the next day, and I asked him how much he got for it. Accounting for the fact I'm losing half, I got $1.75, he said. Wow, I realized, that means that he only got about tree fiddy.

{"body": "1. Literally none of the characters I bring to favourite character threads are capable of pulling this one off. Unless its hide isn't durable enough to withstand the pressure of something spiky hitting it at supersonic speeds.\n\n2. either Cirno or the Demoman could take out the immortal head. (The Demoman can only do it if he has a spellbook in his loadout, though. Or possibly the Eyelander/Headtaker/Nessie's Nine Iron, since those three are possessed by spirits) Cirno might be able to freeze the stumps to stop them regrowing, and the Demoman might just burn them sealed with explosions. If Elzam is in Aussenseiter, he might be able to instagib it and the mortal heads because Aussenseiter is a 155 metre tall giant robot.\n\n3. At an estimate of 190 mph? Sonic is literally faster than it! Nepeta is probably the second best option for this as she was raised to hunt. Aussenseiter might give Elzam the maneuverability needed, and I imagine its energy weapons are a fair bit faster than arrows. If cheap options are allowed, then the Doctor can materialise the TARDIS around it.\n\n4. Cirno could try to freeze it, Elzam could try to pick it up with Aussenseiter, and it might be light enough for Blue Tornado from Sonic to work.\n\n5. If the Doctor is allowed to cross his own timeline for this then he has all the time he needs. The Demoman might try to detonate the mess with grenades or stickies.\n\n6. The reason they had to be disturbed from a distance was because they could fire their razor-sharp feathers IIRC. That's.. not going to do much to a Super-type like Aussenseiter. Also, Sonic might be fast enough to outright redirect the feathers with his speed.\n\n7. Similar deal to the boar, really.\n\n8. The Doctor can speak almost any language in the Universe. He might be able to outright TALK to them to get them to do what he wants them to. No one else really has any options here.\n\n9. Knowing the Doctor, he might not just take her girdle, he might outright take Hippolyta herself! There IS a precedent for taking royalty with him, after all...\n\n10. Cirno would not have the attention span to herd them. Nepeta would be too tempted to hunt them. The Demoman might also be tempted to take their heads. Basically, only Sonic, the Doctor, and Elzam might be in with a chance at this one.\n\n11. Again, I'm pulling in knowledge of the actual labours here. There is a reason Heracles had to persuade Atlas to get them. The actual apples were guarded by some sort of beast, and Atlas was able to get the apples without having to fight it. Heracles just carried the sky while he went to get them. As there doesn't seem to be any actual beast here, carrying something that heavy can logically be optional, as there is no need for an Atlas equivalent. With that said, Aussenseiter might be the only thing with the lifting strength to pull off the carrying something heavy feat. As for actually collecting the ~~apples~~ oranges... Sonic and The Doctor can use their speed and the TARDIS respectively to do it.\n\n12. The Doctor has literally come face to face with the Devil, which is a more powerful being of some form of underworld than Cerberus. Cirno, similarly, fought a hell raven with the power of **nuclear fusion**. Again, something more powerful than Cerberus. With that said, Sonic is probably the only one who might be able to pull it off, as The Doctor might not be able to even get into the underworld, and Cirno could easily get lost there or be unable to take Cerberus with her.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411752089", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "About five years ago I retired from truck driving. I drove for ten years and only picked one person up. It was a cold rainy day on the M1, some old man was hitchiking. He looked old and weak so I pulled over and asked him whats wrong. He wouldn't say anything to me, so I got out my truck and went up to him and asked what was wrong. He then looked at me and said \"no english\". So I got out my IPhone first gen and searched for a translation site, he said \"French\". So I turned it on and kinda shown him how to type. Then two men jumped out of the bush behind him and jumped me, they all stole my phone and drove away in the truck full of cigarettes. I was badly wounded and noone noticed me for about half an hour, then finally a man pulled over and picked me up and put me in his car. He droove me to the hospital (NHS FTW) and I got treatment for the next few days. My boss was pissed, so was I. I wanted to track that bitch down, luckily I had a mini gps inplanted into my phone (it was a new type of phone what I didn't want to loose). So I tracked them down to an abandoned warehouse. I didn't even call the cops to help me. I barged in by myself. They all beat me and took me to there boss. I managed to say \"Wh..\" before they slapped me and said don't talk unless spoken to. I was shitting bricks. \"So you come like a idiot?\" he said in a strong eastern european accent. \"I tell you what, you go if you can get me it.\". I replied \"What do you mean?\". He said \"I need about tree fiddy...\". Thats when I realized he was a Giant crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "Back when I was in college, I had a part-time summer job with a \"renewable lumber\" company. Me and a group of other interns/students would go to a fallow field and plant saplings in rows, all day long. Now this was more arduous than it sounds, if you're unfamiliar with manual labor in the blazing Colorado heat. But things weren't so bad when you've got a group of friends to shoot the breeze with as you work and cool off afterwards with a beer. \n\nAnd then there was Amanda. \n\nA year older than me, and my God she was gorgeous. Blonde hair done up in a ponytail, she was quite a bit taller than me, but I had a thing for tall women so that just made it worse. She'd been doing the same summer job for years, and she was fantastic at it. It was fun just watching her work. She'd been asked out by every guy on the team at least once, except me (too chickenshit). Anyway, she was the \"team leader\", responsible for marking up the batches of saplings in numbered groups\" and getting us where we needed to go for the day. Numbers were chalked on the first saplings in each batch nearest the road, so you'd be told to head over to \"175\" in the morning, or whatever.\n\nThing was, there was a group of rather cultish new-age hippies living in a commune not far away. Usually they were just fine, and individually they were really friendly when you met them on the street. But a year or so before, there was a change in leadership and the new guy was a frothing-at-the-mouth eco-warrior. Didn't matter that the logging was renewable and that pains were taken to re-plant cyclically. \n\nIt started off pretty low-key. Small protests along the road to the yard, mild harrassment of workers when they were in town. Things started escalating to threats and petty vandalism. A guy on my crew named Terry had had a run-in with a particularly pushy guy early in the summer and clocked him, so there was a bit of bad blood going on there.\n\nAnyway, summer was drawing to a close and I'd finally worked up the nerve to ask Amanda out once the new week started. I knew it was a long-shot, but I had one of those teenage crushes that you look back on in your 20s and just shake your head at how hard and how easy you fell for her. But when I got in, things were...a bit chaotic, to say the least. The \"eco-warrior\" had convinced a group of his friends to start throwing rocks at people entering the yard. Stupid thing to do, I thought, since all it would take is one phone call to the police and they'd be dragged away to bother us no more. As it turned out, he was more clever than I'd given him credit for. The whole thing was a distraction - while we were all drinking coffee and waiting for the mess to sort itself out, there was another group of goons sent to rough up the interns working in the field. Which was where Amanda was working that day.\n\nFirst thing I knew about it, though, was a panicked cellphone call - she was being chased on foot down the field and had hidden in some bushes near the road. In a terrified whisper she was begging me down the line to come *get her*. Instant adrenaline rush. I ran out through the jeering rock-throwers and one scored a glance across my forehead - the scar you were asking about. Wasn't about to stop me, though. Chalked numbers on the trees flashing at me as I passed them by - Tree 5. Tree 10. Tree 15. In that much of a rush that I'd forgotten to ask her where she was hiding, so I balanced the cell between my cheek and shoulder as I asked her where she needed me to go. There was just silence at the other end and my heart lurched - maybe they'd already gotten to her? Then a whisper, hard to make out. I asked her to repeat it, and I'll never forget what she said next: \"About Tree Fifty\". It was then that I realized that I hadn't needed to ask, as it was as plain as day where she was hiding. Amanda was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era. \"God damn Loch Ness Monster, I ain't running out to no Tree Fifty\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412004501", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The adaptation has been incredibly faithful to the books, with very few substantive changes and it hasn't seemed to deter the television audience at all.

Well anyway when we were still some hours away the turbulence started. I am pretty used to it since I am a frequent flyer but it kept getting worse over time. In the beginning there was some light shaking and at some point the seat belt signs came on. So this happens about every flight so I was not concerned at all and continuing watching my movie but I was noticing that people were getting quite anxious.\n\nAfter some time I paused my movie, took off my headphones and started talking to people around me that were already totally freaking out. Apparently some glasses fell of the tables and that was a clear sign we were going to die. Well the flight attendants were trying to calm the people down but after some time the pilot announced over the PA that he is going to need everyone to strap in because it was going to get a little bit rougher still but nothing to worry about, he said some planes already went through it when it was even worse. Since he seemed to know that people were in a slightly panicked state he talked a lot more than on other flights I was on and was explaining how many times this happens, what they do to avoid this kind of stuff and the aquaplaning thing and that autopilot landing is usually a bit rougher because the plane somehow likes to register a little bump. And people were calming down a bit.\n\nLater as we are about one hour away from Santiago he announces that there is a lot of rain and the descend is going to bring quite a bit of shaking with it. In that situation, for the first time on my countless flights we come into the situation where we suddenly drop a lot and I get this weird feeling in my stomach and the oxygen masks drop. The pilot immediately is quite hysteric on the PA and tells everyone to stay in their seat and help others if they don't have their gas masks on. Even I am freaked out but everybody seems to manage. I still feel the shaking and see the rain just pouring down outside. \n\nSuddenly the pilot is just screaming over the PA:'I can't land the plane like this, it is just raining too much!'. Of course, people look quite scared and I really don't know what to think, is he announcing that we will go to another airport or what is going on?! And then the PA comes on again and he goes:'Shit I need help here, this is not going to work!' I see the flight attendant picking up the phone and going:'WHAT DO YOU NEED?' and the PA comes on again and he just goes:'about tree fiddy'.

{"body": "well, see, i disagree that abstract shouldn't be *allowed*. there are levels of abstraction. abstract art isn't just jackson pollock throwing paint at a canvas. picasso is also abstract, but on a lower level of abstraction. fantasy- and scifi paintings are also abstract in the sense that they depict something abstract. but abstract paintings can be *extremely* powerful. like picasso's guernica http://www.pablopicasso.org/images/paintings/guernica3.jpg which hangs in the UN building in NYC (well, a copy hangs in the UN building). the story behind it and its message are so powerful they had to cover it when Colin Powell went there to present the american case for a war in iraq.\n\n it's more that abstract painters come here and get downvoted and i feel bad for them because downvotes are never fun and we're supposed to be a nice place. it's easy to critique abstract art, just say what you feel when you look at the painting. but it's hard to give *constructive* critique. perhaps it would help an abstract artist if we were to offer our thoughts and he or she can see if our thoughts match their intention. but we'd never remove abstract submissions. that would only leave the hyper realistic art, the, in my mind, least interesting art ever created. just have a look at the top submissions of all time where the hyper realistic copies of photos are all over the place. i think it's a shame, but i don't remove it based on what i think art should and shouldn't be. i think it also speaks to who is upvoting photo copies and think that's artistic. (it may be technically great, but the artistic merit lies in the original, in my opinion.) those paintings are very easy to get into, so they get the upvotes. anyway, that's a whole other discussion about what art is and all that stuff. that always leads to someone going \"digital painting isn't real *painting*\" and i'll get really mad and i don't want to be mad because i've got an exam in art history coming up and i need to stay focused on the last 31 000 years of architecture and sculpture and ceramics and stuff (yup, from the paleolithic era to Sweden, 1520). but we are not removing abstract art, imagine the uproar when i classify *this* as abstract, but not *that*. can of worms. \n\ni think that's a discussion we need to have with the abstract artists, how can we help them grow. \n\nthe reason we remove photo bashing is that it violates our first rule, that *you* have to paint the art. discrete photo textures and well made bashes aren't removed. it's more us removing photos with painted-on mustaches and shite like that. i mean, i know Uncomfortable photo bashes. that's his technique. (i photo bash too.) but i don't sit and stare at his art and go \"is that pixel painted or not because if it isn't i'll remove it!\" the rule is for us to remove shit we know isn't painted. like a photo with a painted car in the foreground. stuff like that. it's also an issue with legality, can we be sure you have the rights to use that photo, or did you just find it on google and thought it was public domain. it should be noted that tracing a photo and painting a copy of it and publishing it (on imgur or deviantart for example) is *also* copyright infringement, but we can't run around reverse image searching every submission either. it's just the *really* obvious stuff we remove. \n\ni've probably contradicted myself fifteen times by now. it all makes sense in my head!\n\nwe're thinking of removing the downvote button, at least on a trial basis. in my mind, even if submissions couldn't get downvoted, they wouldn't get upvoted either and so the \"bad\" art would go from 0 karma to 1 karma. but that technical stuff is 'zilla's domain. i'm just here to throw walls of text on unsuspecting artists. \n\nand don't apologize, i love talking about art! but now i have to get back to this commissioned piece i'm working on!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412024496", "subreddit": "DigitalPainting", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Yeti and Loch Ness hoaxsters could also be asked if they were genuine in their image capture, and they say \"yes.\" Their monsters are much less improbable than a fire-breathing dragon.\n\nYeti and the Loch Ness Monster *did* exist, though.  Yeti's an albino Gigantopithecus and the Loch Ness Monster is a plesiosaur (which has been in legend for centuries, by the way).  The dispute isn't over whether they existed or not, but whether they were observed alive.\n\n&gt;They had lizards. They had fire. \n\nThat argument might hold up if only one, or two, cultures independently came up with fire-breathing lizards.  The fact that fire-breathing lizard stories popped up all over the world casts this theory into serious doubt.\n\n&gt;That's ab out the process that got us the gryphon (look at this eagle, and this lion. What if they were one thing?)\n\nYou're assuming the gryphon was never real.\n\n&gt;Since when is a fire-breathing dragon not on the same mythological list as unicorns and manticores?\n\nThere's nothing impossible about a unicorn or manticore.

A manticore has 6 limbs, so I can understand the incredulity, but that doesn't automatically make it mythological.\n\n&gt;the other 98% of animals are probably mostly beetles, but I'm holding out hope for some really good existentially terrifying krakens.\n\n[We've already found good evidence of an 'existentially terrifying kraken'.](http://www.livescience.com/40856-kraken-rises-with-new-fossil-evidence.html)  :P\n\n&gt;I would like to point out that, this being in America, this could just be a depiction of a horned lizard. \n\nI think that's a bit silly, lol.  Horned lizards don't breath fire, they shoot a thin stream of blood out of their eyes.  They have almost no neck, and a chunky head.  They don't have a forked tail, or a long horn on their head.  We may never know if the petroglyph was a hoax, but one thing we can be sure of is that it was not intended to represent a horned lizard.\n\n&gt;The fact that the modern banana had not yet been cultivated means we have no size reference\n\n:\\\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412028303", "subreddit": "AskHistory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

We're not talking about a divinity with powers over the realm of reality, the creator of the universe, etc., right?\n\nAnd you're right, the feelings about reality are real, and the topic of divinities is a valid one. But those are wildly different from the original statement and topic of this thread—which is referring to the so-called \"real\" divinities.\n\nYour statement about the people who can't talk and the power structures that reinforce idiocy echoes my own sentiments about the state of education in North America. It's a sad state of affairs (in particular in the US--lucky for me I'm Canadian). Education is declining, superstition is on the rise, and the middle class is being obliterated through manipulation of the systems and economic oppression. Politics and religion are being co-opted by radicals &amp; fundamentalists. There's definitely stuff to be concerned about. But that's an entirely different topic and doesn't have much to do with Man making God in his image.\n\nOne tiny amendment to something you said: \"...am familiar with scientific view, which rejects Gods, as they are irrational.\" That's not entirely true. Science doesn't reject god, nor do the majority of atheists. It just doesn't _accept_ the statement that god is real, not at face value. Science also doesn't reject Santa Claus, fairies or the Loch Ness monster, but it can certainly establish whether the claims that they exist are true, if the evidence is there. I realize this distinction may appear minor and mostly semantics, but there's a huge difference between being skeptical and stating something doesn't exist.
