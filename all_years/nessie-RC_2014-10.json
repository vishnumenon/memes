{"body": "&gt;Except of course that in absence of any sort of evidence it most certainly is evidence of absence.\n\nNo it isn't. There are millions of things that we don't have evidence for but are in fact true. In the 1600's there was no known evidence for evolution, that was certainly *not* evidence that evolution did not occur. Unless you meant in the absence of any sort of evidence whether it has been discovered or not, then I agree. \n\nI should change my argument to \"absence of evidence is not **necessarily** evidence of absence\". It can be if you have say, a predicted outcome for a test and it doesn't happen, that would be evidence that the outcome was wrong. But in this case it doesn't work. I'm not trying to say there are no truths except for those which we have affirmative evidence for, and everything else is up to your personal preference.\n\n&gt;There is no proof at all the Loch Ness monster exists, there are many kinds of things that make it unlikely one exists. This says something about the likelyhood of it existing.\n\nI agree, but since that is something that can be (and has been) tested in the present, it is much easier to find negative evidence to show it does not exist. The fact that there are no historical texts from thousands of years ago that mention one person specifically of probably a thousand \"messiahs\" at the time is hardly compelling. I only bring up the lack of historical evidence for Jesus when people try to assume that it is common knowledge Jesus is an accepted historical figure. Which, we know there is about as much evidence for Jesus as there is Zeus. \n\nIt is much more useful to talk about the similarities between Jesus and other mythological figures in other texts as well as common themes found in other mythologies. Either way, we can agree that Jesus most likely didn't exist, and if he did, he was a normal human that was simply written to be much more special than he actually was (I lean towards him not existing).

I even stated Superman has to be bloodlusted to potentially win, but honestly I'm tired of this nonsense. Saren's argument is basically the \"my character has beaten a bunch of guys that were strong so he should beat Superman, regardless of context.\" Superman has different powers than other characters. His ability to resist transmutation, block/dodge omega beams, and have a lot of experience fighting Darkseid gives him an edge that other characters don't. It's also important to remember characters change overtime. Darkseid may have beaten Agogg and Kalibak but how old are those comics? When was the last time Darkseid has fought anyone at the level? He's a Superman villain that rarely chooses to fight Superman directly because he'd rather use his intelligence, but he does lose and he loses to Superman. Obviously Superman needs help or a boosts from sundipping or bloodlusting to beat him but this nonsense that Darkseid could kill Superman in one attack needs to end.

{"body": "Dear diary,\n\n*It's day 47.* We hear a deep, faint wailing in the dark hours of the night. Sounds like it's coming from the garden. And there it is again. That low, mournful croak, singing of gangrene and despair.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n*Day 49* since Jimmy disappeared. We're losing hope, but not fear. Moonlit shadows of rhododendron branches dance at our windows like bony hands grasping to reach inside. The tree is barren at night but full of color the next morning. Am I losing my mind, succumbing to grief? And once again, the wailing, but louder this time, the wooden claws scratching at the windowsill. Jimmy, please, please come home. \n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n*It's day 53.* The tree is wailing \"Heeelllpp.\" Janice says I'm hearing things, but the look in her eyes betrays her. Her face is pale. She hears it too.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n*Still day 53.* The croaking is relentless. *Heelllppp, heeeeellllllllpp.* The scratching makes sleep impossible. I trimmed the rhododendron branches this morning, but it's scratching the second floor again. A loud *crack!* downstairs thirty minutes ago was a root pressing in through the bottom of the front door, shattering the bottom hinge. The root was an inch thick, knotting its way five feet into the house. Warm to the touch, I could feel it trembling as I began to saw through it, and as the dark, sticky sap came flooding out. The foyer is covered in it.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n*Day 54.* This morning I went downstairs; the sap was gone. So was the root. The tree was in full purple-pink blossom as usual, its breathtaking beauty hiding whatever lurked within. I chainsawed the branches, but the chain broke before I could make headway into the trunk itself. I'll save that for tomorrow.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Day 54, midnight.* Scratching at the window again, new branches having grown to replace the old. They tower over the house, replacing the amputated branches from earlier that sit rotting in the yard, decaying already into the dirt beneath. The wailing was louder, *is* louder, it's yelling again for help. I opened the bedroom window, flashlight in hand, and saw a wooden face growing from the tree. No knot looks so much like a face. Like Jimmy's. It couldn't be. I'm going down to check. Janice is on the overnight shift, she can't insist I stay inside this time. Jimmy, if you're down there, I'm coming.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*This is Janice.* I'm driving into the countryside, as far away from that haunted tree as I can. I got home to find Bill's flashlight sitting in the middle of the yard, flickering from dying batteries, shining at the rhododendron's trunk. Two faces were embossed into the craggy wood, their features distorted in anguish, frozen in empty outward stares. The light flickered one last time before ceding to the darkness, and I swear, I swear it, the two pairs of wooden eyes swiveled to look into mine. No, I can't keep running. I have to go back.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*\n\n*Diary, it's Janice again.* Maybe this will be the last time we talk. I pulled back into our driveway under the cloak of midnight's darkness, to see that the tree had grown into the house, winding its branches into and out of the windows. I stared back at the trunk, watching as the steady gazes of Bill's and Jimmy's faces moved to follow me. Lit only by the scattered beams of my headlights shining on our garage door, I could see the lips on Jimmy's face begin to move. \"Heeeellllppp. I... treeeeeee.\" Please, please just let this be a nightmare. Let me wake up from this. I can't go on. \"Heeelllllppp. About treeee... tree fiddy.\" It was then that I realized my rhododendron was a 500-foot-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. It swallowed my car and I in one monstrous bite, giving me just enough time to scribble down the end of this entry before tossing this diary out through the closing gap between the plesiosaur's shrub-sized teeth.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412270110", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 40, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So there is actually some pretty strict protocol for when you are issued a punishment that you can't preform. Luckily for you, I'll fill you in.\n\nSo the first thing that happens is that you are taken by your drill instructor to an evaluation center on the base. Since the punishments are not above and beyond what military personnel  should be able to do, they must pass an evaluation to make sure they are still fit to serve. If it turns out they pass the evaluation (which almost everybody does) then they begin the second step. \n\nThe second step, and the last step evidently, happens during the middle of the night. The drill instructor wakes you up at around 2am, screaming and yelling at you as hard as he can, and puts you in a humvee. this humvee will take you to the nearest large body of water. Most bases are within 15 mins of a decent size lake. Once at the lake, the put you on one of the military transport boats (MTBs) and take you to the middle of the lake. \n\nOnce out in the middle of the freezing lake at about 2:30 am they make you strip down to your skivies and get in the water. You must stay in the water until...the Loch Ness monster comes up and and tells you that you should be able to do about tree hundred and fiddy push ups.

{"body": "I was camping in Jasper with some friends from university. It was a pretty cold weekend late in the year, and we were all heavily laden with about 80 lb backpacks. \n\nWe're on this 120 km loop, and we're about half way in, at the exact farthest point from the entrance to the wilderness. \n\nWe just reached a suitable place to set up camp for the night, and I was out collecting wood for a fire. Another of us was tying our bags up into the trees so that bears wouldn't get at them. Another of us was setting tents up, and it's funny, because I thought at that time that he was setting the tents up too close to the bags. They really should be out of visual sight, ideally closer to the lake than you are (so that in general the wind will blow from the lake towards you, and you will be downwind of the food/bear).\n\nOne of us is taking the water filter, which is a ceramic filter with a non-return checkvalve operated with a floating rubber ball. Well as he's cleaning the filter before using it, he drops the checkvalve ball in the water and can't find it for the life of him. That year, lupus was a real concern in the water, so now we basically can't drink the water, and we have to travel 60 Km just to get out of the woods. \n\nThat night we're trying to figure out the plan of action. We've got a campfire that is just coasting down outside, and we're inside the tent. I'm about to go check on the campfire. As soon as I zip down the tent and head towards the fire, there is this giant brownbear trying to get at our bags. \n\nI still can't believe I didn't hear her before the fact. I start backing away from the bear and I hear something take off behind me. I turn to look and it's a brownbear cub. At this point I know I'm in some serious shit. \n\nWe go hiking with skipoles to help support us as we hike with our heavy packs, so my first instinct is to grab two poles that are lying down next to me and try to look big and scary. For blackbears, you are supposed to play dead, but for brownbears you are suppose to scare them off. \n\nWell this bear doesn't give a fk about any of that, probably because I'm between her and her cub. I start to run, but after I realise I have no chance of outrunning this thing, I back myself up against a tree, lie down on the ground, and plant the skipole on the ground. \n\nBears naturally attack by going up and coming down on you, so I figure maybe the bear will attack me and impale itself, and I won't get crushed too badly, or it won't eat my face off as it dies - if I'm lucky. \n\nWell this thing crashes in towards me, and stops just inches from me, swats down my ski pole trap, and says \"Do you have about tree fiddy?\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412274908", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was an introvert mostly throughout High School.  I didn't go to many parties, nor did I have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked.  \n\nUnfortunately, I had 0 skills on picking up girls even though I was trying really hard to get a girl.  \n\nIn 11th grade there was a party around my school's christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it.  I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.  \n\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where.  I still remembered her name though, Vanessa.  She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\n\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me.  I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\n\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible.  She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back.  I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\n\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of.  Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\" \n\nI started saying more things.\n\nShe laughed even more.\n\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl.  But then it dawned on me.  I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where.  A strip club.  Vanessa was a stripper.  Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.  \n\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously.  My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once.  I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\n\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"  \n\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\n\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house.  This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue.  I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself.\n\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\n\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone.  A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms.  I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside.\n\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\n\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off Vanessa's clothes.  Finally, she was fully naked, as was I.  She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.  \n\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\".  Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\"  I couldn't believe it.  This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin.  I still can't believe it.  I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock.  She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to.  I told her I was a virgin too and she said good.  As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\"  \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\n\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life.  Been waiting for awhile for someone to post a question like this to askreddit for a long time now.  Happy I finally got the chance to tell that story.\n\ntl;dr: A stripper who aggressively threw herself on to me was actually a virgin.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412356106", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Really been looking to share this for a while, thanks for the opportunity op!\nSorry if this overly long, been hoping to get this out for a while.\n\nSo basically when I was younger my dad would take me out on Halloween. He would take me around all of the houses in our general area, I’d have my joke lined up and then I’d get my sweets. It was a nice father and son activity every year. By the time I was 11 however, I had started going through the “I’m 11 years old I can do whatever I want” stage of life. Over the year I had been demanding that I be allowed to do things with my friends as my only company. Just small things at first like heading down to the local park alone, then to the shopping centre for a fascinating day of walking in circles. So when Halloween came around that year I obviously had decided that I was going dad-less that year.\n\nAs you’d expect my parent weren’t entirely sure on the idea of me being out at night with my friends being my only protection. They decided to let me go in the end; perhaps they thought it was best that I have these kinds of childhood experiences. My dad seemed a bit gutted that we weren’t doing it together this year but I’m sure he was proud that I was growing up. I was certainly excited about it; I had purchased a skeleton outfit ([like this](http://www.fancydressball.co.uk/big_images1/child-3d-skeleton-costume-996242.jpg)). I also had my best joke prepared: “Why didn’t the skeleton go the ball, because he had no-body to go with” I thought it was pretty relevant because of my costume so maybe I could act it out or something in order to enhance the joke. \n\nAt around 6:00pm my friends arrived. I opened the door and was greeted with a cry of “Trick or treat!” I just laughed and made my out of the door to them, then I have my dad a wave and then I was on my way. From then on the night went as you’d expect, we covered the first street, then the next and the next one, milking each house for every piece of chocolate and gummy sweet that they could offer. By the time we had finished it was around 7:40pm and we were burnt out. My friends had decided to call it a night but I went on to point the house down the road where the old man lives. “He’s bound to have loads!” I exclaimed to my posse. My friends shrugged and then we made our way to our final target.\n\nWe halted at the door step. Number 59, I’d stopped by this house in previous years with my dad. He’d usually invite us inside to keep warm while he prepared the treats and we prepared our joke. We knocked on the door. I should probably describe everyone’s costume, seems kind of relevant. My friend Dave was a Spider-Man costume, presumably bought from the same place that my skeleton costume originated from. Next up was Michael who was proudly dressed up as a spooky ghost (ooooooooooh). Finally, there was Kev. He was rocking a generic vampire costume; he had the fake teeth, the eye-liner and the cape. His costume by far outclassed the rest of our but none of cared, we just wanted to have a fun night.\nThe door slowly creaked open; it was as stiff as my old skateboard wheels. Then the man emerged, more enthusiastic. “Hello children!” he cheered; his enthusiastic tone was sticking. “Tr-trick or treat!” we yelled in unison. “Wow, those are some great costumes kids! Why don’t you lot come in while I get the sweets ready!” he spoke in the eerily hyper voice. The idea of going into his house didn’t seem all too strange as I did it every previous year with my dad. We nodded and followed him into his living room.\n\nThe room looked fairly average; it has a sofa position in front a TV, some old photos on the walls and dining table at the back of the room. I asked my friends if they were gonna do the joke here, they simply told me that I could do this one. I’d used it a few times tonight and it had been a hit, always got a positive reaction followed by an overwhelming amount of candy. The old man came back into the room; he looked toward us and then made his way over to the curtains and shut them over. I watched as the darkness from outside was drained; the only source of light was now the lamp in the corner. My friends and I nervously glanced at one another; I didn’t remember him doing this before. He stood tall before us; his old fashioned clothing seemed so peculiar to us and he smelled... old. He spoke. “Boys... before I get your treats... I’m going to need a little something from you.” He spoke with a frail voice, yet it seemed so sinister. “Oh, we- we have jokes!” I tried to keep it as enthusiastic and confident as possible but I struggled to hide my fear. “No... No... Not that.” He replied with a sense of disappointment yet he seemed excited. “Then... what do you want from us?” we said fearfully. I felt sick to the bottom of my stomach. A smile grew on his face, his yellow teeth no visible. “Well... I’ll need about Tree Fiddy.” It was around this time where I realized that the old man was around 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. “God dammit Loch Ness Monstah, I ain’t givin’ you no tree fiddy!” We ditched our bags and ran out of the house as fast as we could. Since then we have kept the events of that night to ourselves. I still think about how it could have gone differently had I just went with my dad, I’m worried that one day my kids may have a similar experience... It scares me just thinking about. Luckily I wasn’t physically harmed but the memory will stick forever.\n\nTLDR;  Went trick or treating without my dad, almost went bad. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412376958", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The Panthers look real banged up, but at the same time, who knows what they have up their sleeves? I don't know about you guys, but this game is going to be closer than y'all think.\n\nBetween our banged up defensive line, and our awful secondary, I think Cam has a good outing at home, ultimately due to the O-line losing contain. Their run game won't do very well, but Cam can extend plays, and as seen last week, our D-line can't hold a QB in the pocket. \n\nOur offense doesn't seem to be firing on all cylinders and with the injury to Bushrod, I think somebody steps up, and makes some big defensive plays for the Panthers, leaving Cutler a bit gun-shy, ultimately leading to two interceptions. \n\nStill, I think Matt Forte has a big day for the Bears, and we successfully move the ball down the field on the ground. Brandon Marshall and Alshon will both have a down-the-field catch each, and Santonio Holmes will show he still has some left in the tank.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a hard one to predict, but my heart tells me that the bears snatch another road win from the Panthers, tree fiddy to zero. \n\nPraise be to Halas.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Just read the analysis.

{"body": "Oh, I can tell you that right off, because it's glaring. There are essentially no generalizations made about men along the lines of:\n\n- men abuse their male privilege\n- men never grow up\n- men always have an excuse: \"boys will be boys.\"\n\nThese kinds of generalizations are *constantly* made about women. I was just writing this in my notes, actually. There are also constant accusations that feminists hate men. This exchange happens continually. The feminists say they don't hate men, and strive to prove their evenhandedness. Other posters contradict this assertion in one breath, and bitterly criticize women in the next.\n\nWhen generalizations about men are made, they tend to be pretty bland, and sourced: men enforce gender roles more than women do, for example. This one is interesting, because the opposite is said far more frequently, and it never gets sourced. There are also some references to men being more violent. Any kind of generalization about men is immediately and angrily challenged.\n\nI was unlucky enough to read the full exchange with that one really homophobic poster complaining about gay pride parades, and the difference in how that was handled was really striking. Moderators deleted a bunch of his comments that technically weren't against the rules. He made the standard disclaimers that he just didn't like *bad* gays, you know, the really gay ones. I am glad that at least FRD at least didn't tolerate the homophobia, but if that conversation had been about rape, and \"bad\" women who flaunt their sexuality, nobody would have batted an eye.\n\nI am not sure if I am going to have it in me to do an analysis of reporting and moderator decisions, because it's really draining to read all the inanity, but it might be a good programming challenge for me to write something that searches for the reported comments. **Moderators, does the software provide any kind of log showing reported comments, ideally with rulings?**\n\n______\n\n\nEDIT: sorry to go on and on. I just finished reading all the posts for my sample, so my thoughts are fresh. One other thing I find really striking is the dearth of empathy and even interest in the female experience. It really reads like a bunch of guys with almost no experience with women, even the ones who are married. There's all this speculation about women, like we are yetis or the Loch Ness Monster. We are of very high interest, but difficult to observe. Why would women object to getting catcalled? We can't actually ask one, that's impossible. Instead, let's develop some elaborate theories, which sadly we'll never be able to prove one way or the other.\n\nAll the topics about women either talk about women in this weird, estranging way, or derail back to a topic they are far more interested in, themselves. Even the casual conversations are all about stereotypical geeky boy interests. \n\n________\n\nEDIT 2: I hope this answers your question. Let me know if it doesn't. Tl:dr; there tons of negative generalizations about feminists; lots of negative generalizations about women; a few careful, measured generalizations about men; and almost none at all about MRAs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412378830", "subreddit": "FRDbroke", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sooo......what do you get when you \"win\" this argument? Is there a prize involved? I'm assuming so, since you're so worked up over it.\n\nTo give a more serious answer, I'm not sure what you're looking for exactly. The earliest evidence we have of religion is from the Middle Paleolithic period. Since the Paleolithic Era didn't, by definition, leave any written evidence behind we can only surmise what form religious worship took.\n\nWe can say that we have a general idea of religious beliefs of the Sumerians in the Uruk period in the Chalcolithic era, but only because of writing that survived from the bronze age. The roots of many Judaic myths, such as the great flood, seem to derive from this culture.\n\nThe bigger point, however, is *why the hell argue about this!?* Look, people believe different things, and there's nobody who holds a monopoly on truth. I prefer an evidence based belief system, and I have many friends and family who prefer faith. If your Aunt believes that Abrahamic religions are the oldest, it's fine to give a counter opinion, but if she's not budging, then just drop it. There are far better things to share and explore with your family than a debate over faith.\n\nI'm not saying this is you, but one of the reasons us atheists have such a well deserved reputation of being insufferable is exactly this kind of behavior. Is she factually wrong? Of course. Then again, there are things you believe in which are factually wrong as well. Sometimes it's best to find the things you *do* agree on, and go from there.

For example, in the /r/xkcd case, there was a large community movement to get people to move to a different subreddit, /r/xkcdcomic, that was run by a much saner mod team. Reddit is founded and centered around the idea of community, the power of the people, and the power of the individual. Don't like a subreddit? Leave or make a new one.\n\nAlso, I'm sure that there are plenty of subs that are run by neo-Nazis, ISIS supporters, the Loch Ness monster, etc., but you will never hear about them unless someone calls them out or they start forcing their opinion on the sub. The /r/xkcd controversy didn't start because of /u/soccer's beliefs, but the fact that he started linking to controversial subreddits like /r/TheRedPill in the sidebar.\n\nKeep in mind, this is a place where subs like /r/GreatApes (A very racist sub) or /r/picsofdeadkids (Self-explainatory) can exist, but nobody is ever forcing you to view them.

{"body": "I was kidnapped in Ukraine by two men during my visit to the country I left as a child many years ago.\n\nI was at home in the US and my parents and I were talking about how I should visit Ukraine since I'd never been back since we left (20+ years ago).  I was a baby when we left and this conversation took place in about 2011.  My brother and I were talking a few days later after my parents talked to him about visiting with me since he was older.  My brother and I were looking at the Euro cup taking place in Ukraine/Poland and thought this would be a good time to visit.\n\nIn short, we flew to Kiev through Aeroflot and had a great flight since my brother got us the emergency row seating so we had **a lot** of great legroom.  In fact, we almost had too much room.  People on the flight were upset at us because we were making quite a scene regarding our legroom (to clarify: we were showing off a bit).  Anyway...my brother and I arrived at our apartment in Kiev (we stayed in apartments because my brothers friend owns an apartment rental business and hooked us up) and in two days we went to our first match - England vs. Sweden.  We sat in the Swedish section and had A LOT of fun cheering on the game! \n\nThe next game we had tickets to was in 3 days so we decided to hire a driver to take us to the town / village where we were born - Vinnitsa.  The driver was a family friend so no worries there.  He picked us up, we had a great conversation, and he drove us from Kiev to Vinnitsa.  My brother hates doing local stuff so we got into an argument regarding what we should do that night.  I went to check out the amazing night-time [fountain show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkWf5omDQtU) and my brother went around the bars hitting on women and getting drunks for a few USD.\n\nI'm at the fountain show and there are people everywhere (obviously).  I saw a few guys heading towards me and I'll never forget it because they were literally walking right at me and they brushed shoulders with me and kept walking.  I'll never forget what happens next - I always give people the turnaround and when i did I saw one of the guys look back and we locked eyes like a mother fucker.  Whatever.  Set your ego aside, Vitaly. I kept enjoying the show.  \n\nThe show ends.  I'm walking around in an area near the water with little lighting and out of nowhere I am grabbed by two men and they hit me really hard in my stomach while they loaded me into an old Soviet type car (to clarify: it wasn't the guy I brushed shoulders with).  It was a small car and I was in so much pain from this guy.  He must be some sort of a reject boxers who didn't make it.  \n\nThey asked me if I was hungry and I said yes because I thought maybe this was my time to escape if they let me out of the car.  They did let me out of the car.  They gave me the whole threatening spiel if I try to escape or do something stupid because they know all the police.  I didn't try to escape because in Ukraine it's very possible that they know all the police.  I go to order and it was a disaster.  They thought I was doing it on purpose.  My Russian is pretty good but now we're in a Ukrainian-speaking part of the country and I seriously **do not** know how to speak Ukrainian.  I'm ordering in russian and this woman taking the order IS SO FUCKING PISSED because blah blah I'm speaking Russian.  In my head, I'm seriously freaking out and thinking: \"ARE YOU SERIOUS?! I'M BEING FUCKING KIDNAPPED NOW! GIVE ME MY FUCKING POTATOES AND [PIROSHKI](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U_p4S_bUMzM/T0rLrj6W9HI/AAAAAAAAAIU/ZgKOHx5sL7I/s1600/pirozhki.JPG)\".\n\nI get the food.  We're driving back to their place / hideout.  There is a police officer parked outside and maybe 60% of me is SO happy and thinking \"WOW, they're going to get arrested\".  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  This guy is sitting inside and we sit around him.  They don't even explain who I am and this got me VERY worried since they clearly do this a lot and don't even need to explain to the **police officer** who this fucking random American guy is.  They break out a bottle of some sort of vodka (might have been homemade) and these makeshift shot glasses.  One was a jar, one was an actual shotglass, and the rest were like candleholers or something (I don't know?).  They asked me in Russian if I want a glass and I was looking at them in shock.  They start laughing and pour me a shot.  It didn't even occur to me that they could have drugged the vodka since they poured mine first.  I drank a shot with them.  I don't know? They take me into a larger room with A LOT of people sitting on the floor / couches.\n\nThis room had: the people who were complaining about my brother and I having too much legroom in the plane, the guys I brushed shoulders with, and the woman at the restaurant thing who took my order and didn't know Russian.  They said that for me to escape, I'll need to come up with tree fiddy hryvnia (Ukrainian money), 31,000 karma points, some Reddit gold, and a [SERIOUS] tag.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412520055", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 74, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"Wow, this is an amazing find. What you have here is one of the original scale model prototypes created for the engineers who worked on the mass relays. While they were massive projects and its estimated that over a thousand of these were made, since they were made out of wood or more specifically cedar they did not last long after being disposed of when newer prototypes were made. \n\nIf you look here you can see that the front end isn't spilt like the mass relays we have now, which allows us to know that this was one of their earlier prototypes. We have only found one of the newer models, and its in rough shape. There could be a variety of reasons why but it's mainly thought that the spilt front compromised the integrity of the model, making them much easier to break and much more likely to be disposed of.\n\nUnfortunately since this doesn't have the inner rings in the opening it brings down the value a significant amount. It's very rare to find one of these completely intact as those rings are very easy to break. Now this will bring the price down as collectors want a complete model but there are still more then a few people and museums around the galaxy who would gladly pay a pretty credit for this wondrous artifact.

{"body": "My idea is strange, it's set way in WWll and way in the future. It starts around D-day, where all of the allies' generals and leaders are together, and they decide that the war is hopeless, unless they destroy the experimental technology the axis has. So they decide that if they win this war, which is hopelessly lost, they will rush for time travel technology, and send a man back into WWll to help win the war. Fast forward hundreds of years, every nation still standing that was in the allies are gathered again, and the US reveals that they have created experimental time travel technology. So they recruit the best of the best, and after a long process of candidates, they decide on one, CPL Joseph M Tiberius. \n\nMission starts, Joseph is thrown back in time, with high tech weapons, armor, and Intel. He is thrown into the Forrest somewhere deep in Nazi Germany. He takes out several camps and finds his first factory, stealthy stealthy so he won't be seen with all of his advanced technology, and takes out the factory. Still more to go.\n\nWhile finding his next target, he meets another soldier, a normal allied soldier named jake, Joseph can't leave him to die, stranded off course. So they team up, continuing his mission. After they destroy more factories and stop convoys, they run into an axis soldier, not a normal one, a technological advanced one, like Joseph. They fight, a long battle nearly killing all 3 of them, then the enemy runs away after finding himself cornered. \n\nBy the end, they have one factory left, but. It's heavily guarded, long battle, future axis soldier comes back and kills jake, Joseph, overcome by rage, kills the future axis soldier, but that's when he realized the impossible, jakes last words, haunted Joseph forever, \" *cough* Joseph.....

{"body": "Man do I have the story for you. I remember I was at summer camp with one of my friends, let's call him Q. At this summer camp, there was this absolutely huge rock climbing wall. I mean, it probably wasn't too big in reality, but my 8 year old mind and small body made it so. This wall was special because nobody had ever made it to the top of its tallest and steepest section and rang its bell. It was that difficult.\n\n One day, Q and I were talking while looking at other kids trying the wall and failing miserably. Don't worry, there were harnesses and safety ropes, so it wasn't dangerous if you fell. We both eventually started talking shit to each other, in a friend type of way though. Long story short, we decided that the argument would be settled by which ever one of us makes it to the top of the rock climbing wall first or at least whoever falls off last. I don't even remember what the argument was about.\n\n So we get strapped up and ready to climb. I then notice that we're the only ones on the wall and a few kids are watching us get ready to climb. So we start climbing and it's relatively easy at first. We start getting to about the middle, where most people tire out and quit, and we start getting tired. I look at Q and say \"dude, this is stupid\". He agreed and replied \"yeah, why the rats are we doing this anyway\". I ask Q \"Hey, dude  I have an idea. We can both be the first to get to the top\". He asks how and I explain that we can use each other as footrests where the footrests are small and far away from each other. He says \"Screw it man, let's do it\". So we both start doing it as such.\n\n We move at an agonizingly slow pace but it's working. People are starting to crowd under us and cheer because we eventually pass the farthest someone has ever gotten. We start to near the top when Q says \"I can't do this anymore man. My whole body hurts\". I could hear the pain in his voice. I replied \"I'm hurting too, come on, we're so close\". He says \"dude I can't. I just can't\". I ask \"Is there anything I can give you to help?\". It was a stupid question in reality because all I had was some spare change in my pocket.\n\nHe answers \"well, there is one thing I need...\". I ask \"what?\". \"Imma need about tree fiddy\". It was around this time that I noticed that Q was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had tried to swindle me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he jumped off the wall and swam away into the camp's lake. Luckily his jump propelled me up and I got to the top and rang the bell. Although Q's parents never saw him again, I still finally got to the top and was a legend in the whole camp.\n\n**TL;DR: I finally climbed a really hard rock climbing wall.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412545621", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, here is a story. Slightly NSFW.\n\nThe reason they brought me into the office was due to agents not properly filing their projects for the past 15 years or so. Federal law required that it be done, and I got paid $20 something an hour to burn cds while keeping up with school. It was okay, I liked interning for DHS more because they let me do stuff. The USPS was just extremely boring, lonely, office work. \n\nOne afternoon my manager came out of her office to talk to me while I was half dosing off at my desk. I wore some well fitting trousers, but when she came over I adjusted myself to sit straight and pulled the junk of the trousers up, tightening around my mostly erect sleep boner I had acquired.\n\nWhile she was talking to me, she couldn't keep her eyes off of my junk. I don't know if I ever have truly experienced what women must notice when guys look at their cleavage, but this was a thousand times worse. She couldn't maintain eye contact with my face, couldn't concentrate on her sentences and was talking in circles, and would look down at my junk at least once every second or two in an almost comical manner to hide her uh...interest.\n\nI told the story and had a good laugh, but because I'm me I had to take everything over its welcomed limit. When she would come into the office I'd already mentally prep myself to get a 50%'er, and she would stop into my cube and just talk to me about things while close-mouthed gawking at my dick. It was pretty fun, I really never had anything to do at the office so it was the only thing that made me feel good about my life. I believe her husband was recently disabled and their sex life was gone, so I imagine it perked her up a bit too as she was still fairly young.\n\nthen finally one day we are doing a Webcam meeting that I have no business being in since all I know about are CDs, but I'm in there getting sleepy again and she asks me to give a quick hip-pocket class on something I had been working on.\n\nNo-Reason Boner was relentless, I was only up there for maybe two minutes but it stuck around for the entire show. I kept having to flex my uh, PC muscle? Which would push it up and draw even more attention away from myself. The second hardest thing in the room was how much I strained to keep my bearing. I finished up the quick class, sat down red faced and things wrapped up.\n\nSo I get back to my desk and grab some water, try to ignore that almost all of the women I work with professionally are now have my cock stained eyes, and just go home. Life wouldn't be that easy for me on that day.\n\nAs everyone was wrapping up and leaving, I received a call from my manager to come in to her office because she needed to speak with me. I walked in and she had her blouse half undone, her heels off, her hair down, and she was half sitting and half straddling the front of her desk.\n\n\"Shut the door MH0\"\n\nSo I shut the door.\n\n\"Sit down MH0, we need to talk about that class.\"\n\nBut the only chair in front of her desk was uncomfortable close with her, so I pulled it out a little and sat down now basically between her knees.\n\n\"MH0, what was that. Tell me\"\n\nI told her I was a little tired, and I guess when I was at the meeting it kind of just came up on its own. When I said that, she kind of chuckled. As far as Interns go, I was a little older being or 24 at the time, and she muttered something along the lines of, \"Shouldn't you have outgrown that?\"\n\nAnyway, after that she looks at me in with these eyes that looked like they weren't sure if they were going to kill me or fuck me. She straightens her back and says \"MH0, I need you to do something for me.\"\n\nI'm a confident man, I've banged a manager or two in the past. I was not to be intimidated. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it was about that time that I noticed that this manager was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the plethazoic era.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412563203", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 140, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The Empire has had no Emperor/Empress for two hundred years. I struggled to come up with something that wasn't a parody of European monarchies of the 19th century, and decided that, actually, there weren't any monarchs and the 'Empire' is run by five provincial governors, their cabinets, an Imperial Service, and the remnants of the old feudal aristocracy who were sidelined by the last Empress because she didn't want another civil war to decide who was her heir. She basically gave the aristocracy a measure of civilian power in exchange for greater commoner participation in public life, a more rigid and fairer legal system, and the progressive emancipation of various classes, such as national and religious minorities, sorcerers, and (quite a while after her death) the peasants, who had been serfs. This permitted the development of industry and an urban workforce which propelled Insula to geopolitical prominence. Paradoxically, with power so fragmented, the Imperial Bureaucracy (alongside a rather toothless Diet) is actually centralising a lot of public life in response to the demands of an industrial, bureaucratic society and the need for freedom of movement and legal equality between provinces. ('Legal in one, legal in all' is a fundamental doctrine, which basically means no state can criminalise a group of people that live anywhere in Insula. It was meant to protect people like magic-users and religious groups, but this was instrumental in the way same-sex relationships were legalised.) \n\nThere's no democratic movement as such, but the communist and nationalist movements which have arisen out of greater freedom for civil society have both got factions within them which argue for formal elections and legislative assemblies. That's a niche viewpoint, because most of the communists and nationalists just think that they could do better with the existing state structures, but it grows quite quickly after the communists take power, but do so only with the support of the middle classes - it's only after a particular general stops the general terror movement in the aftermath of the revolution that they can actually win a revolutionary war.\n\nMost states are confederations, spread across micro-continental landmasses (such as the 'island' of Insula, roughly a thousand miles by a thousand miles) and there are only a few completely independent states not associated with a multinational unit. These states are generally inclined towards the 'Empires', and have a hard time staying fully independent for long; the Insulan Empire is about to absorb two smaller coastal states into it, one of which actually invaded and got a foothold on Insula before being repelled and occupied. Therefore, the plan is now to absorb that state and its neighbour into the Empire before they do any more damage, whether or not the population agree (because a plebiscite can always be fixed).\n\nAlso, 'all myths are true': djinn inhabit the jewellery boxes of powerful magicians, rocs inhabit desert and steppe eyries (and zoos!), yeti roam the highest mountains and Nessie lurks in a lake of her own choosing. Since dragons appear in mythology and heraldry, there are bound to be massive wyrms out there, although they haven't been seen in centuries. In limited circumstances, the dead can interact with the living. And the legal system has to take account of people who turn into bears when they get angry.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412587874", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From a previous thread and thought it was worth posting again:\n\nWhen I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms.  She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet.  His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name.  Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.  \n\nJoe didn't give a shit.  He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either.  Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom.  His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\".  His name was now legally Adam Adams.  Why?  All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\n\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe,  my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it.  He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember.  But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage.  The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me.  Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son.  This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\n\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.  \n\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on.  She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does.  My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\n\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.  \n\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story.  She does.  Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words).  While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out. \n\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved.  After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad.  I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story.  When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her.  She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again.  But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one.\n\ntl;dr: Friend's mom is an overprotective bitch, I get mad at her for being an overprotective bitch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412605673", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "How I think this could be done:\n\n1. Save replays on Blizzard's server for a while (doesn't need to be forever). \n2. Create urls for every SC2 account (make it opt-in). A url could be, for example, sc2://battle.net/spectate/username#thatnumber. When I want others to spectate my games, I simply share my account's url. Opening it launches SC2, downloads the current game's replay, and starts playing it.\n3. When watching a casted replay, simply set the camera view to the observer you want to follow (those are usually in the game just like the players). Alternatively, you can select a players view, just the way it exists in replays already. In fact, there's no need to restrict any of the existing replay features I think.\n4. Streamers/Casters can \"register\" additional content with a SC2 accounts associated games (ie. a short description, icon maybe, and a source for the video stream). Ideally, just a twitch stream (no idea if they'd go along with that though). Use some timestamps to make the stream sync with the replay. Players streaming a game could just offer an audio stream that they can use to commentate their games.\n5. When spectating a game, show a drop down with the available steams/audio. The creator of the game should be able to set a default one and be able to limit what is available as an option. Not limiting this might on the one hand open the whole thing up for spam and annoying stuff, on the other hand, community members could offer additional casting in different languages and other stuff very easily.\n6. When there's no game active, simply switch from the replay to the selected video stream. This way, streamers could still do advertisement in the downtime between games/do games analysis/whatever.\n7. In the SC2 launcher/main menu show featured spectatable games / the most popular streams. That way, no one has to fiddle with actual urls when watching one of the more popular streams/tournaments.\n8. Replace in-game chat with Twitch-chat (Kappa)\n\nThe whole thing is definitely quite a bit of effort. What needs to be added to the game to do this:\n\n- Making replays available on blizzard's servers\n- The ability of the client to start playing replays that aren't completed yet\n- Embed video/audio streams into the replay UI, and add some UI elements to choose an associated stream\n- Whatever features are necessary to restrict access/give the \"owning\" SC2 account control\n\nEdit: As for monetisation, I can think of tons of ways to just restrict some functionality that could be unlocked with some micro transaction (not a huge fan personally, but if it's necessary...): If you don't pay 0.99, watch with 5 minutes delay.

{"body": "&gt;Since it's been proven true now, then it looks like they existed before too. But that's something that's proven true - what if something is proven false: did Martian flying saucers exist when a bunch of people thought they were flying all over? Does the Loch Ness monster exist?\n\nThat's not relevant to the question I asked. The question I asked is \"Can something be TRUE, even if it hasn't been proven true? Or is truth defined only by whether we can prove it or not?\" You seem to be saying \"Black holes only exist because we have proven their existence\" while I would say \"Black Holes would exist regardless of whether or not we proved their existence.\" Truth is not defined by what we can prove. Our verifications or proofs only reveal the truths that already existed.\n\n&gt;Can you give me the names of these tribes that kill and rape each other and steal from one another?\n\nYou can turn on your TV and see them in the nightly news. I think they are called \"today's society.\"\n\n&gt;Like I said, it's relative to society. Do you think male circumcision is good or bad? How about female circumcision? What about pedophilia? Why is that and why do your beliefs differ from other places in Africa. Who is objectively right?\n\nI think male circumcision is value-neutral. I think pedophilia is wrong, and I think female circumcision is also wrong. Keep in mind, if you believe that everything is relative, then I think you are following the logical conclusion of atheism that everything is relative and there is no objective morality. My belief in an objective morality comes from my belief in God.\n\n&gt;See the \"because\" is the invalid part of this. There is no \"because\" in objective morality. Everyone must follow this belief in order for it to be objective. There are no reasons or asterisks given. I mean, if you're a brainwashed North Korean then you agree with Dear Leader who kills the unpatriotic scum, just like religious leaders kill heretics - they've been given \"power\" to end lives of others which turns \"murder\" into legally sanctioned \"killing\". Same action, mind you, and same result.\n\nI disagree with your definition of objective. Objective does not mean that everyone follows it. Objective means that it exists independent of our feelings or desires on the matter.\n\n&gt;This is also your position because, unlike the Nazi's, God has allegedly destroyed vast majority of life on Earth. Your God has apologists like you though to defend him and defending Nazi's is bad, even though they're nowhere close to God as far as how much life was destroyed.\n\nI am a bit confused. If you believe that everything is relative, why are you saying I need to \"defend\" God or the things done in His name? I already said that God is the creator of Life, so He alone has the right to destroy what He has created, and that would not have any reflection or effect on morality in any way/shape/form, any more than you would be immoral if you created a robot and then decided to disassemble it.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412716221", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I've never met somebody as strongly atheist as my stepfather.\nAh so you just mean in the way he argues about it, or gets in people's faces?  Some atheists can certainly be that way.  I mostly don't give a shit what people believe...unless they're getting in *my* face.  Then I'm more than happy to argue with them ENTP style.\n\nOtherwise again I can see how you can be a weak or strong Christian...depending on how much of the many, many precepts of Christianity you subscribe to...but the only characteristic of atheism is that you don't accept the notion of god.  \n\nIt would be like saying you don't believe in Santa but still expect Christmas presents to magically appear under the tree :) \n\n&gt; We can never be sure, and rather then dismiss these theories, i am very open to the possibility of them being true. Hence, \"believing there is more than what we can see\"\n\nFor me the problem with being open in this way means that you have no logical structure to disregard *anything*.   So it means you have to keep an open mind about bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, Noah's Ark, secret alien base on the moon, vaccines cause autism, that God's wrath is responsible for AIDS, etc.  \n\nIf I believe in bigfoot who am I to doubt people that think gnomes live in Iceland, given that we both have about as much proof.\n\nThe way I approach these things is in terms of conditional probability...not in terms of absolutes of what can/cannot be proven.\n\nI ask what is the probability that there is a large, undiscovered primate living in the Pacific NW conditioned on what we know from biology, ecology, etc.  Could bigfoot really be there? In the absolute sense, yes.  But the probability is that it's very, very unlikely. \n\nGhosts could be the subconscious perceptions of other people from an adjacent universe...a quantum mechanical resonance that only conscious beings can perceive.  I can make up \"scientific\" sounding explanations all day. But that explanation is no more likely than saying ghosts are departed souls lingering on the physical plane.   \n\nBut saying that a ghost is a trick of the light, or an overactive imagination, or a misperception is FAR more likely, because we already know how easy it is to trick our eyes and fool ourselves.  Even if not all of us have seen a ghost, I would venture to say that all of us have seen optical illusions, and things out of the corner of our eye that weren't there.\n\nI got a personal lesson on this once when I encounter a black bear in the woods at night.  In my flashlight beam all I saw was his rear end and back legs.  For the life of me...it looked exactly like a pair of fur-covered humanoid legs and waist...and my brain instantly extrapolated that to a figure of a very tall creature standing in the darkness.  It scared the shit out of me until I realized it was a bear.  And then that scared the shit out of me because I realized it was a bear!\n\nTo me it's the same with God....people are metaphorically seeing bears in the dark and then swearing they've met bigfoot. And all because they don't like what the scientific flashlight is showing them. And sadly not realizing that the flashlight can also show them things they couldn't ever see without it.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412794928", "subreddit": "entp", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. woosh.\n\nSince rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now.\n\nTL;DR: Upvotes to the left.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412809531", "subreddit": "CrazyIdeas", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Where I live there is an old abandoned and half dilapidated hospital, St. James, that sits at the end of a country road. The hospital used to be very popular, being it was the only one is close proximity for the people who lived in the area. It was either go to St. James, or drive 45 minutes to a Mercy Health. The hospital was an institution for the surrounding area, being as it provided jobs for many of the residents in the town. In 2001 the hospital caught fire. It wasn't wasn't a gradual fire, more of an instant blaze. The fire seemed to rage out of nowhere all at once. Some people survived but many died. There were more charred corpses than survivors. The fire marshal ruled it as arson, but the suspect(s) were never caught. Paranoia struck the small town because of this. So naturally stories started coming out about employees and patients haunting the once thriving hospital. It quickly became a spot for the paranormal. It was also a popular spot for kids to sneak into at night. Being the hardcore youth we were ,my friends not me, decided we should check out St. James by spending the night in it. I was 13 that night my friends and I made the worst decision of our lives. Staying the night, even visiting for a few hours, quickly became a badge of honor. I think that was our final decision making step in if we should or not. Besides I was crushing on a girl at the time and thought this might impress her. We rode our bikes with all of our gear to St. James and arrived around 8-9p. This was in October of 2002. Luckily St. James wasn't far from my friend Luke's house. Otherwise I wouldn't have went. I wasn't a very adventurous teen and I was still hesitant of the whole situation. We pulled into the parking lot and parked our bikes. Even though the hospital was half gone, it was still daunting in size. Albeit not very scary at the time. We ventured into the hospital and for whatever reason decided we should camp out in what remained of the burn ward. Naturally we each told stories to try and freak each other out. After midnight rolled around I started doubting all of the crazy stories I had heard. Everything was going fine. One by one we each started to fall asleep. I was alway a night owl and stayed up late. Around 3am Luke got up from his sleeping bag, something seemed off. Out of nowhere his head cranked to the right and he began screaming at the top of his lungs. It was the highest pitch I had ever heard in my life. It lasted for about three minutes. I didn't know what to, I couldn't move. I was paralyzed by fear. To top it off when I looked around, everyone was gone. It was just me and what I thought was Luke. At the highest pitch of his scream all of the lights came on in the hospital. I tried to shut my eyes but couldn't for more than a second. Inside my eyelids felt like the only safe place to hide from what I saw. I opened them only to be surrounded by charred and decaying bodies filling the room. In a moment of cowardliness, I bolted. Somehow I avoided touching anything of what I had seen. On my way out of the exit a voice stopped me. It was the Loch Ness monster who told me my co-pay was \"TREE FIDDY!\" ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412882043", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Some background: I grew up just outside of Yosemite and moved to Lima fucking Peru a couple of years ago after swearing that I'd never live in a city, here I am. Love is deaf, dumb, &amp; blind. \n\nAnyways, I was medical &amp; I used to indulge daily in Cali, down here they have archaic drug laws and the authorities are extremely corrupt. Needless to say, I've only medicated a few times since moving. One of those times, I had to walk to the store to pick up some gym shorts to play in a volleyball tournament. On my way there, I passed by this guy that I see every couple of months. He's a younger guy and he has no legs, nothing from the waist down. He panhandles, and every time I see him, I give him all the copper change (10 &amp; 20 centimo coins) in my wallet, usually a sole or 2. Anyways, I said hi, gave him what I had, 90 cents or so, asked how he was,  and continued along. \n\nNow, let it be known that Lima is an extremely loud city, people use their horns more than their brakes while driving and they use their brakes constantly. I wore earplugs full time for the first 6 months that I was here.\n\nSo, after walking about 5 meters, I distinctly heard the sound of a coin hit the ground behind me. I don't think that I would've picked up on it, had I not been tuned in. I turned around and returned to where the dude was and sure enough, there was a 1 sole coin under his wheelchair. He looked surprised to see me emerge from the crowd and a bit confused too. I picked up the coin from under his wheelchair and was like \" Christ! Who gives away 1 sole?!? Money doesn't grow on trees you know! Then I put it in my pocket and made my way to the store.\n\nActually, when I confirmed that my suspicion had been correct, I felt like I had been punched in the gut. People are fucked up down here and do some horrible things, but, this really bothered me. I picked up the coin and gave it to the guy along with about tree fiddy, while thinking 'I wish that I knew who'd played  that sick &amp; twisted joke on him so I can go take the fuckers wallet (or purse). He was very grateful and thanked me profusely. What the fuck is wrong with people!?! I can't wait to return to the mountains! There are good people in the city &amp; bad people in the mountains, but the ratio seems to lean heavily toward the dark side in this one.\n\nTL;DR: Prick (or cunt) dropped money under a disfigured panhandler's wheelchair.

{"body": "Finally, my time to shine!\nWhen I was in 11th grade in High School I took a psychology class, one of our assignments was to do an amateur psychology experiment on some people or someone we knew.\nThere was this girl in the class, lets call her Amy, Amy was a really good friend of mine but she was also fine as hell. At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward. And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.\n\nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward. So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, omg_cats, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\"\nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"\nEveryone in the hall heard. The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.\nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.\nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"\n\nWat.\n\nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying.\nA few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.\nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.\n\nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered. I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.\n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her. Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"\nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her. She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"\n\nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\" I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.\n\nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear. This is great.\nIt slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time. After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life.\nWe're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\"  I personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time. Then she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\" The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\"  She says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.\nI stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.\n\nAs for my psychology project, I never did get it done, and instead dropped the class because of the terrible memories it had given me. To this day I hate reading about Psychology in general.\n\n\ntl;dr: Psychology experiments have forever ruined because of one stupid mistake. Also, never trust a shy girl.  *for the record this is not my OC, I couldn't tell you where it came from, but hilarious none the less.  please forgive me for wasting your time.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412954257", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "EDIT: \n\nGaslamp and urban fantasy mix; I like the idea of magic and the supernatural mixed with the worlds of *Crime and Punishment* and *War and Peace*. I like focusing on the human, social and political elements of stories rather than steampunk (although there is technology, magic is too quixotic for it to be magitech) or making my saga into a high fantasy epic with one single immortal enemy that the human hero has to destroy. Rather, humanity is its own enemy, and the world appears to me as I write to be going through a magical awakening, with low-level, peripheral supernatural occurrences getting more and more inyerface. (Your girlfriend is a *what*? Your boyfriend *died two years ago*? *OMGWTFBBQ is that **thing**?* and so on.)\n\nHowever, it *is* a saga.\n\nJust to add - I can't read much gaslamp fantasy because not much has been written - it's a relatively new genre and although there's more coming out (I was made aware of Brandon Sanderson's *The Rithmatist* this morning), it's not all that prominent compared to mediaeval fantasy. I've read the classic books I've based my world on, obviously, so that probably counts (and the reason why I started writing was because I thought they would be better with magic and ghosts and fairies and werewolves and yeti and Loch Ness monsters and suchlike). Other than that, I generally bypass what look like more generic fantasy books and go straight to writers who come more out of leftfield. It helps I am in a thriving SF&amp;F book group, so I know where the good stuff is kept, but also I tend to be choosy when I buy from Amazon to download to Kindle as well, meaning that if someone is doing something *different*, I'll probably have seen it, bought it and read it at some point. Therefore, I haven't read *The Wheel of Time*, but I have read *The Long Earth*, *The Last Werewolf*, *The Steel Remains* and *Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell*, as well as *Mistborn*, the Drizzt books, Christopher Ruz, J S Morin, etc.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413016223", "subreddit": "fantasywriters", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here, I've edited it into a tree fiddy story\n\nWhen I was a young teen, there was a small forest fairly near our house. My neighbour and I would walk to it regularly to go build dens and play on the park near its edge. The land was clearly once part of an estate because it had an old 1900s-looking swimming pool and bits of stone path dotted amid the undergrowth. We'd sometimes take other kids there and play chase games or pretend to be tribes people, sprinting through the thick foliage. It was a fun place to explore, especially after we discovered where the stash of crispy old woods porn was. It looked like it was from the seventies.\n\nAnyway, we'd been going there for about a year or so at weekends when we finally decided to take a big pair of garden shears to start clearing an area for our biggest den yet. We chose part of the forest that had always been blocked off to us because it was mostly surrounded by a thick wall of bamboo (overgrown from the places' time as an estate I think). The forest was a paradise just for us; we'd never ever seen anybody there other than us or people we brought. The porn and our dens were always exactly as we left them. But all the same, we figured cutting a secret way into the bamboo-walled area would give the best protected den from strangers and barbarians and ninjas.\n\nIt took us most of the day to cut our way in. When we'd made an arch to crawl through, we went in to find that we were in a clearing with only clovers growing in it, no taller plants, just a soft blanket of clovers. Dotted throughout were these odd little knee-high statues of fairies sitting on stone mushrooms playing harps and other instruments. Every single one had its face smashed off. In the centre of the cramped clearing was a giant concrete-looking block. We kicked over one of the fairy statues on the way over to it, probably to demonstrate that we weren't scared.\n\nIt was a giant rough-stone coffin. Some Ivy-like plant covered most of it, but it clearly had a well-defined lid and a worn, unreadable inscription on the side. Adrenaline-curious, we tried with all our might to lift the lid, but it must have weighed tons. The adrenaline wore off, we freaked out, and hurriedly walked back through to the play park where we sat and discussed our find for a bit. We decided the clearing was too den-perfect to pass up, so the next day we returned with some old metal sheeting and plywood boards to build our shelter. It wasn't raining, but the day was heavily dark and overcast, so the woods were about at the darkest they could be during day time. We got back into the clearing, started building, and got pretty far with it. After a little while my friend sort of yelped out an \"oh Jesus fucking Christ\". I turned to see him stood next to the coffin (it's giving me full body shivers just thinking about this) and it was open.\n\nThe lid was slid off to one side just enough that a thin person could get through the gap.  I saw a green mist slowly coming out of the coffin and slowly envelope my friend, he started screaming in pain and agony, \"Help me!  Oh Jesus Fucking Christ Almighty please help me!\"  I saw his skin mutating, turning brownish green, and his neck extended to outrageous heights.  His body swelled up and his limbs flattened.\n\n\"What do you want from me?\" I mustered\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413133459", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Maybe you can't assign certainty, but I can. If this god existed it would have certain traits. Actually some of the traits are incompatible, which disproves its possible existence right there. Second, if it did exist there are certain things we should observe. We fail to observe those things. Hence, it does not exist. \n\nIt's no different than some studies I saw about Bigfoot. One work was on the size of population required to maintain a genetically stable breeding population. Another was on the amount of food they would need to consume. Finally, toss in the possible areas they can exist in - i.e. away from civilization. The conclusion is that when you figure out the minimum size of a viable population and then how widespread it would have to be to have enough food there's nowhere large and remote enough to contain it. There are similar studies that argue against the Loch Ness Monster based on needing a breeding population (it's been reported for hundreds of years), how much it would need to eat and the amount of food actually available in the Loch. \n\nIf something's impossible, it's impossible and hence we can assign a probability of zero to it. That's how we know things such as where planets are (and aren't) even if the locations are too far away to observe directly. If such planets existed, they would have gravitational effects on other bodies.

{"body": "I was homeschooled from 4th grade on. My folks used A.C.E, and rather than go off on a rant I'll try to tidy my thoughts as concisely as possible.\n\n-The curriculum was biased, poorly constructed, and border lined on brainwashing. I don't have time to find it right now but there's an individual who dug through A.C.E.'s core curriculum and pointed out gems such as: using the Loch Ness monster to prove evolution as false, calling Apartheid God's plan for Africa, and essentially tying morality to right wing political policies. \n\nAnother issue I have with A.C.E. is the integrity based \"self test\" system. I cheated my way through huge chunks of school and got away with it.\n\nBear in mind that A.C.E. and Abeka are two of the most prominent homeschooling curriculums out there-this isn't some fly by night scam. These are considered \"legitimate\" curriculum choices and, in my area anyway, A.C.E. is the most prominently used by church / private schools.\n\n-It seems almost entirely unregulated. Texas, my home state, is like home school ground zero. Anyone can do it regardless of whether they've received any formal teaching instruction or if they've even passed high school themselves. I was actually enrolled in a school and, up to my third year of college at this point, I've found no major road blocks in getting through my post high school career. \n\n-Being in a state with a large population of homeschoolers, I found that there were plenty of social activities I could get into as a kid but none of them were particularly desirable. The parents involved tended to be of a paranoid, anti-establishment mindset to the point the entire group once cancelled a trip to see the Hank the Cowdog author at a book signing out of fear that truancy officers would be there to arrest the parents (yes, I'm aware of how flawed the logic behind this was.)\n\n-What colleges recognize your diploma will vary wildly. As I stared earlier, I've not run into any glaring obstacles other than just being forced to learn some material for the first time (purely my fault, as I said I cheated pretty frequently) but I've known people who used the same curriculum I did only to find themselves forced into a GED because their state college didn't recognize their diploma. I can't imagine how heartbreaking it would be to find out that your straight A college experience was meaningless.\n\n-As an upside to the while experience, I perform very well in college. My first semester in a community college I overloaded myself and could myself having to learn many things in remedial classes that I was supposed to have already known. Even still, I managed to pull 3 A's and 2 B's that semester and have maintained mostly straight A's since. Most of my teachers remarked on how much better their home schooling students performed compared to their public school counterparts, but I genuinely am not sure if this reflects very positively on homeschooling or simply very poorly on the Texas public school system.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413157797", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I trusted you, and you turn on us like this?\"\n\nMe: \"snake, man, you're crazy man, I would never, you of all people know I'm as loyal as anyone to this club\"\n(At this point I'm most sure I shit my pants)\n\nSnake rushes at me, before I can even react he has me in a sort of headlock, I can't move, I'm overpowered, I know this is the end. It was an incredible moment, my life flashed before my eyes, everything I've ever experienced, in one moment, it was insane. Then I feel it, Snake's 9mm. He always had it with him. It was right against my temple, I could feel the cold metal against my skin. He gets real close to my ear and whispers;\n\n\"You know what I need?\"\n\nI said \"what snake? Anything. Just please don't kill me\"\n\nHe then said; \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nI turned my head slightly to try and look at him. But it was at this moment that I realized it wasn't the ruthless Snake from the Hells Angels, but a seven story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I then said\n\n\"I ain't giving you no goddamn tree fiddy you loch ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!\"\n\nAs soon as he wasn't paying attention I bolted, jumped on my bike, and rode straight to the station where I promptly turned in my badge and quit the force. \n\nMust have been 7 or 8 years ago now. Haven't fought crime since. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413166180", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I did some undercover narcotics work before I became a regular detective. Obviously everything you do has to remain within the realms of Federal and State law, as well as your own department's policy. \n\nNow, the feds? I'm pretty sure they get more slack in terms of what they're allowed to do. But I work for a municipal department. Our chief is committed to getting the job done, so without much departmental interference, we have to remain within the boundaries set forth by the State.\n\nI had to kiss a prostitute. I've had to make my wife and kids run out to the car when we were shopping at our local grocery store and a dealer I made buys from was there shopping with his grandmother around thanksgiving time. I've had to beat a few people up. and once I even had to put my gun to the temple of a guy's head to get the job done. \n\nThe worst I've ever had to do? Was get into a house with a high level supplier rumored to be working with a cartel. This guy didn't fuck around. He had the whole 9 yards of security. Everything from physical security like steel shutters concealed behind window curtains, to pressure sensors on the lawn, to armed security guards patrolling the perimeter. Along with his own private security that followed him everywhere.\n\nI had been making large buys (10-20k) from some of this guy's high level dealers for quite some time. That didn't matter to this guy. The supplier wanted to strip search me as soon as I walked into the place. We had been working with the State Police, and one of their lead narcotics guys warned me that this would most likely happen.\n\nSo I had no firearm, no wire, no radio. No way to call for help. Even though 20 Troopers and about 30 guys from my department were close by. The only thing that would send them in would be either me sprinting from the house naked, or the gunshots that would kill me.\n\nBut that week we had a pregnant 16 year old girl overdose from heroin and I was fed up. We got there too late to administer Narcan (a drug that literally brings people dead from heroin overdoses back to life) It's a fucking miracle drug, but we were too late. \n\nSo, I'm getting strip-searched and I remember; my tattoo. I have a small tattoo that reads \"Excelsior\" on my left arm, up near my shoulder. It's the motto for my State and it means \"ever upward.\" One of the biggest misconceptions is that drug traffickers are stupid. Now, this may be true for the lower level dealers. But we are losing the war on drugs for a reason; some of these people are brilliant. Some are former military, or former government workers, even special forces, or law enforcement agencies. \n\nThis supplier worked for a cartel, but he was a white male. The second he saw my tattoo, his eyes grew wide. \"What the fuck does this refer to?\" he said while pressing the tip of his knife against my tattoo. Fuck. This was it. I was caught. What could I say that would possibly get me out of this?\n\nMy mind was on autopilot, so my mouth made a move: \"Uh, my dick?\"\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop in that room. The supplier stared daggers at me. Before I could fully comprehend the ramifications of such a ridiculously stupid utterance, two guards had me by the arms and were yanking me down the hall, the supplier right behind us. \"In there! Now!\" he said. \n\nWe went into a small bedroom with a 4 post bed, not nearly as luxurious as I would have imagined for a supplier. These assholes love to flaunt their money. \n\nThe guards threw me to the floor, as the supplier shooed them out of the room. He turned to me and said \"prove it.\"\n\n\"What?\" I said.\n\n\"Prove to me that your dick is excelsior.\"\n\nAnd with that he ripped down his overalls and bent over to reveal the largest most gaping asshole I have ever seen. It looked like the sarlaac from return of the jedi. I pressed my ear up to it and I could hear the wind flowing through it. Like a seashell, I heard the ocean in his asshole. \n\nSo, I slid my cock in. I never had a wild and crazy college phase, so some repressed asshole gape lovin' from a drug dealer hit the spot, you know?\n\nBut, my cock poked something. It felt like a water balloon full of sand. Then I realized, this guy had 35 kilos of pure snow heroin in his ayasshowll. So I pushed harder and harder, until I popped the bags, getting him high as a kite.\n\nEventually I ran from the house naked, prompting the troopers to execute a no knock raid, murdering everyone in the house. Eventually I was diagnosed with GRIDS and had to go to the doctor. How long do I have? I asked? About tree fiddy. he said. Then I realized this doctor was the loch nest monster. And that the office was a lake. And I couldn't swim. I died from drowning. Never forage the river. Because then Jebediah will get typhus.\n\nEdit: I am deeply humbled by your gifts of gold.

{"body": "I did some undercover narcotics work before I became a regular detective. Obviously everything you do has to remain within the realms of Federal and State law, as well as your own department's policy. \n\nNow, the feds? I'm pretty sure they get more slack in terms of what they're allowed to do. But I work for a municipal department. Our chief is committed to getting the job done, so without much departmental interference, we have to remain within the boundaries set forth by the State.\n\nI had to kiss a prostitute. I've had to make my wife and kids run out to the car when we were shopping at our local grocery store and a dealer I made buys from was there shopping with his grandmother around thanksgiving time. I've had to beat a few people up. and once I even had to put my gun to the temple of a guy's head to get the job done. \n\nThe worst I've ever had to do? Was get into a house with a high level supplier rumored to be working with a cartel. This guy didn't fuck around. He had the whole 9 yards of security. Everything from physical security like steel shutters concealed behind window curtains, to pressure sensors on the lawn, to armed security guards patrolling the perimeter. Along with his own private security that followed him everywhere.\n\nI had been making large buys (10-20k) from some of this guy's high level dealers for quite some time. That didn't matter to this guy. The supplier wanted to strip search me as soon as I walked into the place. We had been working with the State Police, and one of their lead narcotics guys warned me that this would most likely happen.\n\nSo I had no firearm, no wire, no radio. No way to call for help. Even though 20 Troopers and about 30 guys from my department were close by. The only thing that would send them in would be either me sprinting from the house naked, or the gunshots that would kill me.\n\nBut that week we had a pregnant 16 year old girl overdose from heroin and I was fed up. We got there too late to administer Narcan (a drug that literally brings people dead from heroin overdoses back to life) It's a fucking miracle drug, but we were too late. \n\nSo, I'm getting strip-searched and I remember; my tattoo. I have a small tattoo that reads \"Excelsior\" on my left arm, up near my shoulder. It's the motto for my State and it means \"ever upward.\" One of the biggest misconceptions is that drug traffickers are stupid. Now, this may be true for the lower level dealers. But we are losing the war on drugs for a reason; some of these people are brilliant. Some are former military, or former government workers, even special forces, or law enforcement agencies. \n\nThis supplier worked for a cartel, but he was a white male. The second he saw my tattoo, his eyes grew wide. \"What the fuck does this refer to?\" he said while pressing the tip of his knife against my tattoo. Fuck. This was it. I was caught. What could I say that would possibly get me out of this?\n\nMy mind was on autopilot, so my mouth made a move: \"Uh, my dick?\"\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop in that room. The supplier stared daggers at me. Before I could fully comprehend the ramifications of such a ridiculously stupid utterance, two guards had me by the arms and were yanking me down the hall, the supplier right behind us. \"In there! Now!\" he said. \n\nWe went into a small bedroom with a 4 post bed, not nearly as luxurious as I would have imagined for a supplier. These assholes love to flaunt their money. \n\nThe guards threw me to the floor, as the supplier shooed them out of the room. He turned to me and said \"prove it.\"\n\n\"What?\" I said.\n\n\"Prove to me that your dick is excelsior.\"\n\nAnd with that he ripped down his overalls and bent over to reveal the largest most gaping asshole I have ever seen. It looked like the sarlaac from return of the jedi. I pressed my ear up to it and I could hear the wind flowing through it. Like a seashell, I heard the ocean in his asshole. \n\nSo, I slid my cock in. I never had a wild and crazy college phase, so some repressed asshole gape lovin' from a drug dealer hit the spot, you know?\n\nBut, my cock poked something. It felt like a water balloon full of sand. Then I realized, this guy had 35 kilos of pure snow heroin in his ayasshowll. So I pushed harder and harder, until I popped the bags, getting him high as a kite.\n\nEventually I ran from the house naked, prompting the troopers to execute a no knock raid, murdering everyone in the house. Eventually I was diagnosed with GRIDS and had to go to the doctor. How long do I have? I asked? About tree fiddy. he said. Then I realized this doctor was the loch nest monster. And that the office was a lake. And I couldn't swim. I died from drowning. Never forage the river. Because then Jebediah will get typhus.\n\nEdit: I am deeply humbled by your gifts of gold.

{"body": "Finally! I have the perfect story! \n\nI was 17 at my first high school party with my best friend Hugh, who was actually known around our school for being a partier. I didn't really drink much that night, but did smoke quite a bit of weed. Hugh however was probably the most drunk I've ever heard/seen of him. I guess he went with being emotional that night and decided to just poor out what he was thinking to me. He told me how he got lost in the woods when he was drunk one time. He started the story off with some random shit about how he almost hooked up with \"the most perfectly proportioned female\", but then he the story actually started when he talked about leaving the house. Said he decided to take the shortcut home to save some time, but had a bad feeling about what would happen. He said is was scary as shit and then that half way through the path as he was passing by a lake he heard girls screaming. He went to investigate and saw some dark silhouette harassing two girls. He was pretty drunk but when he got close enough to actually see what was happening and he was shocked. He screamed that he was gonna kick the dudes fucking ass and that he was gonna call the cops. As Hugh was about to pull out his camera to take a picture he heard, \"if you do that you'll end up just like these girls, Hugh\" I at this point was already really stoned and in disbelief, but that line made me say, \"Sssaayyyy whhhhaaaa?\" out loud. Back to the story, he said he slowly started to put his camera down fearing he would get hurt and scared that he was addressed by name. He said that he promised he wouldn't tell anyone and that he would never be any trouble. \"You're not getting away that easy\" Hugh said he pissed his pants and asked what he could do to get away safely. \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\" At this point my friend said that was when he notices the silhouette was of an eight story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. My friend yelled for the girls to run and then he yelled, \"Dammit monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy!\" this must of been the point where Mr. Lochness Monster knew he was found out so he quickly retreated back into the lake. Thankfully my friend was able to get a quick picture of the beast. It's not the best quality picture, but it clearly shows ole' nessy. If you want to see the picture he took look up his name, Hugh Gray. It's actually pretty crazy.

Her brother was a couple years older than me, and he was supposedly running a meth lab with her dad in the trailer outside of their house. This is all in rural Indiana, so it never presented much of an issue to neighbors or anything.\n\nThe girl always say by herself at lunch and one day I noticed that she seemed really upset. I got along with almost everybody at my school so I decided to sit down and see if I could help in some way. \n\nIt turns out that the night before, her dad was high and pulled a gun on her and her mom. I was in shock. I didn't really know what to do, so I tried to get her to tell somebody in the guidance office about it so they could help her. She refused, but she did agree to take my number so that she could call me if there was ever another emergency and she needed help.\n\nA few weeks later I got a call at like 3:00 am and I could immediately tell that something was wrong. She was bawling and finally told me that she got kicked out of the vehicle by her brother so he could go to some \"business meeting\" and she asked if I could come get her. \n\nMy parents have always been pretty charitable and understanding, so I told them what was going on and I went to pick her up.  We set her up on the couch overnight and I took her to school the next day. My parents made sure that she knew that she was welcome anytime she needed a place to stay. \n\nOver the next couple months she crashed at my place about once or twice a week and we started spending a lot of time together. I learned that she hated her life at home, and I really couldn't blame her. As we got to know each other better, I found that she was nothing like the rest of her family. She was an amazing artist and singer and we talked about her options for art school and such often. I finally realized that I wasn't interested in her because of trying to be charitable like my parents, but because I was in love with her.\n\nI finally told her about how I felt and we started dating. It was by far the best relationship I have ever had. She was now staying with me three or four times a week and was slowly drifting away from her drug-riddled home life. I couldn't be happier. She even started talking to me about applying to the art school at the university I was got accepted to and it seemed like everything was going to work out for us.\n\nThen I got the call. It was the night before a basketball game and the whole team had gone out for pizza for some team bonding. I saw my mom on the caller ID and as soon as I picked up I could hear her crying. She told me that my girlfriend was in the hospital and it wasn't looking good for her. I was panicking. My buddy on the team overheard my mom and told me he would drive me to the hospital so we took off.\n\nI was in the waiting room for what felt like an eternity. Two hours after we got there, the doctor came out and told me that she was going to make it, but it would be a few weeks before she would be strong enough to leave. He did let me in to see her, and she looked terrible. She had gashes on her arms and hands, and gauze covering up what I learned was a 2\" deep stab wound in her abdomen. She rested for a while and finally told me that it was her dad again. He and her brother were testing out a new batch and got violent. She had jumped in front of her mom to protect her and got the worst of it.\n\nI called her phone later that night and her mom answered. She told me that she was scared of something like that happening again and that she wanted her daughter to live with me and my parents permanently. She had a long conversation with my parents that night and they agreed that it would be for the best.\n\nThe day after she came home from the hospital, we took her to her house to get all of her stuff to come and live with me. Her dad was clearly not happy about it, so after we got her packed up and safely into the car, my dad and I went to have a little chat with him. \n\nHe tried explaining to us how it was some all big accident and that he wasn't really responsible for it, it was just a bad batch. We told him that we better never see him around her or our property and then he got angry.\n\nHe starts screaming about how everything she was taking was his and that he had bought it all, he was going to call the police on her for theft.

Now she was a twin, i had known this from the start, but i had never met her other half before until i met with her family for dinner and to stay over (they were letting me sleep on the couch) so I didnt have to bother my parents who arent the nicest people but i wont get into that. I am normally a pretty well reserved guy, respectful and moral as it were, but her twin was the absolute package, everything that my SO was not, she was outgoing, confident enough to wear her hair down and baggy clothes/pajamas around strangers like myself. Throughout the night i swore she was hinting at me and flirting, like she would drop a casual joke every now and then or look at me a certain way. Night came round, we had had a fun night playing card games just the three of us, myself and the twins, i then went to bed afterwards. I was in there lounge-room lying on the couch when i heard someone coming over, it was my SO, she did not say a wod, she just put her finger on my lips to silence me. She then started off by getting me hard with a BJ and we continued on to have sex. So i was half asleep at the time, so we didnt use protection. When i finished, a good 10 minutes or so in (my first time) she leaned over and whispered in my ear telling me that i had the wrong twin. My heart sunk, i was guilty, but aroused at the same time... and as it turns out i did get her pregnant (i have a sneaky suspicion that she knew i wasn't wearing protection and didnt care)  I broke it off with my SO and remained supportive of her twin, my apparent new SO... Another twist though, when it came round to her giving labour, after hours of being there with her, months of supporting her, the miracle of the of giving birth complete, we did not hear any cries and once again my hear sunk, the doctors were about to take the baby to another table when it let out, \"Tree Fiddy\" it was no baby, it was the Loch Ness monster.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413294694", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had a similar experience with crashes and high speeds. My good ol' friend /u/walkbanx was in front of me, /u/the-shaman behind me, and walkbanx decided to throw down a pendy on what I thought was a straight dh run. We must have been going in the 30 range and I was on my nessie, walker was on the darkside that I came to own, eventually. What I thought at the time was just a coleman shutdown that walker pulled turned into a pendy, and that was just after I decided that I was clear to go behind him. He was still crouched and I was in full tuck. My nessie hit the back of his (now my) darkside, my knee impacted his back and I flipped over him, almost did a complete front flip when my left foot and right wrist tried to brace my fall into the grass not a foot away from the concrete that definitely would have broken something. My leg acted similar to a pole and just vaulted me into the air. I remember spinning in a half fetal position and opening my eyes for a second to see that I was more than six feet off the ground and at that moment I accepted that I was either going to break something or just die and all I could do was hold on for the ride. I landed on my left side and rolled a little more and ended up on my hands and knees, about 40 yards away from the initial impact of walkbanx. I asked him if he was good, he was. I seemed to be fine, nothing broken, not even a concussion. I checked my speed app and it said that it went 46 miles an hour. I assume this is because I was spinning fairly fast.

{"body": "I took a marketing minor through the business school at my college. I ended up taking a summer stats course at another school close to my hometown during the summer. Turns out, my school had a rule that if you take statistics elsewhere and you're an Arts school student, that means you have to take an additional marketing course beyond what the general course requirements to fulfill a marketing minor outline.\nSo, technically my fault for not exactly reading the fine print, but I had met with the business school counselor assigned to me numerous times with my courses laid out and no red flags were ever raised. Needless to say, I was really upset when my marketing minor was denied (thankfully, I had been working towards a double minor, in combination with communications studies, so at least I had that to graduate with). What was particularly infuriating was that I had essentially taking the required courses for the marketing minor, but wouldn't be awarded it upon graduation.\nI wasn't sure what to do on my resume because I was looking for marketing jobs following graduation. So I ended up listing a concentration in marketing on there. I know that's not being totally honest (my school doesn't offer \"concentrations\"), but, at the same time...I did take all the required classes. Even my strict, straight-edge parents encouraged me to put that down. So I did and I asked them what I should do know and my father said \"Well son, I need about tree fiddy.\" It was at that moment I realized my father was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "So I used to work in a bakery when I was growing up. It was a smaller town, so we didn't see too much crazy stuff, but one day this GNARLY old guy walked in. I'm talking *old*. This guy was wizened as shit. \n\n\nSo this old guy shuffles his way up to the counter. I'm the only one there besides some other dude cleaning in the back, so I have to take his order. He's taking his elderly time, admiring the cakes, generally irritating the fuck outta 17 year old me.\n\n\nFinally, this old guy looks up from the cakes and says he'd like to order a custom cake. So I ask what flavor, how many layers, etc. running through the little checklist taped to the counter. Finally I get to the end and I ask if there's anything special he'd like for the cake.\n\n\nThis wrinkled bag of old guy pulls out this absolutely disgusting ziploc baggy out of his pocket and carefully slides it across the counter. This bag was NASTY. It was filled with what was *probably* semen. White-ish, rank, and leaving a nice residue on the counter that I was absolutely looking forward to cleaning.\n\n\nSo I look at him him and he's just smiling this wizened old smile at me. Just grinning his balls off. And I ask what's in the bag.\n\n\nAnd the mother fucker just smiles at me and walks the fuck out.\n\n\nWell he never *payed* for the cake, so we ended up just throwing the white stuff out and I never saw him come around again. Then, a few months later, he strolled back into the shop, his ancient ass smile plastered on his face. He asks me about his cake and I have to tell him that we couldn't make it. He's upset, but he says that it's fine, he just needs his change.\n\n\nNow at this point I'm confused as hell, kinda scared of the artifact smiling at me, and the mysterious baggy is floating in my mind. I manage to stammer that he didn't leave any change.\n\n\nHe replies that he did, in fact, he remembers the exact amount. 15 pennies, 5 nickels, 6 quarters, a half dollar, and a dollar coin.\n\n\nSuddenly it hits me. The old man isn't an old man at all. His toothy grin  is actually that of a large green aquatic dinosaur.

{"body": "I'm a relatively well known porn star now. I shoot 2-3 scenes a week and the pay is pretty good. I had a very bad first experience. \n\nThe reason why I got into it was because of school, I just wanted to find an easy way to help pay my student debts. I ended up getting trapped. So I went ahead onto porn casting sites and managed to find an audition, I had to send topless pictures beforehand, which I was pretty sceptical about. I had second thoughts about the audition but ended up going anyways. \n\nWhen I got there, there was at least 30+ girls queued up. I saw a girl come out the casting room crying her eyes out. But still stayed seated, so that I could judge for myself. So they call my name eventually, I go into the room and I meet Miles. Now think of the most evil/inconsiderate person you know of, times that by 10 and you have Miles.\n\nAs soon as I walk in, he pushes me towards the wall and says \"SO BITCH, YOU LIKE DICK HUH?\", I was shocked. In the spur of the moment I said \"Yes I love it\" as that's what I expected him to want me to say. He then pulls down my panties and says \"I'm going to fuck you\" me still being in shock, I don't say anything. He ends up taking his penis out and fucking me until I start crying, just like he did to the girl I had seen earlier.\n\nEventually he pulls out and says \"Sorry, your vagina isn't tight enough, get the fuck out\". I say: Don't I at least get paid for this? He says \"Yes, ok, you can collect your payment from the desk\". I walk to the desk and ask for the payment, the receptionist hands me an envelope. I walk outside towards my car, I open it with tears rolling down my cheeks, I count the money and estimate it to be about tree fiddy.\n\nI was happy once I saw how much I was paid, I then went onto several other castings before getting signed by Brazzers, who treat their pornstars like gods in comparison to how Miles did.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413348199", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 40, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am a healthcare giver who helped treat people in Guinea in March 2014, when Ebola first really started breaking out there. This news post cant but help remind me of those first few days. \n\nMy recent medical training in contagious diseases was still fresh in my mind as I took a plane from Paris, France, to Guinea. It was a particularly cloudy, dark day I remember, and we landed at a remote airport early in the morning. I was a bit nervous, I'll admit, but I was eager to get into the field. \"Here we go...\" I thought to myself as me, my colleague, and two local guides rode a jeep along a rough dirt road to a nearby village from the airport. \"You okay, Dan?\" My colleague asked me, I remember, as he saw the look of nervousness swipe across my face. \"Ya I'm fine, it's just that, this ebola...it's really nothing like we've seen before, is it?\" \"No, its really not. It is definitely an ugly disease. But these villagers need our help.\" When we arrived at the village, there was a crowd of people waiting for us. They swarmed our jeep, and some of them looked very disturbed and desperate. Our translator explained to us how some of the villagers have been plagued by what the locals believed to be a \"Blood Demon\". The villagers told of stories of how people would bleed out of any part of their body, grinding their teeth in agony and screaming in pain. This just goes to show the mindset of the villagers. They are not like you and me, many of them dont have a strong understanding of how viruses spread, let alone what they really even are. \n\nAs our two translators were escorting Dan and I through the village, a sobbing women runs toward us from the crowd with a small child in her arms. She runs right up to us and shoves the child in my arms. I immediately panic and the translators yell at her. Someone takes the child from me and I immediately grab, what we call, E.C.K. (emergency cleanse kit),  that we carry in our back packs. I rub the solution all over my arms to clean myself, praying to god that I just didn't contract this disease right off the friggin' bat. Come to find out the boy didnt have ebola afterall, he was just feeling ill. Nonetheless, I knew my mission now. I had to help these people, and fast. Dan and I suited up and cleared out a hut to use for our medical zone. \n\nOur guides showed us around the village more and what we saw horrified us. There were two dead bodies laying out in a clearing between two huts, and people were laying over them, crying! \"We're going to need more people, Dan\" I told him as we stood there awe struck. \"Well theres nothing we can do for them now, Steve, lets just focus on the living.\" \"I know that, but for god sakes, we need to do something with the bodies.\" We explained to the guides that they needed to have someone take charge and get rid of the bodies. They told us about the rituals the villagers followed, and, feeling overwhelmed with this very bad, bad situation that was about to get alot worse, moved on. In a few short hours, more doctors would be here to start the major quarantines and body disposal. For now, we had to focus our attention on the two living victims. \n\nIt was starting to lightly drizzle out when we came upon the hut the man was in. It was a very depressing scene. Inside, a few members of his family sat, with worried looks on their faces. His wife, I later found out, was the one sitting next to him, crying. Knowing just a very little bit of English, she looked at me with tearful eyes and whispered \"Please, save him.\" I almost lost it here. I very politely asked the guide to have everyone leave the room while I gave an overall check up of the man. The man, named Attu, was deathly ill. He was breathing very heavily and running a very high fever. On top of that, he was sweating profusely and was coughing up blood. I was told that he couldn't eat have any food or water without throwing up immensely. I bandaged wounds that were breaking out on his arms and legs and tried giving him some fluids, but he was having a hard time keeping anything down. I put a cold rag over his head to help relieve him of his fever and headache. I was told he spoke very good english but as of yet he hadn't spoken at all, just breathing heavily and with his eyes closed. I was worried about him. He was very out of it. His blood pressure was getting weak and he kept throwing up blood next to his bed in a bucket. He kept moving and jerking around and I just tried to comfort him. \n\nI held onto his hand as he started moaning. I rubbed his shoulder and softly said to him \"I'm here Attu, I'm here.\" He kept moving all around while he lay in his bed and I was sad to realize that I couldnt do much to help him. \"Attu, can I get you anything? Do you need another cold rag or some water?\" He opened his eyes slowly and looked at me. He started to move his lips. \"I..need...\" \"What is it Attu? Do you need your wife?\" \"....I....ne...\" \"Do you need a blanket Attu?\" I lowered my ear toward his mouth as he laid there. \"I need about tree fiddy.\" And that was about the time I realized this man was the lochness monster, the hut was a boat, and we were on a lake. \"God damnit lochness monster, I aint giving you damn tree fiddy!\" I hurried up and jumped off the boat and swam away. \n\nMoral of the story is; you have a better chance of seeing the god damn lochness monster than to catch ebola, so everyone should be cooolll.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413370560", "subreddit": "news", "score": -12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I appreciate your responses! Though, I strongly disagree with your arguments, well written as they may be.  I worry our major disagreement is philosophical, and little can be done to sway the other on these points, but I'll do my best to explain why I disagree with you.  \n\n&gt;God is perfect without potential for imperfection, by definition. Anything that is not God, therefore, has the potential for imperfection. There are no other choices here. \n\nYou're kind of ending the conversation, here.  You're saying that God is perfect, therefore all his actions are perfect, and there is no room for discussion.  I personally see the God described in the Bible as decidedly imperfect. \n\nMy reasons include the murder of every Egyptian man's first born son, commanding Moses' army to slaughter the wives and children of the Canaanite and Midanite soldiers, holding a grudge on the whole of humanity for the sin of Adam and Eve (which I find problematic for multiple reasons, not the least of which is that God expected humans without the knowledge of right and wrong to know the difference between right and wrong), flooding the entire world and drowning all but one family of humans, forcing Abraham to agree to kill his son, creating the being that would ultimately be responsible for evil and sin, creating hell (or annihilation, depending on your interpretation), threatening death for liking another God more than him, demanding worship, and really, I could go on.  \n\n&gt;Death was brought into the system by another party.\n\nis this party more powerful than God? did this party exist eternally, as well as God? If not, who created this being and why? \n\n&gt;hat money can stay there safely forever, unless another party sneaks into my room and steals it. Is the manufacturer of the dresser to be accused?\n\nNo, you're right, of course the dresser manufacturer can't be accused.  The dresser manufacturer never claimed to be perfect, or to be looking out for the best interests of the valuables possibly contained within.  \n\nYou can't use a human analogy to describe God in the same post you told me that God is perfect and infallible.  either God is subject to the same error as humans, or he's perfect. You can't have your cake and eat it, too.  You're creating a false parallel.  \n\n&gt;The American armed forces enter Afghanistan as a military force to train up a military force there. It's a farce and a joke. None of them can do it. They don't have the education, the resources, the background, or the physical training. If we leave them there, they fail miserably. We know that. So our men go back, and some of them die so that the Afghans can have a stable society. It's a sacrifice so someone else can be free.\n\nI'm not sure I understand or agree with your parallel, but again *you can not compare the struggles of a fallible species like man to the nature of God if you are also claiming God is perfect*. This is a false parallel.  \n\n&gt;This is a grotesque distortion and radical misunderstanding of the text. Have you even read it? It would seem not, because this is just over-the-top foolishness.\n\nPlease, don't be condescending.  I've read and studied the Bible extensively, as well as different interpretations of it. I am providing my own interpretation. \n\nThe way I see it, God created two humans.  He put a tree with the knowledge of right and wrong in the same garden he put the people.  He asked the people not to eat from the tree, or else they would die.  A serpent says that God is lying, and that they should try the fruit anyway.  \n\nAdam and Eve eat from the tree before gaining the knowledge of right and wrong.  God casts them out of Eden for doing something wrong, and specifically increases pain and creates death as a punishment for not doing the right thing and not eating from the tree *before knowing the difference between good and evil*.  Adam and Eve may have failed a moral task, but this is due to them *not yet having the concept of morality*. \n\nI have to ask you the same question. Have you read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation? Not picking certain quotes, not just reading certain stories, but read the Bible non-stop cover to cover as an adult, and thought about what you were reading?  \n\n\n&gt;There are cosmological, teleological, ontological, axiological, and other arguments for his existence that make his existence a reasonable and rational choice.\n\nI have studied cosmological, teleological, ontological, axiological, and other arguments for God, and have so far come away with the conclusion that there is no convincing evidence for gods and that there is direct evidence that contradicts the Christian God. I also find that existing theories of the nature of the universe make it highly unlikely that there is God who is a prime mover or creator.\n\n&gt; If you want to have a real discussion, I'd be glad to do it, but you have to (1) understand the Bible correctly, and (2) not toss cheap shots like unicorns into the mix. No one in their right mind believes in unicorns; millions (billions) of people in their right mind believe in God.\n\nIs understanding the Bible \"correctly\" the same as understanding your specific interpretation of the Bible?  Please understand that people are diverse, and there is no single correct interpretation. That's why there are thousands of sects between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  \n\nthe Unicorn argument is not a cheap shot. I find the arguments for unicorns exactly as convincing as the arguments for god.  \n\nBelieving in something doesn't make it true.  Millions of people believe in the claims of Joseph Smith, are they true?  1.5 Billion people believe in the divinity of the Qu'ran and the Hadith, are they true?  Hundreds of thousands of people believe in Scientology, is that true?  Millions believe in voodoo, and homeopathy, and ghosts, and the loch ness monster, and that there is a board game manufactured by Hasbro that has the ability to communicate with the spirit world.  That doesn't make the claims true.  Evidence is what validates claims, not the belief in the claims.  \n\n\n&gt;Of course you can. A belief is a construct that is the effect of the thoughts I produce. I am the one who navigates the choices, weighs the evidence, and arrives at a belief.\n\nFrom Merriam-Webster: \n\nBelief: an acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists.\n\nI cannot choose what I accept as true. I must be convinced through reason and evidence that something is true in order to believe it.  You wouldn't be convinced Hinduism is true just because you decided to try and believe in it. You can want to believe something with all your heart, and still not truly believe it.  In fact, I've been in the situation exactly.  \n\n&gt;Oh my goodness. WE need to TALK. Have you read the Bible? I'll try to say this kindly: you have a wildly distorted perspective. For us to have a rational discussion, we have to have an accurate notion of what the Bible actually says. Your caricatures are absurdly askew. I hope you have not chosen to believe that this is what Christianity really is and developed attitudes out of this belief you have chosen. It's inaccurate.\n\nthat's not at all what I believe Christianity is.  It's the conclusion I drew about the Judeo-Christian God based on His actions and words in the Old and New testament. But, yes, by all means I'm  happy to talk!\n\n&gt;Well, you're right about that, but after human being brought suffering into our existence, God made it his business to redeem suffering for good, and eventually to rid the world of it.\n\nIs God not all powerful?  If he wanted to, could he will evil and suffering out of existence?

{"body": "Mine was a series of events all in the same night. Me and my three friends were starving so we went out to get food. We were in high school at the time so we had little money. They wanted McDonalds for their dollar menu and our other friend worked there so we could get the hook up. I wanted a Carl's Jr. chocolate shake so we went there first. I order my shake and when I finally get it it's half full and it looks funky. It's usually light brown but it's dark instead. So I said to the lady working the drive thru \"This isn't full? And it looks weird can you give me another one?\" \n\n\"Our machine broke.\"\n\n\"Well can I get a refund?\"\n\n\"Hold on.\" She slams the window shut. \n\nManager comes and she asks what's the problem. I told her what I said to the woman working the window. Manager rolls her eyes and then finally gives me my money back. \n\nWe head to McDonalds(I'm craving ice cream at this point) and me and all my friends order. My friend is driving so he orders for all us \"Can I get a McFlurry and a-\"\n\n\"Sorry our machine broke\"\n\n\"Dang..\" He looks back at me \"What do you want instead\" I tell him just get the rest of what I wanted and forget the McFlurry. So he starts ordering my friends meals \"For the second can I get a large sweet te-\"\n\n\"We are out of that\"\n\n\"Okay a powerade\"\n\n\"We are out of that too\"\n\n\"Okay a lemonade\"\n\n\"Sorry, that too\"\n\n\"What do you have?\"\n\n\"Sprite\"\n\n\"Okay I'll take that. Can you throw in some ranches and buffalo in the bag please\"\n\n\"Uhh we ran out of those too...\"\n\nThis place was literally out of everything we tried ordering. So we all decide to cancel our order and decide to go to Wendy's. We are stuck behind a car but also by the window of the drive thru when we see our friend who works there. We talk to him for a bit when he told us his brother worked at Wendy's and that he'll text him to hook us up. \n\nWe finally get to Wendy's. This time my friends make me order through the back window. \"Can I get a frosty and some nuggets\"\n\n\"Our machine broke\" \n\nI can't believe this is happening. Every machine is broke. \"Okay we will get 8 orders of nuggets.\"\n\n\"I'll have your total at the second window\"\n\nWe pull up and it's kinda dark looking into the Wendy's. The person opens the door, hat covering  the face \"That'll be tree fiddy\". \n\nThat's when I realize it's not a person. It's the Loch Ness monster and I say \"I ain't given you no tree fiddy Loch Ness monsta!\" We drive off after I throw my Carl's jr.

{"body": "I’ve been waiting to tell my story since I was 11 years old and still remember it like it was yesterday. I grew up in a divorced family where my 2 older brothers and I would spend a few weeks each summer with my father who lived in the next state over. The summer of going into 6th grade my father took the three of us to his barbershop for the boys’ haircuts at the start of the summer (typical short farm boy haircut). After they got theirs cut, my father told me it was my turn. I went on to tell him that that mom takes me before school starts to her salon to get mine trimmed. He barked back telling me it’s going to be a hot summer and you’re getting a haircut today. I felt tingles up my spine because I knew it was going to be something drastic and didn’t want to lose my foot long ponytail. I didn’t argue back because my father wasn’t the man you talk back to. The barber got out the bench thing for his chair to have me sit on and went on to cape me. He looked at my father as to ask how much he was cutting as he took out my hair tie and handed it to me. He said similar to the boys and he didn’t want me fussing with it while I was staying with him this summer. He also made the scissors motion to the barber with his hand. I wanted to cry right there so bad, but kind of thought it was my fault since I wasn’t the best at taking care of my hair. I could hear my brothers giggling off to the side as the long pieces slid down my cape as the barber cut away. I just kept staring down at the floor as the hair piled up. It didn’t take the barber long to take my foot long hair up to me ears. The sound of the electric clippers rang in my ears as he did my neckline. Every thought of a typical 6th grader crossed my mind in that chair… What the girls at school going to say about me, how long will it take to grow back? Am I going to look like a boy? Are my brothers going to pick on me? I didn’t even want to look at myself in the mirror as we left the shop in fear I would start crying.\n\nWhen we got home, I ran to my room and proceeded to cry and cry more. I looked in my mirror and I did look like a boy with my crooked bangs and ears sticking out from the short wisps of hair. It tried hard to use my little compact mirror to look at the buzzed neckline. I remember feeling the back of my neck thinking it was never going to be long again and I threw my hair tie in the trash. However that summer I grew (excuse the pun!) to love my short hair. I enjoyed the attention I got when I returned to school that fall (a couple of the popular girls had cut theirs short as well). Every stage of my hairs growth was like a new style I got to play with. As a girl coming of age and my mother hating my short hair, I never spent another summer at my father’s country house. I secretly wanted to so I could return to the barbershop for another short cut. For the next 18 years, I never had my hair that short again, in fact never even above my shoulders.\n\nSummer of 2011 brought a lot of changes... Lost my job due to the economy, I broke up with my long hair loving, controlling boyfriend, and I moved to a new city for a new career opportunity… and new hair. It was time to say good-bye to the ponytail once again.\n\nI made an appointment with a salon close to my new apartment and knew exactly what I wanted to do. When I walked in for my appointment, I was brought to the same level excitement as when I was 11 years old at the barbershop. I couldn’t wait to have the long locks slide down the cape again and see it pile up on the floor. I asked the stylist for a short, stacked bob, which were popular at the time. She asked if I was sure a couple of times before going to work. I told her I was more than ready! I almost lost control of myself as the first 14” cluster of hair was cut and slide down the cape. I enjoyed watching every piece slide down to the floor. She then moved around to the back. I knew I wanted it clipper short in the back. I told her I wanted it “like tapered short with the clippers in the back” with a smile. \n\nWhen she was done I asked how much I owed her. Her response, \"about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that she was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Goddamnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1413433825", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 70, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students.  I heard most of the drama but there is one student that I will always be reminded of when people ask this question.  \n\nThere was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip.  She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't.  Everyone could hear her, including me.  Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about.  She gossiped most days but one day was different.  \n\nI heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom.  I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not?  It could be fun.  \n\nAnyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with.  \n\nMr. Thehealeroftri..\n\nI was shocked when I heard this.  \n\nBut stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young.  She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess.  If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress.\n\nAfter class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work.  It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head.\n\nAs soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, \"Hey Kathy.  I heard you talking about me in class...\"  she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, \"Oh my god!  You heard me say that?  I'm so sorry! And-\" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, \"I want to have sex with you too.\"\n\nShe stopped her sentence and smiled.  Then she said, \"Do you know what my rates are?\"\n\nConfused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in.  It turns out she mentioned that she *would* have sex with me... if I paid that is.  \n\nI decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her. \"Alright,\" I told her.  \"What do you mean?\"  \n\n\"I'll do it, but I need some money of course.  That's just how it works.\" she said.  I replied, \"Okay, what do you need?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That goddamned monster had tricked me again!  \"GODDAMNIT MONSTAH, I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\" I said to her as she swam away.\n\nClass was really weird after that with Kathy gone.  I never told any of the students about our encounter but I sure as hell would never mention it to anyway.  Ever.  Of course I'm telling Reddit, but isn't that what the internet is for?  To tell strangers your deepest, darkest secrets?\n\nThe year ended without being... too weird.\n\n**TL;DR:  Overheard a student talking about having sex with me... things got... weird and it ended in an unexpected way...**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413498671", "subreddit": "RandomActsOfGaming", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

The Paleolithic diet is a fad diet[2] that became popular in the first two decades of the 21st century.\n\nThe core tenet is \"ancient foods.\"\n\nThey then find justify why not to eat these foods they believe our ancestors didn't eat:\n\n&gt;The list of antinutrients found in legumes, beans and soy is seemingly endless and includes: lectins, saponins, phytate, polyphenols (tannins, isoflavones), protease inhibitors, raffinose oligosaccharides, cyanogenetic glycosides, and favism glycosides.

Let’s briefly go through this list so you can clearly understand why you should avoid legumes.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413511611", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Also make sure you leave the lid/door open after each load so that it can completely dry out, or you'll get some bad water stains on the drum. There are other solutions too, but be careful who you listen to: Once I was doing a few loads of laundry with the girlfriend at the laundromat, this guy comes along and sees that I have stains on my clean clothes.

Still, they're both cool guys, and since I helped them a lot on the way (I lent them quite a bit of money over the years, and they've both crashed on my couch for weeks at a time on multiple occasions, as well as used my garage as a work shop) they decided to give me shares in the company, and a low end job there, which I thought was pretty cool, since I honestly believe that it's going to sky rocket. My friend (the engineer) came over to my house to talk to me about it. I guess, because of some legal stuff, they couldn't actually GIVE me the shares, so after some talking about what the job would entail, I asked him how much I'd have to pay for the shares.

{"body": "I'll go ahead and leak what i know about her lore. Half of this is speculation the other half is true but will not be included in her official lore. The beginning is mostly speculation but everything after Demacia is certain.\n\nThey probably betrayed her by killing her master with some sort of wind technique and then making it look like she did it. Meanwhile noxians killed her family and she was stuck guarding an evil well power source thing and couldn't assist them. So she goes against her now dead masters teachings and opens an evil box thing which makes her hate balance and embrace the sun. However she soon learns that the moon is an equally as strong if not stronger source of power after she comes across a bad ass weapon in a hidden cave or something. Then after leading the team that created blitzcrank she comes accross a man getting his ass kicked by a group of men and attempts to help him. However she ends up turning him into a werewolf. Now being hunted by warwick and rengar she flees to demacia but was given no quarter and goes to bilgewater instead. Resisting the charm of miss fortune she starts her quest to find her missing father Du Couteau the former leader of noxian who vanished mysteriously. She makes the mistake of trusting twisted fate who sells her out to thresh in exchange for lucians wifes soul. Arriving at the shadow isles she meets a dude who really loves his shovel and attempts to bury her. Distracted by his passion for his shovel and digging he digs too deep and out pops skarner who is pissed because magic is causing trees to come to life and ruin his 3v3 game... This causes skarner to rage quit after feeding  and spamming all chat begging for reports. Kalista who is now on tilt becomes  feuled by rage and cuts her way to the Freljor where she becomes the new troll king. Just wanting to relax she makes her way to the bar and gets smashed with gragas and jax. Gragas will not stop belly dancing and jax keeps cracking the same joke \"imagine if i had a real cup\" followed by the same pick up line \"who wants a piece of the champ\". Somehow this works and she ends up sleeping with jax. Turns out jax was actually leblanc pretending to be ahri dressed up as jax using charm.  Anyway she gets all preggers and decides she really just wants to be a baker. 9 months and much burnt poro snax later.... Teemo is born but immediately killed by phreak while making kalistas champion spotlight. The spotlight cuts to Hecriam getting beat. Tons of damage. Shaco appears out of no where laughing at teemos death followed by twitch appearing next to shaco demanding a sandwich. Kalista agrees to get the sandwitch but lets them know if the tables were turned she would show no mercy. Before she can even take 2 steps Rammus flash taunts over the wall and says the word that will change kalista forever \"Okay....\" This was followed by a surprise party thrown by fiddlesticks who gets a triple kill. Double jungle op!! She starts to blame her top lane cho'gath for all the terrible things that have happened even though none of it was his fault. She begs him leaves top lane and team fight claiming that if he just grouped they could end. Unfortunately for her it turned out to not even be cho'gath... it was the god damn loch ness monster who replied by asking for tree fiddy. Shaco and twitch went afk while taric stood at fountain letting everyone know that this game was truly truly outrageous. Kalista felt alone and abandoned by her team and watched helplessly as Master yi used his amazing point and click mechanics to finish off the base. Mister Yi 2 shot the nexus but not before saying \"xpece\" and \"easy noobers rekt\"... The whole game Neither their top Nasus or the loch ness monster left top lane and rumor has it they are still there afk farming waiting for three fiddy.  Kalista lost her promo to get out of bronze 4 that day for the tenth time but learned a valuable lesson. A lesson that helped her climb all the way to bronze 2. That's the day she learned \"you can't milk these without first making the ticking stop or setting the world on fire because rock solid.\" \n\nTLDR - I'm way too stoned for reddit at the moment...

{"body": "Probably this:\n\nOk, this story may ramble a little bit, so I'm warning you about it now. I am not going to give names because it gives away too much personal information. \n\nThere was a girl who went to high school with me. She was a junior when I was a senior and it was always apparent that her family never had much money. Her brother was a couple years older than me, and he was supposedly running a meth lab with her dad in the trailer outside of their house. This is all in rural Indiana, so it never presented much of an issue to neighbors or anything.\n\nThe girl always say by herself at lunch and one day I noticed that she seemed really upset. I got along with almost everybody at my school so I decided to sit down and see if I could help in some way. \n\nIt turns out that the night before, her dad was high and pulled a gun on her and her mom. I was in shock. I didn't really know what to do, so I tried to get her to tell somebody in the guidance office about it so they could help her. She refused, but she did agree to take my number so that she could call me if there was ever another emergency and she needed help.\n\nA few weeks later I got a call at like 3:00 am and I could immediately tell that something was wrong. She was bawling and finally told me that she got kicked out of the vehicle by her brother so he could go to some \"business meeting\" and she asked if I could come get her. \n\nMy parents have always been pretty charitable and understanding, so I told them what was going on and I went to pick her up.  We set her up on the couch overnight and I took her to school the next day. My parents made sure that she knew that she was welcome anytime she needed a place to stay. \n\nOver the next couple months she crashed at my place about once or twice a week and we started spending a lot of time together. I learned that she hated her life at home, and I really couldn't blame her. As we got to know each other better, I found that she was nothing like the rest of her family. She was an amazing artist and singer and we talked about her options for art school and such often. I finally realized that I wasn't interested in her because of trying to be charitable like my parents, but because I was in love with her.\n\nI finally told her about how I felt and we started dating. It was by far the best relationship I have ever had. She was now staying with me three or four times a week and was slowly drifting away from her drug-riddled home life. I couldn't be happier. She even started talking to me about applying to the art school at the university I was got accepted to and it seemed like everything was going to work out for us.\n\nThen I got the call. It was the night before a basketball game and the whole team had gone out for pizza for some team bonding. I saw my mom on the caller ID and as soon as I picked up I could hear her crying. She told me that my girlfriend was in the hospital and it wasn't looking good for her. I was panicking. My buddy on the team overheard my mom and told me he would drive me to the hospital so we took off.\n\nI was in the waiting room for what felt like an eternity. Two hours after we got there, the doctor came out and told me that she was going to make it, but it would be a few weeks before she would be strong enough to leave. He did let me in to see her, and she looked terrible. She had gashes on her arms and hands, and gauze covering up what I learned was a 2\" deep stab wound in her abdomen. She rested for a while and finally told me that it was her dad again. He and her brother were testing out a new batch and got violent. She had jumped in front of her mom to protect her and got the worst of it.\n\nI called her phone later that night and her mom answered. She told me that she was scared of something like that happening again and that she wanted her daughter to live with me and my parents permanently. She had a long conversation with my parents that night and they agreed that it would be for the best.\n\nThe day after she came home from the hospital, we took her to her house to get all of her stuff to come and live with me. Her dad was clearly not happy about it, so after we got her packed up and safely into the car, my dad and I went to have a little chat with him. \n\nHe tried explaining to us how it was some all big accident and that he wasn't really responsible for it, it was just a bad batch. We told him that we better never see him around her or our property and then he got angry.\n\nHe starts screaming about how everything she was taking was his and that he had bought it all, he was going to call the police on her for theft. We calmed him down a little and my dad asked him, \"What will it take to make sure you never hurt your daughter again?\"\n\nHe said \"Imma need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nThat's when I noticed that her dad was actually a ten-story tall monster from the Paleolithic era. We gave him the money for the drugs, and we never heard from him again. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413577192", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

She was 10/10, just absolutely amazing. So anyways, at this bonfire, we're spending some time together and manage to get away from our friend group and talk alone for a while. As our conversation goes from polite, somewhat reserved topics to slightly more, shall we say, inappropriate ones, we started walking away from the fire into the less areas of this great summer night. As we held hands and walked to nowhere in particular, she whispered in my ear, \"Come with me,\" which, being the hormonal teenage guy I was, I had no problem with. We went to a secluded place and she kissed me as her hand wandered lower. She grabbed my crotch and one thing led to another, ending with the best (and at the time, only) sex I'd ever had. We were getting ready to go back to the bonfire and see if anyone noticed our disappearance when she grabbed my arm and pulled me close. \n\n\"Before we leave,\" she breathed in my ear, \"I need just one more thing\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked eagerly, happy to please her in any way I could.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy,\" she said.\n\nIt was then that I realized that this girl was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \"Nooo!\" I screamed as I fell to my knees, watching her swim into the distance.\n\nTL;DR: Got laid at band camp, but it turned out to only be a one night stand", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413597553", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

You said you don't need to, did you go get samples of that liquid and test them in a lab? If I link to a video about the loch ness monster or big foot and purport it is true then I am claiming the same as the video. All I see is a *Clear* liquid falling, generally urine tends not to be clear unless you have already urinated a lot prior to that batch.\n\n2. As I said, they are merely gathering in a group, have you seen them destroy buildings and loot? Actually, there is not always a body count by the police, UK police have armed units that can be called out, but they shot nobody during the London riots. Stop drawing parallels with the American police, I already told you they are no shiny example of protectors of the people.\nIf there were a body count I think you'd see a riot, and even some people who are not involved would hit the streets due to them feeling the place had become too much like mainland. Do you want to live in a city where people are shot for sitting on the ground, does this not sound like Iraq to you?\nHypothetically, what would I do? Let's pretend this is Tropico or something, the game. I would give into the demands, and I do in Tropico, why? - because the very short term tear gassing the malcontent populace works, but long term people will be more dissatisfied, you will garner more international media attention. Is it *really* worth it, in your honest opinion, does the government lose much? I would have opened talks with the protesters and tried to reach an agreement. I would not have pretended I was going to open talks and then send police to attack them, you only lose credibility doing that and making people more irritated. People would be occupying nothing at all if they were satisfied. In Tropico, people complain of pollution, so edict for pollution laws and more trees, housing - build more houses. In real life things don't happen as fast, but they do happen if there is a will and time.\n\n3.  \"And in a letter written in May 1984, then Premier Zhao Ziyang promised university students in Hong Kong that protecting the people's democratic rights was a basic principle of the government.\" - [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29454385) That is the dude that was put under house arrest because the Beijing government are a bunch of .... Okay, so let's be really really  conservative and claim that after the hand over China only has to maintain what HK is, right? So they don't have to change anything, but then why would officials promise it soon? There have been many statements promising democracy for Hong Kong soon, not in thirty or forty years.\nAlso, the statement of all candidates must be loyal to the central government itself is not actually anything to do with the formation of democracy, but counter to it.\nLet's say central government in the U.S wanted to turn Texas into a giant landfill. The people in Texas have the right to vote in local representatives, right? Good. So the people plan to vote in people that will be against this project obviously. The central government says then that any person who wishes to stand for election must be loyal to the central government and tow the party line. Does that sound like democracy to you in your *objective* opinion, honestly, does it?\n\n4. Stop stealing my words, guy. I patented those. \nI never attended law school, that is another one of your claims, I said  studied law, I did that at college while studying business and computing before going to university. I do not purport to be a legal expect, I referenced me studying law to tell you about reasonable force and what is usually regarded as reasonable justification.\nActually, not wearing a seat belt is quite dangerous, if you crash and go flying through the windscreen, you increase the chances of killing somebody else as a human cannonball, likewise crossing the road and forcing people to stop their cars suddenly can cause car accidents and deaths. You are right! The comparisons are not too related, since crossing the road can cause deaths whereas the occupy the roads has caused none at all - I guess the latter is not such a big deal huh?\nWhat do you mean finally? Are you confusing me with one of the various other people that are arguing with you? I never denied it, crap, I do illegal stuff all the time, so do you, I know a barrister that does too LOL.\nYou seem awfully hung up on the roads issue, what car do you drive? Can I have a picture?\n\nWho says I am taking it personally? I see pixels on my screen. I like pixels, they make cool shapes. You mean because I am debating with you? I have debated stuff I don't even believe in with people before, but I vehemently believe that the people should have the ability to decide their future - what point is there is a community where you do not influence the future of the community?\n\nIf you believe I can't *see* past anything I want to see, that is your judgement. Fyi, I might be fully capable of *seeing*, but still hold strong opinions because I am not sitting on the fence like Switzerland. Yes, blah blah, police have tough jobs, they signed up for it so they can deal with it I can already see through their eyes. Yes, blah blah the government has difficulties controlling the people, so the easiest option is to let the people vote and they will calm down and go home, no? Do you know why they will not let that happen? The same reason every protest in china has been cracked down on, China does not want power being taken away from the government, power is money my friend, even you can not deny this. You start allowing HK people to vote and stuff, mainlanders will demand it, You know this point is true. Thus they will just push democracy to the sidelines until HK has been flooded with mainlanders (loyal to the central government, does not help low birth rate in HK due to 10 weeks maternity leave LOL, so low....apparent vibrant economy, crap working benefits). It is not in China's interest to give the people democracy and I feel sad for the Chinese people having to endure such a selfish government; I blame Russia for putting them in power.\n\nSame to you dude, I bare no ill will to you for having a differing opinion btw.

{"body": "You've got a couple flaws in your argument:\n\n1) The first is that atheism and theism are opposites and you must be one or the other. Well, this is the age of the Theistic Atheist. Typically this occurs when Theists reject the traditional concept of deities and embrace them as archetypes which are fundamental to the human experience. To the Theistic Atheist these archetypes have a powerful impact on the human mind and experience. As such the way they treat these archetypes is often indistinguishable from the way their purely Theistic counter parts threat their deities.\n\n2) \"I don't know\" is most certainly a valid response to \"Do you believe in X?\". There is no requirement for everyone to have an opinion on everything. It is possible that someone hasn't thought about something to say that they don't know what they believe, or that someone has thought about something and can't (or decides it is best to not to) come to a decision about what they believe.\n\n3) There are a number of problems with your whole 'level of confidence' thing but a couple things stand out. The first is that this is not how philosophy works. This may be great for discussing things scientifically, but the moment you start discussing religion as philosophy your 'levels of confidence' become meaningless. While weak agnosticism (we don't know) could be considered a scientific position, strong agnosticism (we can't know) is most certainly a philosophical position.\n\nThe second thing is, how the heck is the average person supposed to judge their 'level of confidence'? We talk about 'belief' and 'knowledge' so generally because most people don't have the tools, or the time, to make an accurate judgement on their 'level of confidence' on any given subject.\n\n4) The rational person's default position to anything should be \"I don't know\" rather than 'belief' or 'disbelief'. If your automatic position is disbelief (as you say should be the default position applied to everything) that may lead someone to act in a way that might put them in real danger. My brother had a buddy that went camping in an area where bears hadn't been seen in 20 years. So he didn't bother to secure his food. Long story short, there was a bear and he ended up walking three days back to civilization with only a litre of water.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that belief or disbelief in a deity is as simple, or as dangerous as bear or no bear. But there is a reason 'I don't know' is not only a valid but useful position, it would have saved my brother's friend from going three days without food. Not to mention all scientific discoveries, like, say flight, where people like the Wright Brothers shunned the disbelief for \"I don't know\". Disbelief can be just as crippling as \"God did it\", when it comes to scientific discovery.\n\nAnd finally, you're telling me your brain didn't spend a few cycles of RAM on Leprechauns, pixies, fairies, the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot, unicorns, ect.?  Because I did. Heck I believed in unicorns for longer than I was Christian. Bigfoot lives in the extremely unlikely, but I wouldn't be completely shocked box.\n\nSo, in fact my default start point of your list of crazy creatures was, in fact, \"I don't know\", I even researched the origins of the myths of some of them. The FSM and Tea Pot or your pink penguin, not so much. But I know where the these three ideas came from. To say, when considering the beliefs of individuals, that there is no difference between a creature made up for someone's slippery slope argument, and something that has been part of myth and culture for centuries or millennia is ignorant. People really need to stop using that argument, it is the Pascal's Wager of Atheism. It presents a false dichotomy where one answer is clearly meant to seem more reasonable than the other. In Pascal's Wager, thousands of other faiths and deities are ignored. And in Atheism's version of the wager the entire spectrum of greys between belief and disbelief are ignored, as well as the fact that a lot of people actually have pondered whether or not your crazy creatures were something to be believed in or not.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413652726", "subreddit": "agnostic", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Deontological ethics are \"rule-based\" or \"duty-based\" ethics, where the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by the action's adherence to a set of rules.\n\nWhether an action is right or wrong in and of itself is generally called moral realism.\n\nDeontologists are sometimes moral realists because they often claim that their rules follow some objective morality. This isn't always true. It quite often isn't the case, and I agree the assumption that deontologists are necessarily moral realists is silly, and it is common round these here parts.\n\nQuite a lot of the \"egoists\" make this equivocation incessantly. As if I can't be an egoist, a moral nihilist, and affirm private property ethics at the same time.

Taken by photographer Burk Uzzle capturing Nick and Bobbi Ercoline in embrace. Here is the story of Nick and Bobbi [40 years later](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/woodstock-concert-undercover-lovers-nick-bobbi-ercoline-40-years-summer-love-article-1.430404) and current [photo](http://imgur.com/Qq2isJs) of them.\n\n* \"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\", February 23rd, 1945, by Joe Rosenthal of 5 Marines and 1 US Corpsman raising the flag on Mt.

President Truman holding the inaccurate front page of the Chicago Tribune on November 3, 1948 after his victory in the 1948 Presidential Election where he beat Republican candidate Governor Thomas Dewey of New York.

An obese young man emerged claiming he was one a one hundred eighty pound nutritionist, the shady kid with the hemp jacket came out with years of knowledge of amsterdam's nightlife. The peeking girl from earlier came out describing her beautiful house and three children, glancing side-eyed once or twice at the gentleman in the flannel. He, of course, turned out to be a quarterback in the NFL.  \n  \nThere were a few hiccups, of course. Some kids had to go in the device two or three times with admonishments to concentrate on their goal. Some ended up with personalities different than they listed, and one came out screaming he was the loch ness monster and demanding three dollars and fifty cents. For each, the researchers interrupted from time to time asking pointed questions about the person's physical sensations and experience inside the active machine.  \n  \nEveryone was too distracted to notice the young man keeping to himself, scribbling in his notebook and staring at the device, his lips moving silently. He was near the back of the line so no one noticed except the energetic latin gentleman behind him who have to give him a prod once or twice to keep him moving when he got distracted. Altering between studying everything about the study and silent, intense concentration, his behaviour earned a few concerned glances from the other students but nothing more, until it was his turn. He silently filled out his line of the form and stepped into the machine hastily.  \n  \nThe Director glanced down at his entry and paused. \"Inventor. Hmmm. Hey,\" He motioned for one of the researchers to step over. \"Get a camera running. This one might be valuable for more than research.\"  \nThat done, he stepped to the machine, and entered the listed age on the keypad, glancing to his fellow taping as the machine powered up, then down again. Before he had a chance to approach the door, it snapped open, the young man hopping out briskly.  \n  \nHe turned and, instead of addressing the hushed volunteers or the waiting researchers, began to...look the device over. \"Yes...yes...I think I've got it.\" He wheeled on the researchers. \"*Paper! And a pencil!*\" As they were too stunned to react, he darted forward, ripping the clipboard out of the Director's hands and flipping the sheet over, scribbling briskly on the reverse.  \n  \n\"What are you doing? Aren't you going to tell us about your inventions?\" The Director prompted.  \n  \n\"Fraid not, old chap. I decided to be a little more specific with my ideal, and went with 'guy who finally perfected this machine'.\" The student answered as he scribbled away distractedly. Of course, once he absently let that slip, his scribbliing didn't last for long. The entire group of researchers suddenly pressed on him, bombarding his with questions left and right.\n    \n\"Wait...stop, I have to...no, hold on!\" He tried to scribble a few more lines of what looked like physics equations, but it was impossible withthe researchers cawing for his attention. Meanwhile, the Director was pulling at the huddled scientists, yelling, \"Stop! Back up!\" Finally, the crowd dispersed, and the man stood there, reading his hasty notes.  \n  \nThe Director stepped up. \"I just need you to answer one question, as quickly and simply as you can...how does the device work?\"  \n  \nThe volunteer looked up at him with a sad look.  \n\"I dont know anymore.\"  \n  \nThe researchers dispersed, with varying murmurs of regret and disappointment. The Director, crestfallen, motioned for the young man to go.  \n  \nAs he passed by the other students, regarding him with a sort of silent awe, he was heard muttering to himself. \"Radiative alpha wavepackets?

{"body": "Oct. 10th 2014\nI haven't seen them since the summer after I graduated high school. \nAt first you miss it. You miss them. Everything is so.... Dull. Literally.\nVibrant reds, deep blues, majestic purples... At this point in my life they are only faint memories. Just like everything else about her.\nSome nights when I lay in bed and close my eyes I can almost see them. The colors. The way her golden hair cascaded down her shoulders. The way her shockingly blue eyes glimmered in the moonlight. The way her peach coloured skin would glow in the sunshine.\nAt first it took some getting used to. The grayscale. It doesn't come all at once though. The day she left me is when it started to dull out. First I couldn't see reds. Then I lost sight of the yellows, which really confirmed she was gone, when I stopped seeing sunlight. Next greens started to slip away from me, no more trees, no more grass. The last color to go was blue, which is ironic because I always viewed it as the saddest of the colors. \nThen one morning you wake up and everything is gray and black.\nThree years have passed since she left. Part of me still misses her, but more than that I miss seeing in color. \nI see happy people walking down the street together, holding hands, and I get mad because I wish I could still see the world the way they did. I wish I could see the sun shimmering through the leaves again. I wish I could watch the ocean and not just see an endless sea of black. I wish I could see the orange glow of a candle, or the pink and purple hues of a sunset, or even the color of the shirt I'm wearing, which I assume is blue, but I can't really remember what the tag said before I pulled  it off.\n\nOct. 19th 2014\nI met someone yesterday. I was walking out of my science lab when I saw her. She was sitting on a bench on the way to the library reading The Great Gatsby, which happens to be my favorite book. She was alone, which is surprising for a girl as shockingly pretty as she is, especially at a college like ours, crawling with muscular guys eager to jump anyone's bones at a moments notice.\nAny other time I would have walked right by, allowing my eyes to stop and take a glance but not allowing myself to take a risk and say anything. But there was something strangely alluring about this girl. Maybe it was the way she chewed on her bottom lip as she read. Maybe it was the way she tapped her foot to the Arctic Monkeys song she was humming. It might have even been the worn in look of her copy of The Great Gatsby, the dog eared pages, the flimsiness of the paper back spine, the way she had outlined the faded cover art with a sharpie. \nWhatever it was that had me so instantly infatuated pulled me to the bench like a magnet. I stopped about three steps away.\nI started, \"So we beat on, boats against the current...\"\n\"Borne back ceaselessly into the past,\" she replied without missing a beat. \"I'm Sarah,\" she told me with a big smile. \n\"Steven, mind if I take a seat?\"\n\nWe sat on the bench talking for what must have been three hours. I learned that she had read the Great Gatsby exactly 8 times, that she grew up in Palo Alto, that her favorite movie was E.T., and that she had an irrational fear of lake monsters like Nessie. It was getting dark when I finally walked her to her dorm. I held her hand. I had almost forgotten what it felt like to feel someone's fingers between my own.\nShe invited me in to her room. We drank tea and watched Our Neighbor Totoro in her bed, then we talked about our favorite soccer players and our hometowns and told stories about our best friends.\nThen we kissed.\nWe fell asleep listening The Strokes as we stole kisses from eachother.\n\nThis morning I learned that she has chestnut brown hair and that her eyes are the brightest color of green.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413788024", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There was this time when I was little, probably about 4 years old, where me and my brother were playing with a soccer ball in the living room. We we're having a lot of fun and bonding together. It was truly a nostalgic moment in my childhood, because it was a time where me and him weren't bickering or being mean to one another, but rather just having fun. Anyways, we were tossing the ball back and forth, and we decided to try to play our little version of dodge ball. We weren't very good at dodging the ball, but it was super fun to us because we couldn't anticipate when the other was going to throw the ball. So one of us is about to the throw ball, I can't remember if it was me or my brother, but the ball was thrown and it hits the painting on our mantle and it comes toppling down with an unlit candle landing on top. It only slightly dented the painting, but the fire was burning hot at our foreheads because we knew we were going to get in big trouble. Sure enough, mom and dad come marching in and see what happened. It was one of those moments where you just want to puke from the guilt. All in all though, we were told we'd have to collect money to pay them for the painting, mostly with money we would get from grandparents. We didn't have to pay a lot back, but it felt like a lot as a little kid.\n\nFast forward as the weeks go by, we were collecting change and dollars that we got, and then we would put whatever we had into this Clifford the Big Red Dog bank. Our mom would carry it around with her in her purse, so when we found a quarter on the ground or something we would put it in there. We were suppose to collect $25, but me and my brother tried to wait it out hoping our mom would forget. Probably as much as a month and a half later, our mom came into our room (we still shared a room at this point because I would get nightmares) and she said she thought it was about time that we counted the money. Again, the fire on our foreheads was burning hot because we knew that there was no way we had the full $25. She opened the bank, and it looked like there was a lot more money in there than it was so we naturally hoped she wouldn't finish counting. She still counted it in front of us. As me and my brother sat there, we were on the verge of tears because we knew she was almost done. She finished, gave of us the bank back, and smiled. She left the room and brought back this huge plate of oreos with peanut buttter spread on the cream filling (our favorite). We were so happy and right as I began to take a cookie, so threw the plate at us. By the time we brush the oreo crumbs from our eyes we already knew what had happened.

{"body": "This happened a few years ago so some parts are fuzzy. I grew up in a pretty big city in the Midwest. My parents were immigrants and they had come to the States to basically free themselves from civil war in El Salvador. It seemed like a lot of the violence they saw in their home county was there in this new city. I grew up in a very poor neighborhood and there were constantly people being shot, lots of drugs going around. In elementary school I remember a kid bringing in a gun he had taken from his brother, showing it off to us. In middle school I met this kid, Joseph. Now Joseph was a crazy fucking kid. He ran with the gangbangers, his whole family was big in the gangs. The teachers knew, students knew. Anyhow, no one fucked with him because of who his family was. I met him in English class, we were partnered up for a book report. He was a pretty smart dude and loved reading. He actually finished the book before I did so he ended up telling me what all to write for our report. We ended up becoming pretty good friends. Even though my own parents hated seeing me with him and people like him, I hung out with Joseph all the time. Before school, during school, after school. Again, the kid was fucking brilliant. Aside from reading he was great at math and helped me with different things. Our first year of high school he ended up losing both his brothers and his mother in a gang related attack. He was never the same after this. He stopped reading and skipped classes, began failing everything and using drugs heavily. Being the young idiot  I was, I ended up using with him. His problems became mine and before I knew it I had a full blown addiction to meth. Joseph dropped out of school his junior year and was on the streets. \n\nOne day I was heading home and ran into him. We chatted for a while, haven't seen each other for a few weeks since he was not in school anymore. Got a bit caught up and went back to his place to get high. Turns out his dad left after his wife and kids were killed. Joseph was making money by selling drugs and doing whatever his gang wanted. This routine went on for a few months. School, Jospeh's, get high, go home, repeat. After some time we became more and more customer/supplier kinda relationship, not friends. Began paying more for the drugs I wanted and Joseph was more and more isolated among the gang. He was a little soldier for them at this point. He was involved in a shooting at a nearby neighborhood and police were looking for him and a few others, turns out they had shot and killed some guys over drug money. \n\nI still liked to think of Joseph a my friend, so I got a bit selfish and fronted when it was time to pay for drugs. He let it go initially but began asking more and more for money. I knew he had shot other people over drugs but I didn't think I'd ever be in his line of fire. One night I'm walking from a friend's house and I hear tires squealing behind me. This old shitty car zooms up and all I see are guns pointed at me. I froze with fear, my stomach fell and I couldn't even make a sound. One of the guys yelled to get in the car. My body moved on its own and I found myself in the back of the car with about 4 other guys, guns pointed at me. We pull up to a familiar house, Joseph's. I'm wracking my mind trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. We get inside Joseph is waiting in the living room and these guys start kicking and punching me. I've never felt such pain before in my life and it finally hit me that all my time with Joseph was a bad decision. I'm on the floor, bleeding and my arm is completely broken and fucked up. Joseph comes up to me and tells me that this is what I get for not paying him the money I owed. I lose it at this point, I fucking cry. I think about my mom and dad, and all the struggles they went through to see me succeed only to have me die as a fucking junkie. That's what hurt me the most. I finally get the courage and ask him to please let me go and that I'll pay him back. I ask him how much money I owed him and he pulls out a slip of paper. He looked at it then looked at me before saying, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\". That's when I looked up and realized Joseph was a 500 foot tall monster from the Paleozoic era. I couldn't believe it, I felt disgusted and betrayed. \n\nAll of those years thinking I knew him only for things to come to this. I got the fuck out of the house and never saw him again.\n\n**tl;dr Grew up in shitty neighborhood, became friends with gangbanger, didn't pay him drug money and almost was killed by him.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413870846", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I went on this longboarding trip yesterday. On my travels, I found this neighborhood that climbed its way up a hill, so naturally I went up it and planned to go down it. it was a climb, but I finally made it up to the top. Now, this was a nice new neighborhood. Nice grass, green trees, and a freshly paved road! And at the top of the hill, it had 1 central road, each going in one direction down the hill on either side. The side of the hill I climbed would be so easy and fun to bomb, hardy any traffic because it was a new neighborhood, and the bottom just evened out straight so I could coast to a stop. \n\nWell I decided I'd go down the opposite side from the one I came up. This was because it was getting too late in the day, and needed time to get home before the sun set, so I figured I could bomb the one hill on the opposite side from the one I climbed up, climb back up, then go down the hill side I originally came up on for going home as a nice cool down on my way back. I was kind of nervous though for the opposite side of the hill because it curved slightly and couldn't quite see ahead. But I saw it straightened out at the bottom so I went for it. That was a MISTAKE! This side of the hill was a lot steeper than I expected and I was picking up speed fast! As I was going around the curve I noticed something, SPEED BUMPS! Who the f### puts speed bumps on a downhill?! And why didn't the other side have any?! \n\nNow might be a good time to mention that I have no idea how to slide either, so I couldn't slow myself down. And by this time I'm already going too fast for my own good, so if I jump off, I'd get seriously hurt. So I stayed on my board. On my way towards the speed bumps, I noticed that they had a narrow flat spot on the sides near the sidewalk [like this](http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/file/view/speed_hump-saraota-markings.jpg/130402835/speed_hump-saraota-markings.jpg), except the speed bump was higher and there was no grass on the side. Luckily for me, everyone parked in their driveways here and there were no cars on the street. So as I neared the speed bump, I moved my way close to the edge of the sidewalk, making sure my wheels don't touch the sides of the concrete. I'm going really fast now, as I get closer, my chest tightens up. I make it through! Thank God! But of course that wasn't the end of it, of course theirs more speed bumps! And again, who the f### puts speed bumps on a downhill? But luckily I make it through that one as well. Now for a short while there seems to be no more, and now I'm going really fast! But then, you guessed it! I see another one. I'm going so fast now, the gap between the bump was looking even smaller now. Then something happened, I felt it work it's way up through my feet. SPEED WOBBLES! Oh, of all the times why now?! I try to get control of it as best I could while aiming for the gap. As I get closer, I manage to get a little more control of the board and manage to go through the gap! I can't believe my luck at this point. I'm still getting some wobbles, but they are controllable. After this I could see the hill curve slightly but with no bumps in site at least. I could see the hill ending and starting to flatten out. I was almost out of this neighborhood! But I wasn't out yet. As I get towards the end of the neighborhood, I was still going fast! At this point I'd say 35 mph. And when I make my way around the final curve I see it, it wasn't a speed bump, It was a \"T\" intersection with a cast iron fence wall for a golf course at the bottom. And as you might remember, I don't know how to slide so I can't slow myself down. And my wheels are big and flat so they are impossible to slide. Now I'm really screwed, I'm seriously thinking about what everyone is going to think when they find I'm dead, My family and girlfriend will be devastated. People on r/longboarding are going to find my article and use me as an example of what not to do. I prepared for death.\n\nBut then I noticed another thing on the road, there were leaves. Now this may seem unimportant, but I remember riding through some leaves once and made it very easy to slide while riding over them. I suddenly get the urge to fight this. I'm not going to die. I'm going to live! So as I near closer to the cast iron fence and am riding over the leaves, I swing my body as hard as I can and manage to actually turn the board sideways! I was slowing down! I start to lose my balance however and start to fall backwards. My hand catches my fall, I can feel the road eat away at the flesh on my hand. But I was more concerned about the fence. I was still going too fast! As I get closer and closer to the gate, I hear something. It was a loud ringing noise. I'm still probably going 25 mph and I swear I feel the bone carving away at my hand. I knew it was too late, I WAS going to die. Then I hear the ringing again. I close my eyes then open them. My girlfriend is calling me. I answer and tell her about the dream I just had. \n\n:)\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n-edit: alternate version: \nAs I got closer and closer to the gate, I hear something. It was a loud noise. I'm still probably going 25 mph and I swear I feel the bone carving away at my hand. I knew it was too late, I WAS going to die. Then I hear the the noise again. I close my eyes, but now I can hear and see nothing. Am I dead? The silence is broken again by the same noise. My girlfriend is to calling me. I hear a beeping noise from a heart monitor in the background. I hear my girlfriends voice again, but this time a whisper. She was saying something to me. But I couldn't understand her. I then wake up in the hospital. My love was sitting by me. I ask her what happened. She looks sad but grateful I'm awake. She tells me they found me screaming for help on the side of the road. My body was in agony. She tried not to cry while looking down at my body. I asked her what was wrong. She says they had to remove my legs and part of my arm. Apparently when they found me, my legs were \"wrapped\" around the fence and they had to perform emergency surgery. My heart sinks. How could I have been so f###ing stupid. I'm crippled now, my longboarding days are over. I'll have to be in a wheelchair now for the rest of my life. I ask her how much of my legs did I lose while trying not to cry. I would have looked myself but couldn't move due to the extreme pain I was in. She started to cry. I asked her again, how much of my legs did I lose? She looked up slowly and said that I lost about tree fiddy of my legs. I knew then this was the worst story of my life. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413917818", "subreddit": "longboarding", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I apologize in advance for the wall of text.\n\nI started looking into internet dating after my 4th failed serious relationship.  I've been around the block a few times, but at this point I'm just looking to hook up.  Not the type of guy to rebound and try internet dating, but a couple of my buddies of had a lot of success, and I *need* a rebound.  Soooo &lt;insert popular dating app&gt;, here I am. Set up profile sit back, play some vidja games.\n\n\nA few weeks go by.  I get a couple messages from some randos... cute, but no thanks.  I don't know what I'm saving myself for, but I wait for some reason.  Then I get to talking to this one girl... she noticed that I put \"Princess Bride\" under fav movies in my profile, and she's a huge fan.  Bingo!\n\n\n&gt; *SIDENOTE: Hey, if you don't like The Princess Bride, fuck you.  That shit is a masterpiece.* \n\n\nAnywho, one thing leads to another, and I ask her for a pic.  Nothing crazy, I just want to see what she looks like ([Can she fit in a rowboat?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SricpmKQd3U)) ([Not that there's anything wrong with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj3VphK9AMk), just not my cup of tea.)  Well, she sends one and... holy shit.  8.5, 9/10 easy.  I'm kind of funny, can hold my own in a conversation, been hitting the gym lately... about a 7/10.  Looking like I hit the goldmine.  I send her a pic back, compliments are flying every which way, and we agree to go out for coffee.\n\n\nFAST FORWARD: Date night.  I'm nervous.  Originally I just wanted to hook up with a chick, but this girl is really, really cool.  I don't want to screw this up.  I take a look in the mirror: looking as fresh as can be for a coffee date, I have pants on, good to go.  I head out.\n\n\nWell we meet up and I can already tell I'm falling for this girl.  Insane right?  But I figure I've been here before.  I'm no stranger to love.  So besides the usual date random thoughts (Is there something stuck in my teeth?) I just play it cool.  We start talking about movies, and of course Princess Bride comes up, and we sort of start talking about True Love (a major theme in the book and movie).  Well, this of course, leads to us talking about exes, and here's where things get interesting.\n\n\nTurns out her ex is a grade A BITCH.  In a scene straight out of How I Met Your Mother, she admits to me that she was actually engaged... but he got cold feet and took off.  He lied to her about being late to the reception, gave her the run around, then just... never... showed... up.\n\n\nWell by the time she finished the whole story, she's in tears, and I *feel* for her.  I understand what it's feels like to never be appreciated, to invest so much time and effort into a relationship, only to watch it all fall apart and crumble.  It hurts man, it fucking hurts.  So without even thinking about what I was doing, I slide over to her side of the table, put my arms around her and just hug her for a minute while she cries.  Then I whispered into her ear:\n\nWe're no strangers to love.  You know the rules and so do I...A full commitment's what I'm thinking of.  You wouldn't get this from any other guy. I just... wanna tell you how I'm feeling. Gotta make you understand.\n\nNever gonna give you up  \nNever gonna let you down  \nNever gonna run around and desert you  \nNever gonna make you cry  \nNever gonna say goodbye  \nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\"  \n\n\nJust then the barista wanders over and decides to interrupt us at that very moment.\n\n\"Sir, I think you forgot to pay for your drink.\"  \nClearly, this was terrible timing.  I gave her my best stare down, but she just stood there looking bored.   \n\"Fine, how much do I owe you.\"  \n\"Well just the tea and the cookie comes to $3.49.\"  \nI rolled my eyes, with no intention to pay because I was in the MIDDLE OF SOMETHING, so I told her something to get her to back off.  \n\"Ok, I'll be over there in just a minute.\"  \n\"Sir, I'm going to have to insist.\"  \nWas this chick for real?  I have a girl literally crying on my shoulder, and she's pulling these shenanigans. People are starting to stare now.  \n\"Sir...\"  \nFinally, I've had it.  I snap.  \n\"God Dammit woman, I AIN'T GONNA GIVE YOU NO TREE FIDDY.\"  \n\n\nShe storms off. \n\n\nI go home and floss.  \n\n\nAnd masturbate.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413927218", "subreddit": "tifu", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, I was walking down the street when I came across this beggar.  This man was in his early 40s.  Recently out on the street.  Said he needed some money to turn his life around.  I as a curious person decided to ask him what caused this to happen.  He responded that his wife left him, took alimony, he lost his job because she decided to accuse him of rape, and that he picked up drinking.  I knew none of this was true though.  He looked like he was strung out on something else.  He even had some piercings in his arm.  I felt for this guy though.  Drugs are a serious problem.  I asked what I could do to get rid of his addiction.  He told me just two easy payments of $1.75 I could help him.  This is when he started sounding like some kind of T.V. commercial.  I asked him if he ever did voice acting or was on T.V.  He told me he was the guy who did all the medicine commercials.  Seems legitimate to me.  He says he needs cocaine to do the fast talking though.  I told him I wouldn't help him get drugs but would donate if he promised to get his life on track.  He said he would try but he would need about tree fiddy.  That is when I realized I was talking to that no good god damned Loch Ness monster!  I said listen here monsta!

{"body": "Reminds me about one of the worst days of my life.\n\nI was an only child growing up in rural kentucky, and after my parents divorced when I was only 6 I lived a fragmented, lonely life. Weeks at my dad's house were filled with lots of ranch work, because dad was really far behind on the mortgage and couldn't afford to hire on more help. I didn't too much like weekends at my mom's house because she was working two jobs, both as a server, so she could make ends meet.\n\nThere was a horse at my dad's ranch that we called 'Sage' because she had a beautiful gray coat that, in the correct light, could be percepted as a beautiful shade of her namesake. I said before that I lived a very lonely life, so when Dad unloaded Sage from the trailer that first time and she nuzzled at my hand I knew I had found my first friend.\n\nBetween feeding the animals and moving logs, I would always steal away to the stables or pen to spend a few minutes with Sage. We would play a game where she mimicked my actions; if I ran around the yard, she would follow and match my pace. A few quick head bobs, and she would return in kind. My favorite trick was to jump up in the air and watch as Sage reared her legs like a fierce stallion.\n\nMy childhood came to a shattering crash one October morning when I woke to the sound of a shotgun and dogs barking. I bolted upright in bed and yelled out for my dad, and when he didn't respond I tenuously crept from my bed and shuffled my way through the house, clutching my own self tightly.\n\nThats when the world around me flooded in and I heard a sound that made my stomach turn - the pained, agony filled cries of a mare and the verbose, damning curses of my dad. Disregarding shoes, the cold weather, and the possibility of imminent danger, I ran outside into the cresting sun.\n\nMy body was immediately wracked with dread. My father stood there in the stables. Doors flung wide. Buckets, rakes, and shovels were scattered. And blood. Blood everywhere. A coyote lay in the yard, riddled with buckshot.  That wasn't all. I knew it. I could sense it.\n\nAs I crept up to the stable doors, I caught a glimpse of Sage laying on the ground and I broke into a sprint for the last 12 feet. Dad turned, with a tear welling in his eye, and held up his hand, motioning for me to stay back. I ran past dad, dropped to my knees, and began sobbing harder than I've ever sobbed in my life. I lifted Sage's heavy head in my hands, and her limp neck poured blood from a fresh, warm gash torn by a hungry coyote. Between sobs, cursing the world for all its evils, and refusing to believe my only friend in the world could possibly die, I turned to my dad and begged him, implored him, demanded of him *How? How can this happen?*\n\nMy father took a knee beside me, slid a hand over my shoulder, and brought my head into his chest. He kissed the top of my head, squeezed me tight, and whispered, \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413987358", "subreddit": "funny", "score": -22, "controversiality": 0}

(again with the unimpressive money spending) I had like half a toke and he finishes the bowl, we kiss for a bit and I'm like alright, I can do kissing. but then he wants to take a shower with me, so I doge out into the room and ask about videogames. weren't we going to play videogames?\n\nso he follows me, but he's obviously too stoned for mario golf so he asks me to pick a movie and I choose Life of Brian because it's a good movie I hadn't seen in a while. So we chill on the couch and he proceeds to try and basically steal second base and imply that hey, he lives in a studio, and his bed is Right There, I mean we could go over there and be comfortable. I played dumb \"but then we couldn't see the movie\" I said and he huffed and went back to tit-squeezing.\n\nthe groping would have been almost ok, but he for whatever reason decided that instead of the classic up and under, to instead go down the neck of my T-shirt. so he's kinda choking me in addition to pinching my nipple in the mistaken impression that this is turning me on. so I tell him to stop. and he gets all huffy. \n\nbut he stops, so we go back to watching the movie. and the he tries it again. down the neck of the shirt and everything. \n\nthis happens a couple of times. so then I stand up. I say something like \"I think I should  home now\" as soon as I get up he bursts into these blubbery awful tears and he's trying to tell me something about how it's been so long and could I just stay? it's raining, he'd totally drive me! and did I have about tree fiddy? so about that time I realized he was about five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era, so I smile weakly tell him \"I've had a lovely time but I really must get going\" -cue more and stronger crying- exunt pencilears. \n\nI walked home in the rain, called my sister as I did so in case he followed me, and took what amounts to basically a rape shower to wash the feel of his hands off me. \n\nI've been thinking about it today because I just got back last night from a second date with a guy who seemed like he was mad at me and decided against a third date for my \"not being much of a risk-taker\" and I assume it's because I didn't want to go back to his apartment after our first date. \n\nif you're reading this Drew, and I know you're a redditor. then now you know why I'm a little wary of being fucking *date raped*. the only thing that saved me in the above story is that he got himself too high to restrain me effectively. had he wanted too, he could have wrecked me.

I feel that with today's improved effects, a lot of the sight gags such as the trees made of letters and The Doctor trying (and failing) to reconstruct Jamie's face would be even more fun and ridiculous.

My mind's eye sees a cross between a Twilight Zone episode (something like *Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?*) and *Midnight*, with a bit of John Carpenter's *The Thing*, or *Invasion of the Bodysnatchers*. The Doctor and the companion find themselves in a remote Scottish mansion, because reasons (maybe 12 feels more at home in the Highlands?). A disappearance occurs, and the Doctor begins investigating foul play, but then the guest returns - but not quite as he left. Everyone is quick to dismiss it, he has a pretty good alibi, but the Doctor can tell something is wrong. He begins poking around the mansion, and as he does more and more start to become...different. He discovers a crashed Zygon ship nearby, and the unconscious bodies of the converted inside. I think with a storytelling style similar to *Midnight* and without all the Loch Ness Monster shenanigans, it could be quite the thriller.

{"body": "I was a psychology teacher for the IB program in a rough school. There were gang-related incidents almost every week, drugs everywhere, kids bringing guns to school etc...\n\nWe were going through some recent budget cuts so the sociology teacher was laid off, and I was tasked with taking on the responsibilities of two class rooms, which was stressful to say the least. On the first day of class the room had 45 students, all of them were pretty well adjusted kids (keep in mind that this was the IB class, so these were kids that more or less took their education seriously). But there was this one kid, Mateo, who was... a problem. The kid had *real* intelligence, but one hour with this guy and you'd realize there were some *real* problems with him. \n\nMateo would never look you in the eye, was prone to extremely loud outbursts and had a checkered past with sporadic violent episodes in the school. He was alienated, abused and chastised by his peers. After lecture one day Mateo came up and asked if I could be the one to write a letter of recommendation for his college application. I said I would, and for what ever reason took it upon myself to try to get to this kid. \n\nI started asking simple questions, nothing too prodding, and he deflected them with dead-end answers that got me no where. I got a little too frustrated with this and stopped the bullshit small talk and straight-up asked him \"Mateo, is everything alright?\"\n\nI knew I was gonna get a reaction from him the moment I asked him it, I just didn't expect the reaction I got. At first he became extremely defensive, started swearing loudly, raising his pitch, but never looking at me directly, always directing his words to the white board behind me. As he rambled what he said got more and more personal. He started confessing things like how he didn't have it great, that everyday life was a struggle. Then it got *real,* fast. \n\nHe admitted that he had been homeless for TWO YEARS, that he was constantly hungry, that his mom had thrown him out because he had behavioral issues. It became more and more obvious to me that Mateo was suffering from a severe bipolar condition. \n\nHe stormed out of my classroom and I didn't see him again for a month. Then he shows up one day with wrapping around his left wrist. In the staff lounge it was rumored that he had sliced his wrist upward-that's vertically- which is what people do when they really want to die. I was overwhelmed with the thought that it could have been me that caused this, that it was *my* irresponsibility that made this happen. \n\nI should have left well enough alone, but I had to make amends, outside the classroom. I looked through his records and found out his temporary home was a ward for underprivileged children. I found him there, pleaded my case, but he just sat there and wouldn't look me in the eye. \n\nWhat happened next is the reason I said I *was* a teacher, and am not currently a teacher. I grabbed him by the shoulders (big no-no) looked him in the eyes as best i could and said \"Mateo, I can help you, but you have to help yourself. What is it you fucking want?\"\n\nHe threw me away, stood up very frantically and screamed at me: \"I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414029731", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 289, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh really? So tell me, what's up with Uganda?\n\nI'll tell you what's up with Uganda: A Christian Charity linked to the US government is sending missionaries to promote and support a bill that would see not only gay and lesbian people executed but see anyone who doesn't actively hate them executed as well. The bill has been shot down various times not because of the bill's content, but because it could mean a cut in foreign aid to the country. Despite this, this bill is still trying to be passed and it is only a matter of time until it does. *That is Christian Extremism and it has been constantly ignored and downplayed*.\n\nAnd it's not just in Uganda, Killings and corrective rapes in South Africa are motivated by Christian Doctrine. In Russia, the \"Gay Propaganda\" bill was motivated by religion along with the anti-gay violence which is not only seeing the Police raid the homes of gay people but alongside them Lynch raid gay bars and hunt gay men down, often raping them with bottles, taking humiliating photos of them and killing them. They aren't doing that \"because homophobia\", their homophobia is motivated chiefly by Christian Doctrine. Neo Nazi groups, as part of their ideology straight from the Nazi party itself is motivated by Christianity, no matter how much people want to deny it. Christianity is as much a part of the national front, the BNP and Anders Brevik as Islam is in Al Qaeda.\n\nBut those are the most extreme cases. You see, Christianity has learnt something Islam hasn't: PR. Seriously. They know if they lay low, gain the ~~trust~~ love of the general public and make common cause with certain groups and parties they can force a soft theocracy upon their host countries. A nice little example is America. Personhood laws were having a miscarriage can land you in court have been passed. Sexual health clinics have been forced to shut by state laws, misinformation on sexual health has replaced scientific fact to manipulate young girls to have children early, missing out on education that could allow them to earn more money. State funded \"intelligent design\" courses in High Schools, one declaring the Loch Ness Monster exists, are common. Organisations promoting Christian pseudoscience receive millions in state funds while Multi-million dollar projects have been cancelled because they weren't going to \"prove God\". If this was Islam we would, quite rightly, be marching in the streets, declaring this to be theocracy writ large. But we don't. we ignore it, we play it down, we pretend it's ok.\n\nYou're going to deny it, you'll ignore it, you'll go about saying Christianity is totally harmless and is all lovey dovey and cuddly wuddly and is all about peace, love and social justice. It's not. That's what many Muslim groups say, but we don't believe them, do we.\n\nLet's cut the bullshit, Islam and Christianity have to die and they will both be buried in the same grave.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414093515", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I experienced a very strange creature doing something like this at one point, and the encounter led me to believe that people who do this are completely socially retarded. Not in a mean or malicious way, in a \"oh, look at that poor social retard, I should feel pity for him\" kind of way.\n\nThe specimen in question might have been described as a \"Bro\" by some. He was dressed in typical \"bro\" attire. Walking with that confident-not-confident strut that screams out \"I've never seen the outside of suburbia but I want to look like a hard ass\". He had probably bathed in some sort of body spray that had a scent somewhere in between suntan lotion and kerosene.\n\nAnyhow, he walked into the grocery store while I was picking out my produce, and had some sort of awful music playing out of his phone at full-blast. He did a caged-lion dance through the produce section, apparently hunting for mushrooms. I figured this out when he, out of nowhere, yelled \"HEY WHERE DA MUSHROOM AT?\", to a clerk who was literally on the opposite side of the section from him, a good 50 feet away.\n\nThe young female clerk was stocking lettuce at the time, she turned to see what was barking at her and locked eyes with our hero, standing and looking at her, still holding his musical phone up around his waist. She gave him the sort of confused look you might expect from a toddler trying to grasp the concept of adjustable rate mortgages. \n\nHe yawped out another query: \"HEY, YOU GOT MUSHROOMS?\"\n\nStill confused, she gestured to the giant display of mushrooms that was approximately 18 inches from the hand in which his phone was blaring the worst music ever.\n\nI continued my trip, pondering what sort of strange circumstances would create an animal like this.\n\nI continued to run into him as I worked down my list. It seemed like every aisle I'd walk down, I could hear the racket from his mobile device. Eschewing normal conventions like carts and baskets, I watched him carefully balancing spaghetti noodles, sauce, mushrooms, ground beef, Parmesan cheese and garlic bread in one hand while still navigating Satan's Playlist on his phone with the other.\n\nI started piecing together what was happening here...Canned spaghetti sauce? Cheap noodles? Beef? This was the makings of a Frat Boy Romantic Dinner. That's when the bemusement really set in, as I realized that this creature had somehow convinced another creature to spend time with him. I felt a moment of pity both for his date, and then a much stronger one for all of the lonely souls out there who hadn't been able to accomplish what Rico Suave was somehow pulling off.\n\nI made my way through the store, got into my usual kerfuffle with the Self-Checkout and proceeded out the door to find Rico in a kerfuffle of his own...only his was with the Redbox machine. No Frat Boy Date Night would be complete without a cheap movie, but alas, this machine was getting the better of him. He started to ask for help, in the same manner that he asked for mushrooms: Shouting at no one in particular. As he realized that nobody was watching him, and that he was on his own, a look of defeat washed over his face. This time, I felt a small amount of pity for him...\n\nHe was a tragic man of our time. Not built for normal society. Unequipped for normal interaction. Incapable of operating a Redbox machine. And entirely unaware that no less than a hundred people had just looked him up and down and thought to themselves \"What in the holy flying fuck is wrong with this douchenozzle.\"\n\nTL;DR: No damnit.

With finesse and accuracy both guards were taken care of;easily left incapacitated by my massive gluten powered penis missile. I was in home free, all I had to do was go in through the window and preform the change. \n\n**Bang Bang Bang**\n\nAn unexpected flurry of bullets flew through the window nearly missing my scale filled dragon like face. There was no time to retreat. The only option was to move forward. Swiftly I grabbed her gun shot her and grabbed the MacBook from her green red hands. Slowly, as I combed through the greatbook of mmacintosh apples,I realized something, she was not who she appeared to be originally*. \n\n\"If you want the book, you must give me money\" she said in a deep seductive voice \n\n\"you won't get a cent from me\"\n\nIn an Instant everything went dark and out she came bigger and more heartless than ever. \n\n\"i want 3.50 or your dead\"\n\nAnd there, petrified for my life but full of bravery and resolve, I stood up, arms straight, sweat in my eyes and shouted\n\n\"God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy, get your own damn money\"\n\nAfraid of my openness and fearlessness, she ran away never to be seen or heard from again. From that day forth, I would be forever known as Kim Jong Il. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414109744", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

This made me more suspicious as scouting locations in a taxi would have been so expensive. So I jumped into one and told him to follow that cab, so the taxi driver starts weaving through traffic to catch up to her cab. We drive all the way out to the suburbs of London and the taxi driver is trying to comfort me about my fiancé, I really wanted to change the subject and I think he knew because he told me to relax and that we would find out what was going on. At this point I realised that I didn't know his name do he introduced himself as Nellie. I glanced out of the window to see that we weren't in London at all but in Scotland and there were signs for Loch Ness.

{"body": "Tried to scare a squirrel, put a hispanic man in intensive care. \n\nEdit1: A lot of people asking for the story, here it is.\nEdit2: misspelled word.\nEdit3: Holy Hell, GOLD!? Maybe I can use it for these medical costs.\n\nWhen me and my wife first got married, about 10 years ago, we lived in an apartment a mile down the road from my job. It was a really nice 2nd story apartment right up against a wooded area. Great people in the community, and the people managing the place kept it in tip top shape. \n\nMost days I would just run home and fix a sandwich and play some World of Warcraft while I ate. My office in the apartment was situated overlooking this wooded area behind the apartment. We kept blinds over the window to keep the sun from glaring on the computer monitors.\n\nOn this particular day I sat down to eat my sandwich and kill a few internet dragons, and almost as soon as I sat down there was a scratching/chittering at this particular window. Squirrels had constantly been getting into things on our balcony and even ate into a chair cushion. We were not friends.\n\nI ignored the squirrel as much as possible, while trying to get some questing in, but it was having some kind of slam dance party or something out on the windowsill right next to me. About 10 minutes in my eye is twitching and I can't concentrate on my delicious sandwich, so I devise a plan to scare the squirrel away. Forever. \n\nI slowly rose from my chair and crept over to the window and grasped the cord for the blinds. I jerked the cord as hard as I could and let out a herculean roar at exactly the same time as the maintenance worker on the other side of the window screamed like a banshee and lost his grip with the ladder. \n\nImmediately my stomach dropped to the bottom of my nut sack and time stopped. We locked eyes in horror as he waved his arms and dropped his paintbrush trying to keep from falling. At this point he must have stepped back in surprise, because he didn't fall back, so much as just dropped straight down and disappearing from sight with a loud crash and the ladder falling over. \n\nI am ashamed to say I contemplated jumping in the car and running back to work. But I swallowed down a huge lump in my throat, grabbed the cordless phone, and rushed out and around the building to check on him while calling 911. I told the operator my address and that a man fell off a ladder... No sense in telling her why. Yet.\n\nI followed the wall and the sounds of yelling in Spanish and found where the man had landed in a bush. He ended up with a broken arm, but also several bad wounds from getting stabbed in the back from some of the branches in the bush. He was rushed to the ER and I rode in the ambulance with him. There was so much blood and guilt in that ambulance ride. The paramedics worked to clean the wounds and when we finally got to the hospital he was rushed off to surgery. I was escorted out to a waiting area. \n\nI don't know how long I sat there, it felt like days. I remember how upset I was that I didn't know his name, and I just sat there agonizing over what I had done. Eventually a Hispanic lady, holding a young girl, came bursting into the waiting area. She was crying and yelling at the nurses in broken English. I went up to her and tried to explain what had happened to her husband, but I could tell she wasn't understanding much of what I said.\n\nShe kept holding the girl to her chest, closing her eyes, and crying. At first I thought she was quietly sobbing, but I realized she was saying the same phrase over and over. \"How I pay? How I pay?\" And my heart shattered all over again as I realized her small family wasn't going to be able to afford this ER visit and subsequent medical costs. \n\"I will help you,\" I replied, but she just looked at me in confusion. I couldn't tell if it was the language barrier or that a stranger would be willing to help. I pulled out my wallet and pantomimed giving her money. \"How much?\"\n\nAnd for as long as I live I will never forget what she replied. \n\n\"Arbol Cincuenta.\"\n\nThe receptionist gasped, and I quickly turned to her and asked, \"Do you know what she said!?!\" And the Nurse replied with a look of horror, \"She said.. Tree Fifty.\"\nI slowly turned around, because I realized this was not the young man's wife, but a 150 foot tall creature from the Paleolithic era. I ran from the waiting room in horror, and jumped in a cab back to my apartment. \n\nA few months later the young maintenance man came to my apartment with his arm in a cast, but looking much better from the last time I had seen him. Strangely he thanked me for helping him that day, not only for getting him to the hospital in time, but also for uncovering his wife's deception. We have been friends ever since.

Well one fine afternoon we couldn't score any booze or weed so we ended up trying to huff gas. It wasn't one of my favorite highs but we were desperate so whatever... \n\nSo there we were on this bridge several hundred feet over this river huffing gas and if anyone has ever done this it kinda makes you really light headed and dizzy. We were both pretty fucked up when all of a sudden a train appears out of no where. We had both just got done taking this massive hit and I could hardly walk but the train was closing in quickly and we had to get clear. Freddy apparently had a much higher gas tolerance than I did because he took off running. I on the other hand was insanely dizzy and could barely stand much less walk. Somehow I managed to take several steps before falling. I plummeted the several hundred feet down into that cold river which I guess is a good thing opposed to getting hit by that train. \n\nAnyway I barely remember anything but what I do remember is beautiful. I was in a bright white room surrounded by my loved ones. They greeted me with open arms, telling me they love me and missed me. I remember crying tears of happiness. Then a door opened at the end of the room and a silhouette appeared. It was hard to make out at first due to the bright light surrounding him but then it suddenly became clear as my eyes adjusted.

I was pretty nerdy kid and really enjoyed star gazing so I gazed up towards the stars and noticed something odd in the little dipper. I remember this as clear as day. There was a \"rogue star,\" an extra star in the bottom right hand corner of the constellation, just above and to the right of the star. I starred at it for a while trying to remember my books that I'd read and pin down what I was seeing, maybe the lack of light polution was showing me a star that normal was invisible. This is where it got weird. As I'm starring at this star, it starts to move. It starts accelerating to the east, starts to spiral around the star and before I could show any one that it was there, it simply disappears. 11 years later I still have no fucking clue what I saw, but this experience made me a firm believer in visitors.\n\nTL; DR Saw an out of place star that began to move at an impossibly fast speed and then disappear.

{"body": "Story:\n\nWhen me and my wife first got married, about 10 years ago, we lived in an apartment a mile down the road from my job. It was a really nice 2nd story apartment right up against a wooded area. Great people in the community, and the people managing the place kept it in tip top shape. \n\nMost days I would just run home and fix a sandwich and play some World of Warcraft while I ate. My office in the apartment was situated overlooking this wooded area behind the apartment. We kept blinds over the window to keep the sun from glaring on the computer monitors.\n\nOn this particular day I sat down to eat my sandwich and kill a few internet dragons, and almost as soon as I sat down there was a scratching/chittering at this particular window. Squirrels had constantly been getting into things on our balcony and even ate into a chair cushion. We were not friends.\n\nI ignored the squirrel as much as possible, while trying to get some questing in, but it was having some kind of slam dance party or something out on the windowsill right next to me. About 10 minutes in my eye is twitching and I can't concentrate on my delicious sandwich, so I devise a plan to scare the squirrel away. Forever. \n\nI slowly rose from my chair and crept over to the window and grasped the cord for the blinds. I jerked the cord as hard as I could and let out a herculean roar at exactly the same time as the maintenance worker on the other side of the window screamed like a banshee and lost his grip with the ladder. \n\nImmediately my stomach dropped to the bottom of my nut sack and time stopped. We locked eyes in horror as he waved his arms and dropped his paintbrush trying to keep from falling. At this point he must have stepped back in surprise, because he didn't fall back, so much as just dropped straight down and disappearing from sight with a loud crash and the ladder falling over. \n\nI am ashamed to say I contemplated jumping in the car and running back to work. But I swallowed down a huge lump in my throat, grabbed the cordless phone, and rushed out and around the building to check on him while calling 911. I told the operator my address and that a man fell off a ladder... No sense in telling her why. Yet.\n\nI followed the wall and the sounds of yelling in Spanish and found where the man had landed in a bush. He ended up with a broken arm, but also several bad wounds from getting stabbed in the back from some of the branches in the bush. He was rushed to the ER and I rode in the ambulance with him. There was so much blood and guilt in that ambulance ride. The paramedics worked to clean the wounds and when we finally got to the hospital he was rushed off to surgery. I was escorted out to a waiting area. \n\nI don't know how long I sat there, it felt like days. I remember how upset I was that I didn't know his name, and I just sat there agonizing over what I had done. Eventually a Hispanic lady, holding a young girl, came bursting into the waiting area. She was crying and yelling at the nurses in broken English. I went up to her and tried to explain what had happened to her husband, but I could tell she wasn't understanding much of what I said.\n\nShe kept holding the girl to her chest, closing her eyes, and crying. At first I thought she was quietly sobbing, but I realized she was saying the same phrase over and over. \"How I pay? How I pay?\" And my heart shattered all over again as I realized her small family wasn't going to be able to afford this ER visit and subsequent medical costs. \n\"I will help you,\" I replied, but she just looked at me in confusion. I couldn't tell if it was the language barrier or that a stranger would be willing to help. I pulled out my wallet and pantomimed giver her money. \"How much?\"\n\nAnd for as long as I live I will never forget what she replied. \n\n\"Arbola Cincuenta.\"\n\nThe receptionist gasped, and I quickly turned to her and asked, \"Do you know what she said!?!\" And the Nurse replied with a look of horror, \"She said.. Tree Fifty.\"\nI slowly turned around, because I realized this was not the young man's wife, but a 150 foot tall creature from the Paleolithic era. I ran from the waiting room in horror, and jumped in a cab back to my apartment. \n\nA few months later the young maintenance man came to my apartment with his arm in a cast, but looking much better from the last time I had seen him. Strangely he thanked me for helping him that day, not only for getting him to the hospital in time, but also for uncovering his wife's deception. We have been friends ever since.

{"body": "Teacher here. \n\nBack in 2003 I was teaching 6th grade science at a small private school near Richmond, VA. My homeroom class had about 30 students in it. There was one student that I noticed immediately on the first day of school. Small girl, strawberry blonde hair. Very quiet. Sat alone.\n\nHer name was Veronica, and throughout the beginning of the semester she performed pretty awful on her first couple science exams. She couldn't seem to find the concentration that other students could, and I would frequently catch her with a blank stare on her face as I lectured about different atoms and molecules. Nevertheless, I could see that maybe something was going on at home, or maybe there was a learning difficulty present. I didn't give up. \n\nHalf way through the semester, we had parent teacher conferences. It was a Thursday night and she had signed her parents up for a conference around 7:30pm. I remember looking up at the clock at 7:40pm. No one had shown up yet for Veronica's conference. \n\nI was beginning to worry, until a small frail man walked into the room and introduced himself to me as Veronica's father. We sat down and had a conversation about her daughter and what I thought she needed to do to achieve higher scores on her tests. I explained to her father that I could truly see potential in her, but she just needed to apply herself. It was just about that time that I noticed Veronica's father was about eight stories high and a crustacean from the protozoic era. He looked down at me as the conference was ending and said he needed about tree fiddy.\n\nI'll never forget Veronica, I knew the potential was there.

During the day they would cover the case in fur to keep it frozen. Some of these ice spears were up to 5 feet tall and could weigh as much as 150lbs! They would be hanged from tall trees and wired to open the case and drop the ice spear when a large animal walked underneath them. wheeled vehicles with these molds were found in the burials of the Afanasevans and have been dated to before 2200 BC.

{"body": "In tenth grade I was addicted to collecting pokemon cards. Unfortunately, this was an expensive hobby and my parents weren't exactly willing to dump all their fortunes on some \"silly little cards\". But that holographic Charizard was no joke, and I was determined to get my hands on it. I needed ways to earn money, and I will never forget what this one girl offered me...\n\nLet's call her Tiffany, she was a popular kid and I was the geeky guy that stared at his pokemon cards all day, so I was rather nonplussed when she walked up to me that fateful Thursday morning. \"Hey anotherpoweruser, I heard you're looking for money?\" she asked. \"Uhh, yeah, yeah I am\" I stuttered. \"Well it just so happens that I have a couple of extra bucks, if you're willing to do some work\" she replied with a wink. \"Umm, what do you have in mind\" I asked. \"Come see me after school\" she said with a smile and strutted along. I was nervous all day at school, I couldn't believe Tiffany was offering *me* money. I didn't know at the time that she was rich, but I figured she must be well-off if she was offering to give me money.\n\nAnyway, school ended and I waited in the parking lot, searching for Tiffany. \"Anotherpoweruser!\" I heard her voice call out. I turned around and saw Tiffany standing there, looking rather impatient. \"Are you ready to earn that money?\" she asked. I simply nodded as she dragged me along towards her car. \"We're going to have to go to my house\" she said with what looked like a coquettish smile. \"Oh.. okay\" I managed to spit out. What followed was the longest 10 minutes of my life as my mind raced thinking of what was going to happen and she said absolutely nothing. I swear to this day that she unbuttoned her blouse because her cleavage seemed a lot more alluring after this point...\n\n\"Alright, we're here!\" she shouted as we pulled into her driveway. She quickly dragged me inside of her house and locked the door behind us. \"My parents will be home in an hour, so let's make this quick\" she said. Instant boner. \"So, what am I doing exactly..\" I tried to say, but she interrupted with a kiss. My first kiss. She began to lower herself down and unbuckle my pants. \"Umm.. how much am I getting paid again\" I asked awkwardly. \"I never said... but $350\". It was at that moment that I realized Tiffany was not a 16-year old girl, but a five hundred foot tall creature from the Paleozoic Era. \"Goddamnit Lochness montser, I don't want your tree fiddy!\" I shouted. I rushed out of the house and ran for as long as I could with tears down my eyes. I couldn't believe I was about to do all of that for some measly cards.\n\nA few weeks later, I was still avoiding Tiffany, what happened was too awkward to talk about. Unfortunately, she caught me after class one day. \"Well, well, anotherpoweruser...\" she said with a smirk. \"Hi Tiffany\" I mumbled. \"Look, I'm sorry about what happened a month ago, but I got this for you\" she replied with a smile. I looked up from the floor and noticed that she was holding a holographic Charizard in your hands. \"Holy crap, this is amazing!\" I shouted and hugged Tiffany. \"I thought you might like it\" she replied. From that day on, Tiffany and I became the best of friends, and I will always cherish that holographic Charizard.

{"body": "It's a complicated story. I had feelings for her for the longest time, but I was too much of a cowardly fool to say anything. Love can make you that way sometimes, and it's the worst thing ever. It's a sort of torture, a beautiful lovely terrible sort of torture. \n\nShe was going to move. We were all in the same group of close friends, and we went to see her off at the train station one last time. I remember us all saying the usual things one says to a friend that's departing, and I remember feeling a lump in my throat. Partly sadness, partly those words that I wanted to say. I said my goodbye, and gave her a hug.\n\nShe got on the train. The moment those doors opened, I knew I was going to make a terrible mistake if I never told her. I rushed through the door, and everything came out. I don't remember the words I said, but basically I was telling her how much she meant to me and that I was a fool for not telling her earlier and that she meant *so much to me*. I must have looked like an idiot on that train, but that didn't matter, because with watery eyes she looked up at me and told me that she had felt the same about me, and had spent sleepless nights trying to work up the nerve to tell me. She told me about how she always wanted to hold my hand when we hung out in the early morning hours, and she gave me the strongest hug anyone could ever give, despite her petite size. It felt like I was hugging the sun.\n\nAnyways, the train ride was going to take hours, and I had no ticket, and I had no idea what I'd do since I was going to be stuck on a train with her for about five hours. We laughed, and settled into two seats, holding each other close. \n\nHer and I were married for 25 years, which is wonderful except it doesn't really effect me because this all took place in a parallel universe where I'm actually not a lame foreveraloner who sits in his boxers eating ice cream and watching Fresh Prince of Belair re-runs late into the night as he wonders what the hell any of this existence shit means.

{"body": "Rings of her golden hair bounce with vitality.  I am cursed to love a younger woman, and she weeps for my memory.  Her hazel eyes are bloodshot from tears, and melancholy wears on her shoulders.  A judge has beckoned me to enter his chamber, alone, his gravel voice pulling us apart from our last hug.  Who will comfort her when her trial arrives?\n\nI enter a grand room with modern windows to my left.  The sky, clouded, compliments the grey aisle and short slate desk.  The judge motions me to sit, though he carefully stays behind the barrier.  \n\n\"My role is to share the jury's verdict.\"  He speaks deliberately.  \"You will not be kept alive.\"\n\nIt was no surprise.  Only the greatest mystics received the gift of ongoing youth.  Mere mortals are too replaceable, too limited, and the lottery of birth will profit more geniuses than the growing wisdom of age.  \n\n\"What about Melissa?\"  \n\n\"Her trial will happen in nine years.\"  \n\nI stare thru him.  \"There was no jury today.  You've known my verdict for many years.\"\n\nEmpathy draws the judge into a nod. \n\n\"So you know her verdict.\"\n\nThe judge hesitates, but finally nods.  I don't need another question.\n\n\"You are wrong.  I might not deserve to live, but she does... the world deserves her.\"  \n\n\"You'll see her again, when -\"\n\n\"Don't condescend to me with talk of God!\" I rise to my shaking legs, my fists on the desk and my eyes narrowing.  \"Only the mystics, the truly gifted... like *the judges.*\"  These last words trembled with vitriol.  \"You can't tell me the Earth needs you and not her!\"\n\nHe rose, meeting my eyes with paternal conviction.  \"Demeter needs her.\"  The sun beamed thru the grand windows.  \"Demeter needs you.\"\n\nA door opposite from my entrance opened on cue.  The judge took a few steps in that direction before turning, gesturing with a head nod for me to follow.  This non sequitur, vaguely familiar, cut thru me and leveled my emotions.  I took a few cautious steps.\n\nThis new room!  If the last room was grand, this new ambiance was overwhelming!  Onyx and jade pillars imposed for hundreds of meters into the distance.  Mahogany shelves lined the right wall, exquisitely carved and fully stocked with a library that Alexandria would envy.  On the left, modern windows kept their bold style and golden sunlight lent a mystical aura.  The ceiling had to be a hundred meters overhead!\n\n\"You'll be in deep sleep for your 55 year transit.\"  I startled to hear the judge speak again.  \"You'll wake up with this 25 year old body and age until your natural death.  Demeter is terraformed, but you'll be among the first fleets to colonize her.\"\n\n\"... And if I refuse\" I asked, having already decided against it.\n\n\"You'll be restrained and sent anyway.\"\n\n\"And Melissa?\"\n\n\"Will be nine years behind.  A little less, probably, as our mystics improve the ships in the interim.\"\n\nHe offered a handshake, I accepted.  He spoke of the land masses on Demeter, the plentiful rivers and Mediterranean climate, and the quiet vistas of the highlands.  He dwelled for quite some time on those highlands, describing the misty lakes and cool winds like he was remembering his home.  As the sun set, he smiled and directed me to the far wall.  A comfortable looking box lay just off the floor like caskets from the history books.  He gestured for me to lie down, then pulled the transparent lid over me.  I heard a hiss as an air seal formed, then a sleepy feeling rose within me.   \n\nA final question occurred to me.  \"How long has it been since your trial?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"the time really fades together.  I suppose it's been a little over 250 million years.\"  It was at that moment I noticed that he towered nearly a hundred meters above me and was adapted for an aquatic lifestyle.  I said, \"dammit monstah, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"  He looked disappointed as he walked back towards his office.\n\nI let out a deep sigh and allowed myself to grow tired.  As consciousness departed, I dreamed of rings of golden hair, bouncing with vitality. \n\nEdit: grammer", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414446228", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

But I'm bound to agree that a condenser will probably be the best bet for many of us here on /r/letsplay. \n\nI use an AT2020 from Audio Technica myself, which has the unfortunate tendency of picking up my computer pretty clearly if I go above half on the gain of my Behringer Xenyx 302. Hopefully I'll be getting a Focusrite Scarlett Solo eventually, which allegedly has better components and everything and should deliver a slight boost and more ability to customize. What I'd love to have is a compressor or something like that to cut out that background noise, as I've seen many YouTubers using the AT2020 or its siblings without a problem. It is true, however, that many of them have better PC cooling than me, but still.\n\nI feel that a condenser mic would work best in a totally background noise free environment, like a studio. Just the clock on my wall gets picked up a fair bit by my mic, and that clock is a decent amount of feet away after all, so distance really isn't a thing it seems. I would like to be able to have the mic a fair bit away, though, so I could move and type freely or whatever I'd like to do without my computer being picked up. But from what I've seen, you'd need to spend at least a few hundred in mixers, pre-amps and compressors for the ideal setup for noise elimination. Given that fans are used whether or not a computer is water cooled or not, it's really gonna be a challenge to have the computer in the same room and eliminate all noise from it.\n\nOther than that, I feel the AT2020 is a great mic. It's just that I don't have it in an ideal location. Sure, I can have it right up against my face without distorting my view of the game I'm playing, but that shouldn't be necessary with a condenser, right?\n\nAs for your Nessie.

But he felt that, having grown up with the only man he saw as a father and holding a respectable position, he would not be anywhere else.\n\nAnd he knew when his master was troubled.\n\n\"Master,\" called Patrio softly, \"you awake early again\"\n\n\"I...had a dream,\" muttered Gaius. Were he not in his full dress toga, Patrio would suspect he might still be in that dream.\n\n\"Did it trouble you?\" The concern in his voice was genuine as any son he could hope to have, thought Gaius with just a touch of bitterness on the edge of his thoughts.\n\n\"....does the word \"twerk\" mean anything to you?\"\n\n\"Twerk? I can't say I know it. Is that a German tribe?\"\n\n\"No, no, nothing like that,\" dismissed Gaius with a wave of his hand. \"It's a dance. Or a ritual. I don't know. But I heard it in this dream and it troubles me.\"\n\n\"A ritual? For what God?\"\n\nThere was a pause. After some time, Gaius muttered a word which had all the charm and delight of wet gravel. \"Dat Ass\"\n\n\"Datass? I've never heard of such a god.\"\n\n\"No it's too words boy, Dat Ass. 'Twerk, twerk, twerk dat ass'. It's a chant or a prayer to Dat Ass\" Gaius said with a matter-of-fact, like he had become suddenly an expert on Dat Ass and it's strange ritual.\n\n\"Well what do the followers of Dat Ass believe? It's no Greek god, certainly no Roman.\"\n\nGains stopped and turned to Patrio. His eyes nearly shown in the dark with fear and almost...desire.\n\n\"Patrio, I've seen things of which I cannot begin to explain. There were lights, incredible lights like stars dying and forming before my eyes. Great yellow suns and dozens of tiny white moons. They flashed from day to night so quickly, dozens of years must have passed in that time.\"\n\n\"Master...\"\n\n\"And then there were girls. The very fabric of night was wrapped around every lovely curve, and the lights shone off them like sunsets and sunrises\".\n\nPatrio backed away frightened. Gains became wild, throwing his arms about and shouting into the dark. What kind of horrific God would show such things?\n\n\"They danced, Patrio. They danced over columns that rose and fell like magic! Magic! And they danced at me, and they shouted, \"Twerk, twerk, twerk Dat Ass\" over and over, and I couldn't look away! Day Ass bound me to the spot where I stood and I was powerless, Patrio! Powerless before Dat Ass!\"\n\nAnd as quick as the spell came, it was gone. Gains, out of breath, collapsed into a reclining sofa, breathing shallow gurgles of air.\n\nFrightened thoroughly, Patrio worked up his courage. \"And what does Dat Ass command?\"\n\nGaius looked up from the chair, nearly aged from his possession. He brought Patrio closer, and whispered.\n\n\"I need about tree fitty\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414452135", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "But wait! There's more. If you can get a hold of Tolkien, Artist and Illustrator by Wayne Hammond and Christina Scull you'll find that Tolkien [drew more of this picture](http://i.imgur.com/kfqbzxh.jpg), this is only the bottom bit.\n\n&gt;When he got to Moria, however, his inspiration rose. He had mentioned that ancient home of the dwarves in *The Hobbit* but had not yet explored it. Now he was delayed by fascination with its entrance on the west, the Doors of Durin, whose image he sought to perfect...The entrance is similarly shown in the finished picture [*Moria Gate*](http://i.imgur.com/kfqbzxh.jpg)(I took a picture of it with my cell phone)...The scene is now closer to his description in the earliest manuscript of book 2 chapter 4 \n&gt;\n&gt;\"They [the fellowship] trudged on with their weary feet stumbling among the stones, until suddenly they came to a wall of rock some thirty feet high. Over it ran a trickling fall of water, but plainly the fall had once been much stronger...\n&gt;\"The moon was now sinking westwards. It shone out brightly for a while, and they saw stretched before their feet a dark still lake, glinting in the moonlight. The Gate-stream had been dammed, and had filled all the valley. Only a trickle of water escaped over the old falls, for the main outlet of the lake was now away at the southern end.\n&gt;\"Before them, dim and grey across the dark water, stood a cliff. The moonlight lay pale upon it, and it looked cold and forbidding: a final bar to all passage. Frodo could see no sign of any gate or entrance in the frowning stone...\n&gt;\"The strip of dry land left by the lake was quite narrow, and their path took them close under the face of the cliff. When they had gone for almost a mile southward they came to some holly-trees. There were stumps and dead logs rotting in the water--the remnants of old thickets, or of a hedge that had once lined the submerged road across the drowned valley. But close under the cliff there stood, still living and strong, two tall trees with great roots that spread from the wall to the water's edge....\n&gt;\"There was a smooth space right in the middle of the shade of the trees...The sun shone across the face of the wall, and as the travellers stared at it, it seemed to them thaton the surface...faint lines appeared like slender veins of silver running in the stone...\"\n&gt;\n&gt;Closer, but still with notable differences. The doorway, now elaborated even more with an added key-stone, is hardly the almost invisible gate of which Tolkien writes, the water by the stairs is obviously more than a 'trickle' as it pours over the cliff and falls foaming into the rushing stream below, and the roots of the holly-trees do not appear to spread across the narrow strip of land to the water. The drawing, and so the preliminary sketch as well, very probably depicts the approach to the west gate of Moria as Tolkien conceived it before he wrote any of the relevant text. He later cut off the bottom portion of the drawing [the part that's on the spines of your books], with a columned title panel echoing the design of the gate, apparently in an attempt to salvage most of the picture by removing the more active part of the Stair Falls. The rippling water immediately in front of the gate is related to another passage in the draft manuscript: 'Suddenly in the silence Frodo heard a soft swish and bubble in the water as on the evening before, only softer. Turning quickly he saw faint ripples on the surface of the lake...' Moments later, Frodo is seized by 'a long arm, sinuous as a tentacle, ...pale green-grey and wet'. To the right of centre in the drawing is a tentacle raised into the air, one of the many arms of the Watcher in the Water. Here Tolkien merely suggests the presence of the creature among the forest of drowned trees; in the preliminary sketch he drew the Watcher much like the Loch Ness Monster as it it popularly conceived, with two segments of a coiled serpentine body above the water.\n\nHelp! I can't stop quoting! They go on to talk about the design on the doors of Moria and the facsimile of the sheet from the book of Mazarbul Tolkien made and wanted to include in LotR.\n\nSo, more than you ever wanted to know about this drawing. If you can get Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator I highly recommend it, a fascinating look at Tolkiens artistic skills.

She was probably 5'5, 120 at most, swam in college, and in her early 40s. Millions of my future children died with her on my mind. \n\nMark and I hung out a lot. He lived two houses down, we shared a pretty common class schedule in school, and played on the baseball team together, so our friendship was naturally close. \n\nEvery time I was at his place Shelly was always kind of hovering around us, offering food, drinks, or whatnot. Sometimes she would give me a pat on the shoulder and her hand would linger a few seconds longer than it should.

To my surprise, it was Shelly. She needed some help moving some boxes around in the garage since mark was gone. \n\nNot doing anything else, I obliged and we walked the two houses down, making general small talk about school and college plans. Once at their house I helped Shelly move maybe four boxes that weighed about twenty pounds each. I don't know why she needed help them from one wall to the other, but my too young, too dumb mind was already in other places. \n\nAfter we were done she offered me a drink.

When you go into Kindle Direct as an ordinary user/self-publisher, you get options to make your book available to different markets, but not AFAICT alter any cover art.

{"body": "Condenser mics definitely need an absolute quiet environment. Seems you're confusing compression with a noise gate. Compressor will raise any quiet sounds and lower any loud sounds essentially making any background noise worse. A noise gate would simply kill the volume whenever the input is below a certain level, but any noise while talking would still be there. A noise remover is post-production but will remove noise from the entire sound track. Still a really good way of doing this is with Audacity. Simply record a few seconds before you start with game sounds muted and no talking, then use that particular audio sample in the noise remover. Only problem is if you do it too much you'll get flange, a fancy pitch shift, on any points where you start and stop talking.\n\nYou can actually get a pretty decent mixer for about $100-$150 these days. The one I tried with my old condenser mic was about $180 when I bought it. 10 channels in and 2 channels out to USB. One with pre-amps would definitely be a lot more though. Depends if you're willing to do post-production or not. Also depends on the pickup range of the mic. Condensers generally pick up from any direction while non-condensers are primarily direction based.\n\nCondensers are designed to not be right up against the sound source. Example if you position 1 just right, you can record an entire drum kit with no issues. Problem is because of this, they pick up everything. Also, if you double the distance between the sound source and the mic, the volume will drop by 6dB. This is why having the mic a bit further away is better so you can move a bit more without dropping out completely. If you're right up against the mic you got maybe 2 inches before you sound dead quiet.\n\nSo far very pleased with my Nessie.

My beady black pupils dilate as I come to the realization that it is not raining, in fact it never has on this planet so far. I turn around and, to my dismay, a towering worm stood before me like none I have ever seen. I try to run but the devastation is catching up to me. My heart is beating fast.

{"body": "Yea!!! It's my time to shine!!! Throw away for obvious reasons.  \n\n\nRelevant background.  I was 16 at the time and I am from a fairly poor neighborhood, but we lived about a mile away form a richer area (gentrification FTW).  My mom was a single mom who used to work three jobs to take care of us (myself and three younger siblings).  She worked early shift at an Amazon packaging facility, late nights cleaning offices and on the weekends she would work in the rich neighborhood cleaning.  She worked for this one family who for whatever reason really liked her.  My mom used to tell me stories of how they would be oddly nice to her.  They always had her come back though and even though she would often do a really bad job of cleaning.  She was always so tired.  Anyway, for whatever reason, they always had her clean their big old house every weekend.  They had two little kids, a 3 year old girl and a 5 year old boy.  They mentioned to her that they needed a babysitter and my mom always willing to try to get some more ends meet told them I would be great with their kids.  So that's how I got the job.\n\nSo, I started that weekend after my mom cleaned the place I came with her and she introduced me.  My mom left me there and the parents were going to go out for a date or something.  The dad takes me aside and gives me the run of the house rules, no snacks after 9, make them brush their teeth, etc.  He also said, please don't ever go in the basement and make sure the kids don't go in there either.  Something about his workshop and he didn't want them getting into the tools.  Anyway, I didn't think anything about it.  They left and the night went fine.  The kids were fine and I got paid when the parents came home. They ask me back about once every two weeks.  Around two months into doing this I start noticing weird things being placed around the house that I never saw before.  A bear on the mantle, weird ugly fake plants and I am just thinking... That's odd, they really don't match the rest of the house.  I ask my mom if she has noticed and she said she didn't think anything about it and I should just leave it alone because they are paying us good money.  \n\n\nWell, one time I was baby sitting the kids and they went to sleep around 9 and the parents weren't home yet so I decided to look around into some of the oddly placed items.  The bear was really heavy and as you can guess from the question you asked, it was a nanny cam.  \n\n\nI found 10 of those bad boys all over the house, but 8 of them were facing the door to the basement.  They weren't even that well concealed.  I thought that was really odd since the room to the basement wasn't a high traffic area and the kids knew they couldn't play in their dad's workshop so they kinda stayed away from it.  \n\n\nWell, since I knew that if they looked over the footage of the cameras they would have found out I know about the hidden cameras, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to find out what all the fuss was about in his workshop.  It's about 9:45 now and they are supposed to be home at 10:15.  I knew they would probably be mad and it may make my mom and me lose some much needed income, but what can I say, I was young and stupid.\n\n\nSo, I walk towards the door to go into the basement workshop but as I get closer to the door I swear I heard something, like the lock clicking.  Someone knew I was getting close to the door and locked it from the inside...  This kinda freaked me out, but I thought, that maybe I would be able to redeem myself from the snooping by catching or protecting the house... I know... I wasn't a really smart kid.  Being from the poor side of town, this is a common thing for crackheads or homeless people to break in and stay in the basement so I wasn't really scared of them.  They usually spooked easy and I watched my mom chase one out of my grandparents house with a broom, so I was feeling brave.  I grabbed a fire poker from the living room and there I am stalking the basement.  I try the handle and it is open, so either the person unlocked the door or maybe I was just hearing things.  I fling the door open and flick on the light switch, storming down stairs ready to swing on some crazy person or no one.  I turn the corner and I see all this crazy sex dungeon type stuff... I mean weird ass shit...  Stuff I only read about in 50 shades of grey last year.  I didn't even know some of that stuff existed.  Machines, swings, ropes, chains, crazy white people...  Anyway, I'm now thinking, ok, I must have just heard something, and my curiosity has just got my mom and me fired...  Great.\n\n\nThen out of the corner of my eye this fucking guy in what I later found out was a gimp suit comes out mumbling \"Mahgangm  ganangge\"  Dude had a ball gag in and was chained against the wall.  My young brain is just beyond fucked and can't comprehend what I am seeing, so I just run upstairs and run right into the parents coming home... \n\n\nThey see me coming from outside the basement door and are immediately livid.  They start yelling at me and telling me that I am fired and my mom is fired and all this crap.  I start balling tell them I'll do anything...  I was sorry and all that crap and in my naive mind I throw out there \"I'll do anything, I can pay you!\"  Well, this apparently got them thinking and the dad gives a look to the mom and walks me outside.  He says, look, I don't know what you say in there, but we can't have anyone find out about this.  You said you would pay us.  Do you know what you have to do for us to not fire your mother and you?  He has me over a barrel and I have to do it... whatever it is... and I say, yes, I will pay you anything.  Then the dad says, I need about tree fitty.  That's when I realized that the dad was a huge creature, this giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "So here's the issue I have with this. We have a mathematical *proof* that the decimal expansion (or indeed an expansion in any integer basis) of pi is infinite. For one, pi is an irrational number, and therefore it cannot possibly be finitely represented. If you know basic calculus and have a piece of paper I could convince you of this right now, this instant. Again, we have a *proof* of this fact. An infallible series of logical steps that lead to an inevitable conclusion. You see, when a sound mathematical proof turns out to lead to the wrong conclusions, the damage doesn't end in something as trivial as \"a constant we thought was irrational is in fact rational\" - that I could live with. We can patch that up. In essence, to offer evidence contradicting a mathematical proof is to claim that one step in its reasoning is wrongly inferred. But there is no doubt in my mind - nor in the mind of anyone who's studied math for long enough - that any of the dozens of classical proofs of the irrationality of pi are all correctly inferred, and all of the logical steps in them are correctly argued for. To find evidence against this would be to find evidence against the basic principles of human reasoning. We would have to acknowledge the most absolute absurdities. Doublethink to a degree not even Orwell would be comfortable endorsing. A and not A. 1 = 2. What would such a world even look like? It's ridiculous and impossible.\n\nOr so we thought. Turns out we were wrong. The mathematicians, the philosophers, the educators. Pi is finite. A and not A. Somebody raise Aristotle from the grave because he conned us, he conned us bad. We called countless conferences - we verified with the steps over and over - the greatest minds of our generation made their career debating this. The proofs seemed sound to us - pi is an irrational number. It can be shown with a simple chain of reasoning that anyone with the most average intelligence can understand, given enough time. But here the calculations were sitting before us and they showed us time and time again that at some point, at a digit place larger than any of us could imagine, pi terminates, and it ends with the number 9. We did not have the mathematical machinery, of course, to calculate the expansion of pi in its entirety - even the *number of digits* in pi would take far, far more than the amount of atoms in the universe to express in decimal notation - and for all practical means and purposes pi was as not-finite as we would have liked it to be. But here the facts were standing before us and the facts were that pi is a rational number with a finite decimal expansion.\n\nThe first generation of mathematicians took it the hardest. Some quit their occupation for more \"practical\" pursuits. The older generation mostly chose solace in retirement. Pioneers tried to patch up the issue but - after a few hundred years they gave up too. The theoretical physicists soon followed. Then came the philosophers and the intellectuals. The post-modernists looked at it as a triumph. The analytics turned continental. The continentals were welcomed in universities again. \n\nHere was a world where X was not X, where 1 was 2 and where pi was both rational and irrational. A world where every statement could be asserted. Nothing was certain anymore, and everything was and everyone were equally correct. The intellectuals who dedicated decades in university to studying the deeper truths of the universe were no smarter or more qualified to talk of it than the class idiot. We no longer had anything to rely on, nor any common point of thinking to argue from. Every truth was false and every falsehood was said to be true; God was real and God was false; pigs could fly, Nessie was real, and Sasquatch was seen dipping in the lakes of Nebraska. The shockwave that begun in the highest ranks of the ivory tower of academia trickled down its height and soon everyone was affected by the absurdity. The concept of knowing, and of belief, had stopped making sense, and the very way we understood the language we use to talk of these things had changed.\n\nAnd you know what? It wasn't that bad. After a few months the hype had been all but forgotten by the media. The engineers and scientists were shaken - but they continued their work still, if with less trust in the theorems and formulae they previously worked with. The face of science had changed and we were traversing new and exciting grounds. Technology continued to progress, as did experimental science, and society continued to function with no Spaghetti monsters (or actual Sasquatches) in sight. The mathematicians did not forget about this but as time passed theoretical mathematics was driven into obscurity, sometimes associating itself with literary criticism. Still, social activism would change. We became more tolerant, more spiritual and mystical. No longer able to rely on our own minds we began reviving arts that were passe in our generation - and soon palm readers and prophets and saints flooded the streets. The world opened its doorways and it reintroduced itself to us. \n\nYet it was the world we had always known. Our society was changed by our discovery - but in the end it was a discovery that took place entirely in our minds. The stars did not change their colors, the sun still rose in the morning, and the leaves on the trees kept changing with the seasons. It wasn't so much the discovery of the rationality of pi that shook us, but the discovery of our own irrationality. But we adapted, as our species is prone to do, and we kept walking forward.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1414786762", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 878, "controversiality": 0}
