The second chemist is somewhat surprised by his colleagues rather strange answer, but he thinks he probably just is a bit eccentric. He then proceeds to order some water in a normal fashion.\n\n\n&gt;The other chemist excuses himself and goes to the bathroom of the restaurant. He then kills himself, as he is rather disappointed as his murder attempt didn't succeed. He then arrives in heaven. St. Peter asks him why he should be allowed to enter heaven. He claim that he is a noble gentleman, and tips his fedora at St. Peter.\nSt. Peter asks him the question: \"If you use a fedora, that means your an enlightened atheist, europhic in not a phony Gods blessing, but by your own intelligence!\" and the chemist responded \"Yes quite! Then this can't be real!\" Still he couldn't help but feel a bit stupid as his soul dissipated.\n\n\n\n&gt;The other chemist wondered where his friend had gone, so he also entered the bathroom. He then discovered his friends body, cold and stiff, which was rather strange, seeing as how it only had been ten minutes. But it was only a hallucination, as the bartender was also a chemist, and understood that the first chemist had tried to kill the second one, so he had given him hydrogen peroxide instead of water. The bartender was also a statistician, and as all the other chemist he knew had died, it only made sense that he would do to.

He then decided to flee to England.\n\n\n\n&gt; However, unlike how the original writer intended, he didn't end up in England, but rather in Scotland, as the new writer wants to make a Loch Ness monster joke.

{"body": "My gaze danced from player to player. I posited 9-1 odds on Haley holding an ace and and some kind of unimpressive kicker. She always puckered her cherry red lips when she was unsure of something. A plume of Horowitz's cheap cigar smoke floated through the dim light above the green felt table and irritated my eye. I leaned back in my chair and removed my glasses, placing them strategically on the table facing Ursula. She was the only question mark in this pot. What was she in for?\n\nA pair, I figured, of some undetermined denomination. Certainly not aces, that much was clear. Kings were unlikely as I pinned Miguel as owning a couple of them. Perhaps a face pair. No, definitely a face pair.\n\nJackson, who threw is hand in early, snapped his fingers and from the black abyss surrounding us a waiter's face adorned with a French looking mustache appeared.\n\n\"Glenlivet, on the rocks.\"\n\nHe spoke in a gritted voice. The kind of voice that men think women swoon over and women think sounds like money. Haley broke her stolid stare and eyed him mischievously. He was laying back, sitting on the top stack. Debonair and a little pretentious.\n\n\"Keep that up and your chips will be swimming too, handsome.\"\n\nUrsula was usually quiet but she was allergic to losing. She reflexively shot the remark at Jackson through a thick accent, flustered by his confidence. He just smiled in return and snapped his fingers again.\n\n\"Something to calm the lady down, on my tab. A martini, doll face?\"\n\nShe snickered at the cocky gesture and focused on the giant pot that had amassed in the middle of the table. When the waiter returned and served the Martini, Ursula didn't crack. Not a twitch. When the waiter set down the scotch, as if the wooden border of the table were a switch, the entire room was plunged into darkness. Not a light nor flicker was seen.\n\nWe all shouted, all at once, in no specific direction to nobody in particular. There was a rumble and a disturbance, under the table something brushed against my leg. An unnerving draft blew through and the waiter shouted something about a breaker. A moment later, the lights came on. We were all standing now, Ursula looked downright disheveled. Haley's arms were folded and she stood at an awkward angle as though she had no grasp of which way the table was oriented. Jackson, ever minding his priorities, was paused mid-sip of his scotch. Horowitz... Well he never changed. Stalky, he was stone faced, smoking his cigar, hands on his hips, glasses intact and green translucent visor cap perfectly in place.\n\n\"The dealer would like the table to acknowledge that the pot has been robbed.\"\n\nWe all looked at once, it did seem a little lighter than before.\n\n\"How much you reckon is missing, dealer?\" Haley drawled at him.\n\nHorowitz adjusted himself and leaned closer, hovering over the pot.

He'd come play with me at lunchtime with it and I was so jealous I ended up always leaving lunch early. After a week of getting angry at this guy for rubbing his neopet in my face, I told myself that this neopet was mine now. All I have to do is take it and then I get to keep it.\n\nCue lunch time. Everybodies going to their cubbies to get their lunches and toys out. Joon (Asian kid) goes running for his bag to get his neopet and plastic box of rice. I follow suit, grab my ugly green bear neopet and lunch then head to my desk. \n\nI watch this guy like a hawk. Every bite that went into his mouth, I saw it. \"This guy thinks he can just buy his ultra rare neopet without me taking it? Heh.\" Bell rings.

My tumtum hurts.\"\n\n\"sure, stay in the wreckroom\"\n\nYou should have known me better. On to step 2. \n\nI grab my lunch and neopet and head to the cubbies. Everybody gets ready to go outside while I pretend to fidget with my bag. Once all the kids are outside, I open Joons bag, grabbed the only neopet I could find (rare ball-shaped one with two legs) and head back to main room. I start acting all sick, they buy into it, sign me out and call my dad. \n\nI'm homefree. I see his car outside and run into it as fast as I can, and before I know it i'm at home playing with this kids neopet. I just pulled off one of my first heists in my life, and i'm on cloud 9. \n\nturns out, he traded all his neopets to some con-kid for that rare blue one.

{"body": "&gt; nexus fanboys who gulp the Google BS that SD cards are not needed because of the cloud.\n\nTo me, its always been more of a usability problem, being required to fiddle with SD card. I know most people who uses SD card don't mind the extra effort, but its still a little hassle that could be avoided. Same goes to Apple I believe.\n\nNever have I seen anywhere did Google mention to use the cloud instead, maybe some fanboys have mentioned that, but its always the ignorant ones who assume Google stance to be \"use the cloud\". \n\nHere's the [answer from Matias Duarte (in one of his replies)](https://plus.google.com/+MatiasDuarte/posts/JAAMUzx1PFX):\n&gt; Why don’t Nexus devices have SD cards?\n\n&gt; Everybody likes the idea of having an SD card, but in reality it's just confusing for users.\n\n&gt;If you’re saving photos, videos or music, where does it go? Is it on your phone? Or on your card? Should there be a setting? Prompt everytime? What happens to the experience when you swap out the card? It’s just too complicated.\n\n&gt;We take a different approach. Your Nexus has a fixed amount of space and your apps just seamlessly use it for you without you ever having to worry about files or volumes or any of that techy nonsense left over from the paleolithic era of computing.\n\n&gt;With a Nexus you know exactly how much storage you get upfront and you can decide what’s the right size for you. That’s simple and good for users.\n\n&gt;Good questions! Keep 'em coming!﻿\n\nSo I'm not sure where the cloud storage argument comes from. You agreeing on his stance or not, is another matter, but they never mentioned to use cloud storage.\n\nIt doesn't even make sense to begin with, for most people cloud storage isn't feasible on the go, so why the fuck would they think that's a good idea? Its a strawman argument.\n\nAs for the Kit Kat issue, its more of a security measurement that gets HEAVILY misinterpreted as Google going against SD card usage. [Have a read about it here](http://www.androidcentral.com/kitkat-sdcard-changes). Some quotes: \n\n&gt; The other side of the coin is that Jerry's Not Awesome App that steals your data no longer has write access to every file and folder on the SD card. Yes, previously any application that declared permission to read and write to the SD card was allowed to write files to any folder — including your system folders, and any folder something like a banking app might have made. Any type of file, too. That includes files that could be read when another app starts up and affect the settings or way that app works. It was a complete and total security nightmare, and why a lot of people — including yours truly — did not want phones with SD cards.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414944212", "subreddit": "Android", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The other one I really enjoyed, which I originally deleted from my first post in this thread because it wasn't really urban fantasy, was *Daughter of the Empire* by Janny Wurts and Raymond Feist. Not only was it set in a non-Eurocentric setting, but it really delved into what it means to be a woman in a patriarchal society and hold your own against the domination of masculine values, while *still* retaining femininity. It got a lot right, but it wasn't urban fantasy enough to recommend right here.\n\nWith the ocean liner, I was just on a cruise, and the inside of the ship was so sealed off from the outside that you could just forget you were on a moving ship (although there were obviously outlets onto the deck, most of the time we were at sea it was dark anyway so we rarely ventured out on deck while sailing. While we were in harbour we were in European container ports, which kind of ruins the romantic atmos). I could imagine the guests on the inside being totally oblivious to the captain and crew battling something external, be it a mundane storm or a magical monster. The idea I had the other night when I was struggling for an extra dimension was that someone else on the inside of the ship was trying to keep the guests calm - and thought about using subtle magic to accomplish that.\n\nI'd also wanted to write a story about the Loch Ness Monster, or equivalent, so thought I'd combine them in one.

{"body": "&gt; Christian here, and I am honestly looking to find what atheists believe is the best evidence against christianity or the Bible. \n\nThe best *argument* against it is that there is no credible evidence to support it in the first place. This might not agree with your current thinking but I will politely challenge you to come up with the best evidence you think demonstrates that Jesus is/was the Earthly avatar of the creator of the universe. \n\nThe bible itself is not evidence. The bible is the claim. Consider that there is no evidence outside the bible from the time the bible takes place that supports the existence of Jesus. All the mentions of Jesus outside the bible occur many decades after he was supposed to have lived. Worse, the gospel accounts are anonymous.\n\nWe know enough about the history of the bible from a literary perspective to know that it was written by men. (See my notes at the bottom of this comment.) What you think of the bible today is a collection of documents that was edited and copied repeatedly, then voted on by the Council of Nicaea - some books were omitted from the canon even though they are referenced by *other* books in the bible that *are* canon. \n\nA few things worth pointing out:\n\n* If you accept evolution, then there was no first human. If this is the case, then where did original sin come from?\n* The Exodus did not happen. Even Jewish religious scholars almost universally agree that the evidence that should be there just isn't.\n* Think about why Mary and Joseph had to *travel* in order to be counted for the census. Romans were far more efficient than that and were interested in where people lived, and not where they were born. The short answer is that the prophecy required Jesus to be born in Bethlehem, so the census was used as an excuse to explain why he was born there and not in Nazareth, where his parents lived. The bible is *filled* with these kinds of odd things.\n\nThose are three things off the top of my head. Here's [one list that has many more](http://infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html). Another [list](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Biblical_contradictions). One [more](http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Biblical_contradictions).\n\nIn the end though, there's no credible evidence for *anything* supernatural in any religions. I don't believe in Jesus or Yahweh or Zeus or bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster for the same reasons - no credible, compelling evidence.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nSome additional resources as I think of them.\n\n* [A History of God](http://www.amazon.com/History-God-000-Year-Judaism-Christianity/dp/0345384563) by Karen Armstrong. Summarised in video form [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlnnWbkMlbg). Details how Yahweh went from being one god in the Hebrew pantheon to the one true god of Abraham. There originally were several gods mentioned in the books that would become the bible, but were replaced by Yahweh. This explains a lot of really unusual things about Yahweh as a literary character. For instance, the first commandment suddenly makes sense - it was intended to cement the supreme authority of Yahweh in a time when many people were polytheists.\n\n* Check out Bart Ehrman's work, such as [Misquoting Jesus](http://www.amazon.com/Misquoting-Jesus-Bart-D-Ehrman-ebook/dp/B000SEGJF8). It's a great introduction to textual analysis. \n\n* Lastly, if you're still here and have not angrily closed your browser window in frustration, I strongly urge you to check out Qualia Soup's video titled [The Burden of Proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KayBys8gaJY). It demonstrates why it is *your* job to support your claims, rather than it is our job to disprove them. The person who makes a claim (ie, a god exists) is the person responsible for providing support for that claim.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415027915", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Must have been 7 or 8 years ago now. I was over from the UK visiting some friends who’d moved over a few years previous. It was Halloween and I was told this wsa too good an opportunity to miss, I just had to see the kind of things American girls wear and get up to when they do Halloween. Being UKish my experience of Halloween was punk kids of about 14 wearing no discernible costume knocking on your door demanding sweets and/or monies in exchange for not stabbing you or pebble dashing your house with eggs and flour. After a couple of hours my eyes were certainly opened to a better way of living. We were hitting the bars pretty hard along the quayside when I become detached from the group and find myself alone.    \n  \n  \nI stumbled into the nearest bar behind, thinking they must have gone in and left me to wander on oblivious as I was no doubt away with the fairies and gawping at the latest slutty cat costume to cross my path. After entering and a couple of minutes of investigation it was pretty obvious that this wasn’t the place they had ended up and as I turn to leave and bump into this smoking hot 10, (her rating, not her age) She was the type that makes you think “Lord, have mercy, what a damn fine day to be alive.” All thoughts of my long lost friends and a reunion of beer and ogling wenches disintegrate and I have my goal for the evening, to nail that slutty looking thang in that Girl Scout uniform. I muster up some words as an apology and offer to top up her drink that I just spilt and let her know I’m too embarrassed to just ask to buy her a drink so pretty much have to knock it out of her hand to find an excuse to talk to her. This hardly ever works outside of the times I practise on Lord Huffington Boo-Boo but she’s happy enough to let me get her a drink. Back of the net. We wander over to the bar and get to talking for a while.  \n  \n  \nI have the accent and I’m using all my charm and it’s only bloody working. The night heads on and muchos tequila later things only improve. She whispers over and I’ve done it, we’re heading back to hers. I can’t believe my luck, things like this never happen and if they do they never go well, I’m expecting to go home to find her husband waiting for us with a knowing wry smile on his face and the loch ness monster tucked between his legs or a tribe full of kids running riot over the house or to get her undressed to find the last turkey in the shop staring back at me from betwixt her legs but the longer I’m there and the more we carry on as we left off in the bar the more I start to relax,  I was close to crying it was going that well. I didn’t really do her justice earlier, I said a 10 but damn this girl was fine. Brunette, cute little pigtails, drawn on freckles and most importantly, a lovely personality. Who the fuck are we kidding? Most importantly she legs up to her fucking arse, they just seemed to go on and on and on. You took so long to gawp at her from ankle to head that she seemed 20m tall (7 or 8 stories tall I guess for the American inclined).    \n  \n\n  \nThings start getting really steamy and I decide to work her up with a little mouth on neck action (kissing her neck,) immediately I’m taken aback,  it was dry, almost scaly to the lips, I pull away slightly for an instant, but fuck, a bit of eczema isn’t going to put me off now. I’ve a raging clue and other than some dry skin this bitch has it all. She pushes me back on to the sofa and undoes my belt and uses one hand to work loose my buttons whilst using the other to expertly slip herself out of her evening’s slutty attire. Cue her jam on the radio and she’s grinding away all over me. I’m getting the best lap dance of my life, shit aint getting much better than this. Then it hits me, it might be the quayside from earlier but most likely it’s coming from her, a faint waft of marine. Fuck it, we were out in sweaty bars, she’s probably been dancing, she’s not at her freshest. “Sit back and take it like a solider, soldier, you really going to bottle this? Just what the shit are you doing, if this girl had one arm you’d still give one of yours to nail the rest of her, what are two mild irritations of the skin?” I must have stopped moaning and voicing my approval to her weavings and bobs whilst I was mentally battling myself to stay in the moment as she bends down and slaps General Todge into her mouth and starts rolling me around her mouth as my eyes reciprocate.    \n  \n  \n5 or so minutes of pure ecstasy later and I’m close to blowing my beans, by this point with enough force to simulate Niagara falls from the majority of her orifices at once. I’m no love expert but I’m thinking if this is it I’ve put up a bit of a poor show and there’s no way any of this is happening again during my fleeting visit across the pond if the most I’ve done is get a bit yucked out by her neck and a waft or five of what’s usually a pleasant lunch with some mayo, ‘cumber and a couple of bits of bread, and blown half a pale of man goo out of her nose. How un-British of me, stiff upper lip old boy. I pull away and gesture her up towards me. She moves on up and bends down over me, looking at me with her big eyes, waiting for my move “your turn,” I ask, “what would you like? What do you want from me?” she whispered softly in my ear “I need about a tree fiddy.”", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415028601", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

Among the faces on the mountain, you can now see Kakashi's face next to Tsunade's, as the sixth Hokage. Cut to a hooded figure walking toward the front gate of Konoha wearing a cloak. The hooded figure makes his way through the front entrance and removes the hood. \n\nIt's Sasuke. \n\nAlmost immediately, some children run up to Sasuke shouting \"Sasuke-sensei!\" and asking him how his trip went. Sasuke smiles softly and engages the children for a bit before asking them if they've seen Naruto. They tell him the last they saw of him, he was heading to the Hokage's office to speak to Kakashi about something. Sasuke bids the children farewell and makes his way through Konoha to the Hokage's office.\n\nAlong the way, Sasuke observes the village and the people whose lives he, only a few years ago, wanted to utterly destroy. Cue Sasuke feeling regretful. He continues on his way.\n\nAfter making it to the office, he stops right before he opens the door into it. He can hear voices. Among them, one stands out as much more animated than the others. Sasuke knows who it is and smiles to himself before opening the door. In the room stands Kakashi, in his Hokage outfit, Sakura, in her jonin outfit, and Naruto, in his The Last outfit.\n\nNaruto lights up and walks over to Sasuke and they fist bump and begin catching up immediately, as Sasuke has been gone for a number of months on a mission for Konoha. Interrupted by Kakashi, who thinks Sasuke should debrief him on the results of his mission before doing anything else, Sasuke politely refuses and asks if he and Naruto can get some ramen before the debrief. Kakashi obliges and the two of them go off to eat.\n\nThey arrive at Ichiraku Ramen and order their meals, while talking and joking about old times with each other. Both seem to be very happy to have the other by their side. All the while, Ramen Guy observes the two with kind eyes, glad to see Naruto finally has his best friend back. The two finish their meal and Naruto offers to pay for Sasuke's meal, as a welcome back gift. Naruto looks to Ramen Guy and asks how much it'll be, since they essentially cleaned out his whole shop of food. Ramen Guy looks them both up and down, sighs, smiles and says \"I'll need about tree fiddy.\" It was at this point that Naruto and Sasuke both realize that this was not, in fact, Ramen Guy, but an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era.\n\nIn unison, they both shout \"God damn it, Nessy, we ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" And Naruto transforms into his Nine Tails chakra mode and Sasuke brings out his Susanoo, and the final battle between Naruto, Sasuke and the Loch Ness Monster finally begins.\n\nTo Be Continued In The Last.", "gilded": 2, "created_utc": "1415035289", "subreddit": "Naruto", "score": 757, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My head felt groggy as I looked around the classroom. Everyone around is staring at me, each having their own strange look plastered across their face and a few with phones recording everything. I slowly got off the floor and looked around. I was in nothing but my underwear.\n\nAnd then I realized that this wasn’t real life. I didn’t even have any memory of getting here, a clear sign that this was a dream. And so, now that I was lucid, I decided to have some fun. I pointed at the teacher, trying to make her strip, but my dream control wasn’t working. So instead I made my way over to the girl I liked and kissed her, to which she shoved me away and spat. That was when I realized that this wasn’t a dream, which means everything I’d just done was in front of everyone.\n\n“What, what happened?” I croaked, finding my throat to be rather dry.\n\n“You ran into the classroom,” the teacher began, “in nothing but your underwear, spouting something about aliens, abductions, loch ness monsters, and tin hats. I think you need to go see the nurse.”\n\nIt felt like the world was spinning around me. I didn’t understand what was happening. And then the memories came flooding back. There was the risk of temporary amnesia, which apparently I experienced. Wait, what temporary amnesia? How did I even know that?\n\nWith my head hung down in shame I made my way to the nurse, but as I left the classroom I heard a girl shout out to the teacher and then catch up with me.\n\n“Name’s Tiffany,” she said. “I’m going to escort you to the nurses’s office.”\n\n“I, uh…” I started, but before I could finish she pushed me into a secluded corner and held her hand against my mouth.\n\n“Look, I know you’re coming off the reentry amnesia, but you’ve got to get it together,” she said. “I’d hate to see my father get mad that you’re ruining his plans for colonizing Earth.”\n\nShe took her hand off my mouth as I remembered everything. Her eyes glowed green for a minute, and I realized that I had been abducted by aliens last night. They were slowly abducting humans and replacing them, but this girl alien had taken a liking to me, so her father, commander of the aliens, decided to spare me. When I got back, I ran to warn everyone, but then the reentry amnesia I got from coming through the teleporter kicked in. When they were performing experiments on me, I was left in only my underwear, which also helped to explain that part of my predicament.\n\n“Oh, before I go, don’t forget to wear a tin hat,” she said. “You’ll need one seeing as though you’re half human.”\n\n“What now?” I asked, surprised.\n\n“Daddy would never let me date a human, so I had them add some alien DNA while they experimented on you. You’re half alien now. Oh, and also, don’t go kissing any other girls on me like you did in there. You had amnesia, so I’ll let it slide. Same goes for trying to get your teacher to strip. Yes, we aliens can read minds.”\n\nWhen I finally got back to class, having used the excuse the aliens gave me about a bad drug interaction, I noticed something odd. Our previously young, attractive teacher was now old and wrinkly. Also, there was now an empty desk where someone had sat earlier. The rest of the class was full, but for the life of me I couldn’t remember who used to sit there. I watched as Tiffany licked her fingers like she had just ate something delicious and realized soon that the classroom would be full of aliens. I turned my attention back to the teacher, who I couldn’t help but notice looked tasty.

This is more of a declarative statement.  \n\n - Basically this does NOT allow for the existence of gods.\n\nThe former can have a range of definitions arguably including [but not necessarily limited to.]:\n\n - \"I reject a belief structure centered around deities\", i.e. Its possible for the devil to acknowledge a God without believing in Him.  This more of a rejection of a declarative statement.  This allows for the existence of Gods - Probably not the intention of /u/sylvan,\n\nand\n\n - \"I do not confirm the existence of Gods\"  This is the same way that, I do not confirm the existence of unicorns, dodo birds, and Russell's Teapot.  This is a less declarative statement that rejects one's inclusion in a group of theists.\n\nEssentially, if I were to use popular terms, respectively, I'd have:  Atheist, Heretic, and Agnostic. [These term assignments are questionable, but only used as placeholders, not definitions.]\n\nNow the part of the wiki I referred to, read:\n\n&gt;Atheism is, in a broad sense, the rejection of belief in the existence of deities. In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Most inclusively, atheism is the absence of belief that any deities exist.\n\n    Atheism is, in a broad sense, the rejection of belief in the existence of deities.\n\nThis includes Atheists, excludes the heretic, and may include the Agnostic.\n\n    In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.\n\nThis includes Atheists, excludes heretics, and the strength of this statement excludes the agnostic.  [There is no \"Loch Ness Monster\" is a logically different phrase from \"I don't believe there is a Loch Ness Monster.\"]\n\n    Most inclusively, atheism is the absence of belief that any deities exist.\n\nThis includes the Atheist and Agnostic, and excludes the Heretic.\n\nI understand that this may not have been /u/sylvan's intention when he posted it, but the topic he posted about was whether \"Atheism\" encompassed both statements.  I'd argue that, possible reasonable interpretations of his statements that fall outside of definitions of atheism would disprove his point.  \n\nThusly, Anyone subscribing to the position \"I do not believe in God(s)\" is not necessarily an Atheist.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415048968", "subreddit": "intj", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Daughter of the Empire by Janny Wurts and Raymond Feist. \n\n\"Yes! I found this on Google Play,\" is what I wrote as I clicked on the book. Then it didn't load and apparently, though it is listed, it's not available. \n\nI have a door in my mind that I slammed shut years ago and it whispers, \"Raymond Feist. Raymond Feist.\" If I stay there long enough, I can hear, \"You chicken.\" That guy scared the bejesus out of me with the beginning of *Faerie Tale*. I dropped it and never picked it up again, he touched a nerve I didn't know I had exposed. \n\nYou must be on the amazon payroll, you're making Google Play look like a crappy bookshop ;) \n\n&gt;I could imagine the guests on the inside being totally oblivious to the captain and crew battling something external, be it a mundane storm or a magical monster. The idea I had the other night when I was struggling for an extra dimension was that someone else on the inside of the ship was trying to keep the guests calm - and thought about using subtle magic to accomplish that.\nI'd also wanted to write a story about the Loch Ness Monster, or equivalent, so thought I'd combine them in one. My first idea was for a kind of Godzilla mash-up, and I still might write that one later on.   \n\nI've found that the best ideas come from combining two already existing ones. That has been my experienced so far. Never has a story come as a full package but rather in small parcels. After a while one parcel fuses with another one and bam -- a better idea emerges. \n\nI wish you the best of luck with your story.  \n\nEdited to add: Yay! I have the sample for *Daughter of the Empire*. Apparently the Play store has hiccups when downloading books from the browser.

{"body": "Oh man. Did I do this big time.\n\nSo it's freshman year of college, fall semester. Classes have been super easy and I'm cruising on the way to a 4.0. Today's the last day of regular class before exams start, and all I have left to do is deal with my freshman orientation class - mine was about comic books. I took it because like, I would assume, most of reddit, I've read some comics in a lot of different areas, expecting this to be more in depth discussions of themes, cultural values, and why the \"graphic novel\" is different, but no worse than the novel. I had even heard talk of reading The Watchmen.\n\nThis was not that class. This dude was a huge fan of Tintin, especially the 1930s comics run. The Watchmen was a *different* freshman orientation, and this was to introduce the basic bitch to comic books. We had homework one night to read about speech bubbles. Speech. Bubbles.\n\nSo final project rolls around and my group decides to talk about Jack Kirby. Still a little older than I'd like [I still hadn't developed a taste for older comics yet, but I still appreciated the dude and what he did] and I'm tasked with doing his biography and a little bit of his work from early on in his career. I shoot that shit up and finish the presentation by 10am the day of, my class was at 5pm that afternoon so that was plenty of time to kick back, relax, and play Doom 3, which someone in my dorm had given me to play.\n\nNow I did shoot it off to my groupmates, but what I hadn't done was given myself a timer or anything else to remind myself that *I should probably go to class today*. Literally all I have to do to get a perfect 4.0 that semester is SHOW UP. You can see where this is going.\n\nSo I finish the game [it was a little longer than I'd like] and go to dinner, all the while something scratching the back of my head going \"hey. hey. you forgot something.\" without telling me what it is, like Neville Longbottom with the Remberall. I push it out of my mind and sit down to eat, *AT THAT EXACT MOMENT* my class lets out and they all go to the cafeteria to eat dinner. This is where you cue the \"oh shit\" moment in my brain, and my heart drops.\n\n\"Where were you, hailmary?\"\n\"Uhhhhhhhhh....will you believe me if I say I forgot to show up?\"\nMy group mates look at each other and go \"yeah but the prof was pretty pissed.\"\n\nRush home to get to my laptop, and sure enough, waiting in my inbox is an email titled: \"Where were you?\"\n\nFull freak out, I type a long page describing I had forgotten, had sent in my presentation so that I wouldn't have to do it later but that made me forget, I'm super sorry, and if there's any way to I can make it up so that I can still make my grade. I had been there every day and participated a lot, so was there any way that he could help me out?\n\nProblem was, this dude was also in school for his PhD. It took him FOUR DAYS to respond to my email. FOUR. FUCKING. DAYS. FOUR DAYS for my poor, virgin heart to deal with the idea that I had fucked up so hard.\n\nAnd then he replied. I opened the email, nervous, but ready, and inside was only one line: \"Sure, but you'll have to give me tree fiddy.\"\n\nedit \nin all reality I had to write a 5 page paper on Tintin.\nI hate Tintin.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415145021", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey, I didn't realize Britain was in the title, I've been there too! I went there a while ago so I don't remember it as vividly. Hopefully this comment will be shorter than my other, but since I'm trying to put off studying right now there's a good chance I'll just droll on and on again anyway.\n\nMy favorite spot in England was York. It's a very old city, and you can take tours of ancient Viking, Roman, and medieval ruins in the city. I have so many good memories of the city, but one of the best was this ghost tour we took, where a guy would bring a small group around the city at twilight and tell us ghost stories at all the haunted buildings. It wasn't one of those cheesy ones where people try to jump out and scare you, and the stories often involved the incredible history of the city. If the Haunting York tours are still going on there, I would absolutely recommend you do it.\n\nBath, England was a really beautiful city as well. I believe it was pretty major when the Romans were kickin' around in England, and there are still these huge, open Roman baths all over the city. I remember thinking it was really cool to see such big Roman-looking architecture in England.\n\nLondon has some cool old stuff but we didn't see anything worth mentioning that you wouldn't find on every single tourist website and brochure about London.\n\nIf you're gonna get to Scotland as well, you should go see Edinburgh. It has a huge castle on the hill in the center of town that was pretty cool (though I don't think there were any shops or restaurants in it like there were in Carcassonne). There was also this really great tour that you can take of the medieval streets underneath the city. This was great, and they will tell you all about the history of the time period, the black plague and all that, but if you get claustrophobic then I wouldn't recommend it; the streets were so narrow and the roof was so low i had to bail half way through the tour.\n\nThere was a small town in Scotland with a big castle/mansion on a hill that we actually stayed in, but for the life of me I can't remember what it was called. I tried searching on Google, but apparently there are loads of castles in Scotland that you can stay in. It was a pretty cool experience though, so if you can afford it then maybe look around to see if you can get a room in a castle (I'm sure there are castles in England, France and Italy that also rent out rooms). \n\nLastly, I loved seeing Loch Ness. There wasn't too much historical stuff to see there, but it's a beautiful place and the legend of the Loch is so ingrained in Scottish history that it is pretty interesting to soak up all the culture of the area (I was a big fan of the Loch Ness Monster back then).\n\nTl;Dr: Visit York, England to see medieval, viking, and Roman ruins all in one (as well as some badass ghost stories). Bath, England has really huge Roman architecture all over the city. Edinburgh, Scotland has a huge castle in the middle of it, and tours of the medieval ruins under the streets. Loch Ness is great if you're interested in the history of myths in Scotland. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415224008", "subreddit": "AncientCivilizations", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, op, let me regale you with a story of me and my stepsister. Sit tight, little ones, as this is a story for the many ages to come. \n\nAlright, so lets begin. When I was 17, my parents were having a rough time with their marriage. They began fighting alot, and I for one, could not stop them from doing so. They eventually got a divorce and I was devastated. My dad began drinking alot and was soon deemed unfit to have a child in his possession, so I was shifted to living with my mom. \n\nA month after I moved in, my mom got a boyfriend. He was a nice guy with a son and a daughter. A year after, they got married. By this time, my dad had fully recovered from his alcoholic breakdown and I occasionally visited him. \n\nI had a girlfriend up until a week before IT happened. She was a sweet girl who was also smart, but broke up with me for another guy. I was devastated. So, I turned to my new step siblings for help, as I had no siblings of my own. My stepbrother, James (not real name) said that I should forget about her and move on (he was the kind of guy like Kamina from Gurren Lagann, if any of you know what that is.) and Rachel, my stepsister, said that she felt bad for me and tried to comfort me all she could.\n\nRachel was another nice girl. Not the brightest, but still getting by with a nice job. I had always just thought of her as my stepsister, until she did something that changed my view of her forever.\n\nIt was a week after I broke up with my girlfriend, who, that day, announced she was trying to have a baby with her boyfriend. Keep in mind that they have only been going out for a week. I was appalled by this and told Rachel. She sat next to me and we talked for a little while. Our parents and her brother went to dinner that night. And not five minutes after they left, she puts her hand on my crotch area. I ask her what she's doing, and she says that she's trying to comfort me. I try to explain to her that this is a bad idea while she's unzipping my pants, and she says to shut up and let it happen. She then wraps her mouth around my dick. Damn, it feels good. This goes on for about five minutes, getting progressively harder and faster. She then suddenly jerks away from my crotch, looks me in the eyes and says that we should fuck. I say that that is going too far, but she convinces me. And just as I'm about to side my cock into her, she says that she needs something from me. I say that I'll do anything for her.

{"body": "You have been criticized for your \"integers\" example. Allow me to explain why physical verification of integers is inappropriate.\n\n&gt;From the rather remarkable but seemingly uncontroversial fact that mathematics is indispensable to science, some philosophers have drawn serious metaphysical conclusions. In particular, Quine and Putnam have argued that **the indispensability of mathematics to empirical science gives us good reason to believe in the existence of mathematical entities**. According to this line of argument, reference to (or quantification over) mathematical entities such as sets, numbers, functions and such is indispensable to our best scientific theories, and so **we ought to be committed to the existence of these mathematical entities.**\n\n[SEP: \"Indispensability Argument.\"](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathphil-indis/)\n\nThis is a serious position held by professionals on the physical existence of mathematical entities; the debate is quite alive in mathematics academia. (I usually have a boner for WVO Quine.) You seem to accept that numbers exist. Now consider the other side:\n\n&gt;In [the view of Hartry Field], **it is possible to explain successful applications of mathematics with no commitment to mathematical objects.** Therefore, what he takes to be the main argument for platonism, which relies on the (apparent) indispensability of mathematics to science, is resisted. The nominalist nature of Field's account emerges from the fact that **mathematical objects are not assumed to exist.** Hence, mathematical theories are false. (Strictly speaking, Field notes, **any existential mathematical statement is false**, and any universal mathematical statement is vacuously true.) ... Prima facie, it may sound counterintuitive to state that ‘there are infinitely many prime numbers’ is false. But **if numbers do not exist, that's the proper truth-value for that statement.**\n\n[SEP: \"Nominalism in the Philosophy of Math\", section 3: Fictionalism.](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nominalism-mathematics/#MatFic)\n\nFor clarity, \"platonism\" is the view that numbers are real entities, whether they be physical or abstract.\n\nA person naive of the rich field of philosophy of math will typically run with the view most copacetic to their worldview, whether they are atheists or christians. Generally speaking, most New Atheists are skeptics, and most skeptics resist all unsupported assertions of the *physical existence* of entities (e.g. Loch Ness Monster, God, the holy spirit, numbers). Having never read Quine or Putnam, they will be unaware of attempts to ground the existence of numbers. They will fall back on their preconceived notions until further notice, because prematurely accepting the existence of nonexistent objects can lead you into epistemic trouble. (For a thought exercise, try presupposing that Justice is a real physical entity, then try to do moral philosophy.)\n\nI hope I have shown that, in the absence of a consensus, atheists are more likely to lean towards nominalism (numbers do not exist) than they are towards platonism (numbers are real). It is therefore ineffective to use the example of \"physically verifying\" that there are infinite integers (in the sense that one must set a Turing computer to run infinitely many clock cycles in finite time) as an analogy to \"physically verifying\" the existence of presumably real, physical objects.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415286533", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Well let me ask you this. Can you disprove God/Allah/Yahweh other than by saying you've received no proof?\n\nNo, it's an unfalsifiable hypothesis. It cannot be proved untrue. Neither can the existence of fairies or the Loch Ness Monster. The burden of proof lies with those making the positive claim.\n\n&gt;For instance I believe there is a God and I believe every religion essentially worships the same god by a different name and interpreted differently by different people. I have no proof for any of this but I choose to believe it. I also believe in evolution, sexual equality, and the right of choice for pregnant women but I have no proof those beliefs are right, just that they feel right to me.\n\nSexual equality and the right of choice are subjective matters of opinion - they have no 'right answer'. Whether or not evolution happened or whether or not a deity exists are objective matters - there is a right or a wrong answer. Currently the best method we have to determine what is and is not true is science. Science is proven to be demonstrably reliable when finding out the validity of a claim. Through science, we have learnt that evolution is a demonstrable fact of reality, because we have overwhelming evidence to suggests that it exists.\n\nThe idea that a supernatural being exists is an extraordinary claim. And extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. 'A feeling' that it exists is not extraordinary evidence - in fact, it is not evidence at all. Intuition is *incredibly* unreliable - humans are very prone to hallucination and delusion, and often they will convince themselves that something is true just because it feels more comforting to them. 'Feelings' have never - ever - been shown to be reliable ways of determining the validity of things about objective reality. This is precisely why we have tools like science and empirical enquiry to help us.\n\nYou can believe whatever you want to - but don't expect anyone to take you seriously if you make claims about objective reality that you cannot justify in any way other than the incredibly weak answer \"I have a feeling that it's true\". Why should anyone listen to a man that claims Elvis Presley is still alive because he 'has a feeling' that he is?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415290577", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had a mate who used to make up such stupid, ludicrous stories.\n\nI'll call him Dan (for 'twas his name) and basically, Dan was full of shit. It was the typical teenage-fantasist bullshit; his dad was friends with Bill Gates so he had access to mythical, prototype operating systems on his computer (it never occurred to him that owning a Mac and not a PC was quite a giveaway on this one)\n\nDan was in the early stages of signing a contract with, among others, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool... None of us had ever seen him kick a football, much less express any talent at it- he wasn't even on the school football team- yet these top clubs were all apparently queuing up to sign him at the tender age of 13. Not for their youth squads either. Oh no, Dan was going straight into the starting XI, *this weekend, in the Premier League.*\n\nOh, Dan was also related to the Sultan of Brunei. Not only could he boast one of the worlds richest men as a close family friend, but *the* richest man in the world was his fucking *uncle.* A supermodel girlfriend naturally was provided for him (not sure what his girlfriend who was in the same class as us would have made of that one) and for his 14th birthday he was given the keys to a brand new Maserati. When I asked to go for a ride in is car, he reminded me that he didn't have a driving licence yet. Further questioning revealed that, unfortunately, he had written the car off whilst racing against the Stig on the *Top Gear* test track. Miraculously, he walked away completely unscathed.\n\nFor a kid that boasted such an impressive circle of rich friends and relatives, Dan always seemed to be broke. I mean we were kids, I only got a fiver a week pocket money. The same for my friends. Yet we still seemed to be richer than poor old Dan.\n\nSo Dan decided one day we would start our own business. We were going to float on the stock market, and we would be fantastically wealthy. It was, Dan said, too good to turn down - after all, Dan already headed several successful companies that he was bequeathed by another rich and famous uncle, but of course that money was *in trust* and he wouldn't see a penny of it until he turned 18. If we started our own company, with such a fantastic business brain as Dan's at the helm, we could be rich *now.*\n\nHe had it all worked out. Thankfully, I forget most of the details because to be quite honest, I had pretty much given up on listening to whatever it was that Dan had started prattling on about a week or so before. But I will always remember what he said next. Our financial futures were secure, he said, all we needed to do was to invest some money with him and he would take care of the rest. I pretended I couldn't hear him.\n\nHe repeated his request. Again, I ignored him. I hoped that if I didn't give him what he wanted, he would just go away.\n\nHe was becoming quite anxious and agitated. He seemed to be... Different. Before he had been a small, weedy kid but now he appeared quite intimidating and towered over me. I relented.\n\n\"What would I be expected to invest?\"\n\nHe didn't answer. He stepped closer to me, still silent.\n\nI said again; \"how much do you need?\" Something seemed off. I was becoming quite nervous by this point. What was Dan's real reasoning? Was he in trouble? Was he on drugs? Why did he *really* need money from me?\n\nHis eyes narrowed, and I hoped this time there would be an answer. A few seconds passed, only a few seconds I'm sure but they felt like minutes. He was breathing right on my face, his breath hot and acrid. He spoke, finally, breaking the silence.

{"body": "Not my story but a good one. Credit goes to /u/Thehealeroftri\n\n\nWhen I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms. She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet. His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name. Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.\n\nJoe didn't give a shit. He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either. Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom. His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\". His name was now legally Adam Adams. Why? All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\n\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe, my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it. He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember. But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage. The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me. Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son. This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\n\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on. She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does. My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story. She does. Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words). While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out.\n\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved. After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad. I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story. When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her. She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again. But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one.\n\n\ntl;dr: Friend's mom is an overprotective bitch, I get mad at her for being an overprotective bitch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415360477", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

She then told me she had heard someone answer back.  She had run upstairs but in his room was just my son, sitting in front of his closet.  I was convinced she had just imagined the other voice and went to the foot of the stairs myself to listen.  Sure enough I heard my son talking.  It seemed normal enough and was about to go back to the living room when I heard a deep man's voices moaning \"reeeeeee\".  Now I was freaked out and ran upstairs.  My son was sitting in front of the closet and I asked him who he was talking too.  He replied \"the monster\".  I asked him to make the voice again that said \"reeeee\" and he insisted that the voice wasn't his, but the monsters.  Then from somewhere deep in the closet I heard it again.  It sounded like the closet was 100 foot deep and the voice was coming closer and closer.  \"reeeee, REeeee, REEEE!

{"body": "&gt; \"some strands of American Christianity are conservative, and I don't like that\"\n\nIt seems like every word of this is a misrepresentation of how I actually feel. My complaint, first, is not that people are merely conservative. Coexistence would have been possible if they weren't also trying to establish conservative, Christian hegemony in America (and let me add, in other countries such as Russia and large areas in Africa). I do not care if my neighbor is conservative - I care if my neighbor votes to put a law into the state constitution that I cannot have a civil union in the state. There is a real difference between \"conservatives exist and I don't like that\" and \"conservatives are actively voting on my rights as a citizen.\"\n\nAnd I don't think the problem is that there are some \"strands.\" I have at other times bothered to look at the proportion of people who voted to make gay marriage/civil unions illegal, and the numbers are staggering. These aren't strands - they are more than half of voters, and they're overwhelmingly Christians who tell us that it's their Christianity that causes them to vote this way. More than half of the people I pass daily on the street (78% in my current state. It was only 60-something% in the previous).\n\nI'd point to the prohibition of stem cell research (in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, and Ireland), LGBT rights in Uganda and Africa in general (often but not solely under the aegis of Christianity), LGBT rights in Russia (the leaders of the ROC called gay marriage a sign of the apocalypse, Putin's anti-gay laws were widely praised, more than 90% report supporting recent laws), etc. If it were just the _existence_ of conservatives in some strands in America, I suppose you'd be right. But it's hardly the case. They're everywhere and they refuse not to meddle constantly.\n\nAnd yes, Christians are at the forefront of hampering science and healthy sexuality. Funding went through the floor this year and everyone knows that if you submit proposals with the wrong kind of science in it, you'll be on the wrong side of the government.

Kim Jong Un revealed Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il were still alive and were in fact immortal. The middle east is completely gone, and now just an extension of the Indian Ocean, which has been re-named the Lake America following the US getting tired of dealing with their shit.*\n\n*Mexico is completely run by drug lords and the wall between the US and Mexico is now made completely out of fire.*\n\n*Google's self-driving computer system now combined with Tesla's electric cars dominate the automobile market.

A handful of sustained fusion reactors power the entire world.*\n\n*Cell phones are now tiny cerebral implants, where you only need to concentrate to call someone, and video screen is projected into your brain's vision processing center. Virtual-self-image thing from the matrix ended up working out, in virtual space you exist how you imagine yourself.*\n\n*PC's are now quantum powered, and all components are small enough they fit on a watch. The watch sends a signal to your brain where you can enter PC Mode and you see virtual reality and interact by thinking.

{"body": "&gt; A few weeks ago, Scotland was a triumph for democracy, with ordinary voters seeing they could deliver hefty shocks to Westminster, but yesterday much of that glorious collective energy was frittered away on petulance and hypocrisy.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the daft furore over the Alex Salmond effigy it was business as usual on Twitter: instead of debate and campaign, it was once again about faux outrage, the desperate need to take offence, and ridiculous strings of exclamation marks.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Waterloo Bonfire Society assembled two huge models of Alex Salmond and even the most nippy Nationalist would have to admit they were impressive.\n&gt; \n&gt; How the second effigy was detonated\n&gt; \n&gt; As they were wheeled through the streets of Lewes, East Sussex County Council's foolishly tweeted about it and Twitter went crazy. People were offended and outraged. The media got the story and the whole thing escalated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some humourless folk even called the police. In this age of austerity and cuts, the over-stretched police were forced to attend to a dummy in a skirt and a cute monster in a hat.\n&gt; \n&gt; You might say the good people of Lewes are, in their fiery annual celebrations, conforming to a certain stereotype: the yokels in a provincial town gathering around a fire to scream, 'burn the witch!'\n&gt; \n&gt; But we're also acting to type by being dour and humourless about the Salmond effigy.\n&gt; \n&gt; And in amongst the complaints lurks hypocrisy. A quick search of this website shows there were attempts to burn an effigy of Thatcher at the embarrassing George Square death parties.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arguably, that was in far poorer taste than the Lewes affair. At least Salmond was in rude health. At least he was able to respond. At least he wasn't an old lady with dementia and grieving relatives.\n&gt; \n&gt; Besides, the Lewes bonfire has burned Cameron and Clegg effigies, and I'm sure most of us had a quiet chuckle about that. Where were the Scottish objections then? There were none but put a kilt on the thing and we start howling.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why? Is our sense of identity so fragile? Having narrowly lost - or narrowly won - the referendum do we feel divided and, so, a bit defensive?\n&gt; \n&gt; Alex Salmond has shown a sense of humour about the matter and I applaud him for that. He even seemed pleased to have been targeted, and he's right to view it as a sly compliment.\n&gt; \n&gt; They wouldn't burn the leader of the Welsh Assembly, would they? But no-one knows who that is, you say. Well, exactly.\n&gt; \n&gt; So let's laugh about it. Politics needs humour. It's one of this country's best methods for keeping our politicians in check. We're good at taking the pompous and powerful and reducing them via satire and caricature. It's an excellent way of reminding politicians that we can yank them back to earth when we choose.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, there's already an excellent method for doing that - the ballot box - but many of us just can't be bothered on polling day, can we? That's why satire and mockery of politicians exists and why it should never be shouted down. That daft kilted dummy represents freedom of speech.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I must reach for something on which to pin the silly outrage, then I could say the effigy was insensitive, as the indyref result is still fresh and painful for many but, even then, turning your anger on a dummy merely trivialises what the campaign and its outcome meant to you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Isn't the Yes movement bigger than that? Can it be so easily dented by a celebration in a distant provincial town?\n&gt; \n&gt; You could also argue the inclusion of Nessie transformed the effigy into something which wasn't just anti-Salmond but was anti-Scotland.\n&gt; \n&gt; But even then, in a world troubled by Ebola and Isis and poverty, I just can't get offended by a monster in a jaunty cap.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415442258", "subreddit": "Scotland", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

That escalated quickly, so to the top with you, because I lost it at this post, because this is why we can't have nice things.\nIn other words, faith in humanity restored, whoa / mind = blown. Also, many tears were shed cutting onions because I know that feel bro. It hit right in the feels while being a risky click. Yep, nailed it because of you. I like you. I regret that I only have one upvote to give, because they cost around tree fiddy. But I was not disappointed.\nWait, why do I have you tagged as this post is tagged? What did I just read? Dafaq? How is this WTF? Seriously, YOU HAD ONE JOB. And because of this, I can't fap to this. It's totally not my cakeday, so whatever you're doing, stahp. For science.\nOkay, that's enough internet for me today. -2/10 would not bang or even hug. Really, what is this I don't even... /r/circlejerk[1] must be leaking. Better lawyer up, delete my Facebook, and hit the gym... Said no one ever. I do have the weirdest boner right now, though. However, directions were unclear, as my dick is now stuck in my own mouth, as I laughed much harder than I should have. It's almost like Reddit is thousands of different people with thousands of different opinions.\nBut, get ready for this. Plot twist: Step one: be attractive. Step two: don't be unattractive. Can confirm, I am attractive. I have two broken arms, a combox, a pair of cumboxers, a great jolly rancher, my cat Wednesday, a bag of Doritos, Colby, a bad case of Dagobah (Ass Injection Infection), a hambeast, a shitfisting potato, and vaginal bacon.\n\nEdit: wow I can't believe my top comment is about potentially being on the front page, even though it wasn't my first post. Thanks guys! Obligatory front page edit is over.\n\nEdit 2: REPOST (banana for scale), step 4: profit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415447295", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

Unfortunately the floor was so brittle on one board, when I stepped on it I fell through the floor. Rusty nails gouged my leg and tore my thigh. No one was with me so I had to take myself to the hospital. Once I arrived I promptly passed out from blood loss. The doctor came in and told me that he stitched up my legs, and I should be fine in that respect, but he needs to keep me while I recover. He then told me that he was worried about Tetanus and described to me how he gave me a shot anyway even though he didn't know if I already had it. This doctor seemed off... I don't know why. He kept insisting I pay for my hospital bill immediately. I explained that I would pay when I could leave. He didn't like that. He would give me dirty looks when he walked by my room, and I think he purposefully put bandages around my leg too tight and \"bumped\" my wounds. He *really* wanted that money. He even took my camera and said I can't have it until I leave. Then about the third day of recovery I snapped. I yelled and said \"Fine I'll pay your fucking hospital bill!\" He got a huge grin on his face. He was sketchy. He left and came in with the paperwork. I looked down and realized why he was so suspicious. The bill said \"Tree Fiddy\". That doctor was just that DAMN loch ness monster! He kept me for days just so he could get a few bucks.

{"body": "It is a caricature, a racist caricature. A massive part of the Lewes Bonfire is based around bigotry. Burning Alex Salmond along with nessie is racist because burning another culture's symbols is bigoted. Go burn an Anas Sarwar effigy holding a Quran, you'd be arrested for inciting religious hatred. Burning Angela Merkel doing a Nazi salute is racist because the only similarities between the leaders of Germany in 1936 and the leaders of Germany in 2014 is their nationality. Burning a gypsy caravan with the license plate P1KEY5 a few months after an actual Gypsy caravan was firebombed... Do I even have to explain that one? Then there's the [blackface](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B1tUZBDCQAA-Nmm.jpg) again pretty obviously racist. And that's not even starting on the anti-catholic hatred.\n\n\nAs for the David Cameron effigy being burned with the Houses of Parliament, as well as being an \"iconic cultural figure\" the Houses of Parliament is also where Parliament meets. The connection between David Cameron and the Houses of Parliament is that Dave is the leader of the House of Commons. On the other had the Scottish Government does not meet inside Nessie. The only connection between Nessie and Salmond is Scotland. The inference being Salmond is disliked for being Scottish, Cameron is disliked for being a politician.   \n\n\n* The only connection between Merkel and the Nazis is Germany. Merkel is disliked for being German. Disliking someone because of their nationality is tastless and potentially illegal\n\n* The only connection between Salmond and the Loch Ness monster is Scotland. Salmond is disliked for being Scottish. Disliking someone because of their nationality is tastless and potentially illegal\n\n* The main connection between Cameron and the Houses of \nParliament is politics. Cameron is disliked for being a Politician. Disliking someone because of their politics is rarely tastless or illegal\n\n* In 2003 a gypsy caravan had been firebombed and pubs in Lewes had begun putting 'No Travellers' signs in their windows, the 2003 Lewes bonfire featured a burning gypsy caravan complete with gypsy family and P1KEY5 license plate. The is clear hatred on racial grounds and completely indefensible \n\n* The Lewes bonfire is famous for burning effigies of the pope and parading through the streets with \"no popery\" banners. The town of Lewes is home to one of only 7 Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster (Founded by Ian Paisley) places of worship in England who's main reason for existing is to spread anti-catholic views. It is also home to one of the few Orange lodges in the South of England. \n\nFeel free to dislike Alex Salmond, but please don't let your feelings on Alex Salmond cloud your judgement of a festival which is based on spreading hatred based on religious and racial grounds ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415502394", "subreddit": "Scotland", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sorry in advance, but this is more of a story than an explanation.\n\nAt one sit down homestyle family restaurant I worked at in the past, there were these two ladies that would come and eat like once a week.  Every single time they came in, they would find a problem with their food and end up getting the meal for free or at a massive discount with coupons or an extra take home meal because they would put up a huge fuss.  This occurred time and time and time again, until my manager had finally had enough.  He was not giving them another free meal and he didn't give two shits whether they came back or not, because they never paid anyway.\n\nHe allowed me to offer to prepare a new meal for each of them to replace the one they had a problem with, but no discount.  I was the lucky guy that got to approach them.  When I got to the table I asked what the problem was with the food and I couldn't tell you what they said, but it was pretty much bullshit just to get a free meal.  I offered to prepare them another dish and even offered to give them a different dish than they had ordered.  They were not having it.\n\nAfter going back and forth and back and forth I finally said something like \"What is it going to make you happy today?  What can I do?  What can I give you, besides a free meal, that will make everything better?  What do you need from me?\"\n\nOne of the ladies looked at me with a very angry and cold expression and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that this woman was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

But I would never pursue a student sexually or romantically. Apparently, that feeling was not mutual. At first, things were like they usually were with stupid young girl crushing: double entendres, very subtle comments, etc. But there's a line, and she crossed it.\n\nShe wrote her number on an essay with a smiley face. This was not okay by any means. I immediately contacted an administrator so I wouldn't get in any trouble. These sorts of things are taken very seriously at pretty much any grade level these days, and I'm not interested in losing my job over some girl's hormones getting the best of her.\n\nSo a couple of days later, this administrator called a meeting with the parents. We were all in the office and the administrator was doing his spiel to the girl and her parents about appropriate behavior at school and appropriate age differences and the like (apparently this is a common enough issue that he had some training on how to have this kind of talk). She looked fairly ashamed, staring at the floor the whole time. He finished his rehearsed rant and then asked the parents if they had anything they wanted to say to the daughter. \n\nThe father was silent, but the mother spoke up. She said something about how the girl should know better and how they taught her better than this, etc. The usual parent reprimand stuff. But teenage girls can often find ways to surprise you. The mom asked her daughter, \"And what did you even expect would come of something like this?\" My student was quiet for a moment, looking down at the floor still, but then she turned to me, and I will never forget the way she looked at me when she said it: \"About tree fiddy.\" It was about this time I noticed that my student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I said, \"Damn it, monsta, get out of this office! I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!\"\n\nTL;DR Teenage girls are crazy", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1415625846", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1966, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That is my photo! It belonged to my father! He told me all about it just before he died.\n\n\nHe was born in Warsaw in 1934. At 8 years old his family almost escaped but were caught up in the turmoil and were eventually split up and sent to separate camps. He never saw his mother, father, or two sisters again.\n\n\nEverywhere in the forced labor camps they had pictures of Hitler. Angry Hitler, stern Hitler, smiling Hitler - Hitler 24/7 looking down on him. Judging him and all his fellow slave-laborers.\n\n\nThe picture OP found used to be hanging on the wall (like a Jesus portrait in some Catholic's dining room) in the barracks where they slept in row after row for triple-bunks. And only the luckiest ones actually got the bunks. Many had to sleep on the floor and try to avoid rat bites and having whatever meager scraps of food they could smuggle stolen by the other kids.\n\n\nEvery night my dad, too young to understand any better, would pray to that photo of Hitler, hoping to see his mother again. But his prayers went unanswered. Because he was reasonably skilled he eventually earned a leadership position among the inmates. He got better treatment, extra rations and was hated by the others. They thought he was a snitch and his life was always in danger, if not from the guards, from his other internees. It probably didn't help much that he always smiled at the photo of Hitler. Or maybe it did help - with the Germans - hard to say.\n\nAs he grew older his prayers weren't for deliverance or to see his family anymore. He didn't expect St. Hitler to deliver on either of those requests. His prayers became a curse. He would swear each morning to survive and outlive that \"paperhanging bastard\" (that's what Dad used to call him - Never by his name - It made more sense when I eventually learned Hitler was a wallpaper hanger before his rise to power).\n\nSurviving and outiving Hitler meant that my dad did, on occasion have to snitch on some inmates. He was not proud of this but felt it was his duty. The ones he ratted out were hurting other inmates, stealing, or making plans to escape - all of which would be bad for those, like himself, who were just trying to get out alive at the end.\n\nAnd when the camp was liberated Dad took that picture from the wall as a reminder of his prayers, promises and curses that kept him alive. He took that photo everywhere and mounted it where it would be the first thing he would see in the morning and the last thing he would see in the evening. It freaked my mom out at first, but once she understood it's story she got used to it, but never let visitors to our house see it. When I was little, I thought Hitler was my grandfather or an Uncle or something.\n\nAfter Mom passed dad moved into the flat where OP must have found that picture. Dad was struggling financially and could barely afford the rent. One day the landlord came and gave him horrible news - The rent was going up. I think the stress of that conversation is what caused his fatal heart attack. I remember it like yesterday. I knew it was going to end badly when Dad asked him how much the rent was going to be, and the landlord said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415636002", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": -12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade in High School I took a psychology class, one of our assignments was to do an amateur psychology experiment on some people or someone we knew.\nThere was this girl in the class, lets call her Amy, Amy was a really good friend of mine but she was also fine as hell. At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward. And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.\nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward. So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, Thehealeroftri, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\"\nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"\nEveryone in the hall heard. The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.\nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.\nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"\nWat.\nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying.\nA few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.\nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.\nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered. I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.\n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her. Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"\nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her. She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"\nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\" I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.\nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear. This is great.\nIt slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time. After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life.\nWe're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\"\nI personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time. Then she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\" The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\"\nShe says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.\nI stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.\nAs for my psychology project, I never did get it done, and instead dropped the class because of the terrible memories it had given me. To this day I hate reading about Psychology in general.\n\nCourtesy of /u/Thehealeroftri", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415676940", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Finally a topic I can share on! This is the story of Lynn, the craziest and scariest fucking kid I've ever met (she liked Blood on the Dance Floor so that should've been a huge red flag from the beginning).\n\n**Td;dr Crazy girl brainwashes my friend into hating us. We reconcile and crazy girl tries attacking us with a knife.**\n\nAlright, so back when I was in high school we had been the first class to go through. The place was just built, nice and squeaky clean. So we are at an assembly during the first week and I'm sitting with some kids I've known back in our old high school and we decide that this assembly isn't worth the time. The whole school is there and they are projecting this movie on the new building and all the new features classrooms have. We all slowly sneak out.\n\nSo in about 10 minutes we were all congregated in the girl's bathroom--yeah, we skip out and go chill in the bathroom, cool right? We just shoot the shit for about 30 minutes when another friend joins us. She brings with her another girl who was called Lynn. Now Lynn came from a totally different state and none of us, aside from my my friend Shay, knew her. \n\nThis girl was.... interesting. She was **really** into anime. She'd only wear the kind of clothing you'd find at Hot Topic and she insisted that bands like Blood on the Dance Floor were musical geniuses. A redeeming quality, however, was she was a smoker. We all ended up getting high in the bathroom that day and invited her to hang with us more often. We overlooked her weirdness but things got worse. Lynn was becoming, uh... slightly territorial with Shay, meaning that she hated when we would try being around them. Things got to the point where we literally felt scared to even look in their direction because Lynn would give us the craziest glares. \n\nWell after a few months of this Shay changed as well. She began dressing up all in black and her whole personality totally flipped. She didn't want to hang out with us and suddenly her pretty nice life was dark and meaningless. We knew Lynn was the cause of it. Shay began cutting herself and wearing the crazy raccoon eyeliner. Well I had had enough--I had lost my friend and now she was hurting herself. I ended up calling Shay one night and after some arguing, I convinced her to meet me at one of our hold parks we'd go hang out in. \n\nI was desperate to help save my friend, or what was left of her. So it was a little later at night and she came. We had an amazing heart-to-heart and she seemed to realize how crazy Lynn had made her. Well, after hugging it out we were going to leave. But who fucking shows up?! That psychotic bitch. She is **FUMING**. I have never seen someone so angry before! She had been at Shay's house prior to her coming to meet me and she had followed her to the park to see what was going on. Lynn was yelling and screaming to Shay about how I was a horrible friend and how I didn't understand her like she did. She ended up getting in my face after I told her to knock it off. She reached into her hoodie pocket and pulled something out before hitting me with it. It was some kind of trinket thing, totally freaked me out thinking I'd been hit with something dangerous. I'm on the floor registering what the hell happened and this crazy bitch jumps on me, pulls my hair and starts screaming at me about how I \"can't take away her friend\". My friend pulls her off me and helps me up, then Lynn reaches into her pocket and pulls out one of those little foldable knives.\n\n***She fucking had a knife on her.***\n\n We are terrified and this crazy girl pulled a knife on us. She keeps yelling at us and tells me that I'm the reason her friendship with Shay isn't working. I remember asking her to please just calm down but that only pissed her off more. Even today I get shivers thinking about this but I remember *begging* her not to hurt us. She was bigger and could easily overpower either of us. I remember telling her, \"Please don't hurt us Lynn, we can figure this out. What can we do to help you calm down?\". She seemed to think about it for a minute. She looked at me and said, \"You want me to fucking calm down?! Well then I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\". That's when I realized that Lynn was really a 500 foot tall monster from the Paleozoic era. I nearly passed out but Shay grabbed me and we got the fuck out of there before things escalated more.\n\nWe ended up reporting it to the police after telling our parents. She was taken out of school and put into placement from what I understand. It's a pretty sad ending, I think. :/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415695367", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Fuckin' Paul. I love him like a brother but sweet god...\n\n***Paul and his fucking pony porn.***\n\nOkay, so we met back in college. Shared the same boring class with the most boring professor in the world. Have my laptop on, taking notes? Nope, I'm on this fucking site. Load a page and I see I have a new notification. Get the message and it's along the lines of \"This class is boring! Lol\". Alrighty, what the fuck? Reply back asking who it is and they tell me to turn around. I do so and it's Paul. \n\nNow Paul is.... ugh... a treat. Big guy, looks like he doesn't get out much and has the *strangest* smell coming off of him. I've talked to him a few times before and he had seen my laptop and--I still don't fucking know how--saw my username. So we keep messaging, and somehow we end up grabbing lunch after class. After some chatting I realize he is actually a pretty nice guy. His pony porn fetish aside, nice dude. We end up becoming pretty good friends. He is super awkward and never goes out so when I'd go to parties or out for drinks I'd drag him out too. My friends couldn't see anything in him, let alone why I'd hang out with him, but they got used to him. \n\nPaul always insisted he hated it, but I'd take him to the mall and we'd have a \"shopping day\". He had never had a girlfriend but told me he really wanted one. Well damn, being his friend I told him I'd help. He could talk to me so I promised he'd be able to talk to other girls too. After some time, and a bath and new clothes later,  he was ready to go on his first date with one of my friends Janelle. She was a sweetheart and genuinely liked Paul, even before he was \"transformed\" and confident in himself dating. They go to dinner and come to my place where I have some other friends over for drinks. Talking to Janelle aside, she tells me the date went well. I find Paul and almost break his back hugging him so hard, I was so happy. \n\nWell after some time everyone is good and drunk. Paul didn't drink much so it's hitting him *really* hard. One thing led to another and everyone is discussing television shows. Out of nowhere, Paul pulls out his phone and proceeds to show everyone in the room multiple pony porn pictures he has saved on his phone. Discussing how amazing the show is and how sexy the characters are. \n\nI'm drunk and I start laughing my ass off seeing everyone's reactions. I look at Janelle and she is mortified, I thought she was going to puke. Another guy grabs his phone and throws it in the pool. Everyone else starts laughing and Paul starts freaking the hell out. He runs into the house and disappears. At this point I feel horrible for laughing at him. Everyone ends up leaving my place and I go find Paul. He's locked in the bathroom and all I hear is sobbing coming from the bathroom. After a few minutes he lets me in and I apologize but explain to him that what he did was fucking stupid. We keep talking and I remember his phone is still at the bottom of the pool. My guilt skyrockets. I felt like an asshole for this even more. I ask Paul what kind of phone it was and where he got it. Promising to pay for the damage. He just kinda laughs and tells me it's okay and not to worry about it. I insist on giving him money for it and ask him how much he'd need for a replacement phone. He thinks it over a minute and tells me, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" That's when I realized my pony porn loving friend was really a goddamn 500 foot tall monster from the Paleozoic era. I get up and tell him, \"Goddamnit monster, get the fuck out of my house!\" I ended up taking his phone and throwing it away. I was so pissed off. All of that time I'd spent with him, the friend I though I knew was totally bullshitting me.\n\nHaven't seen him since!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415697507", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 275, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was 17 at a friends house for a sleepover. usually we'd just play Halo until like 2pm, eat pizza, and drink mountain dew. All my friends had passed out and I walked 3 floors down to their kitchen level. In the dark living room I saw his mom with old HBO porn on the tv. \n\nI tried to walk away and pretend I didn't see anything but I'd already turned the lights on. She said \"it's okay\" and motioned for me to come to her. I was kind of wtf'd and didn't know what to do but she's the mom so I went over there.\n\nI had always been the polite but fun and flirty kind of kid. She seemed to take it really well and I thought she just thought i was funny. She's about 37 and was pretty hot for a mom. \n\nAs I walked over to her she asked, \"Do you like this?\" Being a young inexperienced kid i didn't know what to say. \"Umm, yeah.\" My friends dad had divorced her a while ago. She then asked if I'd like to watch, I couldn't resist and just kept staring.\n\nShe kept rubbing her clit and began to get really into it. She just had some softcore on tv and was watching girl on girl. Her moans became louder before she abruptly stopped and looked at me. \n\n\"Come closer\"\n\nI was almost hyperventilating at this point because I'd never done anything before and didn't know what was going to happen. She ended up pulling me on top of her and started kissing me. It felt so fucking wrong but she was so hot to me. She moved my hands down to her pussy and I started rubbing her clit and fingering her. I'd never felt a vagina before this.\n\nBasically after a while of fingering she got on top of me and blew me. She was fucking amazing, great eye contact and really enthusastic. I wouldn't really know this until later. I began breathing really quickly and came within 2 minutes. She swallowed and looked up at me. I told her it was fucking amazing. She kept my gaze and then said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415740772", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That uh... that definitely caught me off guard.\n\nAs for the mundanity, honestly, I don't know if I felt it. Like /u/kystevo said, I kind of got the feeling that Simon was autistic, and in any case, I found experiencing the world through his \"eyes' to be rather enjoyable. There were a few moments where I think I was in fact feeling that monotony you wanted, but for the most part, I was kind of just sitting there, thinking \"Good Lord, I think I know this guy.\"\n\nThe flow here is really solid. I could inflate your ego a bit and give examples, but that's not what we're here for, so I won't.\n\nBut while I do think that the pacing is really nice, sometimes it just kind of slips and slips and slips and slips and slips and... do you see where I'm going? A couple of sentences just run for just a wee bit too long, and further after that. They sound nice, but it's easy to forget what the sentence even started with by the time you get to the end.\n\nIf this is a conscious, stylistic choice though, and by your mention of monotony, I'm led to believe it is, then it works, but just, uh... be careful, I guess, not to fall back into it when tackling different moods.\n\nSome of the paragraphs are pretty lengthy too, which made looking at this fresh a little imposing. Can't say I can think of any points where I'd have broken them, and again like with the sentences, it works for this, but just be wary.\n\nThe transition into the Call of the Void section was a little odd, but once we dived in, it worked/made sense. \"called the Call of the Void\", though... That sounded a little clunky. I'm kind of a nitpicker when it comes to repeating sounds so close together, so it's not the end of the world, but it'd be an easy word to swap out.\n\nSimilarly, there are a number of moments where the word train is used to quick succession. Mostly fine, of course. Fits the monotony, yaddah yaddah, now I'm repeating myself, but one bit still sat a little strangely with me:\n\n&gt;...the approaching tube [train](#redtext).\n\n&gt;The noise of the [train](#redtext) filled his ears...\n\nI think the main reason why it feels odd to me here is just because it's the end of one paragraph and the start of a new one, so I was expecting a different [train](#redtext) of thought... oh God damn it.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nAll up, no, I do not think it was too slow to start, and yes, I would read on, though I would be cautiously optimistic.\n\nI get the feeling from this ending that I'd want the story to follow ol' Orange Eye McGee, but I also don't have any real idea what a story might revolve around, and I'm kind of thinking that it'd be really easy to lose control of a story of this nature (in that it becomes something kind of basal and dumb) rather quickly.\n\nBut you've got good style, so I imagine you could do it.\n\nPunctuation is usually good, though there're a few missing Oxford Commas, and a few sentences where even the nature of the scene couldn't help me from wishing there was a period somewhere.\n\nAlso, yes, I did enjoy being surprised by the ending (I certainly wasn't expecting something so \"unnatural\"), but it honestly read like one of those horribly stupid posts that crawl up in /r/AskReddit threads, and I was half-expecting Orange Eye McGee to turn to the reader and ask for tree fiddy.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nSo thanks for the read (it was certainly entertaining), and good luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415746193", "subreddit": "DestructiveReaders", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've been waiting for this thread my entire life.\n\nI grew up involved with the Quiverfull movement, a type of Christian Fundamentalism that involves having a bunch of children, home education, extremely modest dress including headcoverings, the practise of \"courting\" and \"bethrothals\" (basically semi-arranged marriages taking place as soon as the girl was old enough to marry), and something called \"Christian patriarchy\", wherein the father is viewed as a sort of mini god.\n\nI grew up attending a small Christian school run by the local Independent Fundamentalist Baptist church, where every student was Quiverfull. We were required to wear extremely modest clothing (ankle length skirts, hemlines that covered the base of our necks, etc. We had wardrobe checks multiple times each day.)\n\nEach morning we pledged allegiance to the Christian Flag and to the Bible. It's been years, but I can still recite both pledges by heart. Then we recited the chapters of the Bible we were working on. Yes, I did say chapters. We memorized several books of the Bible (Jonah, all of Paul's epistles, most of Genesis, Daniel, a decent amount of Leviticus and I think the Gospel of Mark.)\n\nOur schoolwork was primarily books published by Abeka, BJUPress and ACE. Our textbooks claimed that:\n\nno transitional fossils had ever been found\n\nthe Loch Ness Monster had been proven to be real and was a plesiosaur\n\nthe Great Depression never happened but was just a myth made up by the socialists\n\nslavery was a win-win solution for all involved\n\ndinosaurs breathed fire\n\nthe KKK were great dudes who got a bad rap\n\nthe trail of tears was actually super great\n\nouter space wasn't real because if you blew on a pile of baby powder, a new planet wouldn't form (this was demonstrated)\n\nthe Liberals don't believe in personal responsibility\n\nthe world is about to be attacked by the floating Space Jerusalem\n\nWe never covered much actual math, science, etc. Learning the truth about the government's plan to kill Holocaust the Christians was seen as much more important. \n\nFor one year the girls also took Christian Charm. This was primarily about how God really, *really* cares about whether your chest is 10 inches largest than your waist or not. Girls were forbidden from standing with their feet parallel, \"like a man's\", instead having to keep our feet at ridiculous and painful angles. We couldn't walk without being careful to \"glide gracefully\" and avoid \"swishing\" our knees. We were forbidden to not smile, but our smiles were never big enough, or they were too big. \n\nThere wasn't much time for real schoolwork anyway, since we were all so busy being punished for having an ungodly facial expression, and forced to spend the rest of the school day standing on our tiptoes on one foot in the corner.\n\nIn fourth grade my parents chose to pull me out and homeschool me. We joined a local homeschool group filled with Quiverfull homeschoolers. My parents had gone to a different church, one which was very Charismatic (we spoke in tongues, exorcised people, \"healed\" with prayer) but not necessarily quite so extreme as the IFB school I had been sent to. However, as my father became more violent (he had a lot of mental issues and was an extreme hoarder), my mother (who was a borderline hoarder and very depressed, so much so that for the first ten years of my life she barely left her bed except to use the washroom) became more and more heavily sucked into this subculture.\n\nMy parents had already gotten rid of most TV channels over concerns about evil spirits and only allowed us to read a few classic books, but after this my mom first stopped allowing us to read anything non-Christian, then banned novels altogether. We began being forbidden to see anyone who did not go to our church or homeschool group. Since my parents never really started teaching, and I had little access to books and at the time no internet, this left little to do all day aside from copy out Bible verses and stare out the window for hours. Time sort of stopped meaning anything.\n\nWe became more into the Biblical patriarchy thing, where my father was seen as the head of our household and a sort of direct representative from god who women were to serve and obey in every way. You weren't supposed to express any kind of wishes or desire, but leave it up to your husband/father to make all decisions for you. (if you were his daughter, this included selecting your husband--girls were expected to be stay at home daughters, serving their fathers, until marriage) Biblical femininity was emphasized, which in this case basically meant long skirts and not having opinions or desires, except to serve whatever man God chose as the best \"helpmeet\" possible. \n\nFor a couple of years my mom, who was herself a *nurse* stopped allowing us to take medicine, believing it to be witchcraft. She became more and more crazed about the idea of demons trying to attack her and our family. \n\nUnfortunately, I was born with a birthmark on my leg. She believed that this made me Satan. My father and mother both searched for ways to fix this. I've been exorcised, had oil poured over me, had everything I owned burned, etc. It apparently didn't work.\n\nAfter my father died we were at least spared his extreme violence, but my mother became only more unhinged and depressed. She mostly gave up on her idea of me as Satan, but became absolutely obsessed with the idea of Satan attacking our family. This belief is reinforced by our church and all the Charismatic material she reads. She even abandoned our homeschool group, believing it to not be concerned enough about how demons are possessing everyone.\n\nOur church is obsessed with spiritual attacks, which are seen as stemming from absolutely everything. Anne of Green Gables? Witchcraft! Christian music? Actually sung by Satanists, filled with subliminal Satanic messages! Cabbage patch dolls? Demons who stay still when we look at them! (I'm 100% serious) The only way to ward this off is speaking in tongues, making prophesies, etc. A few people in my church believe they hear the voices of demons in their head, and said demons are chasing them. I've been there as we've all laid hands on people and prayed for them to be liberated from the demonic oppression in their lives.\n\nI...don't really have an end to this story. I still live with my mother and sister. I still go months without seeing anyone who isn't from my church. I still have no real education, although since I can now access the internet (it's monitored, but my mother doesn't know incognito mode is a thing, so I can secretly read Homeschoolers Anonymous, No Longer Quivering, things about atheism and reddit) I've been trying to learn some math through Khan Academy. I have hope of eventual escape, even if I have no idea how just yet. \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2h31pq/eli5_the_quiverfull_movement_among_some_christian\n\nhttp://www.patheos.com/blogs/nolongerquivering/\n\nhttp://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/christian-patriarchyquiverfull\n\nhttp://homeschoolersanonymous.wordpress.com/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415796813", "subreddit": "defaultgems", "score": 28, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is a repost of the Quiverfull person (all the deleted at the top) I am not sure why it was deleted, probably fake and/or a scam or something. I'm only posting in case people are curious what it was.\n\nSTART\n\nI've been waiting for this thread my entire life.\n\nI grew up involved with the Quiverfull movement, a type of Christian Fundamentalism that involves having a bunch of children, home education, extremely modest dress including headcoverings, the practise of \"courting\" and \"bethrothals\" (basically semi-arranged marriages taking place as soon as the girl was old enough to marry), and something called \"Christian patriarchy\", wherein the father is viewed as a sort of mini god.\nI grew up attending a small Christian school run by the local Independent Fundamentalist Baptist church, where every student was Quiverfull. We were required to wear extremely modest clothing (ankle length skirts, hemlines that covered the base of our necks, etc. We had wardrobe checks multiple times each day.)\nEach morning we pledged allegiance to the Christian Flag and to the Bible. It's been years, but I can still recite both pledges by heart. Then we recited the chapters of the Bible we were working on. Yes, I did say chapters. We memorized several books of the Bible (Jonah, all of Paul's epistles, most of Genesis, Daniel, a decent amount of Leviticus and I think the Gospel of Mark.)\n\nOur schoolwork was primarily books published by Abeka, BJUPress and ACE. Our textbooks claimed that:\nno transitional fossils had ever been found the Loch Ness Monster had been proven to be real and was a plesiosaur the Great Depression never happened but was just a myth made up by the socialists slavery was a win-win solution for all involved dinosaurs breathed fire the KKK were great dudes who got a bad rap\nthe trail of tears was actually super great outer space wasn't real because if you blew on a pile of baby powder, a new planet wouldn't form (this was demonstrated) the Liberals don't believe in personal responsibility\nthe world is about to be attacked by the floating Space Jerusalem. We never covered much actual math, science, etc. Learning the truth about the government's plan to kill Holocaust the Christians was seen as much more important.\n\nFor one year the girls also took Christian Charm. This was primarily about how God really, really cares about whether your chest is 10 inches largest than your waist or not. Girls were forbidden from standing with their feet parallel, \"like a man's\", instead having to keep our feet at ridiculous and painful angles. We couldn't walk without being careful to \"glide gracefully\" and avoid \"swishing\" our knees. We were forbidden to not smile, but our smiles were never big enough, or they were too big.\n\nThere wasn't much time for real schoolwork anyway, since we were all so busy being punished for having an ungodly facial expression, and forced to spend the rest of the school day standing on our tiptoes on one foot in the corner.\n\nIn fourth grade my parents chose to pull me out and homeschool me. We joined a local homeschool group filled with Quiverfull homeschoolers. My parents had gone to a different church, one which was very Charismatic (we spoke in tongues, exorcised people, \"healed\" with prayer) but not necessarily quite so extreme as the IFB school I had been sent to. However, as my father became more violent (he had a lot of mental issues and was an extreme hoarder), my mother (who was a borderline hoarder and very depressed, so much so that for the first ten years of my life she barely left her bed except to use the washroom) became more and more heavily sucked into this subculture.\n\nMy parents had already gotten rid of most TV channels over concerns about evil spirits and only allowed us to read a few classic books, but after this my mom first stopped allowing us to read anything non-Christian, then banned novels altogether. We began being forbidden to see anyone who did not go to our church or homeschool group. Since my parents never really started teaching, and I had little access to books and at the time no internet, this left little to do all day aside from copy out Bible verses and stare out the window for hours. Time sort of stopped meaning anything.\n\nWe became more into the Biblical patriarchy thing, where my father was seen as the head of our household and a sort of direct representative from god who women were to serve and obey in every way. You weren't supposed to express any kind of wishes or desire, but leave it up to your husband/father to make all decisions for you. (if you were his daughter, this included selecting your husband--girls were expected to be stay at home daughters, serving their fathers, until marriage) Biblical femininity was emphasized, which in this case basically meant long skirts and not having opinions or desires, except to serve whatever man God chose as the best \"helpmeet\" possible.\n\nFor a couple of years my mom, who was herself a nurse stopped allowing us to take medicine, believing it to be witchcraft. She became more and more crazed about the idea of demons trying to attack her and our family.\nUnfortunately, I was born with a birthmark on my leg. She believed that this made me Satan. My father and mother both searched for ways to fix this. I've been exorcised, had oil poured over me, had everything I owned burned, etc. It apparently didn't work.\n\nAfter my father died we were at least spared his extreme violence, but my mother became only more unhinged and depressed. She mostly gave up on her idea of me as Satan, but became absolutely obsessed with the idea of Satan attacking our family. This belief is reinforced by our church and all the Charismatic material she reads. She even abandoned our homeschool group, believing it to not be concerned enough about how demons are possessing everyone.\n\nOur church is obsessed with spiritual attacks, which are seen as stemming from absolutely everything. Anne of Green Gables? Witchcraft! Christian music? Actually sung by Satanists, filled with subliminal Satanic messages! Cabbage patch dolls? Demons who stay still when we look at them! (I'm 100% serious) The only way to ward this off is speaking in tongues, making prophesies, etc. A few people in my church believe they hear the voices of demons in their head, and said demons are chasing them. I've been there as we've all laid hands on people and prayed for them to be liberated from the demonic oppression in their lives.\n\nI...don't really have an end to this story. I still live with my mother and sister. I still go months without seeing anyone who isn't from my church. I still have no real education, although since I can now access the internet (it's monitored, but my mother doesn't know incognito mode is a thing, so I can secretly read Homeschoolers Anonymous, No Longer Quivering, things about atheism and reddit) I've been trying to learn some math through Khan Academy. I have hope of eventual escape, even if I have no idea how just yet.\n\nEND", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415813028", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

If you want to try more simple, linear scents, [Firebird](https://www.etsy.com/shop/FirebirdBathBody?section_id=6323369&amp;ref=shopsection_leftnav_6) has a lot of straightforward scents whose names directly suggest what it smells like\n\nIf you want blends that are a little more complex but still user-friendly, I always say to others to pick up a [pack of samples](https://www.etsy.com/listing/93821070/5-piece-alkemia-perfume-sample-set?ref=shop_home_feat_2) from [Alkemia](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Alkemia?ref=l2-shop-info-name). Alkemia's scents have more components and are a bit more conceptually abstract than Firebird but are still pretty reminiscent to department store perfumes (sometimes). From Alkemia, I think you might like:\n\n* [Carmen 7](https://www.etsy.com/listing/170333708/carmen-7-perfume-oil-spiced-pear-lychee?ref=shop_home_active_4) - An indecent proposal of succulently spiced pear, exotic lychees, decadent french pralines, bourbon vanilla, and crushed almond blossoms leads to a ménage à trois of gardenia, star jasmine, and magnolia illuminated by the afterglow of a sensuously musky amber.\n* [Lux Aeternum](https://www.etsy.com/listing/157902369/lux-aeternum-perfume-oil-pomegranate?ref=shop_home_active_6) - Red, ripe pomegranates and dark red roses illuminated by a radiant trinity of golden ambers\n* [Elixir of Aphrodite](https://www.etsy.com/listing/177228629/elixir-of-aphrodite-perfume-oil-honeyed?ref=shop_home_active_9) - Persian apricots dipped in orange blossom honey swirling with a sensual enchantment of peach and plum blossoms, mimosa, white star jasmine, ambrette, guiac wood, and vanilla musk.\n* [Persephone](https://www.etsy.com/listing/70358792/persephone-pomegranate-perfume-oil-5-ml?ref=shop_home_active_14) - Ripe pomegranates, dark red merlot wine, &amp; a dichotomy of dark and solar ambers\n* [Pumpkin Strumpet](https://www.etsy.com/listing/89028335/pumpkin-strumpet-perfume-oil-5-ml?ref=shop_home_active_2) - A decadent blend of rich pumpkin, caramelized sugar, Madagascar vanilla, precisely balanced with a swirl of cinnamon, ginger, &amp; clove and a tiny drop of amber musk.\n\nAlso, here are a few more that are a little bit off from the fruity/floral/amber, but I think they smell AMAZING and they might interest you as well:\n\n* Not sure how you feel about citrus, but this is one of my favorite citrus blends ever: [Repartee](https://www.etsy.com/listing/185235014/repartee-perfume-oil-5-ml-mandarin?ref=shop_home_active_12) - A flirtatious zing of mandarin, a bon mot of yuzu, and a unisexy double entendre of lemon and grapefruit blossoms are followed by a zesty riposte of bitter orange, verbena, ginger root tea, sasparilla, oak moss, and wormwood.\n* Some people have said that this smells like Miss Dior Cherie or something: [Antares](https://www.etsy.com/listing/150584234/antares-perfume-oil-nicotania-oakmosses?ref=shop_home_active_4) - Queen of the Night, Dried Wild Roses, Mandarin, Nicotania, Oakmosses, Cactus, Juniper, Acacia buds, Fir Resin, Clary Sage, Cedar Needles, Labdanum, Guaiac Wood, Germander, and White Patchouli lightly bathed in dewy Water Musk.\n* This is more on the heavy floral and resinous side, but it smells so good: [Hex](https://www.etsy.com/listing/86653665/hex-perfume-oil-5-ml?ref=shop_home_active_13) - A powerfully sexy conjuration of frangipani and night-blooming Moroccan flowers, all-spice, black tea, Madagascar vanilla, Tonka, sweet benzoin resin, black amber, frankincense, vetiver, and a caress of patchouli. \n\nMy favorite shop ever, [Darling Clandestine](https://www.etsy.com/shop/darlingclandestine?ref=shopsection_shophome_leftnav), has super weird, acquired-taste type perfumes. However, if you get the chance, you should try to pick up some from there. When it comes to DC, I completely abandon my tastes and preferences and just buy everything because even if the perfume is categorized as one thing, it usually doesn't really fit the stereotypical smell of that category. DC's shop is pretty understocked at the moment because there are going to be new releases and a sale this Friday 11/14. However, if you want to pick up something right now, I'd suggest you get:\n\n* [Smother](https://www.etsy.com/listing/206450369/smother-special-edition?ref=shop_home_active_9) - Green, woody natural pistachio (no pudding here), rich moss-covered oak, and a shy bloom of a gloriously superior essence of jasmine grandiflorum.\n* [Curiosities' Ball](https://www.etsy.com/listing/116897804/curiosities-ball-handcrafted-solid?ref=shop_home_active_23) - Curiosities' Ball is a sensual, unisex, black peppery fragrance dancing with ozone and amber and deep green leaves.\n* [Tilt-a-Whirl](https://www.etsy.com/listing/129290184/tilt-a-whirl-handcrafted-fragrance-oil?ref=shop_home_active_5) - this is a bright, citrusy fragrance that begins fruity and ends mellow and herbal and almost grown up. \n* [Gram-Negative](https://www.etsy.com/listing/109544731/gram-negative-handcrafted-fragrance-oil?ref=shop_home_active_3) - Gram-Negative is deep, damp, earthy essential moss; sticky green leaf resin; a whisper of black tea; and a rare, rich, mellow, buttery orchid essential oil that is just divine.\n\nYou can get sample vial from DC, but you have to message the owner first so that she can put up a custom listing. :)\n\nWith [Deep Midnight](https://www.etsy.com/shop/DeepMidnightPerfumes?ref=shopsection_shophome_leftnav), the shop has a LOOOOTTTTT of scents, so it can get overwhelming. You can always message the owner, Cat, and ask her for suggestions as well! However, I would recommend you get:\n\n* [This Sampler Set](https://www.etsy.com/listing/79881852/berry-sweet-perfume-sampler-set-four-1?ref=shop_home_active_10)\n* [Or This One](https://www.etsy.com/listing/89772241/lovely-ladies-perfume-sample-set?ref=shop_home_active_7)\n* [Or This](https://www.etsy.com/listing/79914539/steampunk-gals-perfume-sampler-set-of?ref=shop_home_active_22)\n* [Aaaaand this one too](https://www.etsy.com/listing/96721343/exotic-girls-perfume-sampler-set-perfume?ref=shop_home_active_24)\n* Or any of these perfumes: Naenia, Thalia, Tara's Burning, Seven Veils, Nessie, Suspiria, Sweet Calavera, Haunted Hayride, The Halfling's Party (this is neither floral nor fruity, but omg it's so good so I had to list it as well), Tenebrae, Pyramid of Giza\n\nOther popular shops that I haven't tried personally are Haus of Gloi, sixteen92, Ten Three Labs, Solstice Scents, and BPAL, to name a few. Haus of Gloi is particularly popular.\n\nSo anyway,\n\n* Look around and see what sounds appealing to you in the descriptions.\n* Ask the owner for suggestions.\n* Buy samples!\n\nIt's all trial and error, really!

{"body": "Thanks for being courteous.  I'm not religious, but was raised with it a bit.  The ways I would tell biblical stories to a kid I would more liken to making up a story you tell to a kid, or showing them a movie.  Kids have wild imaginations and I would like to propagate that.  When I was growing up my dad would make up stories all the time and I think it helped me creatively, and i would like to do the same if I ever have kids.  Any kids I meet will definitely get a healthy dose of science information from me, but it might be very different based on the child and their stage of development.  \n\nFor the creation story, it would be the very basics, like, first came light, then earth, then oceans, then plants or fish (I forget what one came first) then animals, then humans.  It definitely would not be word for word creation, but a very general version of mixed creation and evolution.  So, no, I would not preach directly from the bible, but take note of the simplicity it explained it.  As far as telling my kids \"god did it\" I have been around my friend's kids enough to know that the \"why\" game gets tiring and I could just see myself saying \"God did it\" at some point.  I want my kids to understand religion and the Bible as I think it's worth while to know what's in there, and I wouldn't want them to really be ignorant of such an important piece of literature (despite what anyone says, it is important, but it's also literature).  I think more in the lines that some of the stories are just easily digestible and kind of fun for a young kid.  There are defiantly stories that I won't tell, just like I'm not going to show a 5 year old A Clockwork Orange.  \n\nI definitely won't push the concept of God very hard, though.  I'm agnostic, so while the ideas interest me I don't think the indoctrination of beliefs like that are super important, especially in the way that some parents do it, but as an imagination topic I think it's a fair thing to work through and discuss with kids.  \n\nThese things are also subject to change, it's just how I feel at this point in my life of things I imagine would be beneficial to my ability to explain things to kids at this point.  I do think that giving kids a bit of historical context in a fun way is important to (I liked some biblical stories when I was growing up).\n\nBut, for everyone that's down voting me and their piece of mind, no, I'm not going to tell a straight creation story, and yes, my kids and other kids will get as simple explanations of actual science as I can come up with.  But in addition to all of that I wholly plan on scaring them with stories of sasquatch and the Loch Ness Monster at the same time.  \n\nEDIT:  Just to add, I will never tell my kids the Universe is 6000 years old, they will get accurate information in that regard.

{"body": "Post was deleted its been re copied here:\n\n&gt;I've been waiting for this thread my entire life.\nI grew up involved with the Quiverfull movement, a type of Christian Fundamentalism that involves having a bunch of children, home education, extremely modest dress including headcoverings, the practise of \"courting\" and \"bethrothals\" (basically semi-arranged marriages taking place as soon as the girl was old enough to marry), and something called \"Christian patriarchy\", wherein the father is viewed as a sort of mini god.\nI grew up attending a small Christian school run by the local Independent Fundamentalist Baptist church, where every student was Quiverfull. We were required to wear extremely modest clothing (ankle length skirts, hemlines that covered the base of our necks, etc. We had wardrobe checks multiple times each day.)\nEach morning we pledged allegiance to the Christian Flag and to the Bible. It's been years, but I can still recite both pledges by heart. Then we recited the chapters of the Bible we were working on. Yes, I did say chapters. We memorized several books of the Bible (Jonah, all of Paul's epistles, most of Genesis, Daniel, a decent amount of Leviticus and I think the Gospel of Mark.)\nOur schoolwork was primarily books published by Abeka, BJUPress and ACE. Our textbooks claimed that:\nno transitional fossils had ever been found\nthe Loch Ness Monster had been proven to be real and was a plesiosaur\nthe Great Depression never happened but was just a myth made up by the socialists\nslavery was a win-win solution for all involved\ndinosaurs breathed fire\nthe KKK were great dudes who got a bad rap\nthe trail of tears was actually super great\nouter space wasn't real because if you blew on a pile of baby powder, a new planet wouldn't form (this was demonstrated)\nthe Liberals don't believe in personal responsibility\nthe world is about to be attacked by the floating Space Jerusalem\nWe never covered much actual math, science, etc. Learning the truth about the government's plan to kill Holocaust the Christians was seen as much more important.\nFor one year the girls also took Christian Charm. This was primarily about how God really, really cares about whether your chest is 10 inches largest than your waist or not. Girls were forbidden from standing with their feet parallel, \"like a man's\", instead having to keep our feet at ridiculous and painful angles. We couldn't walk without being careful to \"glide gracefully\" and avoid \"swishing\" our knees. We were forbidden to not smile, but our smiles were never big enough, or they were too big.\nThere wasn't much time for real schoolwork anyway, since we were all so busy being punished for having an ungodly facial expression, and forced to spend the rest of the school day standing on our tiptoes on one foot in the corner.\nIn fourth grade my parents chose to pull me out and homeschool me. We joined a local homeschool group filled with Quiverfull homeschoolers. My parents had gone to a different church, one which was very Charismatic (we spoke in tongues, exorcised people, \"healed\" with prayer) but not necessarily quite so extreme as the IFB school I had been sent to. However, as my father became more violent (he had a lot of mental issues and was an extreme hoarder), my mother (who was a borderline hoarder and very depressed, so much so that for the first ten years of my life she barely left her bed except to use the washroom) became more and more heavily sucked into this subculture.\nMy parents had already gotten rid of most TV channels over concerns about evil spirits and only allowed us to read a few classic books, but after this my mom first stopped allowing us to read anything non-Christian, then banned novels altogether. We began being forbidden to see anyone who did not go to our church or homeschool group. Since my parents never really started teaching, and I had little access to books and at the time no internet, this left little to do all day aside from copy out Bible verses and stare out the window for hours. Time sort of stopped meaning anything.\nWe became more into the Biblical patriarchy thing, where my father was seen as the head of our household and a sort of direct representative from god who women were to serve and obey in every way. You weren't supposed to express any kind of wishes or desire, but leave it up to your husband/father to make all decisions for you. (if you were his daughter, this included selecting your husband--girls were expected to be stay at home daughters, serving their fathers, until marriage) Biblical femininity was emphasized, which in this case basically meant long skirts and not having opinions or desires, except to serve whatever man God chose as the best \"helpmeet\" possible.\nFor a couple of years my mom, who was herself a nurse stopped allowing us to take medicine, believing it to be witchcraft. She became more and more crazed about the idea of demons trying to attack her and our family.\nUnfortunately, I was born with a birthmark on my leg. She believed that this made me Satan. My father and mother both searched for ways to fix this. I've been exorcised, had oil poured over me, had everything I owned burned, etc. It apparently didn't work.\nAfter my father died we were at least spared his extreme violence, but my mother became only more unhinged and depressed. She mostly gave up on her idea of me as Satan, but became absolutely obsessed with the idea of Satan attacking our family. This belief is reinforced by our church and all the Charismatic material she reads. She even abandoned our homeschool group, believing it to not be concerned enough about how demons are possessing everyone.\nOur church is obsessed with spiritual attacks, which are seen as stemming from absolutely everything. Anne of Green Gables? Witchcraft! Christian music? Actually sung by Satanists, filled with subliminal Satanic messages! Cabbage patch dolls? Demons who stay still when we look at them! (I'm 100% serious) The only way to ward this off is speaking in tongues, making prophesies, etc. A few people in my church believe they hear the voices of demons in their head, and said demons are chasing them. I've been there as we've all laid hands on people and prayed for them to be liberated from the demonic oppression in their lives.\nI...don't really have an end to this story. I still live with my mother and sister. I still go months without seeing anyone who isn't from my church. I still have no real education, although since I can now access the internet (it's monitored, but my mother doesn't know incognito mode is a thing, so I can secretly read Homeschoolers Anonymous, No Longer Quivering, things about atheism and reddit) I've been trying to learn some math through Khan Academy. I have hope of eventual escape, even if I have no idea how just yet.\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2h31pq/eli5_the_quiverfull_movement_among_some_christian\nhttp://www.patheos.com/blogs/nolongerquivering/\nhttp://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/christian-patriarchyquiverfull\nhttp://homeschoolersanonymous.wordpress.com/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415851510", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

In 2008, my parents (both realtors) ended up losing their jobs, so I helped support my them until they were back on their feet. I ended up withdrawing 20 grand (the most I've ever held), and gave it to them directly. Within the year, they both managed to secure relatively stable jobs, but didn't start paying me back the money. They only just started. So far, it's put a lot of stress on our relationship. If anyone is considering loaning money to a family member, I would highly advise against it. Every conversation with my parents inevitably leads to the debt they owe me, and when they will begin to repay it. It's made meetings with them emotionally turbulent and painful. I'm hoping that things will eventually get better, once they finish paying off the remaining balance of tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415913249", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ill share a story I found a while ago:\n\nI've been nuked once.\n\nThe first time was when I had only a couple hundred hours playing so far. I was playing as Morocco and going for a Diplo victory, but it became readily apparent that while my gold production was sufficient, my science was not. I would have to wait it out and make sure I could keep all the city-states on my side, and my cities alive, until the World Leader vote. On my continent, Bismarck was to my west, Nebby to my south and east, and Shaka to the north, but much farther away. Bismarck and Shaka were pretty much non-factors, but Nebby had been doing well for the entire game. He had taken over Elizabeth and Napoleon pretty early on, and also put a scare into Oda Nobunaga when he tried a bit of colonialism. Plus his GS production was ridiculous, of course, so he had a ton of Academies.\n\nNebby hit the Atomic Era three turns before me. Scanning his territory, I could tell that he had 6 Uranium resources compared to my 2. By this point it becoming more apparent that he was either going to get to the Spaceship or I was going to get World Leader. His army was only about 2/3 the size of mine, but was significantly more experienced (promoted, that is) because of the three major wars he had fought.\n\nI declared war just as I was finishing my first nuke. I made a quick jump into the east, which was not his homeland and was still partially puppet cities, and took two cities. He was making a heavy but very slow charge across my southern border when he struck first. The bomb hit Casablanca, which was my second largest city by this point and also the one closest to him. He took it quickly thereafter, and I only managed to take it back by removing troops from occupying his former territory in the east. With his recapture of those cities, we were back where we started, and we both realized that further war was futile. He sued for peace first. \"What do you need from me, Nebby?\" \"Oh, about tree fiddy.\" As I glanced from the trade screen to the diplo picture in the background, I could tell I had been deceived! Nebby was in fact Nessie, a five hundred foot long aquatic monster from the Paleozoic Era.

{"body": "When I was about 6-7(boy), and my sister was 8-9, we used to play tag all over the house, all the time. But we had this weird rule that you can only tag the person by poking their butt and we thought it was hilarious if we poked really hard. My sister was a bit taller, and I was pretty short, so I kind of had this jump and poke move that I would do. Our parents would just see us just running around, laughing, and making a ton of noise and never paid any attention to the details, plus we didn't know that we were being weirdos.     \n\nWell, one time before bed we were playing in our PJs and when I tried my jump-poke, I missed. I missed her butt. But not the other hole, as I would realize later. I remember she just stopped running and laughing and kind of had this weird confused look on her face. We started playing again for a bit, but then stopped again and said \"lets play front tag today.\" To my naive self I thought, ok, new rule. So we poked each other in the front.     \n\nI don't remember much from the game, but I remember my sister was more serious that day. And thinking nothing sexual at the time it would have been just another day of tag and probably forgotten, but when we went to bed the day got more interesting.    \n\nWe shared a bedroom, and when we went to bed that night, my sister wanted to keep trying this front poke thing. So we did. For the next year or so we kept exploring \"this area\" of our bodies together. We used hands, mouths, and even sex. I don't know if it was sexual for her, but it was just a game to me. But it went on.   \n \nAfter that first year, it became less often, but eventually, I started to get pleasure from it, and at this point can only assume she had been as well. We would have sex on and off for a few years, and me being young wasn't that wise to the gravity of what we were doing. But I loved my sister and we both seemed to enjoy this together.   \n \nIt was probably about 4 years after we first started doing it when I started to realize something might not be right with this situation. I tried to ask her if we should tell our parents but she got a little angry with me and I dropped it for a while. The second time I told her I wanted to tell our parents she got even angrier and hit me. I cried and ran to the room.  \n \nShe followed me and I remember her being really sweet, and rubbing my back and saying sorry. She then grabbed my hand and put it on herself, not down her pants, but used my hand to rub it on the outside. She asked if this would make me stop crying. It didn't, I kept saying \"I want to tell mom, I want to tell mom.\" She was very calmly, but eerily saying over and over, \"but that's not what I want.\"   \nFinally I screamed at her, \"WHAT DO YOU WANT?\"  \nShe just looked at me in the eyes and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  \n \nIt was at that time I looked up and realized my sister was about 500 feet tall and was this giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.   \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415979354", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sure, but there are some things you should know about the harness first.  What's most important is the D^2 F lifetime ratio.  \n\nFirst, you have to figure out the relative age of the harness.  This is not so simple as it may seem.  \n\n1.  Locate the 'born on date' published on the harness itself.  \n2.  Subtract this date from the present date and convert to kilo-seconds.\n\nRA =  ((PD - BOD)*86,400)/1000\n\nNext, you have to calculate \"drops under mass by average static stress \" coefficient.  \n\nYou will need to know the following things:\n\n\n1.  Weight Of Previous ownerS\n2.  Temperature at Which most climbing was performed AT\n3.  Number of Falls taken on Harness\n4.  Average Fall Distance\n5.  Ambient TeMp At storage location\n6.  And a few multipliers as listed below.\n\nThe equation to calculate is:\n\n((WOPS X AFD) / TWAT)  - NFH  ^ATM ^* ^6.06 ^X10^-6\n\nNext you take your RA and divide it by your DUMBASS to calculate D^2 F lifetime ratio\n\nD^2 F LR = RA / DUMBASS\n\nThis ratio will tell you how safe the harness is.  Ideally, you are going to want a ratio less than tree fiddy.  Anything more than that and you're going to get yourself into some real trouble.  Guys like Alex Honnold would be okay with a ratio higher than that.  I mean, I might climb on it if i'm out in bouldercolorado and have no other option.

Definitely not the highlight of this collection lol. Just a basic 2D platformer with a single enemy that follows you.\n\n* **Trashmania: Remix** - Another 2600 homebrew, but far better! This time it's a overhead view and with more enemies/obstacles. Also introduces an important mechanic: more trashcans you take to the dumpster at once the slower you move, but the more points you get when you take them to the dumpster. Also has a player item called Hologram Joe that can be placed to distract enemies.\n\n* **Trashmania: After Dark** - A more Horror-esque take for the OUYA, and with a first person perspective. Trashcan placements are randomized, and the red monster that chases you is apparently really scary from what I'm told lol. IRL during development I started to suffer from depression, and that's reflected in the later levels (I won't spoil anything for now).\n\n**And now the Wii U exclusive versions..**\n\n* **Trashmania: Classic+** - Similar gameplay to the original, but introduces 3D graphics (Atari style visuals in a more realistic setting), a single, huge level, various enemies to jump over and dodge, and heavy amounts of randomized enemy and trashcan placements. You also have a toy submarine named Nessie that helps out: it automatically finds trashcans, you can see it's view on the GamePad, and it even has weapons that are aimed using the Gyroscope. Also experimenting with special items and other cool stuff.\n\n* **Trashmania: Remix+** - Throws out the original up/down/left/right movement of Remix and replaces it with... touchscreen controls? The original game's overhead view is on the GamePad, and you draw a path for your character to follow (think that Yoshi game from NintendoLand). As it follows the path, it's vulnerable to enemies, car collisions, etc. but you can activate an item at any time during it's journey such as invincibility or speeding up to help her avoid danger. Still a bit early in development. Also contains a vector/neon visual style. (EDIT 2: Forgot to mention that the TV displays a 3D, sorta cinematic view of the action... cameras angles and stuff that normally wouldn't work if you controlled the character in a traditional way.)\n\n* **Trashmania: After Dark Part II** - continues where the last game left off... \n\nEDIT: Bleh, I need to brush up on Reddit formatting...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416012433", "subreddit": "wiiu", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; &gt; I've been waiting for this thread my entire life.\n&gt; I grew up involved with the Quiverfull movement, a type of Christian Fundamentalism that involves having a bunch of children, home education, extremely modest dress including headcoverings, the practise of \"courting\" and \"bethrothals\" (basically semi-arranged marriages taking place as soon as the girl was old enough to marry), and something called \"Christian patriarchy\", wherein the father is viewed as a sort of mini god. I grew up attending a small Christian school run by the local Independent Fundamentalist Baptist church, where every student was Quiverfull. We were required to wear extremely modest clothing (ankle length skirts, hemlines that covered the base of our necks, etc. We had wardrobe checks multiple times each day.) Each morning we pledged allegiance to the Christian Flag and to the Bible. It's been years, but I can still recite both pledges by heart. Then we recited the chapters of the Bible we were working on. Yes, I did say chapters. We memorized several books of the Bible (Jonah, all of Paul's epistles, most of Genesis, Daniel, a decent amount of Leviticus and I think the Gospel of Mark.)\n&gt; Our schoolwork was primarily books published by Abeka, BJUPress and ACE. Our textbooks claimed that: no transitional fossils had ever been found the Loch Ness Monster had been proven to be real and was a plesiosaur the Great Depression never happened but was just a myth made up by the socialists slavery was a win-win solution for all involved dinosaurs breathed fire the KKK were great dudes who got a bad rap the trail of tears was actually super great outer space wasn't real because if you blew on a pile of baby powder, a new planet wouldn't form (this was demonstrated) the Liberals don't believe in personal responsibility the world is about to be attacked by the floating Space Jerusalem. We never covered much actual math, science, etc. Learning the truth about the government's plan to kill Holocaust the Christians was seen as much more important.\n&gt; For one year the girls also took Christian Charm. This was primarily about how God really, really cares about whether your chest is 10 inches largest than your waist or not. Girls were forbidden from standing with their feet parallel, \"like a man's\", instead having to keep our feet at ridiculous and painful angles. We couldn't walk without being careful to \"glide gracefully\" and avoid \"swishing\" our knees. We were forbidden to not smile, but our smiles were never big enough, or they were too big.\n&gt; There wasn't much time for real schoolwork anyway, since we were all so busy being punished for having an ungodly facial expression, and forced to spend the rest of the school day standing on our tiptoes on one foot in the corner.\n&gt; In fourth grade my parents chose to pull me out and homeschool me. We joined a local homeschool group filled with Quiverfull homeschoolers. My parents had gone to a different church, one which was very Charismatic (we spoke in tongues, exorcised people, \"healed\" with prayer) but not necessarily quite so extreme as the IFB school I had been sent to. However, as my father became more violent (he had a lot of mental issues and was an extreme hoarder), my mother (who was a borderline hoarder and very depressed, so much so that for the first ten years of my life she barely left her bed except to use the washroom) became more and more heavily sucked into this subculture.\n&gt; My parents had already gotten rid of most TV channels over concerns about evil spirits and only allowed us to read a few classic books, but after this my mom first stopped allowing us to read anything non-Christian, then banned novels altogether. We began being forbidden to see anyone who did not go to our church or homeschool group. Since my parents never really started teaching, and I had little access to books and at the time no internet, this left little to do all day aside from copy out Bible verses and stare out the window for hours. Time sort of stopped meaning anything.\n&gt; We became more into the Biblical patriarchy thing, where my father was seen as the head of our household and a sort of direct representative from god who women were to serve and obey in every way. You weren't supposed to express any kind of wishes or desire, but leave it up to your husband/father to make all decisions for you. (if you were his daughter, this included selecting your husband--girls were expected to be stay at home daughters, serving their fathers, until marriage) Biblical femininity was emphasized, which in this case basically meant long skirts and not having opinions or desires, except to serve whatever man God chose as the best \"helpmeet\" possible.\n&gt; For a couple of years my mom, who was herself a nurse stopped allowing us to take medicine, believing it to be witchcraft. She became more and more crazed about the idea of demons trying to attack her and our family. Unfortunately, I was born with a birthmark on my leg. She believed that this made me Satan. My father and mother both searched for ways to fix this. I've been exorcised, had oil poured over me, had everything I owned burned, etc. It apparently didn't work.\n&gt; After my father died we were at least spared his extreme violence, but my mother became only more unhinged and depressed. She mostly gave up on her idea of me as Satan, but became absolutely obsessed with the idea of Satan attacking our family. This belief is reinforced by our church and all the Charismatic material she reads. She even abandoned our homeschool group, believing it to not be concerned enough about how demons are possessing everyone.\n&gt; Our church is obsessed with spiritual attacks, which are seen as stemming from absolutely everything. Anne of Green Gables? Witchcraft! Christian music? Actually sung by Satanists, filled with subliminal Satanic messages! Cabbage patch dolls? Demons who stay still when we look at them! (I'm 100% serious) The only way to ward this off is speaking in tongues, making prophesies, etc. A few people in my church believe they hear the voices of demons in their head, and said demons are chasing them. I've been there as we've all laid hands on people and prayed for them to be liberated from the demonic oppression in their lives.\n&gt; I...don't really have an end to this story. I still live with my mother and sister. I still go months without seeing anyone who isn't from my church. I still have no real education, although since I can now access the internet (it's monitored, but my mother doesn't know incognito mode is a thing, so I can secretly read Homeschoolers Anonymous, No Longer Quivering, things about atheism and reddit) I've been trying to learn some math through Khan Academy. I have hope of eventual escape, even if I have no idea how just yet.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416053898", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Matt walked in and I walked up to his desk to ask for a pen and then i got another friend of ours to ask him why he was always talking to himself. Along the course of the day, I got more friends to ask him why he talked to himself. By the end of the day, he was pretty freaked out when i walked up to him and asked him why he was trying to get rid of me, his imagination, he started to scream at me asking me  what I wanted from him that's when i told him, \"I need about tree fiddy\".

One night I dream about a girl from 15 years ago and how are having wonderful sex and the next day I'll be freaking out because I'm at work from a job from 5 years ago combined with the job from this year and all the sudden there's my neighbor. When I was a child I was chased by a lion I tried to jump over the fence but I couldn't because I put the pretty side out my neighbor was upset that we put the pretty side facing the street and on her side there was the ugly side so that we can see the pretty side on the back side of the lot. The so much random this the Trans Am Sam has a positive sometimes or negative sometimes our sex sometimes as whore sometimes it is death sometimes you're flying sometimes you're walking, you can be hanging with friends, can create a random user name and make haikus even though that's already been done, you can draw colors of people's posts, you can think you see what you see but not know what you actually see do you know what you do do not actually do what you do. Do you get that room sets a moment where you dream within a dream within a dream you wake up not knowing if you actually woke up if you're still dreaming if you're awake only to fall asleep within your sleep to dream the same dream that you had before but yet slightly different this time the wall instead of being a 45 degree angle is actually maind the kids that you knew across the street are now actually adults but yet you're still the child now they're raising you instead of you raising them but then you awake again but yet you're still dreaming then when you're trying to figure out of the tree in the you had was a dream and if you're within a dream you away from the dream that you will walk from the dream only to realize it is 4am you still have another 3 hours before your alarm goes off you fall back to sleep only to dream the dream that you had before but this time it's only the first level dream so it's not as fluid and lucid and can't change it you can't shape it and change to make it your own. No the stream this within your first dream but not the second dream is a new dream only to start a mess about you thinking about the previous dream from before you awoke from your dream within a dream but now you're back having sex with the girl from 15 years ago; why? At this point you realize that nearly not for you dreaming you're awake but you're flying but you're still dreaming within a dream are you Leonardo DiCaprio are you simply spinning a top to see if it ever stops do you know that you're within the dream are your kids there is that your wife? You keep swimming do you keep flying are you really walking are you really floating ohmygod your invented the hoover board.

{"body": "Definition of what? If individuals contract to work together, that relationship can take any form. As long as there isn't a third party regulating those individuals, its capitalism.

If a business has customers that spend money there, that community is retrospect wanted that facility. If you want to destroy stuff, go ahead. People won't like you anymore, or want to help you.\n\nTaxation in general slows down the economy, slowing progress in tech and infrastructure.

Thorium is what we need, but how super regulated the nuclear industry is by the state, means that will be a decade or so off, even if China makes them first.\n\nPeople own themselves. People can't sell themselves into slavery, because a slave doesn't own themselves and can't make a contract, one can't agree to be a slave because you would lose the ability to agree, the contract to be a slave is void because no one owned the property at that point to sell. A business is a service that meets the desires of clients. I'm not sure who even would want slaves. In a more brutally honest sense, slaves are unprofitable, everything a slave could do is done by machines now. I guess sex slavery, but even than a good prostitute would be better and cheaper.\n\nI think I'm being pretty precise.

I remember how it jolted me, how the hairs on my arm stood up like they were ready to run away from danger. But I didn't listen to my body, I went to answer the door. \n\nOut of curiosity I looked through the peep hole, but it was pitch black. My under developed teenage mind blew it off like a seventh hour homework assignment. \nI pulled open the door, swinging it open all the way. Right there on my doorstep was an old lady, she was wheezing and convulsing. The fear griped me like I'd just dropped the bench press bar on my chest. I snapped out of it and called 911 while I tried to get her to come to consciousness. The dispatcher frantically told me to ask her loudly if she needed anything, perhaps she's a diabetic he said. \n\n\"What do you need!?\" I Half screamed half asked the dying woman.

{"body": "There was this girl I would talk to online occasionally.  She wasn't incredibly attractive, but one night I was hard up and probably hadn't had any action in weeks.  She was 17 years old (age of consent in my state is 17, judge me as you will but I was only 20) She was about an hour away, but promised she would at least give me a hand job if I came to see her.  I drove down there and she made me park far away from her home and walk to it with her.\n\nWhen she walked up to my car I realize she is a little bit bigger than her pictures let on.  I'm not trying to be judgmental and I am not trying to be mean to bigger girls, but it was just a fact that she was good at making herself look smaller in pictures.  I was caught off guard and considered just driving off. Then I thought \"shit, I drove an hour, she had already seen me\". . . I said \"fuck it, attracted to her or not, I'm going in.\"  \n\nWhen we get there, she says I have to be quiet because her parents are sleeping upstairs.  We watch some TV for a bit and we end up making out.  Eventually she gives me a handjob.  I asked for a BJ, but it was clear that if I pushed her, she would back out entirely.  I accepted the handjob and was very grateful for it.  \n\nI'm not sure if it was the idea that her parents were upstairs, or that I hadn't had any action in a while or what it was. . . but that was probably the hardest I have ever cum in my entire life.  The girl could wank a joint.  \n\nBeing the jerk that I am sometimes, I was gonna just leave but she stopped me and said \"Now I get mine.\"  The pre-ejaculation fog had been lifted and I was thinking more clearly, so honestly, I just wanted to get the fuck out of there.  I told her \"I really have to go, and I'm afraid your parents will catch us.\"  Don't get me wrong here.  She was completely in the right.  It was my duty to return the favor, but I just didn't really want to.  \n\nI started by playing with her clit and fingering her.  Eventually she wanted more and told me to go down on her.  I really didn't want to, but she then threatened to wake her parents up on me, which really freaked me out so I obliged.  Technically, 17 is legal, but she had really religious parents and if they wanted to go to the cops they could have because she was a minor.  I ended up going downtown. \n\nIt wasn't the worst thing in the world, but it wasn't the best either.  Finally after being down there for about 10 minutes, she eventually came.  I stopped and was about to get myself the fuck out of there when she said \"wait, that's not all\".  I said \"What?  What do you want now?\"  She said to me \"It's not about what I want, it's more like what I need.\"  Frustrated, scared and just wanting to get the fuck out of there, I said \"Ok, so what do you need.\" She looked at me with these cold eyes that just sent shivers down my spine and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since and she stopped getting online after that.  I have no idea what happened to her, but it will always be the strangest sexual experience of my life.  On the other hand, it was probably the best handjob I've ever gotten and I've never cum harder than that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416162671", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is true. I spent my summers from university backpacking in various mountain ranges in America - from the Cascades to the Adirondack, I've done them all. It was a glorious way to spend time with my friends, my family, and one time even my environmental professor.\n\nI recently underwent a whole midlife crisis, during which my therapist suggested that I get back into hiking. So this past summer, I took a week off of work, packed up the mini van, and drove my wife and two teenage kids to the Appalachian Mountains. \n\nI was ready to have a great week of bonding with my family, but my kids thought otherwise - \"What do you mean, I can't snapchat my friends?\" \"I can't even check in on Foursquare, what is this shit?\" My son and daughter were absolutely distraught that we were actually away from civilization and cell phone service/WiFi for an entire week.\n\nGradually, my kids got more and more upset with me and my wife at the lack of wifi. They spent the entire time lagging behind, causing me to become frustrated with them. So one morning, they refused to leave their tent. I begged and pleaded with them to no avail, so I sent my wife (their stepmother) to take care of them. She came back crying, saying that the kids were so upset that they started using racial slurs (my kids are white, my wife is black). \n\nSo, I decided to teach them a lesson - if they didn't want to come with us, fine. I set a map outside their tent for the next two days, and told them to meet us at the rendezvous point where our car would be waiting for us. My wife was still very disturbed by the incident; before we left she went to confront the kids about it one more time. I only heard a part of the conversation:\n\n\"Raquel, Charlie, can we talk?\"\n\"No. Go away.\"\n\"If you don't accept me as a parental figure, that's fine. But using derogatory slurs is never okay. Now, I'm willing to accept an apology, but  first I need something from you.\"\n\"What do you need?\"\n\"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nI ran outside, but it was too late - it turns out, my new wife was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. That goddamn Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\n\nTL;DR - Went hiking with the wife and kids without wifi for a week.

{"body": "There were many reasons.  The booze.  The pills.  Other lovers.\n\nWe had met when we were young.  In high school.  She was the shy girl that talked to nobody.  I was the introvert who put on a good exterior show most of the day, but deep down, couldn't stand people.  She walked in front of me in the hallway one day between classes, and I just happened to say hello to her.  It was a mistake.\n\nWe dated on and off from that point during high school.  The first time we had sex it was amazing.  Passionate.  Energetic.  Primal.  Unfortunately that same rhythm in bed became the rhythm our relationship, our lives.  As graduation neared, we had a choice to make, continue the relationship long-distance as she went off to college while I finished high school or end the relationship.  Despite every warning to the contrary, we decided to try the long-distance thing.\n\nDespite the changes we both experienced over the next year, we decided to get married as soon as finished high school.  I took a job at the local factory as a laborer, so she could finish her education.  To make a better life for both us.  I failed.  We failed.  \n\nA few months after being married, she started to leave the house in the evening.  She became moody.  Sex happened less frequently.  I asked if she was okay and would receive a non-committal answer.  One night I decided to follow her.  I wish I could un-see that night.  She pulled into a motel room about 45 minutes away from our home.  As she opened the motel room door, I could see that there were a few other people in the room.  I cringed in horror as looked into the window.  She was on the bed with three different men.  They were treating her like an object, defiling her body at will.  I could see she didn't care.  That she loved it.  The table across the room was littered with pills and white powder.  Stunned, I got back in my car and headed for home.\n\nI was shocked.  What was going to do?  I wasn't sure I could even be mad.  See, I had been drinking a lot since taking the job at the factory.  There were nights I could remember where I was.  Where I ended up passed out on the bathroom floor.  And there were women too.  Many women.  I sat down on the bed and began to cry.  What was I to do?\n\nHours later she walked in the door as if nothing had happened.  I greeted her with a small hello.  Right away, I could see she knew something was up.  I couldn't help it, the words started pouring out of me.  Of what I had saw.  What I had did.  We both began to cry.  Despite all that happened, I think there was still love there.  Finally, I asked if there was anything we could do to salvage our relationship.  Anything we could do to make it work.  I asked \"What do you need from me that I'm not giving you.\"  She replied \"I think I need about tree fiddy.\"  Well it was about that time I noticed my wife was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the plethazoic era.  I said \"God damn it you Loch Ness Monster, I ain't given you no three fiddy.\"  My mother who had just walked in the door gave her a dollar.  But it didn't matter, I knew we were doomed and I ended the relationship right there.\n\n**tl;dr: We didn't get along very well.**\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416258808", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; why you are an atheist\n\nI am an atheist because I have never been convinced to be a theist. \n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nIf you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n\n&gt; I hear \"there's no proof of god\" all the time but this is as much of an argument as \"My book says god exists.\"\n\nI hear \"there's no proof of leprechauns\" all the time but this is as much of an argument as \"The [Fergus mac Leti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergus_mac_L%C3%A9ti) says leprechaun exists.\" Does that really make sense to you?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416378565", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Note: This post is too big to fit in one post, so here's the other half**\n\n**Part Two: The Fanfictioning**\n\n\nHere's what I would have done: assuming 9, 10 and 11 are in it. The subplot of a nethersphere-like Matrix would have been implanted, stolen along with the moment. They stand in the area where the Matrix is (the barn, maybe, though I would have written it as an old, abandoned Time Lord satellite orbiting their star, of the time when Omega and Rassilon [and the Other?] performed stellar experiments) and stand over the Matrix, shiny red button and all. 10 and 11 are trying to convince 9 to do it, to hit the button, to end all of this and live with it, but 9 can't. He just can't. If he must kill his people, then the whole universe may as well burn. After some encouragement, he would hover his hand over the button.. But fail, the weight of the moment crushing down on him. Regaining his breath, we hear a voice from off-camera \"Good, no need for this to end just yet\". He looks up and, standing behind 10 and 11 is an old man, one hand holding a cane, the other on his lapel, his long, slicked back white hair framing a pointed face. The First Doctor. I'm talking Bradly, in his costume/persona from Adventures in Time and Space. He walks up to 9, 10 and 11 and talks with them about the Doctor's effect and role in the Time War, and the reason why 9 must press the Moment: To safeguard the universe, Gallifrey Must Fall (which maybe would tie in with Silence must fall, I don't know). 10 and 11 once more talk about the universe without Time Lords, and 9 has a \"I don't want your future!\" moment, saying \"I can't make this decision myself\" and we see the room light up with TARDISes. We see 2 and 3 bickering slightly among themselves lightly as they step out, until they look around and start to remember where they are, simultaneously. We see 4 come out of another, in his costume and perhaps Clara mentions something about him looking older, and 4 sprouts some technobabble about \"Well, time is like a lens, enough timelines cross and the image gets blurry\". The second last Tardis doors open and we see 5, 6 and 7 rushedly running out and stopping, realising where they are. Clara asks if they look different because of the lens thing too: 5 and 7 start nodding, 6 shakes his head until 5 jabs him with his elbow and starts nodding along. 9 is overwhelmed looking around until he sees the final TARDIS doors open: 8, wearing a bandolier. 9 is furious, and makes towards 8, possibly shouting about how 8's \"Warmongering\" is to blame for all of this, but 1 calms him and brings all of them together around the moment. 1 talks of how, on this day, a choice needs to be made. That choice is too big for anyone but the Doctor to make. 9 says he can't make the choice, until 3 or 5 tell him that \"The choice is the Doctors\". One by one the Doctors place their hands on the Moment. \"What we do, we do without choice\" says 7, \"In the name of peace, and sanity\". The Moment is pressed. Cue footage of Gallifrey, burning, a wall of flame descending and crossing over the planet, Dalek Saucers and Time Lord buildings being engulfed equally. Over this, a voice over of 11 talks of how \"On this day, the choice was made. A choice that would condemn, and save, countless lives. A choice not easily made, but was made by one man. For this, was the Day of the Doctor\". After the voice-over calms down, cue a general \"That was tough, let's get out of here\" banter from the various Doctors; 5 6 and 7 rush off to face their obvious but undisclosed threat, 4 sticks around and mentions something fan-jokey to Clara, while 9 is still reeling from his actions and 1 mentions something to him about \"The Matrix was never found\" that 11 overhears. After a little banter and character, the Doctors leave in various ways, and the Moment scene ends.\n\nOk, fanfiction aside, what I was trying to do was: 1) Resolve Gallifrey in the way we know how, but also leave it open to come back, 2) Introduce the other Doctors in an equal way with a large impact, using Bradley, Shearsmith and maybe Sean Pertwee as 1, 2 and 3; and 3) have the emotion of the scene at least connect with how we know the Doctor's life plays out.\n\nSorry, by now I've been writing this for about an hour so forgive me if I gloss over a few points now for more reasons I dislike the 50th:\n\nTen, and the \"Tumblr Fandom\" jokes. Dear Gods, this was annoying me throughout watching the episode. \"Oh, he has a fez, fezzes are cool, bowties are cool, 10 said allons-y, har har har har har\". Mindless repetition of something that was interesting once is fine for a fandom (if annoying) but loathsome in an episode, especially such a landmark episode. 10, especially, didn't offer anything unique. He and 11 play off each other too well, their dialogue was interchangable. Look at the Three Doctors: Each Doctor has a distinct personality while having similarities they can easily work off of. Also, Osgood isn't dying in a horribly painful fashion yet, doubleplusungood. I swear, it's as if someone snuck their Mary Sue fanfic character into the script and Moffat just rolled with it. \n\nAnniversary as Introductory: The episode was clearly used as a way to get a new following. A new Doctor was made for a clean slate, the fanbase's favourite character coming back, the Zygons as both \"oh, you 40 year olds remember this from your childhood right, the sight of this brings you back to the days when you could watch Top of the Pops unironically\" and \"Yeah, we can't do a whole episode about the Time War because that's hard for a new audience to understand, so half of our special advertised as \"Finally watch the Time War\" is gonna be about that, and half of it is going to be about Zygons.\"\n\nZygons, dear Cthulu, they were shoved in there. I get that you *can't* do a HD Dalek episode for 76 minutes straight, but I'm sorry, while the whole \"Oh, who is the right one and who isn't\" is a good idea for a regular series episode, *Zygons were not the right fracking choice for the* **focus** *of the Anniversary episode*. I was waiting to see the inevitable rubber Nessie. \n\nLastly: It didn't feel like an anniversary. It felt like a blown-out-of-proportion epsiode, and yes it is awesome to get a feel of an episode with a £XMillion budget (where X&gt;1) but it felt like less of a celebration of the series, which is fine for certain things but...\n\nI'll say exactly what my casual-fan girlfriend said: \"The Day of the Doctor\" was an episode that aired on the anniversary. \"An Adventure in Time and Space\" *was* the Anniversary celebration of Doctor Who.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416425979", "subreddit": "gallifrey", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "cont...\n\nScenes\n\nInteraction is broken down into scenes. Think of it as a TV show where you have a scene to shoot. Be very clear where you are on the ship, or away team etc... Continuity can get tricky. Denote the setting clearly like this:\n\n[Helios – Observation Lounge]\n\n[Wolfram Alpha – Vulcan Science Camp]\n\n[Abandoned Space Station – Sick Bay]\n\nAlso, update your setting if the scene involves motion. the mission post may start in the transporter room, but wind up on the planet surface.\n\nWhen writing the introduction to a scene you should aim for two to six paragraphs. The focus of an introduction is establishing the environment. all other posts feed off of the one that came before it. You need to read what came before, (occasionally after if you have tag in the middle of a post) and decide how your character would respond.\n\nTo do that, answer the following questions: What are you here to do? What does it look like where you are? What’s happening? It’s important to give responding players something to interact with so that they can help move the plot of the scene along. Essentially, you are creating a writing prompt or “hook” for other players. Don’t worry about writing down every little detail. Focus on the important bits and let everything fall into place. It’s important to include what your character is doing, thinking, and/or feeling.\n\nOverwriting can happen from time to time where something is described to death, or bogged in the minutiae. It’s so much better to describe a badass by their actions than a super long description and breakdown of ability. We got to know Worf over a long period of time, if he had been presented at first with his whole bio and skillset he would have been a 2-dimensional trope. “Show, rather than Tell.”\n\nResponding to Scenes\n\nWhen writing a response to a scene you should try to write three or four paragraphs, but at least two. Responses should be focused on moving the plot of the scene along. Don’t worry about writing big blocks of text – just get the basics what your character is doing, thinking, and feeling. You may need to add detail to help flesh out the environment. Maybe you would like your character do interact with something that is appropriate for the scene, but wasn’t detailed in the introduction. Feel free to add it!\n\nGenerally, your first bit will respond to the previous bit, and the end of your post should both set new stuff in motion as well as provide a hook for the next bit to be added.\n\nA note about starting new scenes from other scenes: Scenes are finite conversations that only take place in a single area, once the conversation moves to another area it’s time to start a new scene.\n\nReference\n\nFor Reference and Knowledge Trek, I use these sites more than any other.\n\nhttp://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Portal:Main\n\nhttp://database.obsidianfleet.netwiki/index.php?title=Main_Page\n\nhttp://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/\n\nThis is also a good guide for players. (http://lisp.lcnessie.nl/lessons.html )\n\nAnything referenced from these sites or any Tech Manual will trump anything Soft Canon. This shouldn't be a problem ever, just resources for really good, high level detailed writing.\n\nParticipation requirements:\n\n1) To be considered active and to be included in the planning of missions, it is requested that all players post a minimum of once every week. This post may be in a JP or a solitary mission post or in a personal log/side story. Three weeks of unexcused inactivity will warrant contact by the Admin staff to determine whether the player needs to take a leave or be removed.\n\n2) You must not, under any circumstances, use another player's character or NPC without their knowledge or consent. This may, however, be done by the command team if a player suddenly becomes inactive or is unable to be located and a response on that character's behalf is required to move the plot along. NPC that are linked to the “Senior Staff” Account however are fair usage. \n\n3) Be patient and kind. We cannot read each others minds, and are often communicating with whole days between messages. Misfires will happen, be adult about it and talk it through.\n\nCommunicating\n\nWhen writing in-character you need to use the third person perspective – refer to your character by his/her name and by “he” or “she.” Use quotation marks (“”) to denote when your character is speaking.\n\nUse italics to denote what your character says to him-/herself in his/her head. italics can be coded in with &lt;”i”&gt; these are my thoughts &lt;/”i”&gt;  .I put  quotations marks around the i to keep it from disappearing as coding to the website, remove the quotes and anything inside the  brackets will be italicized\n\nFinally, use =/\\= “hi” to denote what your character says over the comm badge.\n\n=/\\= “Chavez to Ro”\n=/\\= “Ro here”\n\n\nRead these! tropes are okay but be aware of them.\nhttp://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTropes\nhttp://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalMutability\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416450281", "subreddit": "holodeck", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

He's well-known for practicing on his iPad between frames - a technique which many attribute to his success and unmatched skill in the game.\n\nHere are some of Varipapa's achievements:\n\n\n* 2011 - at just 9 years old, became youngest winner of PBA Youth Tournament, beating Tom Smallwood, 269-207.\n* 2012 - youngest bowler in history to bowl a perfect (300) game.\n* 2013 - wins PBA Tournament of Youth Champions, beating Jason Belmonte, 224-179.\n* 2014 - wins PBA Tournament of Youth Champions for the second consecutive year, beating Wes Malott, 219-218, and becoming the youngest person to ever win two years in a row.\n\nNot only has practicing on his iPad given him a level of skill and accuracy that professional bowling has never seen before, it also allows Varipapa to achieve record-setting high scores, sometimes even surpassing the perfect 300 score by exploiting some lesser-known rules in bowling.\n\nIn March 2014, Varipapa caused some controversy by scoring even higher than 300 - in fact, he bowled about tree fiddy. It wasn't until he turned to face a stunned crowd that they realized he was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

Everytime I saw him he got a little more trashy looking and lost a bit more weight.\nNot embarrasing, but about a secret my cousin had that I found out.\n\nI hitched a ride out west from him, from Montreal to B.C. Around the time we got to Saskatchewan I found him in the washroom doing some blow. I blew up on him (No pun intended). Anyways we made it to Victoria, I caught him doing blow in Calgary on the way as well. We got to Victoria and he was so strung out, I didn't know what to do. I had a friend there and I stayed there for a few days, then my cousin OD'd on heroin. I had him checked into rehab. I stayed with my friend for a few weeks, he got me in at his construction company and I got a place with 2 other room mates, just month to month and checking on my cousin. After 2 months he was let go from rehab, and I got him a job. \n\nHe turned his life around, I never told anyone about what happened back home, just told my parents we were busy, and that he was really busy working graveyard shifts (He could only call home 2-3 times a week, so the cover worked.) Anyways after a bit I moved back home to be close to my Grandma from my other side of the family, after she passed I went back out to see my cousin. He was doing really good now, had a girlfriend and she was 2 months pregnant and he was looking forward to living a good life, it was nice to see. \n\nWe had a long conversation, and he was really happy and glad I did what I did and forced him into rehab. We had a few beers, were chilling on a cabin near the ocean. After a bit of silence about talking about his upcoming child, he turned and asked me something I'll never forget.\n\nHe asked me, \"I need about tree fiddy\". Then I realized that my cousin was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic period. I yelled back at him \"Dammit monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" and he swam off into the Pacific.\n\nI never saw him again after that.\n\nTL;DR: I kept my cousin's secret, and he still betrayed me.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416452637", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -27, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Its happened to me as well.  An acquaintance of mine that I had gone on a date or two in the past but things were never right because she was moving (we had two day trips biking and hiking a few weeks before she was leaving, so I left it at just friendship)...moved back after two years and facebook'd me saying we should get together.  I had hoped that the earlier dates would be added to the three date rule (i.e., sex) and I suggested a new place that had just opened and was swanky enough ensure that it was known 'this is a date'.\n\nI picked her up, we headed to the joint, and when I told the maitre dour name and reservation, she asks \"Would you happen to have a table for 4?  I have two more coming.\"  WTF?  Ok, she wants me to meet her friends.  Ok.  That's fine.  Sorta.\n\nSmall talk, 15 minutes later...two more dudes show up, all looking confused...and she pulls out her laptop and asks if we each had tree fiddy.  No...that's not it.  Vacations.  She wanted to know if we wanted to buy into time shares all across the world and was selling vacations.  And that we should all be selling time share vacations as her associates and that if all three of us were to buy in, her next vacation would be free.  And she MIGHT just want to take one of us with her.  \n\nI got up and left without saying anything.  The worst part of all of this?  Pulling into the place, she had pointed out a spot where I didn't even see that there was a hydrant -- I was assuming she saw it because it was on her side of the car, and that she knew this was an illegal spot (which was why no one was parked there.  I came out to my car, $200 ticket for blocking a fire hydrant. For which she would have almost had to bash the passenger side door into getting out.  That I didn't see because I was an idiot and expected my 'date' to not encourage me to park illegally, on a busy road three blocks from the police station where SOMEONE would most certainly give me a ticket.  \n\nI got several hate messages from her on FB for abandoning her, and that I had 'promised' a great dinner at this place, and that I owed her for a taxi, and that I was a dickless asshole, and how I'm going to die alone and would never have a hot girl like her, and that I could have had her if only I had paid $5k for a vacation that would have cost me $300 if I had planned on it myself and not got scammed, and that she'll never go out with me again and BTW here is the photo of the guy she is currently banging back in the town she is actually living and hadn't actually moved back at all, but was staying with a friend for a few weeks while she scammed everyone she use to know until she found another place to do the same.\n\nGod damn it.  It only took me a day to defriend her on facebook, and I got all of this in the short time between dinner and her getting nutso shitty with me.  The girl was hot, but fuck...not hot enough to deal with this.  I knew the girl she was staying with (actually, this might have been how we met in the first place), and she kicked her out after reading this knowing she was being used for this purpose.  \n\nFuck vertical pyramid scheme scam whores.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1416501340", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1068, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; If 1000 people saw a dead person come back to life, the most REASONABLE conclusion would be that it happened. 1000 people are rarely all crazy or mistaken.\n\nI think you're overlooking the point. Let's say I agree that 1000 people are rarely all crazy or mistaken—I certainly don't agree given the number of people who swear they've seen aliens and bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, but let's say I did agree. It would still be irrational to accept the resurrection, because no matter how rare it is for 1000 people to all be crazy or mistaken, it's obviously far rarer for a dead person to come back to life. We don't even know such an event to be *possible*, and we have every reason for thinking it *impossible*.\n\nThis is the problem with these kinds of supernatural claims. You're invoking the notion that the rules that typically govern the universe were broken or suspended for one particular event to occur. There's no way to make such a claim rational, because the rules that govern the universe don't appear to suspend or have exceptions. You're choosing to believe something that flies in the face of everything we think we know about how the world works. That's your right, but there's no way to make it rational.\n\nYou understand this yourself, on some level. I'm assuming you aren't particularly impressed by the stories of Indian yogis and gurus who were supposedly born of virgins, miraculously heal people, etc. Yet these events have far more witnesses—people living today you can actually go talk to—than are even *claimed* to have witnessed a resurrected Jesus.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416506741", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

They'll see some women do some awkward/crazy ass shit and still have a dude returning their calls just because she's shaped like Chanel Staxxx and sucks dick like Karrine Stephans and/or the grapefruit lady.\n\n* A man can both see you as a sexual being and as a person. If a guy propositions you for sex, it's not a sign of disrespect. It means he's attracted to you.\n\n* Keeping the first two points in mind: The reason why guys don't pick up on hints(Even ones as obvious as sitting in his lap and/or asking to watch a movie at his place) is because if we're wrong, we can ruin a friendship.

Repeatedly. The reason those guys aren't forming two well formed sentences referencing your profile is because it's really not worth the effort.

Bet him about tree fiddy that you can find him a date by the end of the week.\n\n* If we don't do anything we'll die alone.

{"body": "There was a man that lived in a small country in Tennessee. He owned a nice plot of land and had three very obedient, darling children. He also had a cat. Well, one day the children (who loved the cat ver much) woke up to see that cat gone. No matter how and where they searched, they could not find a trace of her (for it was a female cat).\n\nSo the eldest son (who was 12) set out to go through the forest that the man owned (for though he lived in a small country, he was indeed very wealthy) to look for the cat. He walked this way and that but could not find her. \n\nThe next day the second eldest child, a girl (who was 9) set out to look for the cat. She went this way and that but could not find the cat. So she looked in the burrows of squirrels and rabbit-lokes, but found no cat. So she came back home very disappointed.\n\nThe youngest daughted (who was but 5 years old) was too small to go to the forest alone, so the man went instead, but returned with no luck. \n\nYears flew by, but the cat hadn't returned. Everyone assumed that the cat was dead, lost in the forest somewhere. So the family got over thinking about the cat and bought a dog instead (did I mention that they were wealthy?). But at one point the dog, too, disappeared. The family had dealt with this kind of situation before, so they did not go looking for the dog this time. However, a great evil began to befall them. Every night someone would come and take a boeard from the shed. They'd guard the shed, they'd not sleep through the whole night, but they could not find who it was and the boards kept disappearing. After the shed was gone boards from the house began disappearing as well. \n\nSo the eldest son (who was 19) went into the forest to find the culprit. He went this way and that, but came home exausted and disappointed. He had been all about that forest, and npthing came of his travels. He did bring one board back however, so that was all good. \n\nThe family asked him \"Where did you go?\"\n\nAnd he said \"To the forest.\"\n\nAnd they said \"What did you see?\"\n\nAnd he replied \"A tree stump.\"\n\nAnd they asked \"Where was the board?\"\n\nAnd he replied \"On the stump.\"\n\nAnd that was that.\n\nThe eldest daughter (who was 16, duh) went next and went this way and that but found no culprit. She went this way and that, and did not come back till midnight, and caught the family all worried. She brought back two boards, but was all dirty and scratched up. After she apologized she explained: \"I went to the forest and saw a hill. On that hill I saw one board. So I went up to it and looked down the hill and saw a ditch, and out of it another board was sticking out. I went to the ditch and caught my foot in a root, and took five hours to get out. I brought these two boards with me.\"\n\nThe next day, the youngest daughter went to the forest. Dusk came, but the young girl was still not coming back. After nightfall, she was still gone. The father was preparing to go search for her, but realizing that he will find nothing in the dark he postponed the operation till morning. However, when morning came she returned, clean and unharmed. The family was glad to see her.\n\nThey asked her \"Where did you go?\" \n\n\"To the forest\" she replied.\n\n\"What did you find?\" asked they.\n\n\"A hermit\" said she.\n\n\"Is he the guy who steals our boards?\" they asked.\n\n\"Yes, but I gave him everything that he wants and he will bother us no more.\" she replied.\n\n\"What did he want?\"\n\n\"About tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416521577", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; why are you an atheist\n\nI am an atheist because I have never been convinced to be a theist. \n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nIf you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416532202", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have never seen nor been presented with sufficient evidence to believe the claim that a god exists.\n\nThat's all there is to it. Here's how I figured that out:\n\nI used to be a Christian, actually. Non-denominational, but I believed the whole \"Jesus died for our sins\" thing, \"accepted him into my heart\", read my bible, and occasionally proselytized to my friends (and probably pissed a few of them off in the process). I believed all of the basic tenets of Christianity.\n\nThere was a point where I realized that it was all just stories in a book. And that might not have been when I stopped believing, but it's when I started drifting away. If they were just stories in a book, how was I supposed to know if they were true stories or fiction? I kept believing, but stopped reading the bible, and continued like that for a while.\n\nThen I got to university. I took courses on philosophy, ethics, logic, history, and  religion. The one that really got me thinking was a course entitled \"Philosophy of Religion\". On day one, the prof came in, sat down at the front of the room, and said something to the effect of \"We all have different beliefs in this room. And that's fine. As we go through the course, I ask that you respect each other, but feel free to question beliefs. Your beliefs are GOING to get challenged in this course. Either deal with it, or take a different course.\" The course focused mainly on the major arguments for the existence of a god. We dissected them and tore them apart one by one. I remember my final paper was a 20 page critique on the Kalam Cosmological Argument. My realization, once that course was complete, since none of the arguments for God had any merit, and all contained logical fallacies, was that I probably didn't believe anymore. I didn't admit it yet, but I was getting closer.\n\nAt that time I started debating online, asking and answering questions, and reading books by Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens, And Harris, as well as others. I began watching a show I found on YouTube called \"The Atheist Experience\" - it's a public access show out of Austin, Texas, and they air nearly every week. There are several years of shows on YouTube, and the entire archive is available at www.atheist-experience.com. The hosts are articulate and knowledgable, and what they primarily do is take calls from believers and challenge them to prove their beliefs. It's very interesting, because watching it for a while reveals that no one can, not even the professional apologists who occasionally call in like Matt Slick and Ray Comfort. The arguments are one sided, and that's because the atheist side is the correct side. It's easy to win an argument when you are right.\n\nEventually I was able to admit there was no God. It felt weird at first, mainly because I spent my childhood being afraid of hell. But that went away.\n\nSo, that got long, sorry. But all of the failed religious arguments and debates and everything else showed me that there is no evidence for God. If there was, faith wouldn't be required, and theists would be rubbing it in our faces that they could prove God was real. But we don't see that. All the religious side has is failed arguments and personal convictions. Non-believers don't require evidence to support their lack of belief, but the fact that science continues to explain more and more about the universe without needing to add God into the equation, to me, speaks pretty loudly. It's an indirect form of \"proof\", but we can't ever prove there is no God anyway, just like we can't prove the Loch Ness monster isn't there. We could search the whole lake, and maybe every time we looked it just moved to a different part of the lake.\n\nI am now genuinely convinced that the world would be a better place without religion.\n\nI have three books to recommend, if you haven't read them already:\n\nFirst is \"The God Delusion\" by Richard Dawkins. It's kind of an \"atheist's 'bible'\" of sorts, in that it comes as close as possible to a complete disproof of the possibility of a god.\n\nSecond is \"God Is Not Great\" by Christopher Hitchens. I can't recommend it enough. This is a scathing demonstration of why religion isn't just wrong; it's downright harmful.\n\nThird is \"The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\" by Carl Sagan. This is a book that does an excellent job of tearing apart superstition and demonstrating why logic, reason, and science are your best bet if you want to really understand the universe. The chapter on the dragon in the garage is on its own a great essay on why people should find it so much harder to believe the claims made by religions.\n\nBest of luck in your search for truth.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416537356", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

She hurried across to the city gate and scaled the wall before making her way swiftly to the Vale of Augury. This was all too easy, Mortred thought as she erased the name Slyrak off mentally. They fought bravely and admirably, but even they were no match for the phantom assassin. The dragon will rest within Davion's armor for eternity, Mortred chuckled.\n\nBy the river, Mortred sat and clutched her gloomblade to her chest like a talisman. She looked up towards the starry sky and meditated. A new name appeared, etched furiously in her mind. \"I shall honor him\", Mortred murmured as she bowed towards the Veiled Oracle.\n\nMortred climbed the mountains effortlessly. Her next target in sight, an ancient titanic being by the name Rooftrellen. Mortred loved the woods, but not this one. Even as she moved under the Veil, she could not shake off the feeling that someone or *something* was watching her. \n\nMortred spent weeks searching high and low in the woods to no avail. She sat down and began meditating. She was certain the Veil would show her the divine path but there was no response. \n\n\"Where is that wretched being,\" she shouted in frustration as she fell to her knees beside a giant tree.  \n\n\"Have I failed the Veil?\" she exclaimed. As she looked around her surroundings, something caught her eyes - a carving on the tree beside her. \n\n\"Riki?\" She stared in confusion. The name rang a bell but she could not remember where she had heard it before. She tried to grasp on to any memories of it but...they just fade away.\n\nBefore she could act, she was entangled in an overgrowth of vines and branches. She felt it wrapping around her, every inch of her body held in bondage. \n\nThe giant tree uproot itself and turned around, looking down at Mortred with those big green eyes. Mortred was certain death was approaching but she wasn't afraid. \"I will embrace it,\" she whispered. But the tree simply stood there and stared at her. \n\nEventually Mortred yelled “What do you want!\" \n\nAnd the tree bent down and said “I need about tree fiddy.”", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416566563", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "A little late to the party but from what I understood from when visiting nofap on my old account it started off as something simple and turner into the movement we see today.  Basically it started to help people who were addicted to porn and/or masturbation.  Basically they wanted to stop jacking it all the time.  Now apparently to much masturbation can apparently cause some problems.  One being sexual exhaustion.  Basically you've jacked off so much your dick needs a break and doesn't want to get erect.  Others claim it lowers your sensitivity which makes sex less enjoyable.  Basically it started out as people trying to quit an addiction and others trying to see if they could control themselves.  A noble cause in my opinion.  \n\nNow what went wrong is it became a movement.  Think of some these diet fads like Paleo.  I'm going to use that one as an example. If you don't know what that that is basically someone on the diet eats like a human from the Paleolithic era so no more grains, legumes, dairy, and processed sugars.  They believe that modern humans have not yet evolved to process these things and they cause diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and other ailments.  Except they're pretty much wrong on all of that so that's the last I'll touch on that.  \n\nSo since nofap has become this movement the so called benefits soon followed.  It's been awhile so I don't really remember them off the top of my head.  The problem is is that masturbation in moderation, like a few times a week, is actually healthy and has other benefits as well.

(doors were lock an hour ago) but as I walk past the doors I hear tapping. normally someone would come back for their phone something but when I opened the door there was no one out there. so I go back to closing but that tapping comes again. still no one out there. so wanting to get out of their I check the restrooms. perfectly fine. but when I get done there is someone standing right in the lobby, this is impossible because all the doors are lock, I checked all the theaters and bathrooms so he must have been hiding in the utility closet?\n\n\"shit he must be trying to rob us or something and was waiting for me to leave\"\n\nso knowing I would be blamed for what ever he took I had to at least try and stop him.

{"body": "&gt;Online dating is throwing your dick AND MAYBE your heart at a wall and hoping something sticks. Repeatedly. The reason those guys aren't forming two well formed sentences referencing your profile is because it's really not worth the effort. If you don't believe me, ask that one male friend of yours that can't get a date if you could create and OKCupid account for him. Bet him about tree fiddy that you can find him a date by the end of the week.\n\nYup. This references my experience well. For the first two dozen or so girls that seem interesting/compatible enough to message you really plumb your brain for interesting shit to write in your message. And if you're really really lucky one in ten of those girls will message you back at some point and one in twenty will continue to message you beyond the first couple of exchanges.\n\nBy the fiftieth girl (and still no date) you're just like, fuck it. Why should I read your ten paragraph long profile and spend twenty minutes thinking of something witty and eye-catching to comment about it, just so I can get \"lol\" in return.\n\nBy then you've given up on messaging the girls who seem genuinely compatible with you because you've already sent at least two \"first contacts\" to each and every one of them. So at this point you're trolling for anyone who doesn't look immediately unattractive and/or crazy and you're so far down in the browse section trying to find a girl you haven't already messaged that you're down to the \"last active 3 months ago\" girls. Actually, fuck it, you'll take crazy by this point.\n\nSo your messages by now pretty much boil down to \"fuck it, I'm tapped out of creative juice, holla girl.\"\n\nOnline dating is harder than just striking up a conversation with a rando woman on the street.

{"body": "In high school, I worked in a grocery store right on the edge of the sketchy part of town. Lots of weirdos came in right before closing.\n\nOne night, this guy walks in. He doesn't speak to anyone. He doesn't buy anything. He didn't even pick anything up off the shelves. He just walked up and down the aisles with his hand in front of his face, flexing his fingers. He'd look at his palm for a while, flexing on fingers, then he'd turn his hand around and look at the back of it, flexing away. He was clearly tripping balls. Did that for a solid half hour.\n\nThen he just walked out of the store. I was pretty sheltered, so I was kinda freaked out.\n\nAnother time, I was working the express lane. The way the registers were set up, the opening was behind you, with a partition to your right, the counter where the customer set their items to your left, and the register in front of you.\n\nSo I'm standing in a three sided box facing the open side, and this skeevy looking guy walks up and gets right up close to me. Like, six inches from my face. But I'm trapped in the register. He stands there for a few seconds, then says \"Ya look like somebody.\"\n\nI replied \"I do?\"\n\nBut he just stands there, right near my face. Seemed like a loooong time.\n\nBut chipper, customer service oriented me thinks \"Maybe I misunderstood him\", so I say \"Excuse me?\"\n\nThis seems to kickstart a few brain cells, and he repeats \"Ya look like somebody.\" Then he adds \"Some guy I knew.\"\n\nI replied \"Oh really?\"\n\nThen again, loooong silence with him standing 6\" away.\n\nMy help the customer instincts kick in again, and once more, I say \"Excuse me?\" I'm desperately trying to get this creepy conversation to end or get him to leave me alone.\n\nFinally, he says \"Ya look like a guy. A guy who got killed.\"\n\nCrap. Now I'm thinking I'm gonna die. Where the @$!# is my manager! I'm just a 17 year old recently promoted bag boy! I'm too young to die! I just got my motorcycle!

{"body": "&gt; Online dating is throwing your dick AND MAYBE your heart at a wall and hoping something sticks. Repeatedly. The reason those guys aren't forming two well formed sentences referencing your profile is because it's really not worth the effort. If you don't believe me, ask that one male friend of yours that can't get a date if you could create and OKCupid account for him. Bet him about tree fiddy that you can find him a date by the end of the week.\n\nThis was damn close to what happened to me. I had to stick with eHarmony for a month until I met my wife. I sent out about 15 messages to women I thought I'd have a chance with, nobody replied.  It wasn't until my current wife sent me a message and we began to date that I ever thought it would work. It just sucks for guys because i'm sure that most women on those sites literally have their pick of the litter, and they'd want the best looking/richest/stable men. The only thing I had going for me at the time was a one bedroom apartment and a steady job. \n\nMy advice to any guy looking to date:\n\n*  Don't put that woman on a pedestal. I've done this and had a relationship ruined because of it. It was the hardest thing for me to overcome, especially since it was hard for me at the time to get a date. \n\n*  Be yourself. I know this sounds cliche, but if you're not yourself and she likes the lie you've created then you've set yourself up for failure when she finds out who you really are.\n\n*  Don't cling. Nobody likes a clinger. People are their own person and constantly being with somebody can get old and annoying really fast. Share your time with each other, but don't dominate it.\n\n*  Go into it with the mentality of \"I want to know you.\"  Unfortunately for some of us, this means conversation.

{"body": "\"You know, when you mentioned something about the earth being a sleeping beauty five years ago at Harvard University, I would never have guessed it would land us here today.\" \n\nI glanced up. A lanky man dressed in a checkered shirt and black trousers met my gaze. His layered skins spoke of about 40 years of experience and yet his eyes gleamed with the wonder of a ten year old boy. A pair of silvery spectacles hung loosely off the beak of his nose. \n\nI smiled. \n\n\"Its an honor to meet you, Mr Baker.\" I stuck out my hand, which was warmly received in his grip. \n\n\"Please, call me James. I suppose you understand the critical endeavors of our research on the earth's sustainability that has called you to us today?\" \n\nI nodded. Apart from the obvious-sharp rises in the natural phenomenons and hazards-which has been disclosed to the general public, we still had a lot more on our hands. What we didn't tell them was how the trajectories linked. \n\nIt wasn't a pretty answer. \n\nThe first major lead had been the Boop Signal. Nothing more than some mysterious radio signal that had been shrugged off over the years of mindless research. I had made the naive assumption that it had no connection to this global case at all - that was, until they proved the sounds hadn't been emitted from the depths of the sea at all. The answer was much more exciting. Beyond the layers of the outer core sat an undiscovered layer composed of flesh that possessed suspiciously similar cells to that of a living being, or more specifically, a mammal. That was where the booming noise came from. No deep sea Cthulu, no giant kraken, no loch ness monster - it was from our own planet's core. \n\nNeedless to say, I found myself hunched over paperwork and contacts I needed desperately to make. My faculty was immersed in a giant shit storm that we had willingly stepped into and we were adamant on making progress after a complete halt the last time. \n\nNext was the concept of earthquakes that found itself refounded recently. We were right about the seismic waves and different extensional layers and crusts crushed between each other. We were wrong about that being the only answer. We got the first news after a 9.8 struck the coastal area of Indonesia and in the process, witnesses everywhere swore they heard a loud booming noise, akin to a roar, except this one burst a few eardrums along the way. \n\nWe wouldn't have believed it. Not until the same accounts popped up along with a string of similar cases that transpired in rapid bursts. It was all too quick and the people wanted answers. It wasn't with earthquakes either. There were volcanoes as well, all emitting the same distinctive noise that no one could associate with. Theories pointed towards a seismic interference along the epicentre of the areas of damage but they were quickly shot down after these sounds began happening at random intervals. \n\nAnd then the real hazards stirred. This was where I came in - officially. \nEvery living being beyond a microscopic scale possesses an immunity response. It can come in instinct, and microbiological wise, and what nots. The primal example is our immune system. Turns out, when you give something a long enough time, it starts developing it, even when its not self-aware. Sightings of insects shot up - the funny thing was, these \"insects\" were the size of stadiums. These creatures were earth's defense system. Giant parasites. This was especially the case in North America, where the northern regions had to oversee mass migrations after the insects begin to breed there. \n\nA nuclear assault is on its way. \n\n\"So. Any bright ideas?\" His ears perked intently and I almost felt sorry that I had no good answer in mind. \n\n\"We're at a very critical stage. We need to observe carefully - while ensuring a minimal loss of lives. This can be considered some sort of Renaissance, if you think abstractly enough.\"\n\nHe chuckled. \n\n\"I regret not telling you sooner, but the waves have became more ... vigorous.\" \n\n\"The seismic activity-\"\n\n\"Nothing to do with that, actually. Its almost surreal to say it, but we have linked it to signs of ... premature activity.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"Life.\" \n\nI was an open-minded man. I saw a lot happen - and I was ready to accept almost anything. Almost. James saw that fading enthusiasm on my face.\n\n\"I know. You doubt the validity of our conclusion.\" \n\n\"Perhaps you need to run more tests.\"\n\n\"It isn't about running tests. We associated this with external patterns. For instance, the moon-\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Please. We observed the very same activity originate from there, and if you wait till night and took a look up there, you'd see a slit running across its observable surface. From here.\"\n\n\"This...this-\"\n\n\"This means there's something beyond our comprehensible theories at play here. I called you here because we need to defy all possible concepts we have laid out and start afresh. Because this isn't about Earth alone.\"\n\nMy breath hitched. \n\nIt was like a slap across my face. It all came together. It all linked. The weather phenomenons. The sinking of Japan. The exploration project I held 3 months ago, at the Antarctic. When the sudden hole opened up swallowing nearly 98% of the entire region. When we were befuddled by how it was a hole, yet it wasn't. When the depth of field just didn't match. When the colossal \"island\" in the center began to shift. \n\nIt wasn't a hole. \n\n\"The Voguethers Exploration I held-\" \n\n\"Yes, I'm glad to see you're coming to your senses.\" James smiled bleakly. \"That would be its eye. Now we assume Earth has more than one eye. And a mouth. A nose. A system.\"\n\n\"Holy shit.\"\n\n\"Yes. We need to find answers urgently.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416645133", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Food questions (Priorities!)\n\n•Favorite baked goods? Are home made baked goods OK?: *I wouldn’t go so far as to say I’m on a diet, but I’ve been trying to not go crazy because I’m getting married and want to look good in my dress.  So I’d say quality over quantity.  I love toffee/caramel, orange flavored things, peanut butter flavors, sugar cookies or with festive icing decoration.  I also enjoy gingerbread and snickerdoodle as long as they’re on the sweet side rather than spicy. I’m on board with homemade goods* \n\n•Favorite other snacks/treat things? Sweet or savory?: *I LOVE popcorn.  I also tend to go towards savory, but enjoy sweet as well* \n\n•Coffee, Tea, Hot Chocolate, or all of the above? What kind of flavors do you like? *I prefer tea.  I make tea every morning, it’s like my special thing to make my commute bearable, that I drink while I drive to work.   So a festive tea would be awesome.  I drink mostly black with some added flavor, and again I prefer sweet over spicy.* \n\n•Do you have furbabies, human babies, or SOs? What kinds of things do they like?: *I live with my fiancé, who LOVES cookies.  Like I got him cookie of the month club for his bday one year haha.* \n\n•I know this was asked on the sign-ups, but I'm asking again: Any allergies? Or any flavors that you just can't stand? *Really flowery things bother my allergies, I’m really bad at spicy, and I really don’t like pepper.* \n\nPolishes:\n\n•Favorite mainstream polish brands? *I've been so into indie's lately that I haven't been paying much attention to the mainstream brands, honestly, as I've got most of the basic colors pretty covered.  In general, I like Zoya and China Glaze*\n\n•Favorite indie brands? *Such a hard question!  I'd say Kpt polish, A England, Serum No 5*\n\n•Brands that you're dying to try? *I'm always open to try new brands, but I tend to go more for the specific polish rather than the brand.*\n\n•Any lemmings? *KBShimmer Let’s Sleigh Together, Holly Back Girl, Xmas vinyl sheet, or Different Dimension's Ready Set Snow\n\n•Colors &amp; types of polish that you dislike? *I really hate pink, and I don't really like glitter toppers.  I tend to be into the more subtle polishes so that I can wear them at work*\n\n•Colors &amp; types of polish that you love? *I LOVE thermals.  Like I said, I like polishes that are a bit understated so I can wear them at work.  Think scattered holos, sparse glitter crellies, glow in the dark.  I LOVE greys, and also blues/some purples, and sometimes red.*\n\nOther things\n\n•If you said that you celebrate a holiday, how into that holiday are you? For example, if you said you celebrate Christmas, do you love ALL THE CHRISTMAS THINGS!!! or are you lucky if you put up a tree? *I freaking LOVE Christmas.  Like a lot.  Like, my fiancé had to make a rule that we can’t set up our tree until after Halloween.  I love the warmth, how everyone is nice to each other, the lights, being cozy, spending time with family, shopping for presents.  I don’t think I’ve ever met someone who likes Christmas more than me.  Not that it’s a contest, just trying to give some perspective haha.*\n\n•Do you collect anything other than polish? *Not that I could think of.  I just asked my fiancé and he said “you collect great pleasure from Christmas” so there’s that hahaha.  I guess I would say succulents and planters, or jigsaw puzzles, as I really like both and buy them obsessively* \n\n•What are your hobbies? Can you use anything for them? *Photography but anything I’d need there is crazy expensive, but I really enjoy doing jigsaw puzzles!  Especially in the landscape direction (because of the table I do them on)* \n\n•Are there any warm things you're in need of, or that you can never have enough of? Hats, scarves, (fingerless) gloves, socks, etc.? *I LOVE big cozy blankets, and I’m desperately trying to increase my sweater collection because I’m always cold at work. I’ve been getting into wearing scarves more, and you can never have too many socks.  But pretty much anything cozy you can think of, I’d love.* \n\n•Do you have any fiber preferences for clothing items? Do you react to wool (soft wool exists, I promise!), or can you not stand acrylic hats? *Nothing comes to mind, although the softer/warmer, the better!*\n\n•What's the weather like in your area? *It sadly doesn’t snow here, and the coldest it gets is down in the low 30’s at night on the coldest winter days.  Most days are in the high 40’s – 50’s.  That said, I still tend to be cold haha* \n\n•What's the temperature like at your workplace/school/house/etc.? Are you always cold there? *We keep our house fairly cool because I like to cuddle under blankets to sleep.  I work in a lab, which also tends to be fairly cool.  I wear light jackets inside a lot, because I don’t own a lot of sweaters to be warm without them.* \n\n•Do you like to read? What genre/authors/series/etc. do you like? *For being cozy, I am a bit embarrassed to admit I love historical romance novels even though I go through them so quickly haha.  I’ve been dying to get my hands on Stephanie Lauren’s By Winter’s Light and The Tempting of Thomas Carrick* \n\n•What else would make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside? *I’m going to copy lochnessie15’s answer, and say an active stalker, knowing there was a lot of thought put into things :)*\n\n•Anything else that you'd like your stalker to know?

{"body": "Well here's my story for Street Fighter:\n\nWhen I was in love with my now wife of 7 years me and her father didn't exactly get along very well.\n\nHe was Mormon.  I was Atheist.  He was Pro life.  I was pro choice.  He liked Battlefield.  I liked Call of Duty.  (OK, not that last one)  and etc.\n\nBut anyways,  me and his daughter had been together for 3 years when I finally decided that I wanted to marry her.  I knew that her father might reject me, but I had to try anyways.  Besides, I wasn't asking if I could marry his daughter, I was going to do that anyways, I was asking if he wanted to be a part of our family.\n\nI came over to his house unannounced and awkwardly brought it up after a short conversation about something, I don't remember what.  Of course, I was rejected.  After that I was sent out of his house and asked to never go near his daughter again because he didn't like me.\n\nI was more heartbroken than I thought I'd be.  I expected his answer, but didn't fully realize how much it would affect me.\n\nA few days went by with me mourning, I'd already bought a ring and was going to propose and then tell her what her father thought of me proposing.  I was worried she'd get upset and decide that her father was more important than me so I was extremely nervous beforehand.  \n\nI planned to take her on a date skiing and then propose to her at the top of the ski lift, where there was a beautiful view of the valley we lived in.  \n\nI went to her house to pick her up, praying that her father wasn't home at the moment.  I walked up to the door, knocked, and unfortunately... her father opened the door.\n\n\"Umm, hi, sir.  Is (name) here?  We were going to go on a date.\"\n\nHe sternly looked at me, his facial expression didn't change for a few seconds (which felt like several minutes...).  Then he said, \"Yeah, she's here.  I need to talk to you though.\"\n\nGreat.  What's he going to say?\n\nI'm invited into their house and saw his daughter sitting on a chair putting make up on.  She looked at me, smiled, and I told her to wait out in the car for a moment because her father wanted to talk to me.  \n\nHer facial expression went from smiling and happy to, \"Oh, shit.  What happened?\"\n\nShe agreed and went outside to my car.\n\nWhen her father saw she was in the car, he looked at me and said, \"I've been thinking about what you asked me awhile back.  About.. marrying her.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  I really love your daughter and I'd like to marry her.\"\n\nI was surprised because I expected him to be angry about me arriving at his house. But he seemed... sad, instead.\n\nHe looked at me and replied, \"I know you do.  I'm sorry I turned you down.  I know we may not get along at all, but you're still a pretty good guy.  You have my permission to ask my daughter to marry you.\"\n\nWow.  I was relieved.  I was not expecting this at all when he invited me in.  \"Umm, thanks sir!  You don't know how happy I am to hear that.. I'm going to go on that date with her now. Thanks again!\" I said, then I started to walk out the door.\n\nAs I was about to open the door he said, \"Wait, stop.\"  I was nervous... I thought he had changed his mind, I turned around and looked at him.  He said, \"I need one more thing...\"\n\n\"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\n\"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized that my girlfriend's father was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had gotten me again!  \"Goddamnit monster I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I screamed.\n\nI haven't really seen him since.\n\nTL;DR: Rejected by father, then he changes his mind.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416700225", "subreddit": "playitforward", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I walked into the theater not really expecting to see anything good. Of course, since I was with family, I had to sit through a movie anyways. I decided that we should see something a little family oriented so I wouldn't have to listen to my little brother screaming down the aisle every ten minutes. Ella Enchanted had been playing for a few weeks so I thought to myself \"Why not?\" and booked 5 tickets for the whole family. \n\nAs the movie started, I quickly became engrossed in the incredible plot of the movie. Before long, I realized that I was sitting on the edge of my seat nearly crying my eyes out at the plight of Anne Hathaway's poor character. During the finale scene, I even found myself speaking to her, rejoicing in her newfound love. \n\nAll of the sudden, I noticed that Ella was speaking back to me. She was responding to the very words I was saying. I asked her:\n\n\"Ella, can you hear this?\"\n\n\"Of course I can, you've been speaking to me this whole time.\"\n\nI looked around but no one, not even my family noticed that anything was wrong.\n\n\"Ella,\" I asked \"Why can't anyone else hear you?\"\n\n\"Because I only need to talk to you. I need your help.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, \"whatever I can do, I'll do it.\"\n\nShe smiled a sort of twisted smile, almost inhuman and turned away from the camera. She began to laugh maniacally, starting from a low chuckle to an uproarious cackle that sent a chill down my spine. Her slender figure began to become obscured by smoke. Her dress began to dissolve off of her skin, and her body began to change. Her skin began to become black, almost like it was being burned. However, instead of becoming dry and brittle, her body became slick and shiny. Pustules formed on her back, rupturing her skin and already destroyed dress, but seemed to add to her mass. Her hair crumbled as she doubled, tripled in size, revealing a bald, elongated skull with razor-like teeth. Her dark pupils dilated until the entirety of her scleras were blackened. Smoke poured out of her monstrous nostrils and began to pool below her as her neck became impossibly long. Her limbs changed, flattening, and becoming huge, winglike, but muscular and disgusting. Her belly bloated outwards until she no longer resembled anything human at all.\n\n\"What the hell is this?!\" I exclaimed.\n\nShe turned to me and flared her disturbingly white teeth and said:\n\n\"I'mma need about tree fiddy.\"\n\n\"Godamnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy. You ain't tricking me again.\"\n\nCrestfallen, Nessy Enchanted slumped away out of the movie screen, slinking out the exit door and dissolving away into the night. \n\nI looked back to the screen and the movie was resuming as normal, the narrator stating a simple \"The End\". A tear fell from my eye.\n\nTL;DR-I was  surprised with Ella Enchanted, but disappointed a little by the end. 3.5/10 would watch again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416718614", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, not even fucking joking, I have something like this and I don't know what to do. I was in the military and my last deployment was south america. I started getting sick on the way back, constant stomach problems that led to weight loss and not having ANY energy, to the point where I couldn't do my job anymore which led to me getting a general discharge. They never found out what was wrong, but honestly they never really tried.\n\nFast forward six months and I have stabbing stomach pains coming from the inside out that led to a worm crawling to the surface, about an inch below my ribs. It looked like a blood vessel was wiggling around under my skin, I showed my sister and she agreed it had to be a parasite, so we looked up a bunch of stuff online and found something I could get over the counter at walgreens that was supposed to treat them (pinworm medication). I thought that worked as my stomach problems went away immediately, but a few weeks later I went to the emergency room because I was coughing them up, literally coughing up bits of phlegm that would catch the back of my throat and I could feel things crawling into the soft tissue back there. The ER gave me some medicine called abendazole just based on my description of things, I thought that worked too but it wasn't more than a few days after I ran out that they started moving again like I never even took it.\n\nI found out I had free healthcare from the VA and started going to them. The first doctor was literally incompetent, he looked at one under a microscope and declared it was nothing that could ever infect a human and I had nothing to worry about. I took one to a veterinarian and they said it was a tapeworm. I kept telling him everything that was going on as it progressed, and eventually he just stopped returning my phone calls. I asked for a new doctor and got one, and I have been playing musical doctors since, I think I am up to number 5 or 6 now. I never requested a new one past the first, so they either left or requested not to see me anymore or a combination of the two, I don't know. \n\nIt has been getting progressively worse, I have felt them crawl up behind my eyes and have started having black outs. I eventually requested a copy of my medical records when one of the latest new doctors decided to talk to me like I was a slow child, and it turns out I was diagnosed as delusional by the first doctor and the rest have been just humoring me and sticking with the delusional diagnosis, without ever bothering to tell me they thought I was delusional. \n\nSo yea, I'm at a loss. About halfway through all this I contacted the head office of the VA, that got them to pay attention again, but they sent me to a psychiatrist who prescribed me some medication and told me \"this will help\". I looked it up online and found out it was hardcore antipsychotics. I thought one flew over the cookoos nest was a work of fiction not a documentary, but apparently denial of mental illness is taken as proof of mental illness.\n\nI think the only reason I am still alive is that I smoked sometimes, I eventually noticed that it got much worse when I stopped so I have been smoking like my life depends on it, it almost completely keeps them in check but they start moving again anytime I stop for more than a few days. I wish I could end this with a tree fiddy, but I'm serious as a fucking heart attack and I can prove everything I have just said, from medical records to pictures of the worms I brought them to medication they gave me. \n\nI have an appointment tomorrow, and I still have no idea how to convince them I am not delusional, every time I have tried to stop smoking and let them get worse to try to prove it to the doctors (by the doctors suggestion), they still dismissed me as delusional apparently. One doctor literally took the jar I had a one of the worms in, looked through the side of it and said yea I see something in there, and handed it back to me. Didn't even open it, I was so stunned I just didn't know what to say. I don't think I can do it again, they are suggesting I stop again and let them run wild again (I think every doctor so far has said that), but I can feel a mild pain an inch or so above my left eye all the time now that gets worse the longer I stop.\n\nSo as I said, I am at a fucking loss. I still have no idea what kind of parasite it could be besides a veterinarian said it was a tapeworm and I got it from south america. One thing that stood out to me in this article was \"episodes of altered smell\", yea when they are crawling around your sinuses they smell foreign, don't know how to describe it but slightly musky/slimy, like how I would imagine a tadpole smells. \n\nSo hell, AMA? Anyone want to see pictures of worms in a jar? I have nothing to lose at this point.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416751335", "subreddit": "science", "score": 39, "controversiality": 0}

(She's written as an Algonquin-speaking character in a constructed world similar to Earth but where North American civilisation is still in the hands of indigenous peoples rather than in those of Europeans.) Basically, she's the closest I've ever written to a princess - I write about nobility, but not fairy-tale or mediaevalist style, more a steampunk warts-and-all where characters from the middle and working classes are gaining more prominence. I prefer to write *grande-dames*, matriarchs, or those that aspire to be so, and when I do write about young women, they're a little bit more cynical and streetwise than your average princess. Chepi fits that, but her high-status but low-authority position on the ship is close to that of a princess, so I do edge onto that sort of territory.\n\nI can't put my finger on why, exactly, but thinking laterally for the moment, despite being partly based on d'Artagnan, the main male series protagonist, Michal Piech, strikes me as filling the role of a princess rather than a prince.

And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness. It was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward. So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan. My contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, Mike, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\" Sensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\" Everyone in the hall heard. The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment. I stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest. Suddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\" Wat. I got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying. A few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us. The friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all. At this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered. I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall. \"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her. Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\" This sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her. She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand. Without warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\" We walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\" I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl. We got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great. Suddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear. This is great. It slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time. After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life. We're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\" I personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time. Then she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\" The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\" She says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again. I stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance. As for my psychology project, I never did get it done, and instead dropped the class because of the terrible memories it had given me. \n\nTo this day I hate reading about Psychology in general.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416863975", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;I was 14. It was a rainy Sunday morning, and she had asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the park with her and her friend. I had only been on a group date with her, so I was excited about being around her without so many people around.\n\n&gt;When I arrived, the friend wasn't there. She took my hand and we started walking. It was still raining lightly. The rain got heavier as we walked, until the point where we decided it was too wet to keep walking. We found ourselves at the rotunda, in the middle of the park.\nUsually, the park was full of people, but thanks to the weather, it was totally empty. Keep in mind here that I was a 14 year old boy, far too polite and scared to kiss her myself. I was beginning to shiver because of the nervousness. She noticed. I said I was just cold.\nShe put her arms around me.\n\n&gt;We decided since the rain had cleared up, we'd keep walking. As we stood up, I got a text saying that I was going to be picked up by my parents in 10 minutes. At this point, we both knew what was going to happen. We both began walking more slowly, until we were completely stopped in the middle of the footpath. She looked at me and brushed her hair to the side. She looked at me and said sweetly and softly, \"if you were planning on kissing me... I'm gonna need 'bout tree fiddy.\"  It was that point that I noticed she was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.\n\nGotta do the whole thing bro.

I'm sorry; I'm not very eloquent, and I don't have the best grasp on English grammar sometimes..\n\nI'm not sure if this story is really all that interesting or not, but it is entirely true, and I swear to God it doesn't involve the Loch Ness monster and it doesn't end it song lyrics.\n\nA few years ago I fell in love. Of course, at first I thought that this was the same as any other fleeting crush, I have had many throughout my life. The thing is, this didn't go away after a week. She was beautiful, smart and intelligent, and I sat next to her in Spanish Class. Now really this wasn't the most special thing, I often fall in and out of love, and I'm too awkward to make a move, and I have plenty of other stories, but this one is the only one that I remember and it stings.\n\nlike I said, she sat next to me in Spanish class, which was, by its nature a conversational class. We spent half the class talking and we would talk about family members, and our lives and so on. It went on all year. After a few months, I tried to build up courage to ask her out, but I never could. \n\nI fixated on her to an unhealthy degree at times, it was, of course, doomed to failure. I dreamt of asking her on a date, but the year came and went, and I never had enough courage. I think she knew too.\n\nThat summer I tried to forget about her, but I couldn't. I resolved that I would ask her out next year as soon as I saw her again.\n\nIt was the beginning of the next year. She was in none of my classes. I could never find her in the halls, I was getting desperate. \n\nEventually I did the only thing I could do. I E-mailed her, on her school E-mail. I asked her if she wanted to go to the homecoming game with me, and then maybe meet up at the dance the next day. She didn't respond to the E-mail. I felt like an idiot, I felt devastated.\n\nOn Wednesday before the homecoming game, we ran into each other, she excused herself from her group of friends and we caught up. My heart was pounding as she agreed to meet me at the game. We exchanged phone numbers and parted. I was euphoric, I had done it, I had finally asked her out.\n\nFriday night I'm waiting at the game for her to arrive. She said she'd meet me a half-hour before it started, and the game had just started. I waited with a friend. We went in to see if I had missed her. I hadn't, she wasn't there.\n\nI watched the game for about twenty minutes, and my friend poked me, and pointed to the entry. There she was, walking in with a friend.\n\nI walked over to speak with her, and she didn't listen to a thing I said. She left after five minutes.\n\nI slunk to the back of the stadium with my friends. Our team lost the game, but I didn't care. I wasn't really watching the game. More than anything, I felt disappointed.\n\nI went and spent the night at a friend's house that night, and people were surprised I showed up. I told them. We spent much of the time trying to cheer me up. I went to sleep early while everyone played Soulcaliber V. I usually love Soulcaliber V.\n\nI didn't go to the Homecoming Dance, I sulked at home and stayed in bed.\n\nA week later, she walked up to me while I was standing in line for lunch. I weakly made a joke about her only wanting to talk to me because I was near the front of the lunch line. She apologized for the night. According to her she was \"under the influence of multiple substances\". I didn't ask her what. I don't care what it was. \n\nShe said maybe we could go out for coffee sometime soon, and I said that would be nice, and there were no hard feelings. I wasn't mad at her. I was just disappointed that this had happened.\n\nWe never went out for coffee or anything, when I talked with her again... weeks later, nothing had happened. She was just another student now.\n\nIt's been over a year, and I've been unable to have any luck with romantic relationships afterwards. Later, I would become... basically the gay friend to a girl I wanted to ask out... without being gay. 2 different best friends of mine dated two different girls I was about to ask out, and all this served to make me very meek. \n\nAnd of course, there was other stuff going on to my life  that led to me relapsing in to depression for the third time, so I haven't had a lucky love life yet. But, I'm not going to give up quite yet. Who knows what the future has in store for me, eh?\n\nEDIT: Some words", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416888020", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've been waiting for a chance to post my experience on Reddit. This is honestly something I'll never forget. So I live in Anaheim, CA in the US. So about 20-30 minutes away from here there is a canyon called, Black Star Canyon. It is an Indian Reserve filled with many haunted stories. It is said that during the night Indian spirits haunt anyone trying to trespass the land. During the day it is a lovely hiking trail used by many of the locals. During the night, all hell breaks lose. Many sightings have been reported about a tall, humanoid figure. With fur all over it. It stands about 9 ft tall and has red piercing eyes. Now with other spirits \"supposedly\" roaming the lands my friends and I were interested in the furry spirit. So one night we go to Black Star Canyon around 3AM, we go deep into the canyon but can't find anything. Much to our disappointment we go back into our cars and go home. Next night we are playing cards against humanity at my friends house. One of my friends calls out my gf for humming while we are playing cuz he thought it was coming from the fireplace. She claims that she wasnt humming. He doesnt believe her and we continue playing. Then I heard the humming too, it was a woman humming so I call out my gf and she says she is not humming. She keeps her mouth open and my 2 friends and I are scared because the humming is definitely coming from the fireplace. We get up and move to the living room to get our minds of the fact that a potential ghost could be in the house. We start to watch Iron Man on my friends Xbox one in the living room. The time is around 2Am and everyone is asleep in the house except for us 4 watching the movie. We hear the bathroom door creak a bit and we all look down the dark hallway. All of a sudden something slams it completely shut and shakes the living room. We are scared shitless due to the fact that all windows are closed so it can't be the wind and no one else is awake. To make matters worse Iron Man stops playing and a Cartoon Network show called Chowder starts to play. It goes to a scene where some character says \"Oh Snap!\" and it keeps repeating over and over again. We are terrified at what is happening here. Then all of a sudden a message pops up on the screen. \"Hard Drive has been disconnected\". We realized that some paranormal force is messing with us, we are all petrified and wanted it to stop. Then all of a sudden, a figure down the hall appears. It walks close to us and stares immensely into our eyes. It was a young boy in a white dress, he looked as if he was immersed in a body of water because he was drenched in water. Then he says, \"you must pay\" \"PAY FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE\". My friend asks it what do you want, pay what? and what the he said next will forever say burnt into my brain. he mumbles at first, not knowing what he says but he keeps repeating it, it sounds as if he mentions a price or something, \"$3.50\"...then it became clear, he continues to yell and yell until I know exactly what he said, \"Tree Fiddy\". Never in my life have I felt so sick to my stomach. My gf falls to the floor and starts to weep, one of my friends throws up everywhere in his house and I pass out. I wake up the next day not knowing what happened to the ghost but I know for a fact, Im never going to play Uno again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416890087", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I diced the meat and microwaved it in a pie plate to keep the juices. Then I nuked some frozen carrots and peas for a few minutes. Finally, I tossed the veggies with the meat in the pie pan with some celery salt and fresh ground pepper to bring the ingredients together a bit more, slathered on a thick layer of mashed potatoes, and topped with shredded cheese before putting it into the oven at tree fitty for about 20 min. My 16 yr old son was like, \"Wow,\" which means he was really into it. I had to add a touch of ketchup to really bring it over the border, but it was good!

I suggest still going out to eat once in a while and trying to recreate your experience at home. \n\nSingle portion ideas, since you asked- tentative recipes can be provided, just ask :) \n\nSteak/baked potato w/ ALL the fixins'  \n\nBlack bean bowl - just heat up a can of black beans with a good amount of cumin. Top w/ sour cream, cilantro, pickled jalapeños, cheese, whole or crushed tortilla chips\n\nGrilled cheese egg-in-a-hole, fancy omelets, etc.  \n\nTurkey sausage dogs with salad (croutons, veggies, Balsamic vinaigrette)  \n\nFrozen ravioli/tortellini w/ whatever sauce  \n\nCrab cakes- $5 for 5 at a lot of grocery seafood sections. You can cook 1 or 2 at a time, freeze the rest. Roast some corn in its husk in the oven, serve with French bread, lemon, salad, etc.  \n\nAny of these sound good? What do you like usually?  \n\n\n\n\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416896425", "subreddit": "EatCheapAndHealthy", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My only imaginary friend came into my life when I was 9 years old. At the time, I was in 3rd grade, and there was this beautiful girl in my class. I'd always try to talk to her and play with her at recess, but she paid little to no attention to me. She stuck with playing on the swing set and balance beams with her girl friends at recess. It really crushed me, I just wanted to be friendly and she shot me down. So I created an imaginary friend who resembled her, and I called her Cara. The difference between Cara and the mean girl in my class was that Cara actually liked me, she enjoyed hanging out with me and we spent our days doing anything we liked. Cara never complained to me or hurt me, and she was always up for going on adventures and explorations in the backyard and around the neighborhood. Several months after I met Cara, I woke up and she was not with me. I got frightened, and frantically searched the house for where she was hiding. I searched for hours around my house, in the nearby woods, and in my neighbors backyards, but she was no where to be found. As I was walking back to my house, head down and on the verge of tears, I hear a familiar voice shout my name excitedly. \"SoberDreams, I found you!\" Cara! It's her, I thought, she didn't leave me after all! Except when I looked up, she had changed. She was a huge creature, a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era. She stood above me, looking down with her big red eyes and said, \"hey, I need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416902552", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Phantoms by Dean Koontz is very similar to the Mountains of Madness, but takes place in a remote tourist town where everyone has disappeared in a single night.  \n\nCeremonies by TED Klein is cosmic horror in Amish country.

{"body": "Ok, this story may ramble a little but because I have never told it before, so I'm warning you about it now. I am not going to give names because it gives away too much personal information.\n\nThere was a girl who went to high school with me. She was a junior when I was a senior and it was always apparent that her family never had much money. Her brother was a couple years older than me, and he was supposedly running a meth lab with her dad in the trailer outside of their house. This is all in rural Indiana, so it never presented much of an issue to neighbors or anything.\n\nThe girl always say by herself at lunch and one day I noticed that she seemed really upset. I got along with almost everybody at my school so I decided to sit down and see if I could help in some way.\n\nIt turns out that the night before, her dad was high and pulled a gun on her and her mom. I was in shock. I didn't really know what to do, so I tried to get her to tell somebody in the guidance office about it so they could help her. She refused, but she did agree to take my number so that she could call me if there was ever another emergency and she needed help.\n\nA few weeks later I got a call at like 3:00 am and I could immediately tell that something was wrong. She was bawling and finally told me that she got kicked out of the vehicle by her brother so he could go to some \"business meeting\" and she asked if I could come get her.\n\nMy parents have always been pretty charitable and understanding, so I told them what was going on and I went to pick her up. We set her up on the couch overnight and I took her to school the next day. My parents made sure that she knew that she was welcome anytime she needed a place to stay.\n\nOver the next couple months she crashed at my place about once or twice a week and we started spending a lot of time together. I learned that she hated her life at home, and I really couldn't blame her. As we got to know each other better, I found that she was nothing like the rest of her family. She was an amazing artist and singer and we talked about her options for art school and such often. I finally realized that I wasn't interested in her because of trying to be charitable like my parents, but because I was in love with her.\n\nI finally told her about how I felt and we started dating. It was by far the best relationship I have ever had. She was now staying with me three or four times a week and was slowly drifting away from her drug-riddled home life. I couldn't be happier. She even started talking to me about applying to the art school at the university I was got accepted to and it seemed like everything was going to work out for us.\n\nThen I got the call. It was the night before a basketball game and the whole team had gone out for pizza for some team bonding. I saw my mom on the caller ID and as soon as I picked up I could hear her crying. She told me that my girlfriend was in the hospital and it wasn't looking good for her. I was panicking. My buddy on the team overheard my mom and told me he would drive me to the hospital so we took off.\n\nI was in the waiting room for what felt like an eternity. Two hours after we got there, the doctor came out and told me that she was going to make it, but it would be a few weeks before she would be strong enough to leave. He did let me in to see her, and she looked terrible. She had gashes on her arms and hands, and gauze covering up what I learned was a 2\" deep stab wound in her abdomen. She rested for a while and finally told me that it was her dad again. He and her brother were testing out a new batch and got violent. She had jumped in front of her mom to protect her and got the worst of it.\n\nI called her phone later that night and her mom answered. She told me that she was scared of something like that happening again and that she wanted her daughter to live with me and my parents permanently. She had a long conversation with my parents that night and they agreed that it would be for the best.\n\nThe day after she came home from the hospital, we took her to her house to get all of her stuff to come and live with me. Her dad was clearly not happy about it, so after we got her packed up and safely into the car, my dad and I went to have a little chat with him.\n\nHe tried explaining to us how it was some all big accident and that he wasn't really responsible for it, it was just a bad batch. We told him that we better never see him around her or our property and then he got angry.\n\nHe starts screaming about how everything she was taking was his and that he had bought it all, he was going to call the police on her for theft. We calmed him down a little and my dad asked him, \"What will it take to make sure you never hurt your daughter again?\"\n\nHe said \"Imma need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nThat's when I noticed that her dad was actually a ten-story tall monster from the Paleolithic era. We gave him the money for the drugs, and we never heard from him again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416970292", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago. Never did I think in a million years this would happen to me.\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty. Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\ntl;dr: Haha..

{"body": "A 720 [has a glide ratio of 19:1 with engines at idle and 15:1 with no power.](http://vintageairphotos.blogspot.ca/2011/10/how-to-wreck-perfectly-good-boeing-720.html) Based on this data we can calculate that a normal 720 at an operating altitude of 30,000 ft could glide 108 statute miles (94 nautical miles, 173 km), or 85 SM (74NM, 137km) at idle &amp; power off, respectively. I should note that turboprops are more efficient around 20-25,000 ft, so I'd hazard a guess that the testbed aircraft would spend most of its time at that altitude. So using 22,500ft, these numbers change to 81SM (70NM, 130km) and 63SM (56NM, 103km). \n\nNow that doesn't directly answer your question of how far could *this aircraft* get with just the turbo prop engine. I tried to get an idea of the idle thrust of a Pratt &amp; Whitney  JT3D engine but couldn't find a decent source. I found [this thread](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=715421) which estimates most engines at idle are around 3.6% of rated thrust.  Most JT3Ds (a common 720 engine) variants are [rated at 18,000 lbf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_JT3D) each, times 4 = 72,000 lbf. 3.6% of this is = 2592lbf.\n\nNow lets see what our turboprop makes in thrust. As has been stated elsewhere in this thread, its incorrect to try and directly compare a turboprops rating of shaft horsepower (unit of work) to a jet's rating of thrust (force). It depends on a couple of factors such as propeller efficiency, However, we all know engines are just used to pull/push an airplane through the air so I figure we can estimate it pretty closely, +/-10%. So [I found this equation](http://forums.jetcareers.com/threads/horsepower-to-thrust-conversion.43771/) to at least help us ball-park it:  Fn (thrust force) = SHP (shaft hp) x375xProp Efficiency / Speed in MPH\n\nI couldn't find 720 speeds, [but here are some 707 speeds](http://www.fspassengers.com/forum/read.php?f=4&amp;i=18391&amp;t=18332) which is a similar aircraft (the 720 was developed from the 707). If we're flying this and its engines are out, we're going to want to be at the aircraft's best glide speed, which is usually around flap extension speed, or 220 kts (253 mph) ([backup for this estimation](http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/1621604/)).  Depending on the variant of this engine, [they make around 2000 SHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_Dash_8). I'm going to assume in an emergency like losing all 4 turbojet engines, we're willing to run the turboprop at full power. We'll assume an 80% prop efficiency. \nFn = 2000x375x.80/253 = 2372 lbf which is pretty darn close to the idle thrust of 4 JT3D engines. Because I'm really in the mood to do some math this morning, we can linearly interpolate this to get a glide ratio of 18.7:1. I'm too lazy to type out my interpolation steps so you can trust me, or try it yourself using 15:1 @0lbf thrust and 19:1 @2592lbf thrust. \n\n~~**Crunching all the numbers from the first paragraph again with a glide ratio of 18.7:1 at 22,500 ft we get a glide distance of about 80 statute miles, 69NM, or 128 km.**~~ \n\n**EDIT: I made a glaring mistake at the beginning, the actual answer is about tree fiddy. Thanks /u/multifuntion1000**\n\nNote: I've made a lot of rough assumptions in nearly every step of this calculation, but I intended it just to be a rough ball park estimate for OP. If I've made any glaring mistakes please let me know. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417025549", "subreddit": "aviation", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Just sightseeing, food, shopping, you know the drill. We were at a museum I can't for the love of my name recall the name of on a sunny - yet cold spring day when i saw someone I thought I recognized examining a statue in the same museum as myself and my family was in, just a few feet away. \n\nI've always considered myself a huge X-Men fan and an even bigger Star Trek fan so seeing this character with my own eyes was *amazing*. After a couple of minutes of gathering the guts to walk up to the guy, I man up and march towards him in a determined manner.\n\nHe was a bit surprised when I tapped him on the shoulder and said\n\n\"Uhhhmm. Mr Stewart? Hi my name is Eric and I'm a huge fan of yours.\"\n\nHe immediately smiled and shook my hand and told me how nice it was to meet a fan. Apparently he could never get enough of it. We talked about different stuff, acting, life advice and such. He was such a nice guy, and incredibly down to earth. Anyhow my family was getting impatient as I had been talking to Mr. Stewart for about 15 minutes when i apologized and told him i had to get going. I waved good bye and told him how nice it was to meet someone i had idolized all these years. Before i left he asked me if I wanted an autograph, and as the fanboy I i gladly obliged. I handed over my backpack (it was all I had on me) and let him write on the fabric.\n\nHe started to grin, looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\"\nConfused, I replied \"Oh, of course, what do you need?\" \nHe didn't answer. His eyes met mine. Confused i look down on the crudely written signature on my backpack, only it wasn't a signature at all, it was a message that read \"I need about three fiddy\" It was around this time i realized that who I talked to for 15 minutes was over 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. \n\nFuriously i yell \"Dammit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" as he hissed at me and squirmed down the nearest drain. \n\n\n\nAn experience i will never forget. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417037760", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I can help there :D\n\n* *H. neanderthalensis*, more commonly known as Neanderthals, were a group of humans that lived in the Eurasian region of Earth during the paleolithic era of *H. sapiens* development. They were physiologically very similar to sapiens humans, though shorter on average and with denser bones, probably stronger, and probably very slightly less intelligent. They were also better adapted for cold climates. They interbred with sapiens humans after their ranges collided, and the result was a primarily sapiens hybrid species. Modern-day humans have varying levels of neanderthalensis DNA depending on place of origin, with Europeans having the highest average level at around 4% Neanderthal. Modern-day African humans never interbred with Neanderthals, and so have no Neanderthal DNA unless they interbred with other races at some point in their ancestry.\n\n* *H. denisova*, more commonly known as Denisovans or Denisovan man, were a species of human common in the Asian region during the paleolithic era. Thus far, only a few finger-bones have ever been found, but these bones indicate significant differences between sapiens and denisova humans. They were probably shorter than either of their cousins, and were restricted to the Asiatic regions. They could be considered \"Asian Neanderthals\" according to some sources. Hypotheses have suggested they could have been noticeably less intelligent than either of their cousins, but this cannot be confirmed since all this is based on is the simple fact that the single specimen found (a female) was probably smaller than a comparable female sapiens or neanderthalensis specimen.\n\nAll three species evolved concurrently, but H. sapiens interbred with and out-competed them, driving the smaller species to extinction. Today, we are the only members of our family group, *Hominidae*, which is actually kinda lonely. We're all alone on our little rock, and our closest living relative goes \"ook\" and swings in trees.

{"body": "When I was ready to face them, I knew that telling them would change the lives of us all. We lived in a trailer park and were dirt poor, we were actually rather stereotypical rednecks living in the middle of nowhere in Tennessee. The thing is, when you have no money, there are very few ways of entertaining yourself. My parents have entertained themselves with religion; they were completely devoted to God and lived by the bible every day. For me, my favorite way of entertaining myself in a low-cost manner was to go to parties and get laid. We didn't have sex-ed back in the day; I just knew that liked the feeling of having sex. I lost my virginity at a party when I was 14. When I was 15, I hooked up with this girl from my class I was very into. We were kind of like fuck buddies at the time, but I slowly developed feelings for her. One day she called me and told me that her period was late. We drove to the city and bought three pregnancy tests, all three have turned out to be positive. She started crying and we spent the rest of the day wandering around the creek of our village. Then, at some point, when we both watched the sun go down, she confessed her feelings for me and said that she wanted to keep it. I was full of joy and felt ready to assume my responsibility as a father; I'd give anything, I'd work any job no matter how much it sucked just so I could provide for my new family. The day after, I decided to confront my parents with it, seeing as I couldn't withhold the information from them forever. I knew that they were Christian and I didn't know how strongly they felt about pre-martial sex, but I decided to go through it. I went up to my parents, who shortly after lowered their heads. My father said \"But son, we... we don't have money for a grandchild yet. We're poor.\" I asked him \"what do you think I should do to make it work? What job should I take? How much money will I need\" My mother had tears in her eyes as she knew that I was dead set on dropping out of high school. My father slowly opened his mouth and whispered: \"You'll need about tree fiddy\". That's when I noticed that my father was a 15 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"God damn it, John!\", my mother screamed at him.

{"body": "Did no one foresee the vehicles messing up?\n\nCars have been out for a while now, long before the new must-have Chevy Camaro. They all share many similarities; 4 wheels, forward and backward, and pretty much the same material and design as the newer cars. Here is the bad news: they mess up.  That's right, do a quick google search (or be that guy and Ask Jeeves) and you can find various articles of people asking \"What's wrong with my car?\" So did no one connect the two dots? I mean, I just found out that my car needs oil. More like \"an oil change\". If you leave it running for a while you can hear it make some noise from the engine. Plus it needs new tires showing the exact same problems that new cars eventually will have.

{"body": "**TL;DR: If anyone here thinks about escaping their life by running away, please don't. The consequences are more tragic than you might imagine.**\n\nThe thing is, this actually happened. When I was 32 years old (keep in mind this was in the mid-90s) I found out that my wife was cheating on me. I probably shouldn't have been snooping around and reading her emails, but I had my suspicions and was glad that I did what I did, so please don't lecture me on that. I wouldn't be the man I am today if I didn't do what I did on that fateful day. I decided to leave everything behind. My job, my friends, my family. I hated every bit of it and suffered from depression for the last few years. The only thing that has held me back from killing myself was the birth of my son James; I just couldn't do that to him. When I found out about my wife cheating, I hired a PI who had confirmed that she had been exchanging emails with her lover for the last few years. They frequently met on one of her \"business trips\". I was devastated, not even knowing whether or not the toddler in that crib in our living room was even mine. In an act of impulse, I have written a note that announced my leave. I kissed my son good bye and left, consequently cutting off all contact with anyone I have known: I was set on starting a new life. I wanted to do something big. Since I am starting to deviate from the question OP has asked, long story short, I have started am IT company in Japan (who would have thought that they treat Electrical Engineers with a degree from the US as Gods?) and have made more money than I can count. The company is listed on the NASDAQ. At some point, my remorse caught up with me. I fell into depression again. I didn't know how I would do it, but I knew that I would have to meet my son and see how he is doing; after having made so much money, you realize of how little importance it is, and that the things that are truly worthwhile can't be bought. I took the first plane to Oregon and went to the house we used to live in. This was in 2009, at the height of the financial crisis. The house was bleak, the walls were falling apart. I couldn't believe that I have kept all my riches to myself. I knocked on the door and a woman who looked very familiar opened it. It was my wife. She had grey hair all and a dead stare on her face. She just looked so... empty. When she recognized me, she started crying. I hugged her in complete disbelief that she wasn't mad at me. I was just excited to be reunited with my family. \"Where... Where is James?\" I asked with a tearful voice. She looked at me for a few seconds and then said something I'll never forget. \"I'm... I'm so sorry, he... when he was 14... He...\" she then started wailing. I couldn't believe it. My world fell apart. I started crying as well. Feelings of despair, anguish and depression have hit me like a roaring train. With a breaking voice and while holding my wife in my arms, I asked \"Is... Is there anything you need?\", seeing as she was clearly falling apart. She opened her mouth and spoke slowly. \"I... I'll need about tree fiddy.\" That's when I realized that my wife was actually a 14 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. \"Damnit loch ness monster, you ain't getting me this time!\" I screamed at it and left.

He was  killed in a garbage disposal related incident himself, which is what makes this particular event all the more tragic. As soon as that gold ring fell down that kitchen sink, I could see my poor Aunt Ruth turn as white as the fresh fallen snow on the mountains of New Guinea. Wanting to be the hero, and save her from the experience of further trauma, I rolled up my sleeveless shirt and reached down that dreaded jagged pipe. With tenacious bravery and perseverance, my fingers made contact with what was either the top edge of her ring, or the treacherous grinders of the disposal, when  suddenly, to my horror and shock, Aunt Ruth shouted out \"I need about tree fiddy.\" At this point I realized my aunt was about 8 stories tall, and a crustacean from the paleolithic era!

{"body": "&gt;How can you tell me, with one hundred percent certainty, that there is no god?\n\nHow can you tell me with even 1% certainty, that there is a God, and that God is actually the one that lines up with any of the **currently popular** theologies, and further what that god is actually willing to do is even remotely in line with what is being promised in the various Holy books that were written, translated and re-edited for centuries?\n\nFurthermore, what's the definition of a \"god\"?  By many yardsticks, the Engineers in the movie Prometheus would be considered gods.  After all, they were responsible for jumpstarting sentient life on Earth.  Maybe something similar happened here and seeded our Earth with more complex life.\n\nThere have been literally tens of thousands of \"gods\" worshipped in humanity's history.  The sheer number of \"gods\" that people have worshipped over time and the variety of their attributes and personalities tailored to their local circumstance is a very strong indicator that \"gods\" are inventions of the people who worship them.  Norse gods look and act nothing like Egyptian gods, or Hindu gods, or Greek gods.  But funnily enough all of those pantheons are similar to their worshipping peoples.  If there was a One True God, wouldn't they be the same the world over?   People believe in the God they believe mainly because they've been brought up to believe it and that's a function of geography.  That's why people who are born in Arlington Texas are Christian and people who are born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia are Muslim, and people who are born in the Punjab region of India are Sikhs.  \n\nAnd speaking of \"the world over\", I read an article a few months ago (can't find it now, but [this is close enough](http://www.thelocal.se/20130711/49004)) that just further illustrates to me the idea that God is a man made invention.  The article talks about the difficulty Muslims have with Ramadan north of the Arctic circle when it coincides with a season where the sun does not set.  The Koran makes no provision for how to participate in Ramadan in a place where the sun doesn't actually set for weeks.  Why is that?  Is it because:\n\n* The omniscient Allah somehow never saw a day where His worshippers would live in such a northern or southern latitude?\n* Allah just doesn't care.\n* The Koran was written by men who had never seen such a land and had no idea that there were places where the sun never rose or set for weeks on end and therefore never thought to include such provisions to cover living there.\n\nMy money's on the third. \n\n&gt;Because if you can't, and I know you cannot, if you can't then there is a nonzero chance that god exists.\n\nThis is BS semantics.  You and I know you can't \"prove\" a negative.  So we also cannot disprove:\n\n* Sasquatch\n* Mermaids\n* Unicorns\n* Unicorns that shit diamonds\n* Santa Claus\n* The tooth fairy\n* Krampus\n* The Easter Bunny\n* Xenu\n* The Loch Ness Monster\n* The Reptilian invasion\n\nBut between you, me and the wall, we all know the above list is nothing but fiction.
