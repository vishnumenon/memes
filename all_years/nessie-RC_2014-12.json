{"body": "There are several \"Slower Traffic Keep Right\" signs posted on the median of the 805, 15 and 5 freeways for the rush hour commute.   So those are left over from the Paleolithic Era and are vestigial traces of laws in the past?  Have you found other states in the nation that follow this?  I haven't.  The CAUSE of the traffic density is the lack of \"left lane passing only\" concept.\n\nThe concept still exists, the law exists, it is just \"common courtesy\" that no longer exists.  It is the \"I am in a hurry, I am going to get in the left lane\" attitude, the same as \"I need a Hummer H2 to drive my 1.3 kids to school\", \"I need to talk on my cell in the grocery store aisles\", \"i can leave my shopping cart in the parking lot\", \"My Facebook update is fine because I am sitting at a light and no cop can see me\", \"I can turn right from the left lane because I don't want to go an extra block when I wasn't paying attention\", \"I am just going to be a minute so the Handicap space is easier for me\", etc. We are a self centered, self absorbed, egotistical state full of entitled assholes that from now on get a ribbon for just participating.

(Including persons, in contexts where personality is not significant).\"\n\nThis is still a definition that denotes a semantic class of things, and not, a collection of syntactic properties (and so while encompassing a lot, it's subject to the difficulties I and others discussed above if we apply it to nouns). While this doesn't mean that some people (including apparently you) don't have a more syntactic meaning of *thing*, since the OED is only a record of usage, it does suggest that your usage is uncommon.\n\nIt's perfectly possible that lots of people get taught this usage of *thing* (although I'd question exactly how common this is), but it's not a very good one because (i) it doesn't mean what *thing* usually does, and (ii) it means the same as *noun*.\n\n&gt;If you disagree, you need to find another way to account for the fact we identify such words as 'things'. As /u/nessie[1] said above, 'How is a process not a thing?' It's just totally intuitive.\n\nFor people who do, then they either are using a semantic definition that nobody can work out, or (more likely) they are doing what you are, and using the same unusual sense of *thing*, probably because of their education.\n\n&gt;Do you disagree that combustion is a thing?\n\nYes, that doesn't accord with my understanding of the word *thing*.\n\n&gt;&gt;what does thing mean that noun doesn't\n\n&gt;Why does it need to?\n\n&gt;(Of course, thing also has a range of other meanings. As mentioned, some of those are 'archetypal' nouns. That's why the word is useful for simple explanations. Arguably, it's much easier to say 'Nouns are things like a chair or a table. And non-physical things like an emotion.' (at which point most people just get it) than, say, 'Nouns are words which bear a certain syntactic relationship (what's that?) to other words. For example if you can use an article (what's that?) in front of a word and it's not an adjective or an adverb (what are they?) then it's a noun.')\n\nThe problem with this definition is that it's just an ostensive one. You're picking out a few words, saying they are *things*, and expecting people to work out both that you don't mean *thing* in the usual sense and that you're actually identifying a syntactic class. That people/children can work this out is just testament to their linguistic sensitivity, although I'm not convinced that everyone makes this leap. Yes, it's more difficult than this to explain what a noun is as a linguist would, but this is because linguists have attempted to develop definitions that are better than just ostensive. And they aren't that complicated either, but they do require you to understand some syntax. Which is just as well, since accurately defining nouns is a syntactic topic.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417450345", "subreddit": "linguistics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in high school, I wrote this rap song that I would perform for friends. Just messing around. For context, I'm an Asian-American male who wears glasses. I think that added to the effect.\n\nWhen I went to college, during the freshmen orientation week, they had a \"New Student Talent Show.\" I thought of doing the rap song from high school. I talked to one of the coordinators. He discouraged me, saying you don't want to turn off a bunch of people and embarrass yourself. Saddened me.\n\nThen I talked to another coordinator, a young woman who told me I should totally do it. So I signed up.\n\nThe night of the talent show comes. When it's my turn, I get up on stage. It's the entire freshmen class, a sea of new faces, a couple hundred students. Holy shit. Too late to go back now.\n\nI said my name, but added that my nickname was Spider-Man (he's my favorite super-hero). Got some laughs.\n\nStarted off by telling this sad story of how in high school I wanted to ask out the girl I liked to a dance. But she turned me down. Crowd goes, \"Aww.\"\n\nSo I wrote this song to tell her how I felt. How it was my way to get over it. True story.\n\nI took a deep breath, put on a sad face and tried to look like I was about to go into this soulful song.\n\nInstead I exploded with these lyrics:\n\n    Yo, my name is _____\n\n    I like to mack on senoritas\n\n    Freshman year, my life used to bite,\n\n    when I first freaked I saw the light!\n\n    I became a master pimp\n\n    I do you so hard, you walk with a limp!\n\n    Cuz I'm a mack daddy, I find out your name\n\n    and make you feel my game\n\n    I'm a mack daddy\n\n    one night with me you never feel the same!\n\n    I'm gonna get me a car, an old drop-top\n\n    exceed the speed limit, outrace the cops!\n\n    Cuz I'm a man, fearless and flawed\n\n    I'm a rebel without a pause!\n\n    I'm a mack daddy!\n\nThe first 10 seconds I sang, it was dead silence. Oh shit. Show must go on. I kept on singing.\n\nAt 11 seconds, the whole room erupted into pandemonium: \"Yeah!\" \"Woo!\" People were going crazy for it. So loud it drowned out my singing. When I finished, everyone cheered again.\n\nThe end of the night was the winner's announcements: third, second, and first place. Before one of the judges revealed every name, people were yelling, \"Spider-Man!\" \"Go Spider-Man!\"\n\nI didn't win. Didn't even place. People shouted, \"No way!\" \"Spider-Man got robbed!\"\n\nI'll be honest, it was a really killer talent show and all the other contestants were awesome. Not just the ones who placed, nearly everyone was good. I just wanted to give the audience a good time. Mission accomplished. (Later, one of the judges said I almost won third place, it was a close call).\n\nIn the end, it didn't matter. I was an audience favorite anyway. People, all of whom I didn't know, came up afterwards to shake hands and slap me on the back. Saying things like, \"You got robbed\" \"You were my favorite of the night!\" \"I don't care what the judges think, you won!\" One girl even gave me the sexy look and said, \"I would have gone to the dance with you.\"\n\nWhen I asked about why everyone was silent at first, they said it was because they were all in total shock. After hearing the sob story, they had no idea that a rap explosion was coming. When they realized I was rapping, they got excited.\n\nI didn't walk out of that room. I floated out of that room. Felt like a star. Biggest high I've ever felt. Even years later, people still remembered my performance. I'd run into other students on campus, and they'd say, \"Hey, you're Spider-Man!\"\n\nStill think on that experience when I'm having a bad day and need a boost.\n\ntl;dr: No tree fiddy.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417544403", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 142, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yup. Look at the population explosion that occurred in /r/outside when the developers released the Agriculture patch. Pre Agriculture patch (in a time known as the Paleolithic era) players were limited to hunting and foraging for food, which took massive amounts of time and effort. \n\nOnce the Agriculture patch was released and the Neolithic era began, players were able to grow massive amounts of food with much less effort. The result was spectacular. Since it was much less tedious to make food, the player population exploded. Moreover we saw players specialize into different prestige classes, whereas before the patch most of the players chose the basic hunter-gatherer or child-rearing classes. Post-patch saw the development of professional soldiers, record keepers, priests, artisans, and philosophers. They could afford their full-time occupations thanks to the dedicated farmer class players who provided the bulk of the food for the majority of the player population.\n\nSome argue the patch decreased balance and should be nerfed as other play styles (namely the hunter-gatherer style) are no longer as important and most players never even view this game content.

{"body": "I think back to an important day I shared with people I care about.For me that day is something I'm not ashamed of it anymore, in fact it's something I laugh about now. But it makes me feel less alone every time I think about it.\n\nFor me, that day happened many years ago. I have thought about the details of this one night over and over, but this is the first time I have ever written it down.\n\nFirstly, about me. Originally from the US, but grew up overseas as my family all lived in other parts of the world, and I'd spent the past couple of years working in the New Zealand. The past year I had been based in California working for a start up. Objectively not particularly good looking, a bit geeky, glasses, and a weird sense of humor. I had managed to trade on my technical and creative skills though, so at 25 I'd already worked for some very high profile companies. If nothing else it gave me good stories. I still wasn't the best around girls though. I had had two or three girlfriends, but due to a lack of self confidence had only lost my virginity in the past few years. Growing up in a fairly strict religious environment, the emphasis had always been on trying NOT to have sex, so the experience I had on this particular night was made even more memorable by the slow anticipation and desire we both experienced.\n\nI decided after all the work this year to go and have some fun with my friends in New Zealand. I was only there for a few days, and my friends suggested I come along to church with them that morning. I had grown up going to church, and if nothing else it was a great place to meet people. They were actually hoping to set me up with one of their friends, and I was looking forward to it. As it turned out, I never really did meet the girl they intended for me to end up with, but had one of those moments that changed the course of my life and a few others!\n\nWhen I got in to church I noticed this girl outside. She had long natural blonde hair flowing down her back, well dressed, immaculate nails, a gold bracelet and rings on. She hadn't even turned around, but I was already a bit jealous of the guy beside her. When the service was over my friend went off to find the girl they wanted to introduce me to. I was left sitting in my seat, when I saw the gorgeous blonde outside. She was beautiful. She had absolutely gorgeous big blue eyes, and a smile to die for. I didn't see my friends, so I ran to the door to try and talk to her before she left. I must have looked like a fool running out to the door as I ran right into her. I stuttered out an apology for being so clumsy, and she smiled and said \"it's ok\". I fumbled my way through a few more sentences and she tried to assure me it wasn't a big deal. We must have talked for 10 minutes or so, and I found out she was 23, had a great sense of humour, laughed at things that I only thought were funny, and a remarkably similar background to me. The best part was that she was actually planning a trip to the US - to California! So we swapped email addresses, and I told her I would send her an email when I got back home.\n\nIt seems quite funny looking back, but my head was in a spin when I left, and the first thing I did was call my mother overseas to say \"You are not going to believe the girl I just met!\" It was one of the few times when I really felt swept off my feet. Normally it would be enough just to see a girl like that from a distance, but to have someone like that actually engage and be interested was more than I'd ever had before!\n\nTwo or three days later I was back in the US, and immediately emailed her. My plans were to spend Christmas with friends in San Francisco, and her trip was to come to visit Monterey then go to LA and San Diego. Shit we were almost crossing paths, so we made a few changes so she could meet me. Over the next few weeks I found out she was single, and had recently broken up with her boyfriend. While she was all the things I thought she would be, she was definitely not just a good little church girl, and it made my heart race in anticipation for what possibly might happen. The days leading up to her arrival dragged, and even though I was having a great holiday with my two married friends, I was still just counting down until she arrived.\n\nFinally it was the day, and I can still remember it as clear as if it was yesterday. She knocked at the door, and there she was in a blue T shirt and shorts, big blue eyes and long blonde hair. I can remember one of my first thoughts being \"Damn… how did I not notice her boobs!!\" When I gave her hug I almost went weak at the knees feeling how firm and large they were under my chest.  I managed to stutter out \"Can I get you anything?\"\n\nShe bent down and smiled at me in this way that just melted my heart and said, \"There is just one thing. Could I have... Tree Fiddy?\"\nIt was at this point that I realized that he was actually a 30 foot tall monster from the paleolithic era. \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy, Loch Ness monster\" I told her.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417569760", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was 15, and I would take back my first time, as much for me as for her. \n\nThe girl was sweet but a little troubled, and we weren't safe. I asked if I should grab my condom (probably expired and given to me by a guy on the baseball team), and she says, \"It'll just be the tip. We're just playing.\" \n\nEager teenage hormones pumping through us both, and it’s quickly more than the tip.\n\n Immediately after my two pumps and quick pull out, she begins sobbing. Then she starts opening up for the first time about the years of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse she's had since age 5 or younger.\n\nOn top of this trauma, she's now worried she'll get pregnant and she 'Doesn't want to have an abortion and go to hell', which is another indication that in the time we've been 'dating', I know nothing about this girl. I have no clue about her beliefs, values, menstrual cycle, etc and spend the next 2-3 weeks scared shitless and contemplating what to do if she is pregnant. Get married? Drop out and work? Suicide?\n\nThe relationship continued, and taught me the lessons of: why you shouldn't think you can fix someone else's problems, and how to identify when a girl's drunken mother is likely to switch from verbally tearing her down to physically assaulting her. I was quickly out of my depth, sworn to keep her secrets, and incapable of identifying or implementing any kind of intervention and miracle. This continued for about 2 months, until she ended the relationship with me for being the shitty, clueless boyfriend I was.\n\nThe next time, was at 16 with a different girl and different circumstances. We had met at a summer camp, and I'd quickly fallen for her. She was opinionated, enthusiastic, witty, and adventurous. To top it off, she had the greenest eyes I'd ever seen. \n\nGreen eyes were part of my ideal girl: brunette, green eyes, petite, confident. My dream girl was the epitome of elegance and sex in all appropriate proportions. I'm not sure that I had this ideal before the week started, or whether she had driven it into my mind by the end of it. But, either way, I was completely and hopelessly attracted to her.\n\nThose beautiful green eyes of hers would look up at me so sincerely when I talked to her, that I felt like I didn't have to finish my sentence. She could finish what I was thinking. She already knew me. And when she spoke, we would get lost together talking about all our shared beliefs and ideals; our hopes and dreams. We could say absolutely anything and be perfectly understood. \n\nWe went everywhere together, and went on walks whenever there was time. It didn't matter if it was sunny or raining, because whenever we were together that was everything in the world in that moment. \n\nThe day we left camp, I emailed her anxiously hoping to keep her from forgetting me, and she never did forget. We emailed back and forth, multiple times a day, and in between marathon long-distance phone calls. She invited me to one of her school dances, and though it was a 4 hour drive away I convince my parents to drive me there for the weekend. \n\nThat first night, we held hands and watched movies at her grandparents’ house, until 4am. She went to bed, and I kicked myself the rest of the night for not kissing her. The next day, we would sneak chances to touch arms, bump shoulders, and hold hands. We would do anything just to be closer. \n\nAs Saturday continued, we went to dinner with her friends and went to the dance. The tension and connection between us both was absolutely palpable and urgent. It wasn't until we were dancing in that crowded gymnasium with some dumb pop ballad playing, that we actually recreated that camp feeling.\n\nThe music dissolved and the room melted away. All I could feel was my hand in the small of her back, and her arms gently resting on my shoulders. I was nervously plucking up the courage to bend down and kiss her, when she tiptoed up and plucked my head down with her arms still round my neck, to kiss me.\n \nMy mind swam and I basked in the whole moment as I kissed her back, hard, and she swayed in my arms. But, as soon as the floodgates had opened, they'd been stoppered by her stuffy friends and the patrolling chaperons. The song ended and then, a little later, the dance ended and there was only that one kiss. \n\nAfter finally arriving back at her grandparents’ house, as we climbed out of the car, before we slipped into their house I caught her arm and kissed her more thoroughly than on the dance floor. 'I couldn't let her go tonight without getting at least one more kiss', I told her.\nShe just smiled and said, 'That's not the last one,' as she walked into the house.\nHer grandparents had gone to bed, and by the time I had changed and set up my laptop to watch more movies, she had changed into her pajamas: a pair of soft, green, short shorts and a silky cami with no bra. I hit play, the movie started and was forgotten, as she pushed me back onto the couch, and bent down kissing me hungrily.\n\nShortly after that weekend, we agreed our long distance friendship could be and must be a long distance relationship. We didn’t have sex that night, there on her grandparents’ couch. It wouldn’t be until another couple of months and visits, but that night was the first time I released all anxieties and hang ups, and gave everything to being connected and intimate with my partner.  7 years later, I still fall asleep thinking about that night; my dream girl.\n\nTL DR; All high schools should pass out and instruct on proper prophylactic use.

Oh look, this thread again, you stole this from the top all time, you pulled a trappedinreddit, since violentacrez don't real because logic (TM) and reason (TM).

I fail to see what this has to do with my post, because it's like trying to explain algebra to a 3 year old- the greatest wingman of all time made 2 am chili. OP delivered (I'm not even mad that we did it live). To be fair, I came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly. Lost it at 'welcome to jackass' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risk click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. What a story, Mark, really a cool story, bro.

This went on for the entirety for freshmen year.  I wanted to say hello and strike up a conversation, but I just could not bring myself to for whatever reason.\n\nFast forward to sophomore year, and we live in separate areas.  I still see her very frequently, as we had the majority of our classes in the same building, but still not a hello.  She was no longer friends with those other girls, so I had lost my chance to see her out at a party with the social lubricant known as alcohol. \n\nThen, one time, I see her sitting on a bench, reading the book that I am reading, and I approach her....It wasn't her.  Damn.\n\nSo fast forward to Junior Year: She is friends with her old friends again.  I see her at some croweded parties, but still have never spoken with her.  Not a hello, nothing.  Well, I just said fuck it, walked up to her and started talking.  \n\nShe told me all about her life, where she grew up, and other things.

{"body": "With regards to dating I'll repost this:\n\n* Be attractive/Don't be unattractive isn't all bullshit(it's like 50% BS). We've seen dudes do some creepy/disrespectful ass shit only to end up with the girl at the end of the night. If women really payed attention(not saying y'all don't. Just that it's something to look for), they'd see it's the same for them. They'll see some women do some awkward/crazy ass shit and still have a dude returning their calls just because she's shaped like Chanel Staxxx and sucks dick like Karrine Stephans and/or the grapefruit lady.\n\n* A man can both see you as a sexual being and as a person. If a guy propositions you for sex, it's not a sign of disrespect. It means he's attracted to you.\n\n* Keeping the first two points in mind: The reason why guys don't pick up on hints(Even ones as obvious as sitting in his lap and/or asking to watch a movie at his place) is because if we're wrong, we can ruin a friendship. Not only that, but it taints *every*  ***single*** nice thing we've done for you. \"Did he do that just to get in my pants?\"  \n\n* Online dating is throwing your dick AND MAYBE your heart at a wall and hoping something sticks. Repeatedly. The reason those guys aren't forming two well formed sentences referencing your profile is because it's really not worth the effort. If you don't believe me, ask that one male friend of yours that can't get a date if you could create and OKCupid account for him. Bet him about tree fiddy that you can find him a date by the end of the week.\n\n* If we don't do anything we'll die alone. If we don't take that first step, send that first message, or say that first \"Hi, My name is...\" we'll end up in a one bedroom apartment choking on a dinner for one in front of a TV reaching for a life alert button.\n\n* How contradictory the whole \"Don't be my friend to get in my pants. Let me know straight up that you want to date me.\" and \"I don't date strangers. I wouldn't date someone *just* because they found me attractive\" is.  \n\n* That stupid irrational ass fear we have that after working for 10-15 year we'll end up with someone who's settling for us because we're \"stable\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417635689", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 72, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm sure it's a factor, but life is never that simple. Harnessing fire gave us the energy, security and free time to sit around looking at the stars wondering what it's all about. Our brains began expanding like great lotus flowers. Tracing the roots of religion before humans does throw some very interesting kinks into some modern beliefs but I've been more interested in tracking the symbolism and the lessons than worrying about the details of the stories themselves. \n\nSure, running when you hear a twig snap is a natural instinct. Sometimes we have to trust our intuition, but faith also gives us courage to act against our inclinations. The tigers are still out there, even when you can't hear them... and running triggers *their* natural instincts. We have to trust there is a reward to holding fast when every nerve is screaming for us to do something else. It's the birth of empathy and delayed gratification.\n\nI'm a man of faith but I'm also a man of reason. Studies of ancient theology rely very heavily on a wide array of ethno- and paleosciences. Science and Religion are two of our most extraordinary tools. They're capable of performing great transformations for health or harm, but (fortunately/unfortunately) we still can't just see a \"better\" way, snap our fingers and remake the world. Half a million years, two million years... they're just drops in the bucket. Evolution takes time.\n\nWhile the two disciplines may be in conflcit at times, diversity gives our species great strength. One takes the high road and one takes the low road, and with a bit of luck (God willing) at least one makes it home to warn the tribe about tigers. Or demons. Or eight story tall crustaceans from the Paleozoic era selling anti-tiger charms for about tree fiddy. Whatever.

{"body": "Ok, this story may ramble a little but because I have never told it before, so I'm warning you about it now. I am not going to give names because it gives away too much personal information.\n\nThere was a girl who went to high school with me. She was a junior when I was a senior and it was always apparent that her family never had much money. Her brother was a couple years older than me, and he was supposedly running a meth lab with her dad in the trailer outside of their house. This is all in rural Indiana, so it never presented much of an issue to neighbors or anything.\n\nThe girl always say by herself at lunch and one day I noticed that she seemed really upset. I got along with almost everybody at my school so I decided to sit down and see if I could help in some way.\n\nIt turns out that the night before, her dad was high and pulled a gun on her and her mom. I was in shock. I didn't really know what to do, so I tried to get her to tell somebody in the guidance office about it so they could help her. She refused, but she did agree to take my number so that she could call me if there was ever another emergency and she needed help.\n\nA few weeks later I got a call at like 3:00 am and I could immediately tell that something was wrong. She was bawling and finally told me that she got kicked out of the vehicle by her brother so he could go to some \"business meeting\" and she asked if I could come get her.\n\nMy parents have always been pretty charitable and understanding, so I told them what was going on and I went to pick her up. We set her up on the couch overnight and I took her to school the next day. My parents made sure that she knew that she was welcome anytime she needed a place to stay.\n\nOver the next couple months she crashed at my place about once or twice a week and we started spending a lot of time together. I learned that she hated her life at home, and I really couldn't blame her. As we got to know each other better, I found that she was nothing like the rest of her family. She was an amazing artist and singer and we talked about her options for art school and such often. I finally realized that I wasn't interested in her because of trying to be charitable like my parents, but because I was in love with her.\n\nI finally told her about how I felt and we started dating. It was by far the best relationship I have ever had. She was now staying with me three or four times a week and was slowly drifting away from her drug-riddled home life. I couldn't be happier. She even started talking to me about applying to the art school at the university I was got accepted to and it seemed like everything was going to work out for us.\n\nThen I got the call. It was the night before a basketball game and the whole team had gone out for pizza for some team bonding. I saw my mom on the caller ID and as soon as I picked up I could hear her crying. She told me that my girlfriend was in the hospital and it wasn't looking good for her. I was panicking. My buddy on the team overheard my mom and told me he would drive me to the hospital so we took off.\n\nI was in the waiting room for what felt like an eternity. Two hours after we got there, the doctor came out and told me that she was going to make it, but it would be a few weeks before she would be strong enough to leave. He did let me in to see her, and she looked terrible. She had gashes on her arms and hands, and gauze covering up what I learned was a 2\" deep stab wound in her abdomen. She rested for a while and finally told me that it was her dad again. He and her brother were testing out a new batch and got violent. She had jumped in front of her mom to protect her and got the worst of it.\n\nI called her phone later that night and her mom answered. She told me that she was scared of something like that happening again and that she wanted her daughter to live with me and my parents permanently. She had a long conversation with my parents that night and they agreed that it would be for the best.\n\nThe day after she came home from the hospital, we took her to her house to get all of her stuff to come and live with me. Her dad was clearly not happy about it, so after we got her packed up and safely into the car, my dad and I went to have a little chat with him.\n\nHe tried explaining to us how it was some all big accident and that he wasn't really responsible for it, it was just a bad batch. We told him that we better never see him around her or our property and then he got angry.\n\nHe starts screaming about how everything she was taking was his and that he had bought it all, he was going to call the police on her for theft. We calmed him down a little and my dad asked him, \"What will it take to make sure you never hurt your daughter again?\"\n\nHe said \"Imma need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nThat's when I noticed that her dad was actually a ten-story tall monster from the Paleolithic era.

The Miami Heat lost to the San Antonio Spurs, which was expected because the Spurs have been killing it that season and the Heat didn't have much of a bench. **But that's not what directly broke my heart.**\n\nSee I was dating the younger sister of someone who was in the 'entourage' of a certain big-name basketball player who, as had already been informed to me, would be leaving the Heat if they didn't win the championship. And since she was very emotionally (and, let's face it, financially) tied to her family and brother, she knew she'd probably be leaving too, if they lost. I never felt so tied up to a season of basketball in my life, and I'm a pretty big sports fan.\n\nSo as you can probably guess, when the Heat lost, I was very upset. We hung out a few times after the loss, but we knew what was coming. Anyway, it wasn't until the very last time we saw each other that I realized that I care so much about her that I offered to move with her to Cleveland. I asked her how much she figured a studio would cost around there and she said \"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nNot until then did I realize that I realized she was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "I had an awful employee about 5 years ago, in my opinion anyway. I was the manager of a local retail store by the beach in Majorca. We sold your basic beach attire and accessories.\n\nThis woman, Jess, applied for a job at the beginning of summer. It doesn't take much to get hired near the summer in Majorca and the islands surrounding as it gets so busy. All I knew about her was she was 24 and from the UK. She was a great speaker and was fairly pretty. I hired her anyway. I kept a copy of her passport for security reasons. Apparently, that was normal to do on these holiday islands.\n\nThe first 2 weeks of summer, business was going great. Jess was doing fine. Nothing special, just doing her job. Soon after this, when the tourists really began filling up the island and the business was soaring, Jess began to get on my nerves. She would turn up late some days, too many days for my liking, looking kind of scruffy and hungover. The smell of alcohol from her was disgusting. I sensed she was indulging in the late night activities with the tourists. I had no problems with this, once it didn't interfere with her work, which it did. Customers were complaining about the stink coming from her. She was in a bad mood and wasn't treating the customers properly.\n\nI could have easily fired her for this but I chose not to because, honestly, I'm a softie and I liked her when she was being herself. She got warnings etc. which I don't think she took serious. She would have 3-4 day stretches of coming in with no problems but then the next day it would be the same thing.\n\nOne of the days, I had left her on her own for a couple of hours while I spent a few hours with my son. It was morning hours so the store wouldn't be too busy. I figured she could handle it on her own for a while. Oh how I was wrong.\n\nAfter spending time with my son, I dropped him home and headed back to the store. There was a handwritten note on the front door saying \"Closed until 12pm\". The door was locked from the inside so I went around the back which leads to the storage room. As I approached the door, I heard screams and moans. Screams from a man that sounded like he was in pain. I quickly unlocked the door and went inside. There was a man on the floor, butt naked with Jess lying on top of him, pinning him down. I didn't know what was going on or what would have gone on if I didn't enter. I shouted at Jess to get off him and fired her immediately. That was the final straw. I didn't want any excuses from her. i just wanted to get rid of her. She said \"Wait, I want one thing\". I asked her what she wanted. \"My paycheck for this week\" she said. \"How much are you owed?\" I asked. \"About tree fiddy\" she said. It was around this time I realised that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Jess Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\ntl;dr Employee got worse as the weeks went on and I possibly interrupted a rape/kinky fetish sex.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417727559", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 898, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hmm, you're best off looking through the #tulpa tag and using the reblog feature to add posts you like to your blog. I do, however, highly recommend writing original content of your own, and perhaps keeping a guide page on the side--it will be the original content that will compel people most to follow you, as they can easily find the original posts that have been reblogged by looking through the #tulpa tag or following the original authors themselves.\n\nOther advice (warning in advance for shamelessly using my own blog for examples):\n\n* If you're going to post a lot, create a [tag system](http://visionsofgray.tumblr.com/tags) so people interested in a certain subject can quickly filter all the posts to a category of interest. To do this, figure out what categories you want your posts in, then tag the applicable posts with that tag, then provide a link formatted http://[yourblognamehere].tumblr.com/tagged/[yourtaghere] without the brackets. (For example, I have a \"personal\" tag for personal things and progress reports, and my link to this tag is http://visionsofgray.tumblr.com/tagged/personal.\n\n* Write yourself an About page. This can be an actual side page, or simply a post linked in your description.\n\n* Spruce up your blog with a nice theme. Most of the nice themes I know aren't in tumblr's official list--they're posted on various theme blogs, and you can find them if you look around. Some recommendations: [Cynessie](http://cynessie.tumblr.com/thstop1), [Manatopia](http://manatopia.org/tagged/theme:-mine), [a--themes](http://a--themes.tumblr.com/), [Viwan](http://viwan-demo.tumblr.com/). You can customize your blog's theme further using the Edit HTML feature (under the theme name in Edit Theme), but this takes some knowledge of CS (though Rain and I are willing to help out with this, provided the requests are not too extreme). And when editing the theme, always respect the original author of the theme and abide by their guidelines.\n\n* To add onto the above--when picking and customizing a theme, please please please take your readers' comfort into account. A lot of themes I see like to use tiny font with colors that very closely resemble the backgrounds of the posts, which force you to squint if you want to read anything. A reader will most likely not bother trying to read a long post if it gives them eyestrain. If you come across a theme and you like it, but the text is a pain to read, consider changing the font size and font color to something easier on the eyes. (If the theme author allows you to, which most will--and again, Rain and I can help if you can't figure out how to change these options).\n\n* And general rule of thumb--assume everyone navigating your blog is easily lost and easily distracted. Put important links out where they're easy to see--don't frustrate readers by hiding the home and ask buttons under several layers of animation.\n\n* blah blah don't have an extremely busy background, it's distracting, blah blah other design principles. Also, custom cursors can be a pain to use if they're tiny and easy to lose. Also also, if you're playing music on your blog (something I don't recommend, actually), make sure the \"off\" switch is easy to locate. Blah blah, design.\n\n* Anyway, back to the topic of actual blogging. This is something I'm horrible at, but when people send asks (especially after you ask for asks), try to answer them as quickly as possible. Doing so encourages people to send you more.\n\n* On the topic of asks, if you turn on anonymous asks, always prepare to receive hatemail, especially since tulpamancy can be a hot topic.\n\n* On the topic of hatemail, don't let the SJWs get to you.\n\n* Be focused when you post. I know this is a hot topic, but if you're aiming for your blog to be a formal tulpamancy resource, don't post or reblog unrelated things. With more personal blogs, this is more okay. (Though I still maintain that if you outright say that your blog is a tulpamancy blog, the majority of stuff on it should be tulpamancy-related. Reblogs of stuff for your tulpas also count if the blog is especially meant as a personal space, but the more resource-oriented you want your blog to be, the tighter your focus should be.) You are always free to make a sideblog if you want to separate off-topic things from your main tulpamancy blog.\n\n* And probably the most important tip of all! Network, network, network. This does not mean go up to people and beg them to advertise your blog on their blog, unless they're specifically asking for people to send them their blogs so they can promote them. Rather, follow people with similar interests, respond to their posts, send asks yourself, answer questions, promote other people's blogs every so often, etc. Involve yourself with people--don't wait for or expect that people will come to you first.\n\nThis was extremely long! And I might add more later. In any case, keep in mind that all of the above is just stuff I've gathered from personal experience and opinion. Feel free to mix, match, and tweak what I say to suit yourself. (Except that you should always respect theme artists' work, because stealing work is rude, to say the least.) It should be especially noted that the above advice is given with the assumption that you want your blog to be a relatively well-known and easy-to-use resource--if you're making a mostly personal blog, one that you'll be the primary reader of, you can do whatever you want with music, custom pointers, backgrounds, etc.\n\nHope it helped!\n\nEDIT: More stuff:\n\n* Use crosslinks, i.e. take advantage of wiki-walking tendencies. If your post references ideas you already wrote about in another post, feel free to hyperlink to that post, preferably in a relatively unobtrusive manner. [For example.](http://visionsofgray.tumblr.com/post/103839471868/keralastic-mementomoriarity-said-do-not-make)\n\n* Also, this is a bit of advice I forget to follow, myself, but when you want people to ask you something, hyperlink your ask page so they can quickly reach it from your post instead of looking for it.\n\n* Proofread your posts. Avoid egregious grammar and spelling mistakes. Use paragraphs--it saddens me a lot when people write good things without using paragraphs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417743515", "subreddit": "Tulpas", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

They are the most honest people and will let you know if they're enjoying themselves. \n\nMy favorite memory was this little girl at the Fishermans Wharf in Monterey, CA. She was probably 2 or 3. Walking on her own but had a pacifier and kind of short tawny hair. \n\nI was playing [The Hazards of Love part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRLSaBZV1Eo) by the Decemberists. She was walking with her parents and once they came on line with me, she just came to a halt. Her parents stopped and gave her a dollar to put in my case. When she figured out that it was safe to get closer she just walked right up to me and stood about a foot in front of my guitar. \n\nI have not seen a sweeter smile on a child in all my life. You could see her grin behind her pacifier as she kept looking back to her parents for assurance. \n\nWhen I got to the last verse I got kind of quiet for her and leaned in close so I was only really playing for her. She pulled her pacifier out of her mouth and says to me \"I'm gonna need tree fiddy.\" It was about that time.... nah joking.\n\nShe handed me her dollar and went running back to her parents. There was a moment there that pretty much set it in my heart to be a musician for life. It was so surreal forgetting that I was nervous about playing in public because of a child. \n\nThat family stayed for a couple more songs before moving on, and each one they gave her a dollar to give to me.

{"body": "I would think this is common sense, and I'm pretty sure it is justified.\n\nSkepticism = withholding belief until evidence justifies it. \n\nAtheism = skepticism as properly applied to claims regarding the existence of gods.\n\nSince it is not justified to believe a claim until it can be demonstrated (skepticism), this becomes the default claim. \"I don't believe you\" is the proper response to any claim that is asserted without evidence. This is true regardless of the claim; atheism is merely a subset of skepticism that exists in relation to the claims made by theists. In order for this to be false, you would need to demonstrate that it is desirable to believe things without justification - and where else in life do people wish to do this other than with their religious beliefs?\n\nThere are 2 options when presented with a claim: belief or disbelief. To say that you are ignorant of the truth and will therefore withhold judgement is not an option: if you have evidence to support it, belief is justified; if you don't, or you don't know if there is evidence (ignorance), then you still don't believe - ignorance is a subset of disbelief. If I come to you and claim to have a dragon in my garage, you can either believe me, or you can say \"I don't know if that's true, but I can't believe you until you show me\". Skepticism - withholding belief until justification is given - is the default with any claim.\n\nThis is not a situation in which a burden of proof applies to both sides, it is merely a situation in which one side (theists) must meet the burden brought about by their claims, and the other side (atheists) are justified in disbelieving their claims until they do. It's the same reason why you aren't required to prove there is no Loch Ness monster before you say you don't believe in one. Disbelief (skepticism) is the default there, and everywhere else.\n\nIt is also justified by the fact that skepticism used in day to day life leads to better decision making.

{"body": "Your slutty boss.\n\nI was employed by an absolute MILF who was the head of a small clothing franchise, whose name I won't say for obvious reasons. \n\nI was working there for about a month and everything was going normal. Just doing my job, getting along with my colleagues etc. My boss was rarely around. She spent most of her time in the office, right beside the camera room. Looking back at it now, I'm convinced she was perving on me and the other guys while she was back there.\n\nOne of the days I was trying to reach a shirt on the top rail for a customer. I couldn't find the long hook thing to reach up there so I went into the back room to look for one. I met her back there and she asked what I was doing. When I told her I needed the hook to reach the shirt, she looked at me baffled, saying that I should be able to reach it. She told me to show her what I was trying to reach. I brought her over. I reached up, stretching with one hand, not even close to pulling it down. Then she slapped my ass in a way that a NFL coach slaps his players ass in a congratulatory way. This wasn't congratulatory though. As she did it, she said \"Come on Keith, stretch!\". I was kind of surprised, as was the customer who giggled a little.  \n\nAnyway, I couldn't reach it and had to go back to get a hook. When I returned the hook, she was there and started chatting to me, asking how I am not fed up of working the floor, dealing with customers. I asked her what else was there as it's a clothing store. She mentioned she would be moving out of town in a few months and there would need to be someone to replace her. I didn't really get the hint, but she was implying that I could replace her. It never really crossed my mind as I was only working there a while. She said by the time she was gone, I would have plenty of experience and she would help me. The next sentence out of her mouth was not one bit expected - \"I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine\"\n\nThe look on her face, I instantly knew what she meant. I felt kind of uncomfortable/bold at the thought of it. Then the more she went on about the perks of her job, the more I wanted to do it.\n\nLong story short, we did the deed in her house that weekend. It was great fun, especially because she so fucking hot. I expected it to happen a few more times since she wasn't leaving for a few months. I was correct. 2 or 3 times every couple of weeks, we would meet at her house when nobody was there. It was OK, a little perk in itself, but I was eyeing that big promotion when she left.\n\nThe time came for her to \"leave\" and that bitch wasn't going anywhere. She thought we had bonded enough that she could confess to me that she only said that to get me into bed with her and we would still be fine. That was not fine at all. Firstly, I would have slept with her if she just asked. Secondly, I was promised a promotion at the end of it all which was a big deal to me. I didn't want anything to do with this crazy woman anymore. I quit that job immediately. She pleaded for me to stay. There was no chance. I changed my number because she kept contacting me.\n\nThen a few days later I was chilling at home. I hear loud thumps on the front door. I look outside and her fucking car was in the drive. I stayed out of sight. I didn't want her to see me. She was too persistent and loud. Banging and banging for about 15 minutes. I finally answered the door. I asked her what the hell she wanted. \"Uhh, you're entitled to a bonus which I never gave to you\". She didn't sound too believable, but she started searching her pockets and pulled out $400 and handed it to me. I didn't say anything and was about to close the door. She said \"Wait!\"...\"What do you want now?\" I said...\"I gave you too much\" she said...\"What, how much do you need back\"...\"About tree fiddy\" she said. It was around this time I realised that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nShe was a psycho bitch.\n\ntl;dr Crazy MILF used me, promising a promotion that never existed", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417891012", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A cryptid is an animal that may be unknown to the public.  The panda bear was once a cryptid for instance.  Even though people were seeing it, it was not the right people seeing it.  \n\nWhat makes me believe they are possible... The Panda above is a good example.  Even with a pelt sent as evidence with a sketch, British scientists initially thought the platypus was a hoax.  The true giant squid used to be considered mere legends of drunken sailors.  Whenever one of these are found, science suddenly says, \"Alright, but the rest are still hoaxes.\"  That is why I tend to at least think they are possible.\n\nCommon cryptids are of course Hairy homonids (Bigfoot, skunk ape, yeti, orang pendek, etc.), Dogmen such as the Beast of Bray Road, Jersey Devil, prehistoric survivors (Ropen, Mokele Mobembe, possibly the Loch Ness Monster), big predator cat sightings, Dover Demon, thunderbirds, Lizard men, etc.  \n\nOut of all the strangeness in my life, I have never had an encounter with a cryptid.\n\nAs to which cryptid I believe to be the most credible; there are actually a few, but I suppose Bigfoot takes center stage. \n\nAll across the world and throughout history, there are sightings of various hairy humanoids.  The reports are in the thousands here in North America alone.  That is a lot of people putting their reputation on the line even when you consider hoaxes and  wrong identification of noises.  Dogs seem to fear the very scent of them.  The size of the rocks that sometimes come hurling towards your area are too big for most humans to toss that well.  Tree beating when supposedly no humans are around etc.\n\nI imagine the scientific community knows cryptozoology is necessary.  Somebody has to be willing to follow clues and dedicate time and resources to find reclusive and hidden animals.  People had to do just that in the past to discover some of the animals we take for granted today.  Scientists would love for actual evidence to be found that they cannot discredit.\n\nAs far as how they view it in terms of plausibility, shows about people getting drunk and firing their rifles off at anything they hear does not help the image.  Hoaxers further the bad image.  The more hoaxes there are, the less plausible something looks.\n\nIt has come to the point of researchers staying as far away as possible because of how damaging it would be to their reputation.\n\nAnyway, I hope that helps a bit.

{"body": "Okay, so my idea for a quicker game of monopoly pretty simple. Basically you start with the base game. Except each player takes on a unique role. Player one is the banker, of course. Player two is a lobbyist for the banking industry who panders to Player three who is a congressman and is employed by Player four who is a large investment firm.\n\nNow each player can make investments with the firm that are based on a combination of sacrificing moves and money - but we'll get to that later. First I need to introduce the main concept of this game: A free-market trading system of goods and services. Essentially you need to combine it with the resources from settlers of catan to make the cost each property determined by a specific availability of resources - but more on that later.\n\nThe part that makes this quicker than the traditional monopoly is the basis in real-world market trends. By consulting traditionally owned stocks and pairing them with specific properties you're able to set the pace of the game according to the timeframe in which the stocks are played through, but I'll get back to that. \n\nEssentially the stock idea is based upon the Argentinian debt crisis of 2001. Each player, along with their financial roles, plays the role of a certain large player in the debt crisis. Player one is of course Marigol Harnandez, the largest player in the banking field during the Argentinian debt crisis. The other players are chosen based on their facial similarity to a selection of thirteen major government officials during the time of the debt crisis - of course one of them needs to be federal auditor Jose Gonzalez, who is in fact on the payroll of the banker's lobbyist, but more on that later.\n\nWhat this boils down to is a game that incorporates greater logic than the traditional monopoly in order to speed it up. However, should a player become too ingrained in such a logic, said player is given a fixed time limit per turn. This time limit is based on the current location of both the position of the moon and the last article published online about the loch ness monster.

I started to freak out, so I began to rewind the video, just to make sure I wasn't just being paranoid. When I replayed the video I saw a hulking man in what I thought to be a ghillie suit. The man from the video had to be at least 7 foot tall, and I was offically scared shitless.\n\nRight after I was done playing the video, the giant man reappeared on a different monitor. I paused in utter terror as I saw him rummaging through desks. I then noticed the man was merely stealing change out office drawers. I quickly grabbed my tazer, and went to the floor I saw the man stealing from. I snuck into the administrative offices and could still hear him rummaging around quiet loudly. I posted up outside of the door then yelled \" Stop, I have a tazer and will use!\"\n\nThen man completely paused, and didn't move a single muscle. He then started to repeat, \"I need, I need, I need\". Feeling as though I had control of the situation I exclaimed, \" What? What do you need\". Then man turned around and said, \" I need tree fiddy\". Letting out a sigh relief, I told that lochness monster to get the hell out of here. He hunkered his head down as I escorted him to the door.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417945884", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Both of us being white, meant we couldn't really go into urban areas to get to our eagle's nest position in town, without the local militia being informed of our presence. Kevin, being the best spotter in the whole unit devised a quick plan to use our ATVs and over watch from an adjacent hill. But this meant we would be mighty close to only being in position a couple of minutes before zero hour. \n\nWe quickly packed our equipment onto the ATVs and scrambled as fast as we could into position. If there was one thing we didn't want, it was to leave our boys without cover for the raid. Kevin, as he always did, lead the way, carving a path threw the rough African terrain. We got to our over watch position just as the sound of US made UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters whispered, and then thundered through the air as they got closer. \nWe had just a few minutes to set up. But we had done this hundreds, nay, thousands of times before. Once done, I looked down the barrel and aligned my sights. I spotted one guard in the guard tower. Kevin had spotted him as well. \n\n\"I'm gonna need a range on him Kev,\" I said as I began to adjust and slow down my breathing rate. \n\n\"978 metres. Winds 4.6 metres per second left to right.\" Kev answered. \"But Mike, first I'm gonna need something from you.\" \n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this point that I realised that Kevin was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the palaeolithic era. \"Goddamnit Nessie!

I went to the kitchen and found a note on the counter. \"We left for the hospital, John (my little brother) fell off a tree, I took the others with. Dad's at work, he'll be home at 8\". I put the note down and did a little happy dance as I would have the house to myself. I sat myself down and turned on the TV. I was watching The Simpsons when I heard a knock on the door. I opened it and saw a very tall man with blonde hair, a scruffy beard, and no arms. \"Hello there, triumphantcookie. Care to sit down for a moment?\" I asked how he knew my name but he just stared at my eyes. I began to get really uncomfortable and closed the door saying no. I turned all the lights on and continued watching TV until I heard another knock about half an hour later. I got up, and opened the door.

Whatever lead to the evolution of the homosapien just simply took that long to happen.

If humans had evolved 2 million years earlier, that would mean modern day society would be 2 million years ahead of current technology.  \n  \n2. In 2 million years I have a feeling that space travel will have been conquered through technological advances.  \n  \n3. We can therefore ask; what if *other* sentient beings started their evolution 2 million years before us; simply because their planet sustained life earlier than ours did... We can assume, if the conditions were right, they could be immensely more intelligent than us.  \n  \nThere are many theories that suggest the reason we have no experienced intelligent contact yet is because we are NOT an intelligent race.

{"body": "So there I was studying away in the library I had a big physics exam coming up and that meant a lot to me. I didn't have many friends at the time to study with so I just sat alone on an armchair. Out of nowhere pops up this mighty fine young girl. But I was way to shy to even attempt to talk to her. She starts speaking to me. I reply back some simple yes or no answers. Hoping she would leave my awkward self alone. But she was persistent almost too persistent. \n\nEveryday that week I would be in the same chair and she would come up to me and start chatting to me. Overtime I started to have conversations with her. But she would constantly make me blush the whole time making the conversations almost embarrassing due to how red I was. As I walked out of the library one day a somewhat popular guy pulls me aside. \n\"She wants the D.\" He whispers to me. \n\"What? What's the D?\" I asked. As I had never heard of such a term before. \n\"Put your D in her V.\" He said. I nodded my head as if I understood what he said but I honestly had no clue. \n\nThat night I thought about what the guy had said to me that day and what it actually meant. Constantly twisting it over in my mind before dismissing it as my physics exam was almost here now. \n\nThe day before my physics exam I left the library earlier than usual and once again the guy was standing leaning near the exit. \n\"Have you done it yet?\" He asks. A look of excitement and a cheeky grin appears on his face. \n\"No.\" I reply. Then he repeated the same phrase he said before. \n\"Put your D in her V.\" Once again the words fly in one ear and out of the other. Not even processing in my brain. \nThat night I lay in bed desperately trying to sleep before my exam. But my mind was stuck thinking of the riddle the library man said to me. The words echoed around my head but never came to anything more than a phrase. Eventually I fell asleep.\n\nMy alarm buzzed and I started getting ready. The thoughts of the night before had completely left my head by now. My mind was only focused on one thing, the exam. \nI get to the exam hall in plentiful time and find my seat. I see people outside trying to cram in every bit of knowledge they can with worried looks on there faces, they are about to face the worst exam of them all. Everyone is called into the hall and the examiner slowly delivers the exam papers. When he says we can begin I almost rip the exam paper in two due to my excitement. \n\nIt wasn't until I was half way through the paper. When everything became clear to me. The riddle had solved itself. It was now clear what I had to do. The exam no longer mattered to me. I had a new aim, a new focus. I stood up throwing my exam paper to the floor and Marched towards the door. The examiner shouts something to me as I leave the door mentioning about my grade. But I knew the only grade I was getting that day was boning and I knew I was going to get an A* in it. \n\nI march into the girls room. I see her sitting at her desk doing work. But work meant nothing now. \n\"I'm here to give you the D!\" I proclaim. I'm almost bursting with excitement. \n\"I'm presume your looking for Vicky the girl who always speaks to you in the library?\" \n\"Yes!\" I reply slightly worried. \n\"She lives across the hall, and make it a bit more romantic for her.\" She says not even looking up from her work. \n\"And how would I do that?\" I respond. \n\"Well first of all don't ever use that phrase ever again.\" She says. \n\nI exit the random strangers room and knock on Vicky's door. I was trying to seem romantic and polite. She answers, her hair is wet and she is wrapped in a towel. Shit she's beautiful. I don't think I have seen anyone so pretty. She smiles cutely as she realises its me. In this moment the whole awkwardness of my previous encounter across the hall is forgotten. My whole plan of being romantic is gone as well and then I say it again. \n\"I'm here to give you the D!\" I realise a second too late as the word just escaped my lips, what have I just said.  To what I can only presume to be the love of my life. My facial expression turns shocked. She's acts like I said a completely normal sentence. Inside I'm having a meltdown. \n\n\"Well come inside then.\" She says this answer shocks me and I step inside her room and shut her door. Vicky drops her towel in the middle of the room. That's when I realised she wasn't Vicky at all. This was not even a human. Vicky was in fact a monster from the palaeolithic era and almost 8 stories tall. \n\"Give me tree fiddy!\"Nessie says. \n\"Goddamit Nessie leave me alone!\" I shout.

{"body": "I have never posted nude pics online but I have an incredibly disturbing story to tell about a girl who posted to /r/gonewild that I recognized. I have been thinking hard lately about whether or not I ever want to share this story with reddit and this seems like a pretty good thread to share it in. For all of you /r/gonewild girls out there and those of you who have thought about posting nude photos of yourself, let this serve as a cautionary tale...\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was.\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to /r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was insanely open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about.\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her /r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\nWell, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\"\nNot only did I walk away without any extortion money, I didn't get any new nudes from her which is what I was holding out for more than anything else. The only good thing about the failed sextortion deal is that she never contacted the FBI which works out perfectly for me because if she did, I wouldn't have been able to share this cautionary tale with all of you wannabe /r/gonewild gals out there. I was seriously bummed about not getting any more exclusive jerk-off material from this bodacious babe but c'est la vie no smoking hot gonewild noodz 4 me :( Just remember this, girls: If you're gonna get your tits out for the lads, don't show your face.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418091046", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

Like a good neffew, I of course wanted to assist my auntie in retrieving her gold ring. It was her wedding ring, and the only piece of jewelry that my Uncle Sanders had given to her. My uncle was a great guy, from what I hear, but he died before I was born. He was  killed in a garbage disposal related incident himself, which is what makes this particular event all the more tragic.

{"body": "Sure, I actually have the material up now because I'm writing my final paper on the topic.\n\n&gt;Estimates indicate that women provided up to 70% of caloric intake up during the paleolithic era.\n\nThe split between the paleolithic and the neolithic is defined by the widespread domestication of both plants and animals. (Its important to note that this isn't a precise cut-off, the earliest uses of agriculture were from 12,000 to 10,000 B.C.E where the Neolithic is usually regarded as starting around 10,000 B.C.E give or take a few hundred years) Rather than being food producers, paleolithic peoples were food collectors. Paleolithic peoples lived in bands of around 50 people but began to move towards smaller scale groups near the lower paleolithic. While we don't know much about the sexual division of labor in these nomadic groups because they leave behind little evidence. We do know that the small groups of proto-farmers that began to pop up were moving towards a more strict division of labor, with women's roles generally being more directed at farming with men taking care of animals. This combined with studying different hunter-gather groups still active today, like the San peoples, present a pretty good case for women providing a majority of the food during the lower-paleolithic period specifically. Though their diets largely stayed the same, we just don't know how old the devision of labor is so we cant say for sure.\n\n&gt;Also, though labor was gendered in most cases, it looks like a gendered hierarchy was nonexistent until the rise of first wave civilizations.\n\nThe move towards agriculture created a more stationary lifestyle and  allowed for a surplus of food and other items. The ability to accumulate and control these surpluses, due to the residual social tradition of kinship, was dependent on control of your bloodline. To control your bloodline you had to begin exerting power over the reproduction of women. This wasn't nearly as pronounced as it became during the bronze age of course. This also wasn't universal or uniform. For instance, neolithic farming villages in southern turkey managed to remain fairly egalitarian. Many still think that relative gender equality was the norm until the end of the neolithic.\n\nI'm trying to not link anything behind pay walls like jstor.\n\n[Here is a good source on paleolithic diet if you don't mind reading scanned pdfs](http://www.diamondsindasky.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Eaton-NEJM.pdf)\n\n[Also, here is my old text book lol](http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/classes/strayer.pdf)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418192262", "subreddit": "badhistory", "score": 31, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You clearly have a very unique intuition when it comes to this dangerous situation, and while I cannot provide you with LSD, I will solve for you a riddle that will help you in your new quest. \n\nFirst of all, LSD really stands for Lizard Secret Detector. The chemical name is actually a riddle, which I will solve for you to spare you the sacrifices I had to make across several intertwined timelines to truly understand what was really at stake:\n\n Let's get the obvious part out of the way first, as without this initial connection nothing will make sense- Lysergic  sounds an awful lot like Lizardgic . Say Lysergic outloud over and over until it does, it is critical. Eventually you will hear it.\n\n\n\nLizardgic is an amalgamation of two key words, which I'm sure by now you've guessed to be Lizard and Magic! Suddenly We have taken Lysergic Acid Diethylamide and turned it into:\n\n Lizard Magic Acid: Diethylamide\n\n You may be thinking:\n\nWhat the fuck? What the fuck do we do with the Diethylamide?! Chemistry words don't have anything to do with Lizard people or conspiracies! and it sure as hell doesn't sound like something like Lysergic did! Is this some kind of sick joke? Is this some big wind up that will end with a giant lizard asking me for tree fiddy?! Is all of this a lie?!! This entire time?!?!?!?! \n\n I certainly thought those exact words when the truth was revealed to me.  But then it all became clear when I rearranged the letters of Diethylamide thus unraveling the riddle of the Lizard Secret Detector: Lizard Magic Acid:  Y Had Time Lied? \n\n I may have done some of the dirty work for you in explaining this riddle to you, but the dirty work is left to you. You must consume enough of the Lizard Secret Detector to unravel time and all of its lies, and when you finally answer the question Y you will have all the tools you need to save your state just as I did for mine.

{"body": "Thank you for the reply! It means a lot that you would help me as I am struggling. I would have to agree that those of us with anxiety will latch onto something, and if we resolve it, we will latch on to another concern. That has happened to me since I was diagnosed, but my concern is that right now, I am scared of death. What is bigger than death? Surely, worrying about paying taxes or who to vote for is miniscule compared to death. Who gives a damn about where I work or what my hobbies are if we all die someday? Do you see my point? I can't imagine worrying about anything bigger than death, because at the end of the day, it is the biggest concern any human will ever have to face.\n\nI would like to ask a few questions on your answers, if that's alright.\n\n2.) I totally agree, NDE's are the closest thing to 'evidence' as we can get, however, if we dismiss NDE's (which I often do) then this leaves us with NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER. That being said, how can we be sure of an afterlife? For comparison, take any given conspiracy theory (aliens, etc.) We don't know that this conspiracy/event took place, but there is enough evidence to argue either side of it. Given that we have quite literally NO evidence for an afterlife, how can we be so sure that there is one? In the case of the 'loch ness monster,' at least there is that crummy photo... at least we have SOMETHING tangible. In the case of the afterlife, what is there to tangibly grasp on to? And if we have nothing to grasp onto, then how can we believe it? \n\n4.) I disagree. When I lean toward the belief that 'there is no afterlife,' I tend to not care about anything. I become apathetic towards everything, because in the end, why does it matter? If when I close my eyes for the last time, there is nothing else, then why should/would I care about anything? It's an incredibly depressing place to be...\n\n5.) I would hope that we don't grow bored! But have you considered how long ETERNITY is? If you lived 1,000,000 earth years, you haven't even touched a percentage of what eternity is. If you lived 1,000,000 earth years, you could literally do almost everything that there is to do on this planet several times over. That being said, don't you think that seeing the Grand Canyon for the 4,000th time would be a little boring? In the scope of eternity, if we have FOREVER to do something, then don't you thin it'd get uninteresting after awhile?\n\n7.) What basis do you have to dismiss the 'body-mind dualism?' As far as science is concerned, this is a pretty legit topic, in my opinion. And if we have bodies in heaven, then we're back to a body-mind relationship, which you just said you tend not to agree with. A different relationship, albeit, quite similar.\n\nMy questions stem from my faith 'hiccup' I am experiencing. This is so hard for me, and I hope you can understand that. My friends and family have noticed a physical change in me. I have lost close to 15 pounds, and I have had several people note that I have aged facially... and this is just over the past 4 months! I am incredibly distraught, and I appreciate you taking the time to help me through this... I am just not sure what to believe in anymore.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418316261", "subreddit": "CMH", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

They wanted to spend the day sightseeing on scooters, I wanted to go for a bushwalk and see some of the houses people had carved into the rock up close.  We chose to separate.\n\nI got into a nice comfy pair of shoes, jeans and a t-shirt, grabbed a bottle of Schweppes Bitter Lemon (1.25L, because hydration) and set out, camera in hand, down a 5km track.\n\nAfter about two hours, I realised I was lost.  I'd walked over a log to cross a stream, climbed a ladder carved into a rock face, and ended up aimlessly following a farm track in the hope it would take me somewhere back towards town.  Eventually the farm track terminated at a cliff edge, and I could see where the walking track wound down back towards town about two hundred metres away, so I tried to see if there was a way down the cliff.\n\nWalking along the cliff edge, I suddenly felt the soft, sandy soil start to slip away under me.\n\n\"Fuuuuuuuuu-\"\n\nI grabbed handfuls of grass and tried to claw my way away from the ledge which was falling out from under me.  The grass pulled out of the sand and I slid helplessly down with the forming avalanche.\n\nI somehow managed to rotate 180 degrees during the descent so I could see what I was falling towards and noticed a tree sticking out of a rock about halfway down.  I grabbed for it, caught it, and pulled myself up onto the rock.\n\nWorming into a seated position, I took in my position.  I was halfway down a solid fifteen metre cliff, with about 6.5-7m of sheer drop beneath me onto a flat rock bed.  So no jumping.  Above me was the sandy, soft cliff face, almost impossible to climb without it collapsing.  So no climbing.  I was stuck.\n\nI took off my pack, had a swig of Schweppes, and checked my phone.  Dead.  I took it apart, carefully cleaned it, put it back together and it came on.  There was enough credit for a single text, so I texted my friends with the news that I had an accident while bushwalking and needed rescue...\n\n***to be continued...***", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418389989", "subreddit": "AFL", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Mailboxjackson23's 2014 /r/longboarding yelp review:\n\nI woke up this morning with a distinct craving for a.. Different type of cuisine. I hop on yelp (as I usually do when I wake up) to catch up on the latest dirt surrounding the small business world in my locale. I log in to find one of my favorite people, Raffi, had recently checked in to a nice little dig, oddly titled “/r/longboarding.\" I thought to myself \"It must be some strange hipster bar/grill\" but with an empty stomach a $$ dollar sign scale, and a five star rating from Raffi G himself, I had to check it out for myself. \n\nI go at about 2:00 Pm, to find a rather odd hour system, \"closed and instantly reopened every 22 hours.\" I think to myself, \"how do the employees get rest?\" Puzzled, I open the double doors, and when I enter I see a restaurant atmosphere like I've never seen before. From the outside, this restaurant seemed very small, no larger than a Mcdonald's, but on the inside, a massive cavern of tables and chairs large enough to fit a small country in. I swear to god it's like the TARDIS In there. \n\nI am greeted my a boyish fellow, whom according to his name tag, was called \"Stig.\" A perfect gentleman in every way, asks me my name, how long I have been riding, how many boards are in my quiver, and what my sponsors are. I answer his information requests and as soon as he said \"gr8 b8 m8\" I felt a sharp pain in my back. It would appear that a small, quiet, almost hobbit-like man with a holographic name above his little head to the tune of \"/u/petetsar\" had stuck me in the back with a large pole, injecting me with something some kind of liquid. I ask him what in the hell he just injected me with, and in his small little voice he says \"82a.\" Almost immediately I felt a haze above my head, and it would appear that just like the man they called Pete, I too now had a holographic name above my head entitled \"/u/Mailboxjackson23.\" \n\nI sit down at one of the 30,000 tables and grab a menu to see what's cooking. To my surprise, the menu says:\n\nFood: Fish Taco, tree fiddy ($3.50) \n\nBeverage: 40 Oz, $12\n\nI order both, and wait eagerly for the arrival of what Raffi called \"the best fish taco in town.\n\nAs I wait I overhear a massive argument erupt, with the main 2 phrases being shouted \" THEY'RE MIDS! \" and \" NOT MIDS!\" I look to my left and see a raggedy little corner with a large neon sign on the front that says \"BST\", and as I go to investigate I see hundreds of groms in tattered clothes, holding boards and gear and whispering ever so slightly \"9/10, only ridden once.\" I then see a man by the name of /u/xXTowelieXx, who offered me a towel for the rather reasonable price of $10 and a blow job. I just give him $20 and send him on his way. \n\nAs I exit, I find my order awaiting me on the table. I sit down, crack open the 40 and before I can take a sip, a man named /u/Madmax30000 sits down and offers me an alternate way of drinking my beer.

This sounds stupid, and probably is, but my mother's best friend and I have a 'the dumbest book you've ever read' competition. \n\nFor instance, she started it by giving me a historical fiction book that started out with a bar fight scene. Which was fine, right up until I realized the book had aluminum foil, in the bar, *in the civil war era*. Nope.\n\nI sent her back a murder mystery where the 'Watson' of the investigative team, is a stuffed rabbit. That's right, instead of having an actual character to ask the questions that the reader wants to know, the author chose to have the main character converse with a stuffed animal. Imagine, if you will, the main character is hiding from the bad guy trying to avoid getting shot while explaining their thoughts aloud to a *stuffed rabbit*. \n\nShe sent me back a book that she bought for 99 cents at a Barnes and Noble because she 'felt bad for it' being there. Apparently there was a huge display of them and she wanted to know what was 'so bad about it'. The list is too inumerable to share. We read it together and laughed. It had everything from a Loch Ness monster to a hysterical pregnancy, and liberal amounts of feminism and made-up Native American gibberish on the pages in between. *It was the pretentious hipster of books.*\n\nI've read worse. \n\nAnyway, the point is that *no* I don't feel that I have to finish a book just becuase I've started.

To say that you don't is not a valid argument becuase I have nothing to back up my claim that you don't.\n\n\nHrm....where to begin?\n\n\nFirst thing's first, forming a belief system based on the system you are presenting would open yourself up to believe virtually anything. If you are willing to believe anything that *cannot be disproven*, then you are essentially admitting that you are willing to believe any claim put to you. Not only would you have to believe that I have a dragon living in my garage, but I could easily convince you owe me one hundred dollars and you have simply forgotten.\n\n\nAfter all, there's no *evidence* that you don't owe me one hundred dollars. After all, you forgot it.\n\n\n&gt;You stating a belief that Jesus didn't exist is an opinion with nothing factual backing up your statement.\n\n\nI do not need anything 'factual' beyond the fact that nobody has, to date, presented me with any evidence whatsoever that Jesus did actually exist.\n\n\nI don't believe in bigfoot either. Or dragons. Or pixies. Or the loch ness monster. Or little green men in flying saucers. Why? For the same reason. Because there is insufficient evidence to justify belief.\n\n\nThe time to believe in something is when evidence is presented that it exists. Not before. *Never* before. Again, if you are willing to accept a claim - especially an extraordinary claim (e.g. that I have a dragon) - without evidence, then you are opening yourself up to believe virtually *anything*.\n\n\nThat is why the burden of proof exists, and why it makes sense.

{"body": "When I was 22 I was swimming off the coast of Ensenada. I was a drunken student on spring break.\n\nI'd cut my leg on a broken glass a few hours earlier, and my friends told me not to get in the water. I told them it was fine and there were too many people around for a shark to get near. \n\nWe swam for about 10 minutes when I thought it was a good idea to try to swim out to a sandbar about a 100 yards into the ocean. \n\nHalfway there I felt something brush by my leg. I peered under water and saw a gigantic fin in the distance. Then it turned around. It was a tiger shark. I felt the adrenaline rush through my veins and suddenly didn't feel so drunk anymore. \n\nI knew I was supposed to punch the shark in the nose if it went for me. But I froze when I saw it. Those razor sharp teeth, it's ominous black eyes, and all its scars from the battles it had won. I watched it from 20 yards away, suddenly swimming straight for me. I knew what was about to happen, but I was completely paralyzed. All of the sudden, I felt it bite down on my leg, and I was pulled farther and farther down into the ocean. I struggled to get away - not to survive the shark, but because I had swallowed a lot of water and everything was going black. That's when the shark started thrashing. I don't know if I can really describe that. The pain was ineffable. I blacked out. I was losing blood fast because of the alcohol.\n\nTwo friends pulled me out of the water. The shark was gone, and so was my leg. I only remember flashes after that - lying on the sand, in the ambulance, and being on a gurney. I woke up in a hospital bed to a tremendous pain where my leg should have been - later on the doctors would tell me this was common among people who had lost limbs. I'd gotten lucky. I'd been attacked by a tiger shark and escaped with my life. That was 10 years ago.\n\nIt took me 6 years to even get near a beach again. I had panic attacks just thinking about the ocean. But slowly and steadily, I got over my fear. A few years ago in Belize I had the opportunity to swim with sharks from inside a cage. I asked one of the divers how much it would cost to do it, knowing even a small fortune was less than the fear I would face. The diver told me it would be about free fiddy. That's when I noticed he was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That God Damn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.\n\nAfter that I paid the diver and swam with the sharks. There was something beautiful about those dark eyes, deep scars, and deadly teeth. My heart raced, but not out of fear. I had earned the right to swim along these deadly beasts.\n\nTl;dr survived a shark attack, took me almost a decade to get over my fears but I eventually swam with sharks.

{"body": "When I was 14, my dad got transferred from San Antonio to Los Angeles, so in a matter of weeks I went from being a down-home Texas country boy to having to live amongst a huge amount of surfer dudes and gals. This, along with my raging teenager hormones, brought along a lot of stress for my family, and even though I had an older brother, he'd adjusted quite well (even got a girlfriend within three months, alpha fucker), which left me with only myself to turn to, and myself wanted to find a new friend, which brings me to my Girl Next Door.\n\nMy next-door neighbor, whom I'll call Nellie, was a year older than me, went to the same school, was a straight-B student, and was the most un-emo girl I've ever seen who enjoyed Hot Topic. She was also attractive. Now with hindsight I see her as kind of an 8, but back then hormones added like 5 points to anything. After about three weeks, Nellie started dropping little signs that she was into me. Like, she picked up a spoon I dropped in the cafeteria while making eye contact. She sat at the same table as me and kept looking in my direction. I, as a stupid teenager, didn't realize these things until after I got home, and only then did I figure out that I needed to do something. She was less than a hundred yards away! Why hadn't she done stuff like this before? Was she nervous? In a move very unlike what I had been doing, I confronted Nellie about it by ringing her doorbell and asking to see her. I asked her if she felt anything for me. She said, among a multitude of ums and uhs, that she thought I was nice and cute. I asked if she wanted to go out (in the most beta way possible), and she said yeah. The next week we went to see Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which I really liked, but she wasn't so hot about. We discussed it at an In'N'Out afterwards, and that's when it happened. I finally had a girlfriend.\n\nFour weeks pass. The whole school knows, and we don't care. We're having the time of our lives right now, and Nellie and I couldn't be happier. We found out that we had so much in common that we were even discussing marriage in a couple years (reminder, we were both 14). One night, she and I were home alone. Her parents are out of town for a \"second honeymoon or some shit,\" and my dad was away on a business trip while my mom was running errands. We had been planning for this for a week. Our parents were very strong believers in boundaries, but our hormones overrode anything like that. It would happen in her bedroom, the lights would be off, and we'd bang until the cows come home (the cows in this case being my mother). I comfortably crossed the lawn holding two red roses in my hands, and rang the doorbell. She greeted me at the door, and we were up the stairs within fifteen seconds. We get into her room, she throws herself on the bed, and, in the most sensual voice I have ever heard, says \"I want you to do something to me.\" I, assuming the role of roleplayer, said \"and what is that, my love?\"\n\nAnd she said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd then I realized my girlfriend was fifty stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleolithic era. I said \"Dammit Monster! You won't get any damn tree fiddy from me!\" And shot it with my laser eyes. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418623807", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It has been implied and, in a few cases, flat out stated by some theists that the mere mention of atheism or even the acknowledgement of the existence of atheists is offensive. So, good luck trying not ruffle any feathers. \n\nThat said, I usually say something along the lines of, \"I am an atheist because I have neither seen nor heard any compelling reason to be a theist\".\n\nAdditionally;\n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nIf you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418655731", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

She would sing songs of their conquests, dance around proclaiming their brilliance, beat me with a stick to put the fear of the Raptor in me, smoked \"the grass where the great Raptor laid eggs\" she called it. Anywho, all those had a profound effect on me as I grew up to be a successful paleontologist. It started off when I was 10, I dug up my back yard and found my first bones, it was so exhilarating. Although the bad people came and took it away, and put a yellow ribbon around it. I assumed it was for me to cut, as an inauguration ceremony. But the shitty part was that my Uncle Charlie got all the credit on TV, he said it was a \"Hooker\" he had come across a long time ago. I have yet to learn about such a dinosaurian species, lucky uncle Charlie. I never got to cut that ribbon and I didn't see uncle Charlie again after that, I suppose they recruited him to some fancy Lab or something... lucky bastard Hahahah.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo yeah, I grew up to become a paleontologist. I would join the crew on amazing missions. We would dig deep and find bones sometimes. Each time i dug up the ground It would feel as though I am digging deeper into my own soul. Each time I would find a spine or a femur, it was like finding my own bones and putting it onto my body, slowly piecing it together so I can stand on my own feet. D^eep huh..\n\nThe one time I found a fully intact Velociraptor skull was the closest I got to making love. God damnit those were great days. But one day it all changed, as I was sleeping with my prized velociraptor head, it started to talk to me. It started to make a low humming sound at first. I immediately pulled my dick out and proceeded to talk back to it. It told me to come closer, i did. My heart was racing as I waited anxiously for what was to come, the secret to their extinction?? Some highly philosophical statement that would solve the worlds problem?? Meaning of life?? Whats there in the after life?? I came close when the words came out, piercing my heart with more questions and driving me to the brink of madness... \"I need about tree fiddy\". Thats when I realized that this velociraptor skull was actually 500 feet tall and was the skeletal remains of a loch ness monster from the Paleolithic era. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI left my profession after that and have still been looking for a way to help out the Raptor community. I would like nothing more than to join your elite team and try and help out to the best of my ability.

{"body": "It all started back in 2003. I had just started my accountancy degree and was in the 1st year of university. In the UK we have a \"freshers week\" where you get to meet other people and just generally jump feet first into your new environment! I'm not sure if it's the same for other places or if there are different names for them, anyways!, during this week I met her, let's call her Katie for this story.\n\n\n\nMe and a guy from my class make our way to this gathering with two backpacks full of alcohol, it's fair to say we were not going to resist the idea of getting drunk! We arrive and unload the drinks, and set about socialising and meeting all these other humanoids! It was amazing fun and I met many awesome people, everyone was enjoying themselves, which is why Katie stood out to me so much. She was alone on the couch with a can of beer in her hand. I had the idea that everyone should be enjoying themselves during fresher and wanted to make a point of getting Katie to smile and socialise!\n\n\n\nI approach her and speak with her for what felt like an eternity, she was well spoken, well versed and very smart! We spoke about all things and everything, from politics to our favourite types of cake. It's at this point that we get on to the subject of our classes. She was studying a business management course and one of the requirements was that she had to have passed 1st year of the accounting course if she wanted to continue with her degree. I asked which class she was in and lo and behold, she is in the exact same one as me! Now let's get this point straight, there was something about Katie, she wasn't like anyone else. She was unique, she had quite the shape and when she smiled, she would reveal the most beautiful set of teeth I have ever seen! Her jaw was sharp and she held herself well.\n\n\n\nI knew I liked Katie at this point and I wanted to get to know her so I invited her out for a coffee sometime and to my surprise, she accepted! Now this is when I realised that Katie was in to me. We met for coffee at a Starbucks in the town, she told me about her week and I know it's harsh but I was so taken back by her looks that I don't even think I paid attention during the whole conversation. We spoke about some of the assignments our lecturer had set for the week before we quickly veered into more interesting conversation. \n\n\n\nThree hours later and two cups of coffee we are still going strong, I suggest going to the local ice rink (I was trying to do something memorable and fun! Don't mock me!). She thinks it is a great idea and we head off to get a bus, all the while we are still chatting. Katie had been giving me weird looks all day, not weird as in weirded out, but more intimate than she has looked at me before if that makes sense. We get on the bus and I put my fare in and move aside for her to put hers in, this is where she gives me 'the look' and asked \"can I ask you something\", I replied with a very obvious yes and she said, \"can I have tree fiddy?\", it was at that point that I realised Katie was a 7 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. I replied with \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\".\n\n\n\nThat was the last time I ever saw Katie, some say she moved away and completed her degree at another university whilst other stories say she dropped out and became depressed. I don't think I'll ever see her again though!\n\n\n\nTL;DR Met a girl at a party, true love emerges from a coffee date and gets ruined by an ice rink.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418690137", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

In his first year he rescued the Lord Commander Joer Mormont from the wights sent to kill him in his sleep and in gratitude was given his ancestral valyrian steel sword Longclaw.\n\nHe would later rise to Lord Commander himself and make an alliance with the wildlings north of the wall to help man the dwindling Night's Watch and defend all men from the attacking Others. It was then that he was murdered by a group of his brothers who still saw the order as a protector of wildlings as it had for thousands of years after the Long Night, and not for what it needed to become again.\n\nKilled in cold blood only to be reborn as Jon Targaryen, with the help of Howland Reed, the only man alive that knew the secret of his parantage. He sent him to Winterfell to find the evidence hidden away in his mother's tomb, a royal wedding cloak and Rhaegar Targaryen's prized harp. With his new knowledge he turned back north to find the Others in the lands of always winter and slay them before the Long Night returned. \n\nHe took 5,000 men with him on his journey but only a third survived long enough to see the lands of always winter. When he at last reached the Heart of Winter and confronted the Night's King it smiled and opened it's frozen, unhuman mouth and said \"I need about tree fiddy\".

He started as a small dealer and through hard work and trust earning he slowly got closer and closer to the king pin. One time he was leaving a club and he was picked up just like you see in the movies, bag on head, tossed in a van the whole shebang. He knew he was fucked from the licence plate on the van was \"c mnstr\" which was short for the kingpin, Carlos \"The monster\" Chavez. He was scared the kingpin found out and he was going to be killed. He was then tossed in a room and tie to a chair and beat up a bit. After a few days of being fed shit food and getting smacked up he was untied and taken into another room, whats when he saw Carlos and some bodyguards. They pulled over garbage bags on the floor and Carlos put a gun in his mouth and said\n\n\"Are you going to be loyal to me\"\n\nHe nodded and Carlos screamed\n\n\"ARE YOU GOING TO BE FUCKING LOYAL TO ME\"\n\nCrying he nodded and Carlos holstered his gun and took off his leather jacket.

{"body": "So I was the kid in this story. \n\n\nWe moved into a new house when I was 5. My room was (and still is) on the second floor. \n\n\nI'm not sure when it started, but I started hearing these scratching sounds outside my window. At first I ignored them, but they were persistently happening, night after night. Every time I would sit up and investigate, nothing would be there. I told my dad about them but always got another explanation.\n\n\nThis continued for two weeks until I saw... something. I saw a snowy owl flying away one night. Each night afterwards, I kept seeing the owl. The thing was fast: Every time I tried to catch a glimpse of it it would just fly off for some fucking reason.\n\n\nAbout three weeks later, instead of just flying off, the owl perched on a tree in my backyard. By now mildly curious, I put shoes on and ran outside. The owl dove off the branch into another tree, this time in my front yard. This pattern went on for a while: I would sprint to the tree the owl had perched in, only for it to swoop to another. This continued for a good 15 minutes until we hit the woods at the edge of my neighborhood.\n\nOnce we hit the edge, the owl started flying in circles above me, then dove into the woods. A few seconds later, a figure in a dark trenchcoat strolled out of the woods, with the damned owl perched on its shoulder. I felt a chill in the air around me as the hair on the back of my neck began to stand.\n\n\"Why are you bothering me? What do you want?\" I asked desperately. For a month this owl had been bugging me, and clearly it was for some reason.\n\n\"*You have something I desire...*\" The figure slowly hissed. He took no haste in his speech.\n\n\"*You see...*\", he continued, \"*I need about tree fiddy.*\"\n\nAt that point he pulled back his hood, and I realized I was speaking to a 50 foot tall reptilian from the Paleolithic era!\n\n\"Go away Loch Ness Monster!\" I screamed. \"I ain't got no tree fiddy!\"\n\ntl;dr Snowy owls are fucking trolls.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418835345", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -33, "controversiality": 0}

While I've never seen aliens, I definitely believe they exist. Maybe not in the form that we've depicted them as for so long, but I definitely feel that they're out there. There was a time when the most brilliant people in the world believed that the Earth was a flat surface, and you could just sail off the edge. I find it incredibly small minded to think that with all the planets, and all the galaxies, and all the space that exists - there couldn't possibly be another life form. I also believe that mermaids, and the god damn loch ness monster could exist too. We haven't discovered even half of the water that fills up the world. We don't know whats down there. \n\nSome of you may view me a whack job, but that's my response. I respect all of your responses, and I am so fascinated by how your minds work. So please respect mine. I believe in everything. If you believe in something - it exists. I think the brain is such an amazing thing. \n\nDid you know that the brain can't create faces? Any face that you see in a dream or a mid-day fantasy is a person that you have in fact seen before. Maybe you just held the door open for them at a Wawa or something, but you've seen them. So isn't it possible that if you believe in something, it's because you've experienced something that proved it's existence. For example maybe the spirit of an angel touched you as a young child. You don't remember it, but for some reason you believe that there is something out there, you just feel it.

While they are strong they have not achieved this status because of their power but rather their elusiveness. Lugia being an excellent example of this.  Because of the anime we know there are others but they most likely dwell in deep ocean trenches where most Pokemon researchers have not yet been able to explore comfortably. \n \nOther Pokemon like mewtwo and genesect are known to exist and are deemed legendary because of the amount of power brought forth by the genetic alterations humans made to them. It's unheard of and unnatural for such things to happen in nature amongst the other Pokemon. \n\nI would also like to say there are some Pokemon that are legendary simply because they're considered deities in their respective regions. Under this umbrella would be Arceus, giratina, dialga, palkia, kyogre, groudon, and rayquaza. How did they become dieties?

This is an interpretation of the original [\"Shaggy God Story\"](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_God_story), which by definition is \"a science fiction genre characterized by an attempt to explain Biblical concepts with science fiction tropes.\" It is also characterized by revealing at the end of the story that the work of science fiction has biblical ties. It gets its name from [Shaggy Dog Stories](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_dog_story), which are extremely long-winded anecdotes characterized by extensive narration of generally irrelevant incidents and terminated by an anticlimax or a pointless punchline.

He was a really good looking guy, super talented violinist and a teenage heartthrob by all accounts.  \nAnyway he was one of my bros.  We watched football together, wrestled together in high school, were on the water polo team almost inseparable.  \nBy far one of the best friends I ever had.  \nOne day Greg and I were playing Halo 3 at his house, but he felt super tense the entire time.

{"body": "Sorry for the wall of text, this belongs in r/offmychest but now is as good of a time as any...\nSo there's four of us living in a two bedroom apartment- Matt, Mark, Jo (Mark's gf) and myself. Names changed obviously. Spacious enough and we have all been friends for years, so it works out.\nOver the last couple months we have been noticing things have been occasionally gone missing for a day or two then show back up.\nFirst it was Jos hair dryer. Then Marks gym bag. My Xbox controller. Matts thermos. Just weird random things.\nHaving a lot of close friends and a relatively open-door policy we just figured someone came in and moved the things out of convenience. Until my toothbrush went missing and never showed back up.\nWhat the fuck? My toothbrush?\nTo add to the strangeness, over the next month, everyone else's toothbrushes disappeared. One a week. Except Matts. How fucking convenient. So of course we blamed Matt for everything. He denied it all. Said it wasn't him. Suuuuure. We believe you.\nThings progressed as you think they would. Blame. Anger. Resentment. It was really putting a wedge in our relationships. Jo and Mark ended up calling it quits and he began suffering from severe migraines. Stress induced. But Jo \"couldn't\" move out. Fun times followed (/sarcasm).\nMark went to the doctor and got put on some anti-anxiety pills and things kinda chilled out until last week.\nIn a rare cease fire between Matt and me, we were watching the telly and Jo came in wondering where Marks laptop was (asking Matt, but not.  You know... How girls do...)\nMatt turns to her and says, \"I sold it. Sorry.\" Just says it. WHAT THE FUCK!?\nJo calls Mark. Mark comes home in a fit of rage and finally takes a swing at Matt. Fucking hard. But he misses. Matt didn't even dodge him, like he knew Mark wouldn't hit him. Blew my mind. After Mark realized there was nothing he could do to make this nightmare end, he curled up in a ball and started sobbing. Dude was a mess. He needed a good cry. We just all stood there not knowing what to do. Finally, Jo leaned in and asked if he needed anything. All he said was \"No there's nothing. Go away.\" Jo, now crying as well, said ,\"Please, let me get you something.\" He just turned and glared at all of us and started screaming \"GO AWAY! NONE OF YOU EXIST!

You want me to believe its russian vehicles firing at Ukraine just because NATO said so? Since when NATO became a reliable source of information? They will say its Loch Ness monster on the picture if it suits them.\n\n2. There is alot of blatant lying going on about about missing and dead russian soldiers that fell in Ukraine. Info about this usually comes from people like Elena Vasilieva that was cought lying numerous times but ukrainian and western media just keeps quoting her and you keep adding this bullshit to \"undeniable proofs\".\nWatch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoAJv_Ct3RQ\nAnd then this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcBEEnKSjJY\nAnd you get the idea where all this \"hundreds of russian soldiers missing\" stuff coming from.\n\n3. Captured Pskov desantniks. I saw this many times already. Yes they are russian soldiers. Yes they were captured in Ukraine. But lets check other facts. They were arrested just near russian border. They didnt resist. They never shot a bullet. They said on press-conference they never had any military tasks in Ukraine. They were let go without any questions after press conference.\nIt was ONE incident. ONE. There were never captured any russian soldiers during real fights. How you can explain it?\n\n4. What about Girkin? He was clear volunteer there. First weeks in Slavyansk he was almost daily beggin Putin for help. He was crying how they lack ammunition, severely outnumbered, he was criticising Putin and again begging Russia for help. That doesnt look like official russian soldier completing Kremlin orders.\n\nSo none of what you gave is an evidence. And sorry, but I dont buy it, that in EIGHT months nobody ever filmed russian army in Ukraine considering that there supposed to be thousands of them. Ukraine also never captured a single russian soldier except those poor pskov guys. They never provided a picture of any DEAD russian soldier. Its not possible during war. \n\nWhat happens is simple really. SBU and ATO press center just made up this fairy tale about russian army invasion to excuse their war failures and get help from the west (because HEY! Russia invaded us!!). Who they are fighting in reality? 90% donbass citizens and 10% russian/chechen/other country volunteers who have nothing to do with Kremlin. Why so many american and european news sites screaming about russian invasion? Because noone ever sends journalists to Donbass to learn what the hell is going on.

{"body": "Oh man do I ever. \n \nSo I've had to wear glasses since I was about 10-years old. Big ol' coke-bottle lenses. When I got into high school I got contacts, but basically I haven't been able to see without some sort of aid for about 20 years. People who don't have to wear glasses/contacts don't know the annoyance of being fucking blind any time you lose your glasses or a contact falls out because you were napping and you get that weird headachey half-blurry half-clear vision. \n \n \nSo anyway I'd been waiting for a long time to have both the money for the procedure, and for my eyesight to stabilize. I'd been working for a small engineering firm that does range safety work for Wallops Flight Facility. Fun stuff. I know people think \"Safety engineering, that's boring as fuck.\" But it's not bad when you're working with rockets possibly killing a bunch of people in Richmond. Not that we'd let that happen or anything. \n \nAnyway I'd been doing well and I got a pretty hefty Christmas bonus. And after I'd wasted a bunch of Christmas gifts for the family and some frivolous shit for myself I still had a bunch left over. I was planning on putting in savings or investing it, but on the commute home one day I heard this ad for \"Fast and easy LASIK performed by Dr. SoAndSo, the best in his field. And if you mention you heard this advertisement you can get 10% off your procedure.\" Then it hit me, fuck yeah, it's LASIK time.  \n\n \nAnyway I get in contact with the \"Laser Eye Center of Podunk Central\" and we get some shit hashed out. My insurance won't cover \"elective cosmetic surgery\" but that's alright because I've got cash to burn. They can schedule me in for an initial checkup the next day and then the procedure a couple weeks later blah blah blah. \n\nSo I go in for the initial checkup, and it's in a strip mall. Not like a classy one either. It was between a Food Lion and a WE BUY GOLD place. But whatever, I'm getting LASIK. So I go in, and it's not too bad. Clean looking at least. The ophthalmologist is personable and seems to know what he's doing. Which is good. So I get checked out and set a date with the receptionist to come back and get the real thing.\n  \nSo for a week I'm really excited. I get everything set. I've got someone to drive me home, I've got some books on CD to listen to, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time. The day rolls around and I go back to my shitty strip-mall and what do you know? Different doctor. Some guy who went to school in Jamaica and has terrible hygiene. I ask him where doctor Knows-what-he's-doing is and he tells me he's out that day and that he, Doctor RipeSmell, will be handling my surgery. Well...that's disconcerting. But they wouldn't just let someone unqualified do my surgery? This guy is sill an ophthalmologist.  \n\nSo I forgot to mention that I opted for general anesthesia as opposed to local anesthesia. They tried to convince me to go the other route, but I'll be fucked if I'm gonna pay good money to be awake while some person cuts up my eye. \n \nI wake up after the procedure, and I can't see anything. And my eyes are *burning*. Like habaneros dipped in lemon juice and applied liberally to your eyeballs burning. That is definitely not supposed to happen. So I pretty much scream at the doctor \"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY EYES!\" \n\nHe tells me it'll be okay. He puts some eyedrops in my eyes that feel like cold Jello and the burning goes away. He tells me there was a complication with the surgery and he's gonna need me to do some things over the coming weeks. First he tells me I'm gonna need to put these viscous-as-fuck eyedrops in my eyeballs every 4 hours for the next three weeks. Even at night time. And then he kinda shifts uncomfortably and says \"And there's one more thing I need you to do.\" So I ask him what he needs. He replies \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time I realized my ophthalmologist was a 500 foot tall crustacean from the Mesozoic era! Godammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy.\n \nEventually my sight normalized to an extent, but I still needed glasses, and I couldn't have the procedure done again due to the scar tissue that'd built up in my eyes. So I ended up right where I started, but with eyeball scars and a lot less money.\n\n\n**TL;DR: Don't get eye surgery in the strip mall next to the Food Lion.

{"body": "Zomg, Christmas came early!  /u/boobiesiheart was an *amazingly* generous gal, and ordered me a Screw Cakes shirt - and I got it yesterday! I LOVE IT!!  It's a bit tight (I know I flubbed my measurements), but that only pushes me to continue to lose! I gotta get back on the exercise train in the new year - my only excuse has been laziness in not wanting to swap between jeans and shorts for my walking.  And that's one hell of a poor excuse. :(  This year is coming to about 40lb lost, and while it's impressive, I *know* I could have and should have done more.  A non-keto friend of mine started the same time I did with the same weight, but is down to 165lb.. and of course the lovely /u/TineCiel's success has me happy but still green with envy. :) I have noone to blame except myself, though.\n\nI'm still in full PMS-swing mode, with sore boobs and back up at 185ish - someone help me do the water weight flush dance!

And then I put it into a 8x8 pan with bacon layered on top, 45 minutes at tree fitty farenheit. So. Delicious.

{"body": "So the first time I met Eris, I wasn't sure what to think of her.  Something about her seemed somewhat suspicious considering she was babbling on about things and telling me to do some of the most ridiculous tasks, but I decided that for the good of the universe, I should at least investigate what she wanted me to do.\n\nShe first sent me all over the strangest places on Earth in order to kill some overpowered Knights and Ogres, which wasn't that big of a deal to me at this point considering I had already done that many times in the past.  Next she sent me to the moon and told me to shoot a giant crystal, claiming it would stop Crota from forming.  So I destroyed this crystal and the very next thing she does is send me to hell to fight Crota.\n\nCrota?  She had just told me that by shooting the crystal, Crota wasn't going to come out.  But again, being the good Samaritan that I am, I decided to brave this task at hand.  I descended down to the deepest place in the universe and I have to say, she was right.  There he was, Crota.\n\nCrota was the most difficult task that I had ever faced at this point, and for good reasons too.  I couldn't even hurt the guy at all with my guns, it took more than that.  Me and my brave men were able to use swords to drain this guy's life energy bit by bit until finally, Crota disintegrated into thin air.  We had done it!\n\nI couldn't wait to tell Eris what I was able to do.  I knew that not only did I save the universe, but this strange lady would finally be at ease and would be the proudest being in the universe.  I walked up to her, and I was right.  Eris was thrilled with what I accomplished and told me she could finally rest easy.  But before I left, she asked me to come back.  She said \"I need one more thing.\"  I asked \"What do you need?\"  She said:\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time that I realized that this Eris lady was actually 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.

{"body": "Earlier this week a beautiful woman replied to a craigslist post about seeking another woman for a threesome. My boyfriend quickly arraigned a date and she agreed. I had a long talk with her on the phone on Tuesday night. Thursday night was date night. We went to get Mexican food and drinks. She was fun, bubbly, open and gorgeous in person. She and I hit it off right away, so much so that I was worried that maybe she was only into me and not my boyfriend. \n\nMy fears about this peaked when she asked me to go to the bathroom with her and kissed me in the lobby. When we returned to the table she happily agreed to come home with us. We all kissed and cuddled and got down to business. She was mostly the center of attention in bed. I used a strap-on and my boyfriend and I took turns going down on her penetrating her, and driving her wild. She used a strap on on me and we gave her a very intense orgasm in the end as I pinched her nipples. She was shaking and moaning. It was awesome. I still can't believe how beautiful she was and her attitude was even sexier. \n\nPart of the original agreement was that she wanted to watch or participate in pegging my boyfriend. She'd never done anything like it but she wanted to check it out. She just watched but she thought it was hot. Amazed at how well he could take it. We all exchanged pleasantries and kissed goodbye. After she was gone my boyfriend gave me my own earth shattering orgasm. The threesome was way more successful and less work that we've had in the past.

{"body": "Yes, unfortunately.\n\nAbout 7-8 years ago, I had finally saved up enough money for a used car. I asked my dad to come along with me, as he worked for a jiffy lube and knows his way around cars, and was generally a no bullshit kind of guy. We agreed to go to a Honda dealership on a weekend.\n\nDuring the week leading up to the trip to the dealership, I felt a strange sense of dread all day. At night I had bizarre dreams in which I felt like I was being pursued by something, but I wasn't sure what it was. Every time I woke up from one of those dream I felt like I hadn’t slept at all. On the night before I went to the dealership, I dreamt that I turned around and saw what was chasing me. It was a mysterious, shadowy figure, with glowing red eyes. I heard a ringing sound, and then woke up. The ringing continued, but I realized it was just my doorbell.\n\nAs me and my dad drove to the dealership, my dad noticed how tired I looked, and asked if I was ok to drive. I brushed it off, but I made sure to take advantage of the free coffee they had at the dealership.\n\nAfter I had my coffee, I discovered a blue 2008 Honda S200 that was just inside my price range. Seemingly out of nowhere a friendly salesman asked if I wanted a test drive. I asked if he would let me test it on the freeway, and he said yes.\n\nSo, I took the car out for a spin, with the salesman in the passenger seat, and my dad in the back. The freeway was pretty packed, but traffic still moved pretty quickly. I got stuck behind a truck that was transporting a bunch of Mercedes, and the lanes to my left and right were too crowded to change into.  The coffee didn't really seem to do anything, and I dozed off for a second, but was awakened after feeling my dad’s hands on my shoulder, and the salesman screaming \"Watch out!\"  A car had fallen off the truck, and was heading right for us. I quickly tried to turn, but the car hit us head on. I blacked out on impact.\n\nI awoke to find myself lying in the middle of the road. I couldn't fell any of my arms and legs. The air was thick with smoke. I craned my neck and saw the salesman lying on the pavement, with brains and blood oozing out of his nose, ears, and mouth. I looked around for my dad, but couldn't see him. I cried out for him, but there was no answer.\n\nSuddenly, the mysterious figure from my dreams towered over me, and stared at me with its glowing red eyes. Then, with a voice as deep and dark as the ocean, it said....  \n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time that I noticed that this shadowy figure was 8 stories tale and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Ok, this story may ramble a little but because I have never told it before, so I'm warning you about it now. I am not going to give names because it gives away too much personal information.\n\nThere was a girl who went to high school with me. She was a junior when I was a senior and it was always apparent that her family never had much money. Her brother was a couple years older than me, and he was supposedly running a meth lab with her dad in the trailer outside of their house. This is all in rural Indiana, so it never presented much of an issue to neighbors or anything.\n\nThe girl always say by herself at lunch and one day I noticed that she seemed really upset. I got along with almost everybody at my school so I decided to sit down and see if I could help in some way.\n\nIt turns out that the night before, her dad was high and pulled a gun on her and her mom. I was in shock. I didn't really know what to do, so I tried to get her to tell somebody in the guidance office about it so they could help her. She refused, but she did agree to take my number so that she could call me if there was ever another emergency and she needed help.\n\nA few weeks later I got a call at like 3:00 am and I could immediately tell that something was wrong. She was bawling and finally told me that she got kicked out of the vehicle by her brother so he could go to some \"business meeting\" and she asked if I could come get her.\n\nMy parents have always been pretty charitable and understanding, so I told them what was going on and I went to pick her up. We set her up on the couch overnight and I took her to school the next day. My parents made sure that she knew that she was welcome anytime she needed a place to stay.\n\nOver the next couple months she crashed at my place about once or twice a week and we started spending a lot of time together. I learned that she hated her life at home, and I really couldn't blame her. As we got to know each other better, I found that she was nothing like the rest of her family. She was an amazing artist and singer and we talked about her options for art school and such often. I finally realized that I wasn't interested in her because of trying to be charitable like my parents, but because I was in love with her.\n\nI finally told her about how I felt and we started dating. It was by far the best relationship I have ever had. She was now staying with me three or four times a week and was slowly drifting away from her drug-riddled home life. I couldn't be happier. She even started talking to me about applying to the art school at the university I was got accepted to and it seemed like everything was going to work out for us.\n\nThen I got the call. It was the night before a basketball game and the whole team had gone out for pizza for some team bonding. I saw my mom on the caller ID and as soon as I picked up I could hear her crying. She told me that my girlfriend was in the hospital and it wasn't looking good for her. I was panicking. My buddy on the team overheard my mom and told me he would drive me to the hospital so we took off.\n\nI was in the waiting room for what felt like an eternity. Two hours after we got there, the doctor came out and told me that she was going to make it, but it would be a few weeks before she would be strong enough to leave. He did let me in to see her, and she looked terrible. She had gashes on her arms and hands, and gauze covering up what I learned was a 2\" deep stab wound in her abdomen. She rested for a while and finally told me that it was her dad again. He and her brother were testing out a new batch and got violent. She had jumped in front of her mom to protect her and got the worst of it.\n\nI called her phone later that night and her mom answered. She told me that she was scared of something like that happening again and that she wanted her daughter to live with me and my parents permanently. She had a long conversation with my parents that night and they agreed that it would be for the best.\n\nThe day after she came home from the hospital, we took her to her house to get all of her stuff to come and live with me. Her dad was clearly not happy about it, so after we got her packed up and safely into the car, my dad and I went to have a little chat with him.\n\nHe tried explaining to us how it was some all big accident and that he wasn't really responsible for it, it was just a bad batch.

Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn anymore; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence. **Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?**\n\n2. Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots. **Would you attempt to do this?**\n\n3. Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical. **Which option do you select?**\n\n4. You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Credence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it’s being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it’s being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a Capella (but it will only sound this way to you). **Would you swallow the pill?**\n\n5. At long last, someone invents \"the dream VCR.\" This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR. **Would you still do this?**\n\n6. Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week. **You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?**\n\n7. You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson's gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film's \"deeper philosophy.\" **Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?**\n\n8. A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commercial success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man). **Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likelihood of you reading this book?**\n\n9. You are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that--somewhere--your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill. **Would you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie?**\n\n10. You meet a wizard. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, \"I will now make them a dollar more attractive.\" He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But--somehow--this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can't deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though--you can only pay him once. You can't keep giving him money until you're satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front. **How much cash do you give the wizard?**\n\n11. For reasons that cannot be explained, cats can suddenly read at a twelfth-grade level. They can't talk and they can't write, but they can read silently and understand the text. Many cats love this new skill, because they now have something to do all day while they lay around the house; however, a few cats become depressed, because reading forces them to realize the limitations of their existence (not to mention the utter frustration of being unable to express themselves). **This being the case, do you think the average cat would enjoy Garfield, or would cats find this cartoon to be an insulting caricature?**\n\n12. You have a brain tumor. Though there is no discomfort at the moment, this tumor would unquestionably kill you in six months. However, your life can (and will) be saved by an operation; the only downside is that there will be a brutal incision to your frontal lobe. After the surgery, you will be significantly less intelligent. You will still be a fully functioning adult, but you will be less logical, you will have a terrible memory, and you will have little ability to understand complex concepts or difficult ideas. The surgery is in two weeks. **How do you spend the next fourteen days?**\n\n13. You have won a prize. The prize has two options, and you can choose either (but not both). The first option is a year in Europe with a monthly stipend of $2,000. The second option is ten minutes on the moon. **Which option do you select?**\n\n14. Your best friend is taking a nap on the floor of your living room. Suddenly, you are faced with a bizarre existential problem: This friend is going to die unless you kick them (as hard as you can) in the rib cage. If you don’t kick them while they slumber, they will never wake up. However, you can never explain this to your friend; if you later inform them that you did this to save their life, they will also die from that. So you have to kick a sleeping friend in the ribs, and you can’t tell them why. **Since you cannot tell your friend the truth, what excuse will you fabricate to explain this (seemingly inexplicable) attack?**\n\n15. For whatever the reason, two unauthorized movies are made about your life. The first is an independently released documentary, primarily comprised of interviews with people who know you and bootleg footage from your actual life. Critics are describing the documentary as “brutally honest and relentlessly fair.” Meanwhile, Columbia Tri-Star has produced a big-budget biopic of your life, casting major Hollywood stars as you and all your acquaintances; though the movie is based on actual events, screenwriters have taken some liberties with the facts. Critics are split on the artistic merits of this fictionalized account, but audiences love it. **Which film would you be most interested in seeing?**\n\nEdit: For those wondering, these questions are a subset of Chuck Klosterman's [Hypertheticals](http://www.amazon.com/HYPERtheticals-50-Questions-Insane-Conversations/dp/0307587924).

If for no other reason, then because landing 3 pills back to back is *incredibly* satisfying, I swear I have a conditioned dopamine response to the sound of dings.\n\nTide: I thought having the Claidheamh Mor would mostly mitigate the nerf, but I underestimated just how bad the \"charge meter reduced with damage taken\" thing is. Charging is horribly unreliable now unless you have the drop on them. I was very much used to being able to push through defenses for a charge pick, but now it seems like every charge stops 5 feet short of the target with me as a completely ineffective sitting duck, soon to be turned into a whole pile of floating ducks. I don't know if that'll be avoidable once I adjust to the change, but this might lead me to equip - *gasp* - a sticky launcher.\n\nClaidheamh Mor: When I wasn't stopped in my tracks by a single rocket, I really appreciated the extra range from this. The full charge return is only a part of the buff to this weapon, it also got an indirect buff in that sometimes it's the only reason you're able to go the full distance to your target if you take damage along the way.

{"body": "These questions are fun as hell, and I have a couple of essays to procrastinate on, so here goes my answers with accompanying reasons.\n\n1. No. Intrinsic abilities are meaningless without application. Magic boy is certainly a more interesting subject of study, though.\n2. I have no doubt that I do not have the strength or endurance to kill a Clydesdale with 20 minutes worth of kicks but I'd probably give it a shot.\n3. Hitler's skull. For two reasons: fuck turtles/pets, and I'd like to own the greatest conversation piece known to man. Imagine the absurd stories I could invent when asked why I have Hitler's skull on my mantle.\n4. No way. Alice in Chains is terrible. Music is beautiful. Selfish? Unquestionably, but I'm comfortable with it.\n5. Yes. My dreams are rarely sexual or disgusting anyway (to my knowledge), and I think this would be sufficiently interesting to offset any awkwardness. It would certainly give rise to a new degree of honesty in my life. If this were available to everyone, then this would quickly become normative probably, and if this option is only presented to me, then how could I possibly pass up on this opportunity to gain knowledge about myself that no other human has ever had?\n6. I'd make the cover story about the president's operation. Nessie and Sasquatch would simply have to rest below the fold.\n7. Disclaimer: I have no idea what Dark Crystal is. Based on your description, though, this sounds like it makes this woman crippled socially and generally strange. There are other fish in the sea. No marriage.\n8. Does not affect. Would not read it due to the middling reviews. The additional knowledge does not affect my desire to read it because I would have reached the conclusion to not read it without this additional information. For the sake of argument -- had I initially wanted to read the book, I suppose that this would increase my desire to read it. No, I don't want to be gay. I just think the risk would be entertaining.\n9. I sit still and finish the damned movie. Leaving twenty minutes before the end isn't going to make my mother come back to life if she's dead, and if nothing's happened there's similarly no point in leaving.\n10. In my current financial state? Probably $1k. Background: college student with reasonable amount of savings for his age. I'm not incredibly attractive, but I suppose I'm attractive enough. The statistics relating physical attractiveness and success/perception indicate a strong, positive correlation, so I'd consider it an investment in my future. \n11. This is a tough one. I suppose since the average human enjoys negative caricatures of him- or herself, the average cat probably would as well. Supposing human IQ levels and the capacity to understand Garfield fully.\n12. Shit. If I were going to be an evasive little shit like OP, I'd probably say I'd delay the tumor removal and try to get an easy, high-paying job in the interim. However, that's boring as fuck. Since I'd have to drop out of college or at least transfer to a lesser institution, I'd figure out how to successfully deal drugs over the next two weeks and write an in-depth, foolproof guide on how to deal for my future moron self. I'd enclose it in an envelope labelled \"ONLY OPEN IF YOU'RE BROKE WITH NO HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.\" Also enclosed would be a key and safety deposit box number holding sufficient cash to start a drug dealing operation. Probably also a handgun and passports and birth certificates for a few other identities in case things go sour. The rest of my time would be spent devising a method in which I could cheat successfully in college, so that I could possibly have a licit, successful future. I'd explain the situation to my friends and probably just take a class with each of them and pay them to do my work. Lord knows what I'd do for exams, but surely over the course of two weeks I could figure something out. Greater feats have been accomplished.\n13. Probably the moon. It sounds more exciting, and realistically I can already go to Europe if I want to. And likely I'd be the guest of the entire gamut of talk shows and web series: \"The Boy who Spent 10 Minutes on the Moon\" Don't worry; I'll work on the title.\n14. First of all, I'd like to correct OP. You are fifteen years old. You do not kick hard enough to kill someone by kicking them in the ribs with all your strength, particularly with medical intervention. Second, I'd probably tell them, \"If I told you, you'd have to die.\" And they'd say, \"You messed up the quote. It's suppo-\" I interrupt. \"I'm afraid I wasn't quoting anything.\" Engage creepy stare and walk out the room.\n15. The former. I'd love a closer-to-objective view of my life.

You can't play with term definitions in order to shoehorn your god into existence.\n\nIf you want to claim morals and virtues come from a god, you have to then first prove the existence of a god.

{"body": "I was in a long-term relationship with a young lady named Kate.  I became very good friends with Kate's family, but in particular I got along well with her younger sister, Edith.  Kate was a year older than me, but her sister, Edith was the same age.  Not that a year made much difference, but I think it gave Edith and I enough in common that we got along really well.\n\nAt first we would hang out when Kate was otherwise busy, and we developed a great platonic relationship.  I had zero attraction to her physically and romantically.  We'd watch Netflix, go for a pint with friends, catch a flick...whatever friends normally do.  Then one day we were shopping together and I was waiting for her outside the change room. It was one of those ones with a curtain to pull across instead of a door.  There were three change rooms in a row with a large mirror at the end of the hall.  The way the mirror was angled, I accidentally caught her nearly naked reflection in the mirror.  I saw side-boob and I was a changed man.\n\nWell, that was the turning point on our platonic relationship.  I couldn't be around her without checking out the way her clothing draped over her body, or the way her breasts seem to tug at the buttons of her blouse.  Eventually I struggled to make eye contact with her, partially out of guilt but mostly because I couldn't keep my eyes off her body.\n\nI was seriously confused.  Was I in love with her?  How did this platonic friendship suddenly become all-consuming lust? I was deeply in love with Kate but lusted after her sister.  At first, I tried to handle the problem by avoiding Edith.  I'd make up excuses to avoid hanging out, but with such a close family it became nearly impossible to avoid her.  Every time I'd see her, the lust was rekindled.\n\nEventually she picked up on the fact that I was avoiding her and she brought it up,in conversation.  I don't know if I was hoping for some cathartic cleansing or subconsciously I was hoping to gain her interest, but I came clean with her and explained exactly how I felt.  I expected she would laugh it off but instead she confessed that although she didn't think we were couple material, she had lusted after me.  In fact, she explained that she used to love shopping with me because she found it a turn on knowing she was nearly naked with only a curtain separating us.\n\nNot knowing how to handle this newfound mutual attraction, we arranged to meet for coffee at the Starbucks at the mall to discuss how to handle it.  I think secretly I was hoping to stoke the flame, but she quickly shut that down.  We agreed to spend less time together and to try to avoid situations that would lead to sexual tension\n\nThen it happened.  We left the Starbucks and were walking through the mall when she saw something on a mannequin that she had to take a closer look at.  She asked the clerk to try it on and went to the change room. I waited outside, but then something came over me and I slipped past the curtain into the change room with her.  I was weak, she was willing, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nWell, we continued our little charade, sneaking off for quickies at family functions, longer sessions when our significant others were out, etc.  We'd often be in the same room with family, sexting back and forth to build the anticipation until we could slip into a nearby closet or bathroom to do the deed.  We became bolder and bolder.\n\nThen the predictable happened.  The sisters had the same phones and somehow got them mixed up at thanksgiving dinner.  There, in painfully obvious text, was all the evidence Kate needed that I was not a faithful man.  She dumped me on the spot and that ended my relationship with her wonderful family. It also ended my relationship with her sister, Edith. I called a taxi and left with my head hung low.\n\nI learned a powerful lesson that day; you can't have your Kate and Edith too.\n\nOh, and the cab fare came to about tree fiddy.\n\nEdit: spelling, typos, grammar\nEdit 2: Thanks for the gold, stranger.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1419392356", "subreddit": "tifu", "score": 148, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I went to Europe in the summer of 2008 with some people and teachers from my high school on one of those EF tours with the bright orange back ups. If you've ever gone on an EF tour then you know that backpack, it screams \"I'm a tourist\". Anyway,  we're about half way through the trip and we're in Venice, Italy. We had 4 or so hours to go off on our own and explore the city and so my friends and I go do some exploring. They found a museum they wanted to go to, but my grandma (whom had given me a good portion of the money to go on this trip) really wanted rosary beads from a specific church in Venice. So I go off, alone, to find this church and these rosary beads. It doesn't take long before I realize I'm lost. I have a map but it's in Italian and I don't know which way is north. The moment when I realized I was in deep shit was when two thugs selling knock-off designer handbags started following me. The part of the city I found myself in was suddenly less touristy and there was graffiti and other signs I was not in a good part of town. And this is where that fucking back pack comes in, it's bright fucking orange and practically screams \"I'M LOST COME TAKE ALL MY MONEY!\" Then I could feel someone right behind me. I turn around and it was one of the men who was following me. He asked me if I was lost, I lied and told him I wasn't but he knew I was lying. I began furiously thinking about how I was going to get out of this situation and decided that maybe if I bought one of his handbags, knowing he'd over charge me, maybe he wouldn't take all my belongings and I could ask for directions. So I ask him how much for a handbag and he says \"about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about this time that I notice this street thug was actually  three stories tall and a crustation from the paleolithic era. I said \"God damn Loch Ness monster! I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" I ran away and somehow found my way back to my group.

When I turned the light on and inspected this package it looked more like someone melted down some blue candies into the rough shape of pills but FAR too small. I *demand* this motherfucker return my money and what does he doing? He \"calls\" the guy he got them from them and bitching about something being wrong and the pills are all wet and fucked up...This little whigger doesn't know what's about to fucking hit him if he doesn't hand that money back over and quit trying to bullshit me and pretend like the $60 I *just* handed his fucking ass just disappeared because \"he got ripped off too!\"...That's not how this works, that's not how any of this works! I'm getting real fed up at that point and have to make my intentions a bit more clear, that I'm getting that money back and he can have that jacked up blue pellet bullshit because he's not gonna treat me like some fucking mark....He hands it over reluctantly...but that wasn't enough for me, I was done with his shit so I just told him how it was gonna be. \"Bitch, I'm gonna need another tree fiddy!\"...it was about that time he realized I was five hundred feet tall and from the Paleolithic era..he just needed a little convincing that I wasn't leaving without it.

{"body": "&gt; Why do you think it is...what is the explanation...for why we tend to find things (like Lego pieces) when we stop looking for them?\nI'd say it's because we've started looking at all the pieces in a new way. \n\nWhat's your data to suggest that this accounts for all instances of this situation?\n\n&gt; And I'd say for that reason it's a good analogy...because I think that sometimes, when people say they've been looking really hard for God and haven't found Him, they need a fresh way of looking. And I think maybe that can start by not looking.\n\nExactly, start with the conclusion and work backwards. Except that's not the methodology we use for determining the validity of claims, especially supernatural ones. Let me put it this way, why do you remain unconvinced of the existence of Vishnu, or Allah? The same things that you use to reject those gods could be used to reject your god. \n\n&gt; But the point really is that OP asked what he could do to avoid hell. And I tried to give him practical things that he, as an atheist, might start to \"do\" with that aim in mind with the aim that if he started to act as though there were a God, he might come by that route to the knowledge of God, rather than by the route of intellectual inquiry.\n\nBut how does that address the issue of whether or not god even exists? Sure if you pretend he exists long enough maybe you will start to believe it, but you still haven't established that he actually exists. \n\n&gt; Intellectual inquiry has its place, but it isn't everything. Sometimes you need to take a step back and get a different view of the situation before starting in on the intellectual inquiry again.\n\nI leave you with this question. How do we determine what is real and what is not. What is true and what is false? Why is it that the same methodology that leaves you unconvinced of UFO abductions, Bigfoot, the loch ness monster, Santa Claus, Vishnu, Allah, Buddha, or the literally thousands of other gods or supernatural beings people claim exist today should not be used on your god?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419484913", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I was 16 at the time of this and there's not much to do in a small town except cause havoc. It was probably about 2 in the morning and we'd been drinking at a mates place out of town when we decided we were hungry as Fuck and needed snacks. Like desperately. So with us all underage and drunk driving was a no go so next best thing was horses! Now it seems like a silly thing but drunk us were like Fuck yeah can't get dui on a horse. First mistake. So we actually get to town no troubles (half an hour ride so I'm amazed we made it) and ride into maccas. Fuck yeah drive through on a horse,everyone will think it's hilarious! We trot on up to the order window and start drunkenly yelling our orders when we here \"wait are you on a horse? Greg these blokes are on a horse! Do I serve them?\" Turns out horses are allowed to be served, we order and get our stuff and trot round the corner to see two coppers walking out the restaurant. They immediately ask us what the Fuck were doing and my stupid mate (who was 17) said that we'd been drinking so we decided to ride. Mistake 2. Coppers checked our ID did us for drink driving and underage intoxication in a public place. We got thrown in the paddy wagon and taken back to the station. The check in attendant told us that it'll all be cleared up and it's just a fee of $3.50. That's when I realised the check in attendant was the loch Ness monster and promptly told him \"he ain't getting no dam tree fiddy!\"\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419492842", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It, or whoever is morphing this shape of a conversation, definitely has a life of its own. I am convinced that this Self is not just a figment of my imagination, it is much, much grander and magnificent than I. Perhaps, this Self that is within me, and probably within all of us, is… God?\n\n“I am not God. I am your Self. But I am to bring you to God.”\n\nYes. Yes. This entity can definitely read my mind. I concluded, still mesmerized by this ever evolving shape which all the mandalas I have gazed upon in my previous life seem to be a projection of.\n\n“But before I can present you to God, I need one little thing… I need about tree fiddy.”\n\nNoooo… I cannot possibly have interpreted that one correctly.

{"body": "**TL;DR: The internet is a very scary place for young girls and you should be insanely careful about what you post on reddit and anywhere else.**\n\nI have never posted nude pics online but I have an incredibly disturbing story to tell about a girl who posted to /r/gonewild that I recognized. I have been thinking hard lately about whether or not I ever want to share this story with reddit and this seems like a pretty good thread to share it in. For all of you /r/gonewild girls out there and those of you who have thought about posting nude photos of yourself, let this serve as a cautionary tale...\n\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\n\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\n\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was. \n\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to /r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was *insanely* open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about. \n\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her /r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\" \n\n\nNot only did I walk away without any extortion money, I didn't get any new nudes from her which is what I was holding out for more than anything else. The only good thing about the failed sextortion deal is that she never contacted the FBI which works out perfectly for me because if she did, I wouldn't have been able to share this cautionary tale with all of you wannabe /r/gonewild gals out there. I was seriously bummed about not getting any more exclusive jerk-off material from this bodacious babe but c'est la vie no smoking hot gonewild noodz 4 me :(", "gilded": 6, "created_utc": "1419552316", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2305, "controversiality": 0}

It was red, plain, lacking any notable features aside from a gleaming yellow dot sticking to the center like pancake batter to the grit. I pulled it out further, seting and swaying it in my arms as though I had just heaved a flour sack.\n\n\"Mom.\" She, the daughter, said. \"When are we going home? I don't think we have time for this.\" What a fool. What a genuine fool.\n\n\"Time,\" I stated \"is a currency is just any other; dollars, pounds, or whatever sort of 'yin' thing it was that your father'a country of origin uses.

She looked absently at her feet, tugging at her tiny overalls and doing other mindless things children do. \"My lips hurt.\" She said.\n\n\"Yeah? Grab a chapstick from my purse then\" I was fixated on the book, which shot out that dusty aura that informed to what ever mythical contents it might contain. Rustic curries, forgotten forms of french delacies, the like. The girl absently rooted around in pack before pulling something out, she was in the side of my vision, and to be honest I wasn't paying her much mind. But if I had known,  god if I had known what my lack of attention would have brought,  I would have dropped that book in the dust and rot and bolted after her. God if I had only known \"Did you find it?\" I asked. Ignorant. Ignorant and stupid.\n\n\"Yeah\" she replied,  so genuine,  so naive. \"I'll be in the bean bag zone.\" This was followed by a gargle, an oily slurp of a sound like bacon stiking the oil. I turned around to see her, oh god her face, caked with reddish cherry oil, she sat against the book case deafeted.\n\n\"Lin!\" I shouted, cradling her in my arms.

{"body": "That isn't freaking out. I had a chance to see the little guys the other day with some guy who was trained to handle them (whatever that means). So this guy, and I kid you not he looked like crocodile dundee, was explaining that the arched posture like the one the photo is used for many emotions, not just surprise. Before I go further I should mention that there was this annoying hot blonde girl too because she becomes important to the story soon. She was wearing an american flag tank top and strutted around like she was superior to everyone else there. Of course we all ignored that. But anyways, 'Crocodile Dundee is telling us that \"the animal is really kind\" and that it is just a 'bit jumpy' so we weren't allowed to touch her. A lot of the kids around whined a little because they wanted to. Maybe their parents promised them they could or something. Well one person decides they will anyways. You guessed it, this is where 'Merica top comes into play. The whole time she was yapping about how cute the thing was and while I agree it was, this was incessant and bothersome. She starts to make her move, edging closer to the wildlife manager. I actually remember noticing her do this for some weird reason, but I just passed it off as her going in for a closer look. At this point she is pretty much breathing down the guy's neck, but he's kinda busy holding a living thing so he just shifts around awkwardly. Blondie reaches out and the poor little bugger arches just like in the picture and makes this crazy noise. Somehow it makes it out of the man's hands (shame on you Dundee) and onto the girl's chest. This is where the story gets rather unbelievable. Something inside me clicked. Maybe it was a hot girl in trouble, maybe it was pity, maybe It was my Emergency Medical Training kicking in. The scene was not safe but screw it, I dove at her. Somehow I managed to extricate her from the situation. Me and another guy hurried her off to the side so that we can be sure she's ok while the 'Trained Man' checks on the animal (none of this was the animals fault). So being kinda trained, I tell the other guy to get help, a first aid kit or something, and I take a good look at the girl. Old glory was in tatters and she was showing a fair bit of skin. A lot of skin actually. It was hard keeping my eyes on her face to calm her down. She was crying and thanking me at the same time, while I was able take a bandaid I had in my pocket (cargo shorts) and put it on her chest. The other guy came back and we had someone professional look at her. She wasn't so annoying anymore. This is how I got a hot date to a Formal I had later that month. But back to the subject of the animal. I walk up to it cautiously and it is eyeing me with what looks like jealousy. It knows in it's earthly wisdom that I had seen this girls full American Glory. It says, \"that's gonna be about tree-fiddy\" it was at this point I noticed she was a monster from the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "I guess I can share this now.\n\nSo about 8 years ago I was a cop in a fairly large town. I was in my second year of policing , so I was jus past the point of being a rookie. I began policing the more crime ridden areas of town to stand up to crime and eradicate it. I wasn't looking for small time pot users, I was mainly look looking for crack, guns, and gangs. I had a different approach than most cops in these areas. I would bring my bicycle with me in my cruiser. I'd park my cruiser and ride my bike around, this way I could be more personable and seen as someone who is there to help. I'd talk to and get to know the good people. A lot of them are great people struggling  working two fast food jobs feeding three kids. I will admit most of them smoked pot and knew that I knew but that wasn't why I was there and they seen that in me. They knew I was there to help the struggling families and give a chance to there kids. \n\nSo that was the back story here's the my screw up.\n\nD was a regular kid I knew he was 11 or 12. He was a little nedry and didn't have many friends in the neighborhood. So whenever I'd be riding and see him I'd make it a point to stop and talk to him. Wed chat for five minutes or so and I'd be on my way. I really felt for the kid and would secretly send him a gift on his birthday and christmas. I had to be professional so he or his family never knew it was that sent em. So anyway, one day I'm riding by and see my buddy D from a distance  and he in the middle of a group of 6 or so. So Im kind of glad that he found a friend. Then I notice some egg cartons in there hand. Then it registers, before I could ride up to D all the boys start pelting him with eggs. In a matter of 5 seconds D is coverd in dozens of eggs lying on the ground crying. I'm furious, this kid and I had a bond, I'm s creaming stop, stay, all the kids run, I get off my bike and start chasing the punks. I start running and leap on the first one I can reach. My instincts took over and all cop protocol went out of my head. I start punching , and punching this dude. He is now bleeding, broken jaw, missing teeth, mul tuple cuts. So I come to and think oh damn, there's a crows of people around me staring in disbelief. I'm frozen , I hear a woman yell , We called the real police and there coming. So I just go sit on the curb , and reflect on why, and whsts about to happen to me. I know I'll be fired but I might even go to jail. So my coworkers arrive, and take me off to jail. There I am, sitting in a jsil cell trying to make sense of what happened to me and whsts about to happen. A lawyer walks in and introduces himself. He looks me dead in the eyes, and says , \" My services run around tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419635258", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was driving from Virginia to Georgia to visit my girlfriend at the time (this was about 6 years ago). I stopped for gas and went inside to pick up a couple of snacks for the road. I'm browsing the store, and I notice a girl I assumed was simply a goth. Dressed in all black, hair over the eye, etc. Her make up was startling and she weirded me out a little because she seemed to be staring at me menacingly. I hurried to the chip aisle, picked up my Bugles, turn around and she's right. fucking. behind me. She chokes out, almost in a whisper \"I... Need... It...\" and tries to claw at my arm. Naturally, I dropped the Bugles and noped the fuck out of there. I made the rest of my trip to and from my girlfriend's place without anything else weird happening, and within a couple weeks I stopped thinking about it.\n    Fast forward to about 3 years ago. I was throwing my regular Super Bowl party, and obviously needed to buy snacks. I went down to the local Costco and bought the usual party foods: chips, salsa, cheese, etc. I get to the checkout and there she is behind the counter. Same girl. Staring at me. I noted her clothes this time because she looked like she was wearing the same shirt (I couldn't see her pants). A black long-sleeved shirt with tombstones on it. Hair over one eye. Black make up. Ring on her thumb. After I looked her over, I decide it would be better to use the self-checkout. I scan all my items, keeping one eye on the girl. Unfortunately, her register is facing the self-checkout lane so she's still staring at me, almost as if she knew I had something of hers. I look down quickly to bag the snacks. I look back up quickly to see if she's still staring. But she's gone. I feel sharp fingernails claw at my back and I turn around quickly. There she is. And again, she rasps \"I... Need... It...\" This time, I'm even more petrified. I run out of the store, leaving the snacks behind, get in my car, and speed home to my girlfriend (different one). I tell her about the girl, including my first encounter with her, and I show her my back. She tells me there are 3 long scratches across my back, and another that's about half as long as the rest, and she tells me she'll take care of the groceries.\n    The Super Bowl party begins a week later or so. The event was still very much on my mind, but this was the big game, so I decided to try to ignore it for a few hours. I managed to push it from my mind. Then, at halftime, there's a knock at the door. My friend Andy said he'd be late, so I assumed it was him. Of course, it was the girl again. Wearing the same outfit. Ring around her thumb. The whole deal. She points a knife at me. Looks me dead in the eye and whispers in the most chilling voice \"I need it...\"\n    Finally, I'd had enough. \"What do you need?!\" I shout.\n    She looks at me, looks at the rest of my guests, who were dialing 911, and glares back at me.\n\n\"Imma need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was about that time I noticed that this  girl was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419662370", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -22, "controversiality": 0}

I'll never forget this game when one of my kid's best friends (the goalie) failed to stop an easy shot. There was about one minute left in the game and this lost it for them. He started crying and frantically looking around for something or someone. Keep in mind this kid was 14 years old, and his mom was known to be pretty strict, and would often argue with refs and other parents. Well apparently this kid was looking for her, and was terrified of what was about to come. He spots her and starts sprinting the other way. She tries to play it cool and starts fast walking in his direction. I seem to be the only one watching. Knowing her reputation I keep my eye on her and see her pull something shiny out of her pocket. She backs this poor kid up against a car and screams at him. At this point everyone is looking, and some are getting quite worried. The crowd begins to slowly make their way toward her, but it's too late. I'm close enough to see that this shiny object is a fucking switchblade. The crowd is running at her but before we reach her she repeatedly stabs the kid 17 times. *17 times*. We get to her and bring her to the ground and a doctor in the crown announces that the kid isn't going to make it. Everyone is crying and some are trying to kill her, while others are holding those ones back. The police are called and I, being the closest one to her, and the first to tackle her, ask her why the fuck she would do such a thing. She looks up at me with bloodshot eyes and frazzled hair and says in a satanic voice \"I did it for a bet of sorts\" while maniacally laughing. She clears her voice and pulls me close, and whispers in my ear \"the devil offered me about tree fiddy\".

I was going to leave it at that but it can be confusing. \n\n**This was mainly based on personal opinion**\n\nA lot of times the post was flared incorrectly for the type of definitions I was using. For example, a question was defined by me as a \"post with a question that has a relatively concrete answer with little debate available\" whereas a discussion was more \"a post with a question or idea that has multiple interpretations and answers can be debated on a deeper level.\" Some posts were not flared appropriately for that definition.\n\nNow it is 1:00am so I guess some are probably a bit shaky, but you get the idea. And also you should know that if a post was \"iffy\" and could go 2 ways, I usually deferred to the flair the user/mod had put on it.\n\nThe \"fluff\" category is very much inflated by about 10 \"Merry Christmas\" posts a few days ago that made it a rather atypical week. \n\nThe tweets do not include other things that just happen to be in tweet form. So for example, twitter drama is considered a tweed (though it could be argued for fluff) but a roster change is considered an announcement for these purposes.\n\nAlso, Tournament threads were under \"modposts/meta\" for this. There were 3 or 4 of them.\n\nAnd this was a bit of a direct response to /u/slopnessie post, so I would appreciate hearing his feelings on it.

{"body": "TL;DR: by forgetting my wallet.\n\nBackstory: I go to a school where 90% of the dads work at the mine so if both parents work in a family, there's a fair amount of disposable income. So the kids think they are rich and try to flex daddy's money every chance they get. Getting new cars, traveling across the world 2-3 times a year, etc. You get the point. It's common to get a new car every year, or whenever.\n\nStory: a girl at my school and her boyfriend broke up. Conveniently, the mirrors on her brand new car got kicked off the day they broke up when the cameras were facing away. She obviously would have a huge sight handicap, so she didn't want to drive if it would endanger her and others. She was gonna have to find a ride for about a week before her parents could go buy a new car, which was odd because it would take about an hour to fix at any repair shop. \n\nI always kind of admired her from afar, but I was never too close to her. I took this as a chance to talk to her a lot and really get to know her. Worst case scenario (still pretty good) I will make a new friend. Best case we date for a while. I have been driving underage for the past few months, but I'm safe. I choose to be honest and let her know that, she has no problem. I'm smitten. \n\nWe start talking a lot and we find we have a lot in common. We are both really into basketball, sneakers, a little drinking, typical teenager stuff. It's fun to talk to her, we have the same sense of humor which is great. She's always kinda physical with me, grabbing my arm, holding my hand when we drive, kissing me when I drop her off at her home. I take the plunge and ask her if she'd like to go to dinner the coming Friday. She smiles and accepts immediately, she thought we were a couple already. Great! \n\nThat Friday I pick her up at 7, and things are going great. We are both dressed pretty well, so I figured I would splurge and take her to a finer dining place. We talk over dinner and it's great. We are playing footsie the whole time, I scuffed the crap out of my dress shoes and her heels but it's nothing. She's rubbing me under the table. I'm finally gonna lose my virginity. FINALLY. \n\nI get giddy. I ask for the check. I reach for my wallet, and it's not there. My eyes are the size of saucers and I look at my date. She laughs and pulls out the cash to pay from a stack of hundreds. We both laugh it off and head to my Focus. The mood is still kinda there, but I need to tend to the fire of her libido. I ask her, \"so what do I owe you?\" through a grin, expecting her to say something sexual. \n\n\"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that moment that I realized she was about 3 stories tall, and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \n\n\"God damnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree Fiddy!\" I say as I shoo her out of my car. And that was the day that I learned to always quadruple check that you have your wallet before you step out of the car on a date.

{"body": "**1)** As many people have suggested, the subreddit design needs to be changed and I think we could get some really great looking designs here. [/u/DonOfTheWest](http://www.reddit.com/user/DonOfTheWest) put it well in my opionion when he said that the design is \"very bland and non-inviting\". [/u/slopnessie]{http://www.reddit.com/user/slopnessie) did say that recent attempts to change the design have not gone to plan but perhaps someone not on the mod team could design something for the sub. Does it have to be a mod that designs the subreddit?\n\n**2)** In my own opinion of the subs rules, there is nothing wrong with them. I see people complain about the new rule about linking videos as posts. I really don't see the issue in just posting the link in a text post. In regards to posting original content, it should be allowed in my opinion. No other competitive gaming subreddit has any problems posting original content so why should we? Instead of posting the content in a new post, we should have a weekly stickied thread where people can come and post as much original content as they want.\n\n**3)** Again, a few people have commented on this and **it is a problem**. As the home of competitive Call of Duty on the internet, this should be a place for pros and the fans to come and discuss the scene, things in the game, the league structure, what works and what doesn't, etc. Hardly any pros actually visit the sub because of the toxicity here which at times, can become pretty severe. Many of the pros have said that they no longer visit the sub because of this and it no longer has much value. People need to stop the hate, NOW! I think the sub needs some sort of moderation where any hate or disrespect does not go unanswered for. Plain and simple, it should not be allowed.\n\n**4)** One final thing that I will add is about the use of the search bar. Do people know it exists at all? I don't know about other people but it irks me so much when people don't use the search bar. Similar to a weekly stickied thread about posting OC, we could have a weekly stickied thread where people can come and ask questions about Scufs, headsets, monitors and so on. I realise you can't simply add a weekly stickied thread for every issue that the sub has but it could be a start.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419860618", "subreddit": "CoDCompetitive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Anyways, this one car starts following up on me pretty close, I can tell he wants to pass me so I try to wave him around. I guess he can't see my arm or whatever, I never find out but he doesn't switch lanes he just stays on my tail. I look in the mirror and I can barely see through his window and I legitimately think he's wearing a Halloween mask.  His face was really distorted, but I didn't get a good look because it was night and his lights were on. Eventually he actually does switch lanes and drives next to me at my speed for a few miles. There's no one on the road but us at this point. I look over again and I actually see his face, he must have had a terrible deformity. His neck was maybe twice as long as average and his jaw pushed forward pretty far. My stomach jumped when I first processed this, but then I shook myself out of it and kept driving. After another mile or so he rolls his window down and signals for me to do the same. I'm a little apprehensive but I do it nonetheless. That's when he shouts something out. I didn't hear it at first so I shouted for him to repeat it. He does and I make out, \"can I have about tree fiddy?\" That's when I realize that it wasn't a man driving the car, it was the goddamn Loch Ness monster!

The only way I see a vendor selling MSM-free meth is if they manufactured it themselves because I guarantee the majority are just selling shit they get from those cartel mongoloids down south.

Months went by and his chemo didn't really work that well, he was getting worse and worse as the days went by and our family had pretty much given up hope, and my son was kind of content with dying he said. Sad time for us all.*\n\n*There was one last hope though, our doctor was apparently part of some medical testing group that had their hands on a new type of treatment for the cancer that was similar to chemotherapy but didn't have as bad of side effects as the other, more commonly used chemotherapy had.*\n\n*So, we decided we'd give it a shot, we didn't have much to lose anyways. The doctor guided us step by step on how to care for him following the chemotherapy and even helped us move into a new house while he was our doctor. (We moved closer to the hospital so we could get better healthcare than at our local clinic, we used to live in a pretty small town)*\n\n*Over time, his diagnosis got better and better, about 5 months later it was as if he no longer had cancer at all, he was healthy enough to run around and play sports, it was as if the cancer had never even happened. Everyone in our family was overjoyed.*\n\n*Back at the doctors office, I was worrying and worrying over what the bill was going to be, I mean.. new treatment.. not only that but it worked.. and extremely well at that.*\n\n*The doctor came up to me and I asked, \"So, will my insurance cover any of the costs?\" and he replied, \"yes, most of it actually.\" I was relieved,but who knows how much money would be left... Then he said \"I've been touched by your little boy, and me and my nurses have gathered enough money to pay off the rest of the costs.*\n\n*I couldn't believe it. I started to walk away in disbelieve when I heard the doctor say, \"Oh, one moment, wait\" I turned around and said \"Yeah?\" he said, \"I need just one thing from you though.\" Confused by what he would need I asked, \"What do you need?\" The doctor said, \"I need about Tree Fiddy\"*\n\n*Now it was around this time when I realized the doctor was 7 stories tall and was actually a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamn Nessie! That goddamn Loch Ness monster had gotten me again. I stood there screaming at him about who was going to pay my bills as he swam into the distance.*\n\n*So now, I don't really trust doctors that much anymore, because I always remember this incident and it makes it that much harder to trust them.*\n\n**Tl;dr: I really, really don't like hospitals that much anymore.**\n\nCredit goes to /u/Thehealeroftri", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419912018", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

They don't think I'll ever find anything of significance, but I swore to prove them wrong.  To this day I haven't found anything, but I will never give up.  Some day I will discover something extraordinary, and the people who laughed will be sorry.\n\nThis was the first Sunday I had taken off in years.  I normally worked 8-10 hours 7 days a week.  Today was my nieces 10th birthday, though.  I had missed most of her previous birthdays, so I thought I'd take a day to celebrate with her.  She was due to show up any minute now.\n\nThere was a knock at the door, so I leaped up to go answer it.  As I had expected, it was my niece standing in her girl scout uniform.  She had a box in her hand labeled, \"Girl Scout Cookies.\" I ask her how much she wants for a box, and she says, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that time that I realized it wasn't my niece, but instead a giant crustacean about 6-stories tall from the paleolithic era.  It was that damned Loch Ness monster!\n\nI said, \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy you damn monsta!\" To which he replied, \"how about two fiddy?\"\n\n\"Oh, now it's two fiddy!  What is there a deal on Loch Ness munchies?\" I said. The giant monster laughed, and that was how we became friends.\n\nSo, that is the story of how I discovered my first mythical beast.

{"body": "This: \n\n&gt; In a meta-analysis of 217 studies published between 1957 and 1990, the psychologists George Comstock and Haejung Paik found that the short-term effect of exposure to media violence on actual physical violence against a person was moderate to large in strength. \n\n...is bullshit. Read those studies. The methodology is complete rubbish. Basically, if you believe these studies \"prove\" that media causes violence then you must also believe in the much stronger case for Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and alien abduction. \n\nThe thing they tend to have in common is they use odd definitions for \"aggressive\" or \"violent\". For example, if you prefer to use certain terms you are deemed \"violent\". \n\nNote this key proviso:\n\n&gt; What’s missing are studies on whether watching violent media directly leads to committing extreme violence. \n\n\"extreme violence\" as in ACTUAL violence. There is no study that shows correlation, let alone *causation*, between media and actual violent crimes. \n\n&gt; Because of the relative rarity of acts like school shootings and because of the ethical prohibitions on developing studies that definitively prove causation of such events, this is no surprise. \n\nIOW, it's too hard to get real evidence so we'll just make shit up. \n\nEDIT: [Latest](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/no-link-seen-between-violent-video-games-movies-and-real-world-violence-110514.html) study refuting violence link. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419973670", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

(and getting one's record expunged is not as easy as the tv shows make it seem, fucking trust me.)  and so forth.  \n\nsince we had already been raising him to enjoy his childhood while he had it - we were always strong on that point, like, 'hey, i know you're gonna wanna do all these things as soon as you can and as soon as they're presented, but take our word for it, childhood is only a second of your life and you're going to have from age ____ to death to ____, so enjoy having no responsibilities etc while you can,\" this was an argument that made sense to him by the time he was confronted by these very grownup things that entered his realm of possibility around age 14.  \n\nit's not that he didn't push boundaries.  of course he did.  but our voices reverberated in his head, and further, there were plenty of times we just said no, outright, and it pained us to do so.  there was one time when he was 15 and the cool kids invited him to a bonfire on a saturday night.  i REALLY wanted to let him go.  i knew it would be SO MUCH FUN, i remember that shit when i was a kid, and i knew he'd LOVE it.  rubbing elbows with the cool kids, having illicit beers, etc.  but i also knew the party was almost certain to get busted by 10p, and that all the kids who didn't run fast enough would get hauled in, and that even if that didn't happen, he was unlikely to call us for ride and would instead opt to ride with a drunken teenager who could likely kill him on the way home.\n\nso, i said no.  sorrowfully.  'i'm sorry, but no, you can't go,' and i felt shitty about it all night long, and he was FURIOUS with me.\n\ntwo days later he came into my room and said, 'so, about that bonfire,' and i interrupted him to say, 'we've already discussed it, it's over now, i don't want to hear it,' and he interrupted me in turn to say, 'no, thank you for not letting me go.  it was busted and blake and adam were hauled in and their parents were called and now they have charges for underage drinking.  so thank you.\"\n\nthere's no tree fiddy here, that really happened, and that's what i mean when i say our hard and fast zero tolerance resulted in him learning lessons we were trying to teach in the first place.\n\nso yes, i know the popular thinking is to teach them to 'do it safely' and whatever, and while i completely agree with that when it comes to sex, i absolutely do not agree when it comes to illegal acts that could result in years worth of trouble for kids who are just starting out.  you can rain fifteen thousand downvotes upon me and i will never, ever change that view.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419991298", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hiya, first of all congratulations on your marriage :) \n\nI'm Scottish and I'll give you a few tips\n\n1. It can get pretty cold here so bring warm clothing.\n\n2. If you get the chance visit a city or two, Glasgow and Edinburgh are great for shopping and both have some cool scenery, mainly Edinburgh if you go to the castle there.\n\n3. If you want scenery you should go to Loch Lomond or Loch Ness. Both are amazingly beautiful. I personally recommend Loch Ness because the history, food and culture is amazing there and I'm sure you've heard of Nessie the Loch Ness monster :)\n\n4. Read up on our slang terms. Lots of people here have the accents you might hear on tv that are very clear and understandable but most of us like to use alot of slang terms and you'll definitely like it more if you know what people are saying.\n\n5.Try Irn-Bru. It's a soft drink that was created here, It's one of the only drinks that have outsold coca-cola (but it has only done that here). Anyway it tastes great.\n\n6 Get a ferry out to one of the isles. Most of them have great views.\n\nI hope I helped and I hope you enjoy it when you come here. We have alot of great scenery and great food, music and history you should try and do as much as possible.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420068037", "subreddit": "Scotland", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
