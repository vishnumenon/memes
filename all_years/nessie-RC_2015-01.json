{"body": "&gt; That's an impressive strawman you've built up. Nobody argues that all the world's woes would be solved if Islam went away, just as I imagine most people didn't argue that defeating Nazism during WW2 would create everlasting world peace. But of course that wasn't a good excuse to leave Nazism alone in 1939, just like it's not a good excuse to ignore Islam today. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good as they say.\n&gt; \n\nWell to say that Islam is the only religion that is an issue is just stupid and wrong. Is islam a threat? Yes. Is it the only threat out there as far as religion is concerned? No. To ignore Islam's threat is stupid, but to then say we should ignore all other religions or dismiss them as harmless is just as retarded. Every time someone brings up violence in other religions the same response is called out \"HURR DURR IT'S NOT ISLAM!\" \n\n&gt;And just because Hitler used rosy, religious language to galvanise the German people doesn't mean he was a Christian extremist, that's so absurd it's almost not worth mentioning. You might as well argue that Thomas Jefferson was a religious extremist because he talked about God and a creator in the American Declaration of Independence, even though by all accounts he was as secular people got back then. You should read up on Hitler's religious views.. Most historians agree that he allied himself with Christianity when it was politically useful but in his private was a deeply secular person. As the historian Laurence Rees concluded \"Hitler's relationship in public to Christianity - indeed his relationship to religion in general - was opportunistic. There is no evidence that Hitler himself, in his personal life, ever expressed any individual belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church\".\n\nAs a history buff myself I can say that Hitler, Nazism and indeed Neo Nazism is very much Christian. The argument that Hitler wasn't religious and used religion as a way to garner more support simply doesn't hold water with many people. He was, by all accounts very religious, traditionally so, even. He justified his acts using religion and his acts were religious, they were wiping out the foreign, non christian influence in favour of Christian influence. The only documents that support that Hitler was non religious was his \"Table talk\", a document that to a lot of historians is controversial. The table talk, which was recorded \"for posterity\" also recorded Hitler as saying the Holocaust was not happening. I do not believe a lot of the table talk is that trustworthy.\n\n&gt;And finally, I'm not really interested in talking about religious extremism that occurred 500 years ago. Christianity has grown up like most other religions and divorced itself from obnoxious piety. It's not a coincidence that Buddhists and Mormons aren't flying planes into office buildings in the 21st century.\n\nHas it? I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. Religion hasn't \"matured\", it's just learnt how to use PR. Lets have a quick look at the clusterfuck that is Uganda. The Ugandans, with encouragement from religious leaders both in Uganda and the USA, are trying to pass a law that would see not only gay people put to death, but effectively anyone who didn't report them. This law was the result of talks, visits and campaigns from Christian pastors from the USA, some of whom have links to the US Government. Now the reason why this law hasn't passed yet isn't because \"it's a fucked up law\", no. It's because of a technicality in the constitution which is quickly being remedied. \n\nYou know the Anti-Gay propaganda law in Russia, you know, the one being used to arrest people for holding hands, raid people's homes and even dismiss rape cases, guess who's behind that? The Russian Church.\n\nIreland, with the help of it's church, have basically turned pregnant women into nothing but incubators. One woman was killed after being denied an abortion for a baby that was already dead, one woman who died was kept on life support to the point she began to rot because she was pregnant at the time. They cut open women's vaginas rather than give them caesareans. Why? Because religion. No other reason.\n\nIn the USA we have laws that make having a miscarriage an arrestable offense. There's a law that require doctors to shove an ultrasound dildo up you and actively lie to you on medical matters. In one state, you have to lie to children about homosesxuality being legal. Michigan is passing a law that will allow EMTs to let people die on religious grounds. In one state, you can bully someone on religious grounds in schools and teachers can't stop it. There's states where a pharmacist can deny you your meds because their imaginary friend told them to, Louisiana is funding a science program that teaches the Loch Ness Monster exists and all of this is due to religion. There are pastors and churches calling for the death of homosexuals, people of different religions amongst others, and indeed, people doing just that and everyone just ignores it. Christianity isn't as violent as Islam because it's better, they're less violent because they don't have to be violent to get their way. If they want something or want to do something, they can do it with impunity. Christianity is in a place Islam can only dream of, they can pass bullshit, theocratic laws and get away with it. If these laws were passed through pressure from Muslims, they'd be riots. And lets not even get into people like \"Crusader for Christendom\" Anders Brevik and the like.\n\nEven Buddhism, fucking buddhism, Mister \"I'm so fucking peaceful\" itself, is getting in on the act. In Myanmar, Buddhist mobs are raiding Muslim areas and villages and killing Muslims there. Men, Women and children are being killed by this apparently peaceful religion. 140,000 people have fled their homes because of this. Oh, and you know how Muslim countries arrest people for insulting Mohammed? People are being arrested for insulting Buddhism, as bizarre as it may seem.\n\nBut of course, all of this is OK, it's Islam exclusively that's the problem, we should actively ignore *all* other acts done in the name of other religions.\n\nAm I being an apologist by saying this? No, I hate Islam as much as every right minded person. It is violent, it is authoritarian, but guess what? So is pretty much every single mainstream religion both currently, previously and in the future. Religion is a mental illness, a cancer that must be wiped from the world no matter what. It's like putting the guy who believes the voice of God is calling him to kill everyone in a secure unit whilst letting another guy who believes lamp posts wants him to kill everyone go free, even after committing acts of violence. We shouldn't be fighting religion with an exacto knife, we should be using a claymore and we shouldn't give a fuck about what part of the monster is the liver and what part is the spleen, it's all the same fucking monster. Lets kill it, bathe in it's blood and piss on it's fucking grave.\n\n&gt;The sooner you realise this the sooner we'll all be able to fix this problem.\n\nWell that last bit is ominous, What is your solution to the problem, praytell?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420077678", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Erin told me of a day where she and James were walking home together (they are next door neighbours and were practically raised as brother and sister). On this day, James, being the awkward freshman that he was, James decided that he could do a front flip to impress Erin. He obviously had no idea how to do a front flip, so while he was, he was in the midst of the flip, he landed on his head an dislodges some vertebrae. He was numb on the ground, with his neck looking all fucked up, passed out. She quickly called him an ambulance, but he was dying too quickly. 'James, you're gonna be fine, aren't ya?'

{"body": "Part deux!\n\nI know that the mountains are going to have a lot of people at first, so I stay hidden and silent amongst the trees. I find a hidden, muddy trail, and begin to follow it northward. I follow this trail for about an hour, but it eventually ends. I am forced to continue through the dense forest. The sun is directly overhead, but it is mostly dark under the trees. I walk and walk, rather bored, but on the lookout for trouble. I don't want to run into someone, and if I do, they will probably kill me or take me prisoner. I walk until dark and then set up camp near a small stream. The stream is clear and cool, and I fill my water bottle from it, and add a purification tablet. I get in my sleeping bag, and fall asleep quite quickly.\n\n\nAround midnight I wake up to noises. I lay still and listen. I don't hear anything else. Suddenly, something falls and lands in my chest. I am completely silent for a few.seconds, then I look down to see.what it is. It's a squirrel that's just as stunned as I am. It must have fallen from the tree above me. \"Fucking shit-noodles,\" I mutter softly to it, \"you scared the shit out of me.\" It just scampers off of me and hides somewhere in the bushes. I fall asleep, and thankfully don't wake up until morning. When I do wake up, the sun is just coming up, and it's a good day for hiking.\n\n\n**Five days later**\n\n\nAccording to my map, I am almost to the Wyoming border. I have been staying away from roads and town as much as possible, to stay away from people. My legs hurt from all the walking, but it has been worth it, as I have managed to stay alive this long. I think that if I get north of the border, I can find some farmland that is uninhabited and set up a decent house and farm to live in. I have been killing squirrels and other small game to feed myself, and getting water from streams. I've eaten most of what I brought with me, excluding some candy that I am keeping for special occasions. I once sent and looked at a town to see if I could learn anything from afar, but it looks like people are hunkered down. I hope that some.order eventually gets restored, but I don't expect it for a long time, maybe even a decade depending on the scale of the attacks. It if evening, so I set up camp and go to sleep.\n\n\nI wake up the next morning and clean up my camp, and get on my way. I walk along, thinking about life, paying little attention to my surroundings. Unexpectedly, I trip on something g and fall flat on my face. \"Fucking cock-graters!\" I exclaim. When I look up, j see a woman standing over me. \"Who are you and what are you doing here?\" she asks. I reply, \"I'm someone and I'm headed north.\" \"Well that's where I headed,\" she says, \"Care to join me?\" \"As long and you don't try to kill me or rob me,\" I say. We start out north for the Wyoming border, which my map says is about fifteen miles away.\n\n\n**Three months later**\n\n\nWe have found a good uninhabited area to live on, and built and built a log cabin. It isn't much, but it has to do. We have set up some vegetable patches with seeds that she brought. We have a stream a little ways off that we use to get water. We have been eating various animals that I've found like squirrels and once even a rogue cow that we found when exploring. We are getting along well with each other. We are even considering having kids, but we might not because of food.\n\n\nI occasionally go exploring around our land and look for anything that might indicate that someone has been nearby, but I haven't found anything, so I think we won't see people for a long time. I personally just want the whole order to be over, and just need some normalcy after all I've been through.\n\n\nThe End.\n\n\nAlternate ending: I occasionally go exploring around our land and look for anything that might indicate that someone has been nearby, but I haven't found anything, so I think we won't see people for a long time. I go out for my daily walk around to check for animals, and I stumble on a branch and almost fall. When I look up, there is a monster standing over me. It says, and I quote, \"I need just 'bout tree fiddy.\"\n\nHopefully there is nothing in this part like quite instead of quiet.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420108439", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

You might have finally scratched the surface of his reoccurring existence, but I assure you his true purpose is magnificent to comprehend.\n\nHe is a ghost in plain sight and employing a method of slowly developing a subconscious familiarity in his target that will allow him to strike completely unguarded.  It started with the hostage situation on the plane, he was able to yell and scream in the presence of the target without suspicion because the whole plane partakes in mass hysteria, but he escalates and even shouts an order through the crowd before kicking open the plane door which starts sucking people out.

{"body": "My best sorry was actually from the other side. I still don't quite understand what all was said and why it happened, but here's what I caught:\n\nI was at my favorite little shitty dive bar back in college. I was a bit old for college, since it took me forever to decide what to do, but there I was, about to turn 25, 6'0, 215 lbs, ex college wrestler, and just there for a beer. \n\nWell, it was very busy that night, and quite loud, but I make my way through the crowd up to the bar and order a beer. Since I'm a regular, I get served pretty fast, but it's really busy, so there's a wait. The bartender gives me the nod that he'll be over in a bit, so I turn around to see if any of my friends are there yet. \n\nInstead of seeing my friends, I see what appears to be a giant, ginger ewok. The guy is about 5'9 or so, maybe 220 lbs, but built like a teddy bear. He's also obviously quite upset about something. He says to me, \"Do you vouch for him?\" Or that's what I hear, and he gestures to the man standing next to me that I have never before seen. This startles the guy next to me as well, since he doesn't know what's going on either. \n\nI respond, \"I actually don't know this guy, but he looks like a perfectly reasonable individual. But why do you want me to vouch for him?\"\n\nInstead of answering my question, he says something that sounds a bit like, \"You don't know who you're messing with!\" And pulls a knife from his pocket. My first instinct is that I misheard him and he just wanted to show me his know, so I say, \"that's a nice knife! I just got a new one, too. See, it's a folding utility knife, very useful. You don't even have to worry about damaging the blade, because they're replaceable.\"\n\nWell, at this point, my furry friend decides to meet something under his breathe, put his knife away and walk away through the crowd. I look to the guy I just \"vouched\" for and ask him if he knew what that was, and he just shakes his head and laughs. Then I turn around and the bartender takes my order, gives me my beer. I pay, nod to the guy next to me, and turn around to find a table. \n\nBoom, ginger bear is in my face and looks even madder. Practically frothing at the mouth in anger. He says, \"I've got no problem cutting you!\" And puts his open knife up to my throat. I'm baffled by this and immediately think, \"I need somewhere to put down my beer!\"\n\nMeanwhile, no one around us has taken any notice, and there are no tables nearby, so, I'm stuck holding my beer in my right hand and my left hand up in a defensive gesture. I say, \"Whoa, buddy, I don't know what's going on, but we seem to have down of on the wrong foot-\" Then grab his hand around the knife and raise it up away from my neck. \n\nSatanic Santa's fave goes from beet red to shock white in about half a second. The anger is gone, only pants - shitting fear is left. He says, (speaking clearly for the first time) \"I apologize, sir! I see you're a man of action!\"\n\nThat phrase \"man of action\" threw me a bit, so I wasn't even angry, just really, really confused and worried about spilling my beer. So, I take a so so it's not so full, still holding his hand, and say, \"I don't know if this was a weird joke or something, but I don't appreciate it. This is my favorite bar and I don't want to cause a big seen, so I want you to put down the knife and leave.\"\n\nHe says, \"I understand, sir, but I can't let go of the knife.\" I realize that unless I let go of his hand, he can't drop the knife, and if I let go, there's no reason he couldn't just try to stab me. \n\nNot wanting to be stabbed, still being burdened with my beer that I don't want to spill, I don't see an easy way out of this, but then all the sudden, there's a plate between us with mini-burgers on it. I follow the arm holding it to the face of a tiny woman standing directly below the knife, and she says, \"You want a slider?\"\n\nOnce again, I'm completely caught offguard and I kind of forget about the knife when I realize that all I really want right now is that slider. So, I let go of the knife, gran the burger, the ginger neckbeard immediately disappears, and all is one again right in the world. \n\nA month later, that bar hired me as a bouncer.  \n\nI still have no idea what that dude was on about, but the burger was good, so I can't really complain. \n\nEdit: Alternate Ending for people who don't believe it's a true story anyway:\n\n...After I told him to put down the knife, he said, \"I can't.\"\n\n\"Why not,\" I replied. \n\n\"Because I need something first.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I can see you're a man of action, but I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time that I realized he wasn't a ginger neckbeard at all,  but a 5 story tall reptile from the cretaceous period. And I yelled, \"GODDAMMIT LOCH NESS MONSTA, YOU AIN'T GETTIN' NO TREE FIDDY!!\"\n\nTL; DR: knife fight over a miniburger.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420313360", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 65, "controversiality": 0}

I don't know enough to really critique it.\n\nIn regards to your last question, as I explained to /u/fiddyman237, I'm trying to put together a steampunk/gaslamp fantasy (that is, 19th century technological level) world but have indigenous peoples still in control of the equivalent American continent, living in a technologically advanced society, so I'm interested in how you began to put this together, what research you did to start off with, which books you read or people you talked to. I'm reading *1491* at the moment, but it's a huge book and I'm only right at the beginning. As a European it's hard to find people to directly talk to. And I haven't written a story set in a mediaeval European world for years - I've always been more interested in later history.\n\nMy main story at the moment featuring this part of my world is that a ship of similar design to the Titanic (but doing everything right after a previous wreck) is crossing the ocean between Insula (the main northern-European-based confederation) and Algon (a multi-provincial empire of Algonquin-speaking peoples who have established their state - I know it's a cheesy name but I didn't want to try to make too much up). Because this is a constructed world, obviously the geography is not identical to North America; however, because I use real languages in my European stories, I decided to research the peoples who would have lived in the area around New York and take it from there. There is a push by the Algon confederation to colonise what would be the arctic, mostly for mineral wealth, and they are importing labour from the Insulan Empire - labour which is basically unfree but to which both governments are turning a blind eye at what their respective militaries are doing.\n\nThe ship accidentally rams a sea serpent (of the classic 'Nessie' type, but with a Godzilla-style temperament) and the angry monster attacks the ship. (As my friend said when I explained the plot: 'There he is, minding his own business, when suddenly this great big ship comes along and smashes into him. He's got to be a tad miffed about that!') I was inspired by going on a cruise recently and being inside the ship and not even realising we'd left port. It's not so much a story inspired by indigenous America as such, I just wanted to use those peoples as trading partners and rivals to the European confederation. The ship is owned captained by someone from the Algon states; I have a slight problem choosing the name, because I don't know enough about the mythology to know what I can safely call a ship without giving offence, but maybe I'll just call her the *Gansett*, after the main maritime city of Algon, or something like that. The *Hochelaga* might be an interesting name, since that was a settlement on the site of modern-day Montreal which I've floated as a name for a city further north, a staging post for arctic exploration.\n\nBut...well. I don't know what else to say about your world except 'wow'.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420318228", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\n\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\n\ntl;dr: Haha..

I was 10 - had just gotten my very first Pokemon game, coincidentally Diamond, and was confused as well as excited.  I wandered into the tall grass, my little sister peeking over my shoulder, eyes aglow with wonder, when suddenly, strange music begins playing!  The screen goes black, and the legendary fight begins.\n\nI throw out my Turtwig - now level 6, after having defeated my Rival, very creatively named \"Turtley\" (I renamed it when I revisited the game later.)  A strange, marimba-like clicking sound emitted from the beaver-esque creature that now stood motionless before my young eyes.  I clicked \"fight\" and then \"tackle,\" in hopes to defeat the monstrous beast, but alas!  The attack missed.  My aforementioned little sister giggled, and I glared at her.  The bidoof counter-tackled, making contact.  I gasped in fear and attempted the same maneuver a second time. This time, true damage had been done - a critical hit to the Bidoof - and I could smell its fear.  I finished the legendary creature off with one last tackle, heard the victory music, and the satasfying sounds that accompany gaining experience.  While my turtwig leveled up that day, I myself leveled up in spirit, rejoicing in my first wild victory.  Although it was only a video game, it felt real, and power coursed through my little 10-year-old-girly vains, and I imagined myself sharing a satisfied grin with my Turtwig as the monster fled back into the grass.\n\nLater on, I again encountered the creature.  I like to think that it was the same one, returning for revenge; however, this time around, I made peace with the creature, capturing it and teaching it 4 HM moves, keeping it with me for the rest of my long journey to smash rocks, traverse immense oceans, fell monstrous trees, and climb walls for me.

{"body": "So, this was while I lived in San Jose (I have since moved back to Indiana), a few days before I came back home. I was at the mall near the ohlone chynoweth stop on the light rail. Well, as I'm walking around, just chilling out, I meet this girl.\n\nLet me set her character in your mind... She's this slender girl, somewhere around five foot tall, red headed, with freckles, AND the bluest eyes I've ever seen. She's wearing this skirt that was short enough to be enticing, but long enough to not be a prostitute. She's also got these knee high leather boots, a tight button up top, and is drinking some type of starbucks coffee. In addition, and this is what really caught my eye, She's wearing a dog collar around her throat, and being lead around by another girl, slightly taller than she, on a leash.  To top it all off, she's acting like this is as natural as breathing to her.\n\nBeing the lifestyler that I am, and realizing that I'm going to not be here in a couple of days, and how hard it would be to find her again if I was... I try to capitalize on it. I approach them, and make conversation with the girl holding the leash first (following proper protocol). I make some small talk, since neither the domme, nor I are in a hurry. I explain that I'm a lifestyle dominant, and she tells ME that while she owned the leashed girl, she's a switch! I grinned, if only to contain my excitement... Looking back, I was probably showing it anyway. And I compliment the Switch girl on her property, and look the leashed girl over.\n\nThen I turn to the switch and we continued to make talking noises, until almost out of the blue... right after I tell them that I wished I had met them when I had just moved out there, the more dominant of the pair asks if I would like to go back to their place for the weekend. I tell her that I'd love to, but I need money to because my light rail pass has run out, she asks how much, and I tell her 'about tree fiddy.' Then we went back to their place and while they were in the bathroom getting ready, I transformed into an ancient sea beast. As they came out, they saw me in my full glory, lying there waiting on their bed, albeit now crushed. \n\nI learned a lot, did a lot that I refuse to regret, and a few things that I do regret. But, it's ok, some things aren't for everyone... Turns out that blumpkin's just aren't for me... Not even if two girls are doing it.\n\nI never saw those two girls after that fucking weekend, I flew home on the morning after the last day with them, and it's a real fucking bummer. It was probably the best, most exploratory weekend in my life. And I was already in the lifestyle when I DID meet them.\n\n\nTl;dr:  Met two very bdsm friendly girls in a mall in San Jose, spent the weekend with them.

{"body": "Hi. I notice you just created this username for this post so I hope you're serious about having a discussion and not just doing a fly by. \n\nI agree that everyone who cares about the environment (or their health or animal welfare) should avoid meat products to the extent that it's possible, in other words become a vegan. I also agree with u/SarahLee that it does come up often enough in articles and discussions if you've been paying attention. However, you're right that an in-depth discussion needs to happen.\n\nI strongly disagree that becoming vegan is the single most important (\"above all else\") thing you can do for the environment. In fact, I think I can argue that if you go vegan and do not take another step that I think is more important that you have done very close to nothing at all. I will try to make that argument here. It's not one that most people want to hear.\n\nI argue that the only step that an individual can take to reduce their environmental footprint is to **make and spend less money.** That's the step most folks who read the internet must take. The other 6 billion or so already lead a pretty sustainable existence.\n\nThis argument depends on the realization that any way you make money and anything you spend money on contributes to environmental devastation. There are numerous ways to show this, but my favorite is this chart from The Union of Concerned Scientists:\n\nhttp://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/images/gw/cooler-smarter/Table-2-average-household-emissions.jpg\n\nMany people are surprised that people in the US only spend a few percent of their carbon footprint on meat eating. **That's because Americans have such big footprints.** Worldwide meat contributes a much higher percentage (not well defined but in my opinion about 15%; exact numbers do not matter for my argument) of greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nIn other words, saying that people who eat meat are the problem might also be construed as an elitist mentality that shifts the blame from high consumers onto low consumers around the world. In still other words \"If only people in China would stop eating meat I could still drive my SUV.\" \n\nI use global warming as a stand in for all environmental problems because most (water use, top soil depletion, habitat destruction, air pollution, etc) have the same root cause and may be cured by the same program. I hope this is not controversial in this sub, but we can have that discussion if necessary.\n\nIn general these observations are based on what I call the \"Energy Theory of Value\" that may be compared to, for example, the \"Labor Theory of Value.\" To a great extent the cost of something is related to how much energy that something uses to be produced. Even the cost of labor is highly correlated with the amount of energy used during that labor. Therefore, in our society where most energy is produced by fossil fuels, the cost of something be it a product or a salary is highly correlated with greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nI have a lot more to say on this but am also afraid of just getting lost in the downvoting or never-viewed-in-the-first-place universe. I had planned on going into why a tree fiddy bag of organic carrots is worse for the environment than the one for a buck, but will wait to see if their any response/interest.\n\nI'll end by saying that most people don't have much control over how they make their money, and no matter how you spend your money there is something called the multiplier effect (you've heard: spend your money locally because every dollar equals whatever) that means how you spend your money is but a very small part of the equation when it comes to the atmosphere.\n\nCan you tell that while composing this I've had a few?\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420426153", "subreddit": "environment", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Henceforth, I declared no one would have the privilege of eating until the monster was found. As they approached me with ire in their eyes, a spray of mist fell upon us as the creature of myth surfaced rebelliously, ready to repel the invaders to its home.\n\nIts silky green head rose to the heavens as I looked the beast in the eyes. I saw my brother’s eyes staring  back into me as I recalled how our father left us, how are mother died too soon, how we used to support each other, how we were the only two people in this darkened world to treat other with love and respect. I will never release those memories and I will never let go of those times.\n\n“Ten thousand big ones to the man who can bring down the myth!” I screamed as my men sprayed bullets which only bounced off Nessie not even leaving a scratch. Her beautiful, grotesque body slammed against our ship, shattering fiberglass like ice. Damned fools, I thought.\n\nI grabbed my harpoon, the same weapon I used and failed to protect my brother. I looked into the savage animal’s eyes and now only saw a target. I released the harpoon from my hands and into the air. For a moment, the entire world stood still as minutes and hours separated my rapid heartbeats. Wood and steel flung through the air ripping the atmosphere around it. I held my breath for what seemed like an eternity when the harpoon pierced the eye of the monster as it let out a wail loud enough for the whole of Scotland to hear.\n\nThe beast now lay dead like my brother. Like my mother. Like anyone who gave a damn about me and gave me purpose. The men rejoiced as their lives suddenly filled with meaning, but for me, the whole world was blind. I sat on the bow of the ship as it sank to the watery, bloody depths below. There is no world, I thought. There’s nothing to me now.

{"body": "TL;DR: Creep who was looking for a fuck buddy put me up on one of those \"GF Revenge\" sites when I got too cozy.\n\nBack in about 2009 I met a nice-looking guy in a bar just off campus. I'd just gotten out of a pretty shitty relationship and wasn't really looking to hook up with anyone new or anything, but any girl in the \"strong, independent phase\" can tell you that's bullshit. At least retroactively. And I know, I know, telling that cute guy in the plaid button-up that men are stupid while nursing a vodka cranberry pretty much says, \"Please fuck me, I'm sad and alone.\" But as I said, that's honestly what post-breakup girls really want. At least after they've had a beverage or two.\n\nAnyway, Mr. Plaid Button-Up replies with a nod and asks me if he can pay for my next drink, and I think, Alright, at least he's not the kind of douche that orders a shot of tequila for \"this pretty lady\" as a quick and \"chivalrous\" way to get in a girl's pants. I told him I wasn't much in a mood for talking. He told me he didn't have anywhere to be, and that sometimes you just need someone to be with. I didn't care how cheesy it sounded; I needed someone to be with too. So we sat together, drank for a couple hours in silence, only breaking it to order more.\n\nHe was right -- having someone else's company is great, even if you don't even know their name. We'd share quick glances and smile as if one of us just gave the most romantic compliment when all we did was share split-second eye contact. I didn't think much of it, just pleasant company when I needed it. After my fifth glass, though, I felt like I wanted his company for more than just this one evening at the bar. So, I turned to him, and burped. And he laughed. And I laughed. It took a minute, but I was able to compose myself enough to ask (the most romantic suggestion a drunk college student can think of), \"Want to go to my place and watch Netflix?\" He laughed again, his laugh sounding effortless and oozing with classic charm, and reached for my hand to help my drunk ass down from the bar stool.\n\nAnd you know where that goes.\n\nI woke up the next morning, with smudged eyeliner and the world's most tangled sex hair, to find a note next to my alarm clock that said \"had to get to class -- I'll be free after 2 today. Text me at (xxx) xxx-xxxx.\"\n\nMy Intro. to Philosophy lecture went until 5:30 that evening so I texted him asking if he'd like to meet up for dinner. I typed, \"Hey it's tattered_colours wanna met up for dinner? :)\"  Quickly after I sent it, I remembered that we never actually exchanged names; not much talking happened even after we left the bar. I then typed, \"This is the girl from last night\" He agreed to dinner and said his name was \"Dick.\" We went to Noodles and Co, and in between bites of the soggiest spaghetti I've ever ate, we made some sort of small talk. Nothing of any significance, mostly complaining about pop radio and the construction on the freeway. As we walked out of the restaurant, I still knew nothing about this guy other than his name as told to me virtually earlier that day, but that was kinda part of the charm, y'know?\n\nOur relationship was pretty much based on that for two months -- no personal stuff, just meet up somewhere, go back to my place for a bang or two, and then he's gone in the morning. As time went by and I started to recover from my last relationship, I realized I wanted more than just a fuck buddy. I wanted someone I could spend all day communicating with via quick glances and shared smiles. I wanted him to come back to me once his class was done at two. I wanted to know more than just his opinion on Katy Perry's latest single. I wanted to know if he felt the same way.\n\nOne morning we got breakfast together at a place usually meant as a preface to our usual nights, and I started asking him questions about his family, his major, his hopes and dreams, you know, the whole \"getting to know you on a deeper level\" shebang. He kinda danced around most of it though, opting instead to either make some sort of witty remark about our surroundings or silence himself with his omelette. This should have been a red flag, but he was wearing that plaid button-down again, and I was ovulating.\n\nThat night began as an exceptionally passionate one. After we had complete round two, my face flush and my clothes strewn across the floor, Dick straddled me and began moving his iPhone around as if he were an artistic photographer. I played along, pouting my lip and winking at him. He kept making loud, fake shutter noises. I asked if he was actually taking pictures, and he laughed off that silly question with that effortless, oozing with charm laugh. I laughed too. He had never been so fun, so much like a boyfriend instead of a fuck buddy. My dreams were starting to come true.\n\nThen he jumped off my bed in a frenzy, remembering that he had to study for his sociology exam. He said he'd text me later. He didn't. I then texted him the next day asking if he wanted to get dinner. He couldn't. I didn't think much of it until he stopped returning my calls. My dream was becoming as unrealistic as it always had been. I was crushed, but I knew I was being silly to think anything would come out of our \"thing.\" We met at a bar and had sex that night. Any guy looking for a relationship would have watched an episode of two on Netflix first.\n\nAbout a week later people on campus started looking at me kinda funny in public (it was a small school -- if you didn't know someone's name, you probably at least knew their face as \"that girl who was always on the bus Wednesday morning last semester\"). Girls scowled and boys nodded. I asked a few of my friends but none of us were ever the \"in the loop\" type, so it wasn't until my land lord told me he wanted me off his property when I found out what was going on. I asked him why and he told me that he didn't want pornographic images of his tenants on the internet with his house in the background.\n\nI was confused by this in more ways than one. My land lord probably had the least shame out of anyone I'd ever met. He's one of those 50 year old dudes who waters the lawn with a hose in just a Speedo. I once saw him carrying a blow up doll, fully inflated, into his house from the passenger seat of his car, but that's another story. Anyway, the point is that although he had no shame in showing me that he had a paid subscription to gfrevenge.com to show me pictures of my exposed body, he still felt it'd be bad for business. He basically told me that I had a week to either move out or get those pictures taken down.\n\nI'm instantly in tears, so he uses his better judgment and left to go get me a box of Kleenex. I can't stop staring at my pouting face and naked breasts that are now plastered on the internet for any and all perverts and college students to look at. There are similar pictures of other victimized girls surrounding my own. Girls who probably also thought they had finally found love but actually found a lowlife scumbag who used them for their personal gratification and her public humiliation. I start to sob even harder, hating myself for not thinking twice about his \"fake shutter noises.\"\n\nSo I'm absolutely livid. I call the guy a few times before leaving heated messages threatening to go to the campus security to have him expelled for sexual harassment. I didn't hear from him until early the next morning. Dick texted me some bullshit like \"how much is a good future worth to you?\" and I called him immediately to spit all sorts of fire when suddenly I hear his ringtone (some country song, how did I not see the signs?) coming from just outside my front door.\n\nI fling open the front door expecting to confront him and all, but for the first time I see him for what he really is. Not the attractive dude from my post-break up period who looked really how in plaid or the same guy who I now wanted to castrate, but... oh god.\n\nI can hardly get the words out. \"Wh... What do you want from me?\"\n\nHe leans in real close and whispers into my ear, \"I'mma need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nI stood there, looking at this 8-story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era, just stunned, until all of a sudden my naked land lord comes out of nowhere, dick-a-flailin', yelling \"GODDAMNIT LOCH NESS MONSTAH SHE AIN'T GIVEN YOU NO TREE FIDDY.\"\n\nNessie turned and slithered down the street, my land lord following close behind.

{"body": "In my opinion, being friends first is the best way to start a relationship.  But it doesn't always work out.\n\nThis story is long but I swear every word of it is true.  No three-fiddy loch ness monsters here.  Reality is harsher.\n\nI had a great female friend that I knew growing up, our relationship was completely platonic for the first 6 years.  We shared a lot of interests, were each other's equals in many ways, and even the ways we were different worked well together--I played the piano, she sang.\n\nWe started dating non-exclusively.  It was still great.  We'd talk about the people we were dating, pretty much affirming we were the only ones right for each other. After 2 years we became exclusive.  6 months later I asked her to marry me and she said yes.\n\nThen she entered a dark time in her life.  She decided to continue on for a Masters but all of her friends decided to graduate and get jobs.  The stress of saying goodbye to all of her friends simultaneously pushed her over the edge.  She found a guy who was willing to be her friend and she suddenly devoted herself to him, replacing the hole that was previously filled by her plethora of friends (she was very outgoing) with only one person.\n\nIf you're guessing what happened next . . . you're wrong.  SO wrong.  She didn't physically cheat on me.  This guy was engaged himself and not interested in my fiancee that way.  I discovered later there is a thing called *emotional* cheating.  Basically, she went to him for everything. She talked to him every day, sometimes for hours at a time.  He told her he was a psychologist, and she treated talking to him like free therapy sessions.\n\nAt first it was fine.  I didn't mind.  She was going to a college a few hours drive from where we lived so I couldn't always be there, so I understood her need for a close by friend.  The distance was never a problem, she'd been going to the same school since before we started dating.  The problem is this guy was not a psychologist.\n\nHere's where it gets weird.\n\nHe was a 19 year old theater major at a college in a small town 80 miles from the nearest small town over.  I questioned how he became a psychologist without a Masters degree.  She told me he had gotten his degree in a condensed program that he completed during high school.  He's a prodigy.  Unlikely, but technically possible.  But how did he get around the state law requiring psychologists to be at least 23 years old?  He knows people.  Powerful people.\n\nIt gets weirder.\n\nHe tells her he's been a practicing psychologist for the last 3 years, having been picked up by the Government to join an organization called the Criminal Psychology Taskforce, which he abbreviated as CPT.  Google can't find it.  *It's a secret organization*.  Why did he even tell me about it if it's so secret?  He trusts me.\n\nExcept he didn't.  When I started prying he changed the nature of their daily conversations. Suddenly he wasn't helping her affirm her love for me, he was helping her understand how controlling I was.  She started confronting me about abuse that never even happened.  Remember that one time you accidentally messed up my pony tail?  You always hated when I put my hair up, that was how you forced me to change my hair for you.  She became more and more irrational with each accusation, like her memory of who I was and the relationship we had started slipping away to be replaced by this monstrosity her \"friend\" had manufactured.\n\n I want to point out here that I understood almost nothing of what was actually happening at the time.  I trusted her more than anyone on Earth.  When she started accusing me of physical abuse I thought I was going insane.  Why don't I remember hitting her?  What's wrong with *me?*  I had to learn not to trust her, to realize that the things she was saying were not real, to keep from losing my own mind.\n\nI found out later this is called gaslighting.  Psychological torture.  I couldn't eat.  I slept for 2 hours a day if I was lucky.  I lost 20 pounds in 2 weeks and was nearly hospitalized.\n\nOne other thing to point out: this girl wasn't stupid (in general), or easily fooled.  She graduated high school valedictorian, and nearly did it again in college. She easily had a genius level IQ, and I could only keep up with her because I was a year older.  What she was, was desperate.  She needed a friend so badly she literally could not believe he was deceiving her, not with any mountain of evidence in front of her.\n\nEventually, she had to choose between her friendship with him and her engagement to me.  She chose him.  She said she had never loved me.  We had known each other for 10 years.  She'd known him for 3 weeks.\n\nThe worst part is that she went to everyone she knew, including most of the people I knew and had known growing up, and told all of them these fictional reasons for ending our relationship.  I know she knew deep down that I didn't abuse her, maybe she thought having more people agree with her would make her feel better, make her more certain she was right to leave me.  I don't know how many of them believed her, but all of them have broken off all contact with me.\n\nShe wrote me a letter a month later apologizing for saying she never loved me and asking if we could be friends again, saying she had ended her friendship with the guy (but reaffirming her belief that he really was a secret agent with the government).  She said she was going through hell because of what she did and she wanted to make it right.  I started to give her a second chance, since it seemed like a heartfelt apology, only to discover she didn't really want to make amends.  She was just lonely because she'd lost her only friend.  I told her that I could never trust her again and therefore could have no relationship with her, not even friendship.\n\nDon't think I left her sobbing alone, though.  She'd already met a wonderful guy and married him a few months later.\n\nAnd don't think I was left in a bad spot either.  I managed to make it through the entire ordeal without once losing my temper or saying something hurtful in anger.  I'm very proud of that, my self-control is very important to me.  I'm also pretty sure much of what she said was intended to evoke that exact response from me, so she could have something real to hate me for and to leave me over.\n\nAnd a while after this whole ordeal I met another girl who became my best friend.  For two years we had a platonic relationship, but I've been there for her when she needed me and she's always been there for me when I needed her.  We started dating a year ago and so far she's been everything my first girlfriend wasn't, in the best way possible.  I can honestly say that I love her more than I've ever loved anyone.\n\nWe're getting married this year.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420453963", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*Oddball* questions, you say?\n\nOn behalf of Chuck Klosterman...\n\n\n1.Let us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn anymore; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence. **Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?**\n\n\n2.Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots. **Would you attempt to do this?**\n\n\n3.Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical. **Which option do you select?**\n\n\n4.You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Credence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it’s being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it’s being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a Capella (but it will only sound this way to you). **Would you swallow the pill?**\n\n\n5.At long last, someone invents \"the dream VCR.\" This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR. **Would you still do this?**\n\n\n6.Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week. **You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?**\n\n\n7.You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson's gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film's \"deeper philosophy.\" **Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?**\n\n\n8.A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commercial success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man). **Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likelihood of you reading this book?**\n\n\n9.You are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that--somewhere--your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill. **Would you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie?**\n\n\n10.You meet a wizard. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, \"I will now make them a dollar more attractive.\" He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But--somehow--this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can't deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though--you can only pay him once. You can't keep giving him money until you're satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front. **How much cash do you give the wizard?**\n\n\n11.For reasons that cannot be explained, cats can suddenly read at a twelfth-grade level. They can't talk and they can't write, but they can read silently and understand the text. Many cats love this new skill, because they now have something to do all day while they lay around the house; however, a few cats become depressed, because reading forces them to realize the limitations of their existence (not to mention the utter frustration of being unable to express themselves). **This being the case, do you think the average cat would enjoy Garfield, or would cats find this cartoon to be an insulting caricature?**\n\n\n12.You have a brain tumor. Though there is no discomfort at the moment, this tumor would unquestionably kill you in six months. However, your life can (and will) be saved by an operation; the only downside is that there will be a brutal incision to your frontal lobe. After the surgery, you will be significantly less intelligent. You will still be a fully functioning adult, but you will be less logical, you will have a terrible memory, and you will have little ability to understand complex concepts or difficult ideas. The surgery is in two weeks. **How do you spend the next fourteen days?**\n\n\n13.You have won a prize. The prize has two options, and you can choose either (but not both). The first option is a year in Europe with a monthly stipend of $2,000. The second option is ten minutes on the moon. **Which option do you select?**\n\n\n14.Your best friend is taking a nap on the floor of your living room. Suddenly, you are faced with a bizarre existential problem: This friend is going to die unless you kick them (as hard as you can) in the rib cage. If you don’t kick them while they slumber, they will never wake up. However, you can never explain this to your friend; if you later inform them that you did this to save their life, they will also die from that. So you have to kick a sleeping friend in the ribs, and you can’t tell them why. **Since you cannot tell your friend the truth, what excuse will you fabricate to explain this (seemingly inexplicable) attack?**\n\n\n15.For whatever the reason, two unauthorized movies are made about your life. The first is an independently released documentary, primarily comprised of interviews with people who know you and bootleg footage from your actual life. Critics are describing the documentary as “brutally honest and relentlessly fair.” Meanwhile, Columbia Tri-Star has produced a big-budget biopic of your life, casting major Hollywood stars as you and all your acquaintances; though the movie is based on actual events, screenwriters have taken some liberties with the facts. Critics are split on the artistic merits of this fictionalized account, but audiences love it. **Which film would you be most interested in seeing?**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420499540", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Nessie sighed, a thunderous roar which echoed through the long, narrow valley. She was almost 300 million years old and flat out of money. \n\n\"What is a crustacean to do?\" she wondered aloud, shattering windows in Inverness. \"Sure, there might be another few days worth of coins behind the cushions of the couch, but its just not enough.\"\n\n\"Could you get a job? Maybe at a fast food place or something?\" said a small voice by her feet. \"Or you could join the scout troop, we sell cookies for three and a half dollars a box!\" Nessie looked down in surprise at the young girl by her front left foot. \"You should be a firefighter! Or a... or an astronaut!\" the girl continued excitedly. \"Maybe a nurse, no a doctor!\"\n\n\"Yeah! A doctor! You don't need to follow society's gender roles.\" she said reprovingly. \"That's what my mummy says at least.\"\n\nNessie looked thoughtfully down at the small pink thing by her foot. \"I'm too old to learn to be a doctor I think.

{"body": "IP Gains should be increased. The importance of owning more rune pages and runes has drastically increased. I used to be satisfied with having 2 full rune pages (full ad and ap) and it was enough for me to get to gold. However, as the meta has progressed and the more efficient routes have been found, it is not as effective to be running the same rune page on two different champs. So although, you can still run AD marks + quints and standard Armour + mr seals/glypths, there are much better combinations that would help you win the matchup easier. Back then, the fewer amount of champs meant a) less to buy and understand and b) less variation for meta picks that were strong at the time. Now however, it is almost vital to own many champs including the 6300s - 4800s to be able to compete against the meta champs such as zed ori syndra jayce etc. \nTL;DR Put simply, it has become more expensive to be able to compete at the norm since the game has grown so much. It would be advisiable to increase the flow of ip. I believe the xp grind is still valuable and healthy for keeping them in a learning environment (pre-30) but ip gains need to be changed so that they start really high say 200% and progressively go back to the normal ip gain. This way, new players get more commodity to experience champs and runes with and it won't prevent the ip grind that riot loves sooo much.

{"body": "I love telling this story, so I hope that this thread blows up. This wasn't OK Cupid - it was Tinder.\n\nI've been texting a girl I matched with on Tinder. She's blonde and pretty cute. She's also studying dramatic writing, which I think is cool because I spend a lot of my free time writing. I'm still on the fence about meeting her, though.\n\nOn Friday night, she asks where I live. I tell her my neighborhood. She tells me that she lives in Brooklyn and that she's busy Friday night but will be in the city on Saturday night. Late Saturday night (around 1) she texts me and says that she's at a nearby bar.\n\nThe neighborhood I live in definitely has some fun bars, don't get me wrong, but it is one of the sketchier areas in the city. If you're taking the trouble to come to Manhattan from another borough, this isn't a neighborhood you go drinking in. I thought it was odd, but hey, a girl wants to see me.\n\nI take a ten minute walk and get to the bar. The bouncer looks at my ID (an old one that still lists my age as \"Under 21,\" but most bouncers check my birth date and see that I'm legal) but doesn't let me in, which surprised me because I've been to this bar multiple times. Hindsight, serious blessing in disguise.\n\nI walk out of the bar and text the girl something along the lines of \"Hey, bouncer won't let me in, not sure why. Have fun with your friend, we'll try another time.\" I was indifferent about the whole thing - I was pretty tired and my roommates still had some friends in the apartment. She texts me and tells me to wait outside for a minute, so I do. The girl who comes out to greet me isn’t the girl whose pictures I’ve been looking at.\n\nThis girl is overweight and about six inches shorter than the girl in the picture. I’m already extremely uncomfortable. I try to tell her, “Hey, it’s nice to meet you in person, but don’t ditch your friend – we can go out another time.” She tells me “that’s okay” and just starts walking with me, completely abandoning whoever she was with.\n\nWe take about five steps away from the bar and she admits that she looked me up on facebook. Now I know that this is commonplace, but it’s not something that even occurred to me to do – it was just a casual meetup with someone from Tinder. I didn’t notice it, but she and I had two mutual friends. One was a girl I hadn’t really spoken to since freshman year (I’ve since graduated from college) and the other was a friend from middle school. She told me that she had asked them all about me, but believe it or not, they couldn’t tell her much. I’m getting a bit frightened. I don’t want to be completely rude, so I decide that I’ll at least try to talk to her for a little while. We end up on a bench outside a “park” near my apartment building. I sit down next to her and she immediately puts her head on my shoulder.\n\nI don’t know what to do here, so I kind of lift my shoulder until she’s sitting upright again. She picks her head up, so I figure that she got the message. But then she turns around, lifts her legs over the arm of the bench and puts her head on my lap. I try to slide away from her, but she just keeps moving with me. I shift a little more and she turns and starts looking at me. I start to say “Hey…,” hoping that she’ll finally back off. Instead she starts nuzzling her head into my crotch.\n\nIt’s around 1:30 now. I tell her that “it’s kinda late, and your friend is still back at the bar, right?” She agrees to leave. I start to walk away, but she walks considerably more slowly than I do (presumably because I’m about a foot taller than her). Three blocks to go.\n\nShe then tries to hold my right hand. I gently shake it off and take my phone out of my pocket. I text my roommates and visiting friend: “She’s trying to hold my hand. Text me every twenty seconds so I can pretend to text you back.” None of them do. I assume they’re all laughing and trying to fuck me over.\n\nIt’s becoming clear to her that I won’t be putting my phone away, so she leaves my right side and walks to my left side. She couldn’t hold my right hand, so she thought she could hold my left. Luckily I saw this coming and buried my hand into my pocket. She ended up grabbing at air while I appeared to be frantically attempting to scratch my ankle through my pants leg. Two blocks to go.\n\nShe tells me that she’s working on her senior thesis, a sitcom pilot. I ask her what it’s about. She describes it as “a lot like Everybody Loves Raymond.” I’m thinking “okay, certainly not my favorite show but definitely still funny.” So I ask her to describe it.\n\n“Well, it’s about a girl who drops out of school and moves to Hawaii to run a schnitzel cart.” I couldn’t even come up with a response. I can see the bar now. One block to go.\n\nShe asks me what my birthday was. I mumble that it’s September 19th. She stops walking, looks me right in the eye and says:\n\n“September 19th is my lucky day.”\n\nI can barely squeak out a terrified “why?” before she answers: \n\n“Because good things happen to me on September 19th.”\n\nI whisper “Such as?” and she responds cheerily with:\n\n“Well, I’ve never had a bad September 19th.” I wonder how on earth anyone could consider that grounds for their own lucky day. Doesn’t matter; the bar is across the street. The red hand on the crossing light is mocking me. Thirty seconds and it’s all over.\n\nI peek down at her and find that she’s staring at me again. I look up once more and exhale in relief as I see the white guy on the sign ushering me forward. We walk across the street. I muster up my best “It was nice meeting you.” She goes in for a hug and I give her some sort of innovative half handshake/half pat on the back. I start to walk away when she says “Wait!” I turn around and she says “So, Tuesday, right?”\n\nI jog back to my apartment and tiptoe past my sleeping friends.\nWithout taking off my coat or my shoes I sit down at my laptop and log into facebook. I find her and block her, then unfriended our mutual friends. I then blocked her on tinder and told myself that if she ever texted me again I would block her phone number.\n\nA week goes by and things quiet down. I've told the story to my friends and we've all gotten a good laugh out of it. My roommate is going to his friend's housewarming party, so my other roommate and I decide to tag along. Lo and behold, guess who's at the party.\n\nI see her before she sees me. She's sitting on a couch in the living room. I duck into the kitchen and fix myself a drink, out of her view. I mingle for a few minutes and try to figure out how I can avoid her (I have no choice but to walk right past her). No such luck.\n\nShe grabs me by the arm as I walk by, and asks \"Hey, can we talk?\" I can't exactly decline, so she leads me into a corner and starts talking to me.\n\n\"So I noticed you haven't texted me all week.\"\n\n\"Sorry, I've been really busy at work lately.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay. Do you want to meet up tomorrow? Or maybe go somewhere later?\"\n\n\"I don't know...\"\n\n\"Did I come on too strong?\" she asks.\n\n\"Yes. That's exactly it. It was just too much too fast, and I'm sorry. Maybe we can be friends.\"\n\n\"Okay, I see how it is. I'm sorry I annoyed you so much.\"\n\nShe looks like she's about to start crying, so I try to calm her down. The last thing I need is her making a scene. \"It's really okay, I'm not *mad* or anything.\"\n\nTears start streaming down her face. People have stopped talking and I can tell that everyone is staring at me. She's practically screaming at this point. *\"Well, if you're not mad, can I ask you for something?!\"* \n\nI can feel my cheeks reddening. I ask her calmly and quietly - \"What do you need?\" \n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nOnly then did I realize that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again. \"Dammit Monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nI swear to God that this is a true story. Except for the tree fiddy, all of this actually happened. I just figured that this detailed, infamous personal anecdote was also my best chance to trick people.\n\nTL;DR - I got catfished on Tinder and publicly shamed at a party.\n\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1420639811", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 707, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is understandable. I think what most people are annoyed about (me included) is the confusing lack of communication, and complete inconsistency with their recent releases. \r\rFor example, if there was communication about the adapters, I don't think as many people would be frustrated. If I knew that there would be limited stock, I would have preordered, but I didn't because I was expecting to be able to find them in stores. You could make the argument that they underestimated demand. Fair enough, that happens. But how about some clarification from Nintendo after the fact? We STILL don't know if we're getting more, and getting any kind of official response from Nintendo is harder to find than Bigfoot riding the Loch Ness Monster. \r\rAnd then there's Amiibos. Again, of course there would be limited/one-run ones, but how about a better way of telling people than waiting for them to sell out in **one day**, and then being like, \"oh hey lol btw we're not making those ever again thx for buying.\" Never mind the fact that future Amiibbo availability is also really vague and confusing, due to their cloudy statements. I know plenty of people who would have hauled their ass to a store to get first dibs on a Marth Amiibo if they weren't deceived into thinking it would actually stay on shelves for a while like a normal fucking product. If Nintendo were more clear with their supply, they still would have sold out to the last unit and retained all their profit, only far less people would be pissed off and butthurt, because far less stock would be in the hands of lucky scalpers who just happened to catch wind of it before anyone else did.\r\rAnd then there's this. Limited edition? Sure. Super limited edition? Alright. That's fine. But slapping it on the internet completely randomly in a Tuesday morning with no kind of prior announcement, and then \"selling out\" in hours? Fuck anyone that has a day job, or who didn't happen to be sitting on Reddit at the right time. Fuck anyone who's favorite game is MM but weren't on their computer. I managed to order one from Gamestop (the big bundle), but now I'm paying $40 more than I bargained for, and I'm sure plenty of people won't even have that luxury.\r\rIF Nintendo opens up more product and more people manage to get it (which probably will happen, but who knows), you can bet your ass that it's going to be vague and confusing, with little to no communication or clarification from Nintendo, since that's been their trend lately.\r\rtl;dr nintendo's horrible communication is a bigger problem than limited quantities.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420660899", "subreddit": "nintendo", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

It was a cool night, with a gentle breeze. It was around 2 I heard the first noise, it sounded as if it was far away (20 miles at least.) I was mildly curious but went back to reading my book. About 10 minutes later I heard the noise again, this time much more distinct. It sounded like rocks crunching one another with a ghastly background noise. Getting sort of creeped out at this point, I stop reading and just sort of listen. So the noises start getting more frequent as we speed toward what I can only assume is the source. I'm getting really nervous at this point as these sounds are getting extremely loud...I see the rocks just in time and crank the train to a screeching halt. It looked as though an avalanche had occurred nearby and some of the debris had spilled over onto the tracks. So I get out to survey the track when I hear the noise right behind me...I turn around to see it is in fact not a pile of rocks....It is only then I realize it is actully a 80 foot tall sea monster from the Paleozoic era blocking the path. HOW DID I NOT SEE IT?! \"I can help you move the rocks but I'm gonna need about tree fiddy,\" he said. \"I DONT HAVE NO TREE FIDDY GODDAMN LOCH NESS MONSTA!\" She grumbled and lumed away.

If you consider that rude, oh well. Blame reality, not me. It's nothing but a poor assemblage of lies.\n\n&gt;I am curious... Are the Nobel Laureates below, also Morons? Are they imbeciles because the beliefs they hold, which are based on what they perceive as relevant evidence, happens to be incongruent with yours? They are idiots because they believe theism makes more sense?\n\nThe word \"nobel\" isn't even contained in the article. \n\nBut in general, if they are basing their beliefs on \"evidence [that is] incongruent with [mine]\", then yes... Either they are morons, or I'm a moron. (Note: you excluded the possibility of ignorance.)\n\n&gt;CHARLES TOWNES... ROBERT MILLIKAN... ERWIN SCHRÖDINGER... MAX PLANCK...\n\nNone are mentioned in the article. As far as I see from skimming it, the only people mentioned are Francis Crick, Richard Dawkins and Frederick Hoyle.\n\n&gt;(MILLIKAN)  “To me it is unthinkable that a real atheist could be a scientist.”\n\nDemonstrating he used the wrong definition for the word \"atheist\". Clearly he means \"gnostic atheists\". But the same idea can be applied to theists, and quite validly. If you already have the answer, you can't be a good scientist.\n\n&gt;(SCHRÖDINGER) ...God and eternity, Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously\n\nSeems to be saying one of two things. Either, one, essentially what Millikan said, that those who propose to have the answers in absence of evidence are wrong, regardless of god-concepts. Or two, nature has really remarkable things, and god-concepts are pretty mundane in comparison. Context would be helpful, but I really don't care enough about quote-mining to bother.\n\n&gt;(PLANCK) “Both religion and science need for their activities the belief in God… God represents the basis, for the latter - the crown of any reasoning concerning the world-view.\n\nYou notice how this runs contrary to Millikan's statement...? One or the other is wrong.\n\nSmart people can be morons too.  Intelligence is not immune to indoctrination.\n\n&gt;I find the God/Atheist debate fascinating. For many God MUST exist. For others God MUST NOT exist. Neither position seems logically tenable.\n\n&gt;Me? I don't know the answer.\n\nAnd yet you *claim* not to be an atheist, while expressing the one single idea of atheism - rejection of god claims. Why is it that you, as an atheist, so vehemently deny being an atheist?\n\nSeriously! This isn't some twisted recruitment tactic, or argument for/against [insert god claim]. Consider, why do you feel it necessary to **not** be an \"atheist\"? Why avoid that one label?? Would you be so adamant about having fence-posts deep in your ass about anything else? String theory, quantum mechanics, infinite/finite universe? Why about religion? \n\nI submit a probable answer is that religion is afforded some special pedestal, *even for those who don't agree with it*. Well fuck that. It prejudism. Yes, being neutral is prejudism, because you **aren't** neutral. People also aren't neutral about being gay,... You are either gay or not gay - you are either not theist or theist. You refuse to be identified as \"not theist\". Are you so adamant to make sure no one mistakenly thinks you're a theist?\n\nTheism is a *concept*. A completely unfounded concept, with so much baggage that, yes, in general, it is stupid, but a concept none-the-less. I have no doubt I have stupid ideas, and I do my best to recognize what they are and change them. What I do ***NOT*** do is claim \"I don't know\" when it comes to any *other* stupid idea I hold opinions on. I do know that I do not believe that Jesus is my Messiah, who died on the Cross for me, whose love for me in embodied by the Holy Spirit, and who sits on the right-hand of God, the Father and Creator, Lord Almighty. Or Thor, or Zues, or Allah, or Ningizzida, or Yahweh, or Shiva, or any others. \n\nAnd I don't refrain from labeling people that believe they know and love and have a \"personal relationship\" with Big Foot, aliens or Nessie, morons. Deeply deluded morons. And I feel it completely unnecessary, except in this one context, to point out I also do ***not*** deny that Big Foot or aliens or unidentified large deep-sea creatures *might* exist.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420724547", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

But I am not alone, I have many other important gods and figures and symbolistic things from  every other religion with me at the moment. No, I am not sending you to hell. Right now, I have Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva, Buddha, Power of the Universe, Allah, as well as most of the Greek Gods, many Hawaiian Gods, and the Star of David. Satan can't be here right now, unfortunately. Would've been nice to have a different opinion. \"  \n\"Wow... Is this a dream?\"  \n\"No, it is not. We are making the decision of whether or not to destroy the human population or not to. Humans have done many horrible things and are capable of mass destruction. They are slowly killing our creations and even though they are enforcing more orderly laws and having more regulated societies, we need to put an end to them. They fucked up, in shorter words. We were expecting humans to make great advances at this time, but now they are focusing on making bigger and bigger and bigger weapons.\"  \n\"So, you need my help, or what?\"  \n\"We need you to convince us to keep the human race, and not to destroy it.\"  \n\"But, why me?\"  \n\"You are atheist, seem to have no bias, the only group you have real prejudice against is bullies and you only really hate people like Hitler, Serial Killers, and preteen boys, and have an average salary and average looks. Now, please give us your opinion.\"  \n\"Umm.. uhh.. okay.. could you give me some ti-\"  \nWhen I started speaking, everything went black. I heard God say, \"Who in the heavens did that?\" and a educational, peaceful, voice, say, \"I did. The man needs dark and quiet to find his peace of mind.\"  \n\"Well, Jeez, Budda, ya didn't need to unplug the whole damn sun,\" I heard someone say in a smartass tone.  Buddha said, \"Well, if the world ends, better give the humans some preparation. Everyone needs preparation- it helps in life.\"  God said, \"Would you guys shut up? Let the human think. Buddha, he can't have peace of mind if you're opening your mouth.\" Power of the Universe started to speak,\"Well-\"     \"SHHHHHHHH,\" Everybody replied. I smirked. Even gods argue.  \nSuddenly, in all this lighthearted chatter, I realized- the existence of humans is my responsibility. Shit, I need to start thinking. Should I do something short and sweet? Like, \"J-Law's tits,\"? Or should I give a long, heartfelt answer? I have no idea. I'll just bullshit this. It'll be more honest that way.    \n\"Okay. I'm going to ask for no interruptions.\"  \n\"*cough cough* Buddha *cough cough*\"  \n\"No interruptions, Zeus.\"  \n\"Sorry.\"  \n\"Okay, so, first of all. You created us, thousands of years ago. We have developed over a long, long course of time, and our species is almost perfected. All of this effort, for nothing? Hmm? Also, most of the war, and killing, and violence, and prejudice, is caused by you. By your books. Your teachings. Haven't you made an effort to communicate to the world that all of this prejudice is wrong? This is why I was an atheist. How are you gods, the mightiest form of existence, not communicating to the world that war is wrong? That God DOESN'T hate fags? I'm sorry my argument is based on questions, but truly, I'm wondering all of this, and it adds to my argument. YOU created us, taught us these things, and YOU are too lazy to fix it.   \nFinally, a few last words.  \n...  \n...  \n...   \n...  \nI also got about tree fiddy.\"  \n  \n  \n\"Turn the lights back on, the humans are staying, nothing is changing.\"\n\nEdit: If you have the cloud to butt chrome extension, the story might be a little confusing.\n\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420745097", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I looked you up yesterday and here's what I gotta say.\n\n\nDiversify your reviews. So far you've almost exclusively reviewed loaded boards (except Never Summer's Tesseract, and the nessie). There's enough reviews out there for every loaded and the nessie. I was hoping for much, much more from your Paris 150 review since you said it'd be a comparison, but the entire article could have been summized by saying \"theyre like Paris 180s, but smaller.\" In general I find your reviews are on par to most, but I also feel most reviews for gear are very vague and unhelpful...\n\n\nI understand that you can't be buying new boards constantly, and if you love loaded enough to own (and justify the price of buying) 5 of their boards, fuck yeah, but go more in depth on the board features and feel, or try different set ups, or have videos of you riding, or something. Another thing is just because you're a review site doesnt mean thats all you can do. Make tech articles, skate vids, post about new shit coming out, etc. \n\n\nNot to personally attack you either, but one thing that also bothers me about reviews that you also adhere to the lack of rider profile. If youre reviewing 76a cannibals as a grom whose never broke 20, but go online to say they're fast as fuck downhill wheels, you fucked up. Everyone knows cannibals are dope, but if you're not experienced enough to actually use them as intended you won't have any real useful knowledge on the product. Like in your overland review you said the flex fucked up your slides and the tail was too big. If you've never ridden a free ride board with a dampening flex, or mastered ollies on a big board, you're gonna hate it, but if you're an old schooler who did freeride on an old flat dervish, and you're used to ollieing a long board, youll probably enjoy it a lot more.\n\n\nOr like if someone bought a gravity brad Edwards and tried to take it to the park without ever having ridden in a park. Its gonna suck majorly. Your personal skill and your body greatly influences how you view products, so if you say you don't like the tail of your board but also cannot even Ollie a skateboard, let alone a 38\" featherweight plank with tall ass trucks and huge wheels, you fucked up.\n\n\nNot to discourage you or anything, but at the moment your reviews are basically a text version of the loaded product overview videos, just without any riding for credibility. Reviews should tell you more about a board than what you can read in product descriptions. \n\n\nSorry if that was rough but I don't see the point in not giving my true feelings on something when people ask for criticism.

{"body": "&gt;Why do you have to believe on or the other? What about agnostics?\n\nSo your ignorance is even greater than I originally thought. That's actually impressive. Agnosticism is about knowledge, not belief. For example, what would your response be if I asked you \"Do you believe you locked the door or not?\" You could only have one of two answers. Either you believe you did or you believe you didn't. \n\nYou can't say \"I don't know.\" Because \"I don't know if I believe I locked the door or not\" is a nonsensical answer. You may not **know** whether you locked the door or not, but you  **believe** one or the other. Just like I *believe* the answer to 1831/882 is not an integer but I don't *know* it. \n\nTherefore, you either *do* or *don't* believe in an afterlife, while you may not *know* of its veracity.\n\n&gt;I choose to disbelieve the theory of a dragon at the Earth's core because there were no previous stories of it. \n\nSo then do you believe in dragons? Because there have been tons of stories of dragons. What about krakens? Cthulu? Lots of stories of those. In 1000 years when people read Harry Potter and confuse it for history, will it be right for them to believe that wizards and witches were real?\n\n&gt;For example, there are many stories of sightings of Bigfoot or The Loch Ness Monster or ghosts or UFO's, so those stories hold some weight despite solid evidence. Yes they might someday be proven false, but through several people truly believing and investing time researching to find out the truth, it holds weight, in my opinion\n\nSo then, I suppose you're a follower of every major religion in the world all at once, even though such a thing is impossible. After all, there are *lots* of stories for each of those religions and *lots* of people truly believe in them and invest a lot of time into researching the truth on those religions. So you're at the same time a Hindu, a Buddhist, a Christian, a Jew, a Jain, a Muslim. Again, even though that's impossible.\n\n&gt;And there are many people over thousands of years who claim to have seen God or Heaven, and believed it was real as opposed to having a lucid dream and realizing afterwards that it was not real.\n\nA lot of people believing something doesn't make it true, you moron.\n\n&gt;After a lucid dream, you realize it's not real...but after a vision of the afterlife, they believe it was real, and this happened with many many people, even those who were atheist.\n\nNo, not really. \n\n&gt;As there is no way to solidly prove the realness of such visions, also how it generally is a faith vs logic conflict, it will remain a debate that is unsettle-able.\n\nIt's only unsettle-able if you *truly* think the question of the tooth fairy and Santa Claus remain unsolved. Basically, you have to be a fucking idiot.\n\n&gt;PS: I have a brother who is genuinely retarded/special needs.\n\nI think from your posts' logic and sentence structure and wording, it's more likely that you've mistaken your brother for yourself.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420841406", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When people imagine themselves with some super human power, they immediately place themselves in their minds above others. This may manifest itself in the want to protect the needy, or maybe conquer the world. This scenario has been played out in countless comic books, and arguably Superman was above us mortal earthlings. So maybe it just depends on what you get. I, unfortunately attained possibly one of the shittiest powers of all time. Everyone is concerned with themselves, and this \"power\" I was bestowed with only turned me into an egomaniac.\n\nI wasn't the most popular guy in school, but I had a decent amount of friends. Just enough to not feel like a loser, but just enough to want to be known around more. My \"sixth sense\" kicked in around my 10th or 11th grade of school, I don't really recall which. It started off pretty unnoticeable. I'd be standing around in a circle with some of my friends, laughing about some stupid story I was telling and whenever someone said my name they kinda glowed. I didn't really give it much attention, I figured that I was just seeing things and that I needed to calm down from the attention I was receiving. As it gained strength, it became obvious that the more aware of the people discussing me I was, the subtler the glow. If I was completely oblivious to someone's conversation, their whole body emanated a furious red aura. \n\nI slowly fed into the urge to see what people were saying until it became a full on obsession. I NEEDED to know who it was, and it wasn't long before I was skipping classes so I could walk around and look at that beautiful red glow. I was so zealous in my search for the mystery back talkers, usually only to find out it was my friends or the girl I was currently interested in. Nothing too special, but I was an addict and my grades quickly fell. It wasn't long before people began to become creeped out at me mysteriously appearing whenever my name was said, and I became somewhat of an outcast...  \n\nI lost a lot of people who didn't want to be associated with \"the snooper,\" and I found myself miserable. Months went by before I saw the red glow that had once made me so happy. I sat in disbelief for a second before I immediately started walking towards the source of my depression, half heartedly telling my parents I was going to the bathroom. My spirits soared when I spotted two cute girls I knew that radiated the burning glow that slowly dulled to a subtle golden tone. I resisted the strong urge to scream for joy. It had been an eternity of irrelevance and being in the spotlight, even for a moment, made me happier than I had been in months. I wanted more than anything in the world to attempt to listen into the conversation they were having, but I knew that that was what had gotten me into this mess in the first place. I turned around and began to walk back, and faced two men briskly walking towards me. Clean cut, well fitted, and clearly expensive suits burning crimson. The colors died as soon as I laid eyes on them, the two men held faces of shock. \n\nI looked around for my parents, and decided that I would have to handle this situation alone. Clearly the men had been caught off guard, but it seemed their temporary surprise had been replaced with an intense determination. They continued their brisk walk towards me, and I mirrored their actions. \n\n\"We've finally caught up to you, you bastard,\" one of the suited men barked at me.\n\n\"Years and years of credit card debt finally come to fruition today Kyle, you're under arrest.\" \n\nHe handed me a piece of paper, and as I quickly scanned down the page I noticed the accrued sum. \n\nThis had to be a mistake?! \n\nHow am I in three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt?\n\n\"We're gonna need about tree fiddy\" \n\nIt was at this moment I realized that one of the men was in fact not a man, and actually a 500 ft tall aquatic animal from the paleolithic era. \n\nGOD DAMMIT THAT LOCH NESS MONSTER GOT ME AGAIN.\n\n(hahaha sorry about the shit ending, it was my first post and I got cold feet. hopefully i'll have a better one prepared)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420845883", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Craig realizes that there is absolutely no chance of him getting me to leave so he comes clean and tells me he scouts places out alone and when he thinks he found a good enough spot he rigs the building with recording devices that play certain sounds in certain areas and sets up fake web pages to go along with his \"facts and rumors\" and then makes up a story about why the ghost or whatever is here and what happened to make this place so haunted when he's done telling me he makes me swear not to tell anyone out there because they respect him as an actual paranormal investigator and some even believe in his lies. I didn't care I thought they should know and I told him right to his face listen they have a right to know you should've been upfront about this before maybe they could've helped you make the show more believable and he stopped me and asked what I was getting paid for tonight I told 200$ and he said he'd double it i accepted because as I said above I needed the money. \n\n&gt;Well as I was leaving he stopped me once again and asked why he should trust me what if as soon as I get my money I go and tell people on the Internet or tell the rest of his crew I thought it was a fair point so I asked him what I had to to earn his trust and Craig looked me right in my optical stems and said I need about tree fiddy at this moment I realized Craig wasn't any ordinary tv host no Craig was a 15ft tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era and I screamed I ain't giving you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness monster get your own goddamn money and then I ran from the apartment building and never looked back\n\n&gt; TL;DR Fuck you I took the time out of my day to write that on my phone to the least you could do is read it\n\nWhat a mess.\n\nI'm sorry folks, I've done all I can.

If Discovery did one on bigfoot or the loch Ness monster, I'd be down.\n\nHOWEVER, what was truly frustrating was the advertising and push to say, \"No, this is *real*!\" And people actually believing it because Discovery approached it the way they did. There was no wink and nudge to the audience, it wasn't put out as something just for fun. They seemed like they were working to *not* clue people in, and it was weird that the follow-up documentary went so far as to try and dispel \"rumors\" that the first wasn't authentic. That, paired with the brand of The Discovery Channel was just a bad combination that ended up looking like they were purposefully feeding us bull to trick us. \n\nIf the rest of Discovery's content was quality, I would totally welcome a few obviously fake but fantasy-indulgent documentaries.

{"body": "Story time then.\n(Spoiler, the answer is yes).\n\nSo years ago when I was in school, I took German as a first foreign language (basically we had to work on a first language, then a few years later a second one. Most people took English 1 and Spanish 2, but I was totally on the margins of society so I took German 1 and English 2, and then Russian 3, because why the fuck not, and have no recollection of how German works whatsoever).\n\nWhen I was about 13-14 I had a German teacher who was that older lady (probably in her 50s). She drove a crappy orange VW Beetle that everyone had of course seen in the parking lot (it was the mid-90s and a private school, so most teachers made decent money and had new-ish cars).\n\nThe teacher was boring and kind of a bitch, so of course us kids would do lots of things beside following the lectures. So that one time I was with a friend, let's call him John, and we're at the back of the class. We're doodling, because we're bored. At some point I doodled a Darth Vador with a huge errection in place of his lightsaber (I had watched one of the Star Wars the week before or something). I show it to my friend, he snickers, takes it and makes a speach bubble beside the darth vador saying something like \"I'm gonna fuck all the bitches\".\n\nOf course as we weren't paying any attention, we didn't see the teacher walking up to us. She snatches the drawing out of his hand, looks at it, is outraged. We get admonished for drawing filth during class and she takes the drawing and throws it in the trashcan. For us, that's the end of it.\n\nFew days later, we learn that we're getting detention (basically the school had adult hall monitors that would make sure kids didn't mess about during classes, that no fights broke out during recess, and did tech support for the teachers. They also delivered detention notes after they were processed by the administration). Detention noticies had notes about the reason why we were getting them, mostly so our parents would know why.\n\nThat time (because of course it wasn't the first time for either of us), it said vandalism on teacher property. John and me each thought it was a bit harsh, considering we were basically drawing dicks on our own paper.\n\nSo we go to the headmaster, and ask him why the fuck we're getting punished. He tells us the German teacher said we vandalized her car. Of course neither of us knew about it (turns out her car wasn't even touched by anybody). We tell the headmaster that the only issue we've had with the teacher is the Darth Vador incident, and that we'll be happy to get a fair punishment for it, but that getting punished for something we didn't do was unfair.\n\nTo which he responded that even if it was true, and even if we could prove it, he wouldn't take the side of students over faculty.\n\nAfter that we took every opportunity to make the teachers life hell, because we had to merit our hours of detention. After a while the teacher confronted us and asked us \"what do you want from me ?\" I took the lead and said : \"about tree fiddy\". That's when I realized that she didn't like us because we were 8-stories tall and from the paleolitic era. She was just racist.\n\nActually true story (except the last part)\n\nTl;dr : Me and a friend got detention at school for acts of vandalism on a teachers car. Car hadn't even been vandalised, she just wanted to punish us for doodling dicks while in class.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420901383", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I'll never forget this one client I had. *Real* piece of shit, but hey, it's my job to make sure he gets the fair treatment the justice system requires, right?\n\nSo this guy was up for a long string of charges. I can't go into exact detail because he's still in appeals, but let's just say that the more serious charges rhyme with \"shmirst shmegree shmattery,\" \"shmassault with a smheadly shmeapon, and \"shmattempted shmurder.\" Like I said, real piece of work.\n\nBeing an attorney for guys like this is tough because you don't necessarily want to just throw your client to the dogs, but you also have an innate sense of morality. Luckily, I was a mid-level defense attorney, so I was able to strike a sort of balance, at least as was justifiable to me when it came to looking myself in the mirror and sleeping soundly at night. This particular client never actually admitted guilt, but anyone with common sense knew that he was all but standing trial before a jury of 12 eyewitnesses. \n\nStill, the justice system and due process demand they be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and it was my job to scrounge up what reasonable doubt I could find for my mid-level defense attorney salary. I was not, nor am currently, even a junior partner in my firm, so I had little reason to go above and beyond for any of my clients, let alone a piece of shit like this guy, but I wasn't exactly about to toss an alley-oop to the prosecutors, either. \n\nSo the first day of trial comes, and at this point, we've been through multiple plea bargains that our client has refused. This guy was adamant that he was not guilty, and I wasn't exactly in the position to tip my hand and let him know that he was pretty fucked. When you're just another lawyer cog in the firm's wheel, you know what that's like. I tried a number of tactics and angles to get the guy to take a plea bargain, but he always refused. We actually had a fairly sweet deal at one point, but this guy was just that much of a cunt that he would rather go the entire distance with his not guilty plea and lose and spend 20+ years in jail than bargain with the ADA. I don't think I'll ever understand his rationale. \n\nSo of *course* the ADA brings out her A material during the opening statement. But she went far beyond even what I expected her to do in the opening salvo, and this was after seven years of trial experience including my Public Defender tenure. I had never seen this kind of reaming even in TV shows. Judge Judy would have been in awe at this fucking speech. Once she finished, I asked if we could recess briefly. I don't know if the judge was as blown away as I was or what, or maybe he just knew what I was trying to do, but he allowed it. \n\nI took my client into a side room and begged him to take a plea deal. Apparently this ADA's opening argument had gotten to him as well because he was very willing to accept, which was shocking considering his vehemence leading up to the trial and his attitude through the multiple plea bargains offered before.\n\nSo the ADA, myself, and the judge met in the judge's chambers to speak about the possibility of a renewed plea bargain. Obviously, the ADA had the upper hand since it had gotten to this point and she had just given a speech that the best writers in Hollywood would cum to hear, but anything was better than the three week trial and 20+ year sentence my client was facing. For everyone involved, really.\n\nSo the ADA was sitting there looking rather smug, and I felt the judge also understood the upper hand she had, but she still left it up to me to start the negotiation. She asked me what my client and I wanted.\n\nI said, \"About tree fiddy.\" it was about that time that she noticed that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. She said, \"Dammit, monsta, get outta my damn courtroom!\" They ended up taking the plea anyway and my client got 8 years plus 10 probation.\n\nTL;DR You should almost always take the plea bargain", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420905664", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

He hired me and me and my team began to build his case.  The evidence against him was quite overwhelming but we did everything we could to help win the case. It was the day of his final court date and would decide if he was to spend years in prison or not. They brought him in to the court room in shackles and sat him next to me. I thought something looked different about him since I saw him last but couldn't place it. We waited our turn for his hearing outside the court room. I went over what our plea bargain was that I had struck with the D.A. He seemed pleased by the offer. After he leaned close to me and said Mr. Kilgore____Trout before we go in I have to tell you something about the case. I was anxious to see what he would say and hoped it wasn't an omission of guilt since that would make my job so much harder to do. He looked me in the eyes and said \"but before I tell you I need you to promise something\". I told him I couldn't promise him anything before I heard what he had to say as it could be unlawful. He told me Sir I just need something from you thats all. I ask the client what it was that he needed. As the words came out of his mouth I stepped back away from him in horror.

{"body": "Attended the wedding of my best friend recently. Him and his SO had been together for years and were truly madly in love. The type of relationship everyone dreams of. They met while backpacking the Pacific Crest Trail and finished the last three months of the trail with each other. He had asked me to be his best man and I grateful accepted. Tried to work out the perfect speech that was funny and serious at the same time. The wedding was held in a beautiful mountain resort high in the Rocky Mountains. All the guest stayed in cabins next to amazing natural hot springs. The grooms family arrived all flying in from the South. The groom had always told me how conservative his family was and how if him and his SO ever got married it would be a true culture clash at the wedding. Most of the brides family flew in from the Northwest. The grooms family mostly good ole boys and girls from the south seemed a bit put off by the \"hippie\" cabins they were staying in. The brides family couldn't be more happy as they were northwestern liberal hippies themselves. The groom had mentioned to me that he hadn't invited his younger brother because he had always had an issue with the Bride. I found that to be fair and knowing the groom for quite sometime figured if he thought it was best to exclude his brother from the event he must have had a good reason. When the wedding started everyone excitedly took there places. The families pilled in and I took my place at the front next to the groom. Oh boy did he look sharp that day! Finally the bride and her father appeared and all eyes were on her as he walked her down the isle. She looked amazing. Vows were read and finally the standard speak now or forever hold your peace was read. I remember thinking god I wonder if anyone ever speaks up during this part when, from the back I heard \"I've got something to say\". No one could quite make out where the voice had come from. Everyone spun around and the groom turned white as a ghost. There in the back was his brother who hadn't been invited. He cleared his throat also looking as white as a ghost. Directly behind him I noticed a small commotion when I noticed it just as he spoke someone cut him off. Thats when I noticed the giant green tail directly behind him. \"Ima need about tree fidy\".

{"body": "Interesting Question! \n\nAs annoying an answer as this may be, it does depend on exactly what you mean by 'skeptic'. Humanists believe we *can* gain knowledge about the world, so they are not skeptical in the sense of whether we can actually know anything at all.\n\nAccording to the British Humanist Association, a humanist \"[trusts] to the scientific method, evidence, and reason to discover truths about the universe.\" So clearly a humanist would be skeptical about a claim that had absolutely no evidence in its favour.\n\nRegarding homeopathy, if we agree with the BHA's definition of a humanist then a humanist must trust in what science and evidence has to say. According to the NHS, a 2010 House of Commons Committee:\n&gt;\"said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos, and that the principles on which homeopathy is based are 'scientifically implausible'. This is also the view of the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies.\"\n\nSo it would seem that humanists, if trusting in science and evidence, would not believe that homeopathy can cause the body to heal itself.\n\nOn to reincarnation. If we were to take out references to 'soul' within reincarnation, then a humanist *could* believe in reincarnation - depending on the definition. \n\nSuppose all our mental/psychological states were copied, and we were then killed, and then our mental states were 'plugged into' a new body 10 years later. Depending on your view of what it is for a person at one time to be the same person as a person at a later time, and taking reincarnation to be the coming back into existence a person that had previously ceased to exist, then a humanist *could* argue that reincarnation is possible.\n\nThis is clearly an entirely different question as to whether reincarnation has ever occurred *in the actual world*.\n\nI'll take an educated guess that there is not enough evidence for a humanist to believe Nessie exists!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420935822", "subreddit": "humanism", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

I remember it clear as day, the level of awkwardness shared by all parties was so high I wanted to shrivel and die.\n\nI was sitting in a coffeeshop with a date (we had met online, similar interests and all) making smalltalk. I was trying to learn as much about her for the purposes of having sex later. In retrospect, it was incredibly immature of me to have this as my end goal (you'll see why later). She was a college student, like me, trying to get an art history major. To this day, I don't really care for art, but at the time it was the most interesting thing in the world. She was that hot, an 9/10 at least. She's blathering on about Rembrandt and impressionism, but I just can't get myself to care much. \n\nNow it's at this point the three lattes I have had in the past twenty minutes are rapidly catching up to me. I'm trying to discreetly squirm in my seat as well as pretend to care about how Münch was a visionary of his time, but it comes to the point where I can't hold it in any more. I hurriedly excuse myself to the sweet respite of college public urinals, when all of a sudden, right as I'm standing up, I bump into my old ex girlfriend. I was so excited to get out of my chair, I nearly knocked her over as she happened to be passing by. I froze in panic, she froze as well. We hadn't exactly ended on good terms, there were many objects being thrown of various sizes.\n\n\"What are you doing,\" she asks angrily. I think she was visibly foaming at the mouth at the sight of me.\n\n\"I was just on a date with...\" I trail off. Damn it, I had learned to much about art that I hadn't ever gotten this girls name! To top it off, my bladder was bursting at the seams and urine was slowly inching it's way out of my cock.\n\n\"Justine.\" My date says, miffed at my lack of consideration. Damn it, there go my chances. \n\n\"If you'll excuse me-\" I started, but was quickly interrupted by my ex.\n\n\"Oh no, please don't mind me. In fact, care to tell *Justine* about the escapades we used to have?\" She was toying with me. I could see it in her eyes. She wanted more revenge and she was taking it.\n\nI'm not proud of this next part. But I was so stressed from these two women directing their combined anger at me, I just shut down. Muscles were relaxed and pants were soiled. And not just a little bit, either. I'm talking all the way soiled, stains reaching around my ass soiled.\n\nJustine was visibly disgusted. \"Ew. Gross. I literally cannot believe you.\"\n\nMy ex smiled as I cringed internally. \"Why don't you pay for your ladies drink, I have to split.\"\n\nI sighed and turned to Justine. Her eyes had that 'You owe me this.' look. \"How much?\" Defeat was welling in my eyes. \"Well,\" said Justine, \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"It was at this point I realized that my date was an eight story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. \"Dammit monstah! I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam off.\n\nI never saw either of the two women again. I did learn a valuable lesson about respecting women, however: Looking to have sex and then drop a girl is like a fleshlight: frankly, when you have to wash out your own cum the shame tops anything you know.\n\nI do hope she did well on her exam, though.\n\n**TL;DR: Met a girl for coffee, bumped into ex, peed myself, learned a lesson about respecting women.***\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420942711", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

In the late 1600's, a unique financial bartering system took hold in what is now Tayside and this arguably changed the course of history. While the system initially seemed a success, with widespread adoption, it soon began to unravel during the period known as The Haggis Famine. During this time, much like today, hyper-inflation took a hold and many could not afford to pay back interest.

I remember very clearly hear echo's coming from outside my dream \"I need you\" \"please\". I could feel someone squeezing my hand. I blinked and my eyes burned at the bright light.

As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad.

{"body": "I work at an accounting firm in a big city. We manage the accounts for many big companies. The firm is quite big and employes over 100 accountants. Its a pretty boring standard white collar type of office. About two weeks ago the talk around the water cooler centered around an employe on the floor below me. I guess this guy had been with the company for years and didn't feel like he was treated fairly and wanted a pay increase. The word was the our main boss had had it out for him since day one. I guess the boss always thought the guy was a bit off but didn't really ever have a reason to fire him since he did a good job showed up on time ect. So about a week ago I showed up a bit late after missing my train and when I arrived to the building there are cop cars and a fire engine outside. Sirens are going off and the security guy is blocking the door. I asked him what was going on and he said there was some type of situation going on with an employe and I would need to wait outside until it was taken care of. So I had a smoke and waited for around twenty minutes. Slowly one by one all the employes exited the building. No one seemed to know quite what was going on. I noticed that that my boss wasn't in the crowd. I thought back to the story of the guy who was disgruntled about the raise and started to wonder if this had something to do with it. After about an hour the cops came out and said the situation was taken care of and it was safe to return to work. Everyone was asking what had happened and they wouldn't say anything about it. We all returned to our cubicles and work went on as usual for the rest of the day. The day after I ran into my boss and asked him what had happened. I've worked with the company for many years now and he and I are on good terms so I figured he would tell what was up. He told me to follow him into his office. So it turns out the situation was about the guy who wanted the raise. He had stormed into the office and demanded a raise. The boss had made it clear many times that the company wasn't in a place to give him the raise he wanted. He said he offered a smaller pay increase but the guy wasn't only wanted the amount he was after. Thats when he got super angry and started to wreck the bosses office. I asked the boss what he wanted and he told me that the guy wanted about tree fidy. It was then that I remembered seeing him that nasty old loch ness monster. Its gonna be hard to get a job at another accounting firm after doing a thing like that you dirty ole monster.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421013467", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was really really great in the beginning. I met my ex in high school she was my first girlfriend ever. After high school we went away to different colleges out of state. I spent my young years like many men chasing different girls and partying way more than I should have. Over the years my ex and me would bump into each other when we were back home for christmas thanksgiving ect. When we were in our late twenties we both were back home for new years eve. I went to a party at my best friends house. I was at the time seeing a girl I wasn't really that into she went to a big phish show out east for the new year. I was pretty mad that she would rather spend the new year at some hippie music event than with me so I started drinking pretty early and by the time the party really started to get going I was pretty wasted. Thats when I bumped into my ex. Long story short we kissed at midnight and danced to golden soul music late into the night. We continued to talk on the phone almost everyday after that and slowly fell in love. Three years later we were married. It was one of the best days of my life still even despite the way it all turned out. She looked beautiful we were surrounded by our friends and family. At first being married was a dream. We went on an amazing honeymoon to Mexico and spent out days swimming and making love in the hotel. Slowly she started to point out little things that I did that would annoy her. At first I didn't think much of it no big deal I can not leave my towel hanging from the shower curtain. Over the next couple years it became worse and worse everything I did was wrong. I couldn't walk past her without her having her greet me with a list of ways I had fucked up that day. She had started to drink more and more increasingly. She would get wasted and belittle me over and over. I would sleep on the couch to avoid her outbursts. Finally one day she arrived home at around 4 a.m. black out drunk. I had seen her totally sloppy drunk before but this time was different. There was a different look in her eye than I had ever seen before. I knew she was after a fight. But instead she kissed my and leaned in and whispered in my ear oh baby I love you and ima need about tree fidy. It was about that time that I saw her for what she really was the nasty ole loch ness monster. I instantly saw everything the way it really was for the first time. All the love making all the laying in bed watching movies together. When she was really the loch ness monster all along. I filled for divorce later that day and its been three years since the divorce don't know if I will ever really get over the marriage.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421016052", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

All I really wanted was to be left alone, but the more I tried to avoid the group of tormentors the more they sought me out. So many horrible instances but a few stick out. My gym clothes were always stolen and thrown in the toilet. I would fish them out and show the gym teacher who would responded with something along the lines of boys will be boys. He never tried to stop the harassment or help in any way. I complained to my parents everyday after school about the bullying and they always just said its hard to be a kid at this age, people will mature and not act so childish in a couple years and to just be myself . Finally things started to get worse I was walking home one day from school when the cool boys came up behind me. They called me names and shoved me down. I got up and tried to ignore them and just keep walking. One of them took of my back pack and throw it in the mud. There were tears coming out of my eyes I begged em to stop. The leader told me I had to do something for him and he would leave me alone. I was afraid of what he might ask for but anything would be better than the abuse I was constantly getting. He grabbed me by the neck and leaned in close and screamed in my face ima need about tree fidy. It was about this time that I realized that it wasn't in fact a group of boys that had been bullying me but just one prehistoric lizard. I cried no no I won't give you tree fidy you nasty ole loch ness monster. About this time the grounds keeper arrived and that monster took off a running.

This leads to North and South Korea deciding to join back into one state, but it's called off at the last minute when a South Korean delegate serves Kim Jong-un the wrong color M&amp;Ms.\n\nStan and Kyle explain how they learned something today, countries have their differences for a reason, but we're a global society, yada yada yada, cut to credits.\n\nEDIT: Oh and obviously, Kim Jong-un turns out to be the Loch Ness Monster.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421045249", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I noticed right away that something was strange because the lights in all the upstairs bedrooms were flashing over and over. Partner and I kinda go what da fuck and go and knock on the front door. A woman answers the door and its clear she has been crying because there is make up running down her face. I asked her what seemed to be the problem and she was quiet for a few minutes and finally said sir if I told you i'm afraid you wouldn't believe me. I assured her that whatever her concern was we were here to take it very seriously. She said that around two weeks ago she awoke in the night to her bedroom window slamming shut. She said she knew for certain she hadn't left it open and immediately suspected a burglar. The scary thing about it she said was after checking all the rooms and making sure her kids were still sleeping there wasn't any sign of anyone else in the house. \n\nShe brushed it off and went back to sleep. At about this time as she was telling us the story I heard a loud bang come from an upstairs bedroom. \"maam is there anyone else in the house with you\"? thats the thing she said i'm the only one here. I told her to stay downstair and my partner and I headed up to the investigate the noise. As we neared the bedroom pictures flew off the wall it was the scariest thing i've seen in my life. My brain repeatedly said fuck this nope the fuck out of here but I knew we had to continue to secure the house for possible intruders. My partners eyes were as big as sea shells when the lightbulb above him exploded. We gave each other are you seeing all this look and both nodded. \n\nI could see the lights flashing under the door in the room the noise had come from. I slowly opened the door and bam lights go out nothing there. Immediately same thing starts happening in the next bedroom over loud banging lights flashing. I run over and slam open the door and same fucking thing nothing. We return downstairs and tell the woman we are concerned and are going to call for another unit to help us get to the bottom of this. I return to the squad car and am calling in the request when I see a figure move past the window of the upstairs bedroom where the banging was. I tell my partner there is somebody up there I just saw them. We ran up the stairs guns drawn and slammed open the door with the classic POLICE get down on your hands and knees. \nMy partner was knocked to the ground from behind and I spun around in time to see him hit the ground. Out of the dark hallway came the figure. I was certain my heart was about to explode when it shrieked ima need about tree fiddy. Ah you no good loch ness monster. You get the hell out of here and quit terrorizing nice ladies you dirty ole monster. The monster disappeared with an evil laugh. My partner was hurt pretty badly from the monster shove. He was in the hospital for a couple days with broken ribs.

{"body": "Long time pizza delivery driver here. I delivered for a bunch of different pizza joints in a small ski town. Delivered for some local spots and some franchise spots. It was mainly tourists coming to town to ski and usually I made awesome money in tips. I loved the delivery game and only ever had one bad experience. We were backed up at the shop one night and I had taken a whole bunch of pies to delivery to the condo area of town by the base of the ski mountain. \n\nI had dropped off the first three pies and was headed to finish the last one when I got a call from the shop. The person that ordered the last pizza was angry that it was taking so long and the shop had decided to give them the pizza for free. At the time I was working for Pizza Hut and this was a common thing if a customer complained more often than not we just gave them the pizza. When I arrived at the condo it was a classic fancy ski resort type of place. The guy at the front desk directed me where to go to find the unit. I headed up the elevator and got another call from the shop. Guess the guy was super pissed off and wanted to just cancel the order, the shop had assured him I was very close and the pizza would be there in a matter of minutes. Feeling kinda annoyed I headed to the unit. \n\nI knocked and immediately a note was slide under the door. It said Fuck You Pizza Guy how hard is your job. This totally pissed me off but whatever I was just ready to give them the pizza and get out of there. I apologized through the door for the delay and told them the pizza was on the house. Another note slide under and this one was even worse. Clearly they were watching me through the peep hole because this one said You Look Like a No Good Stoner No Wonder You Can't Get Things There On Time. I was starting to loose my cool I told them that they could think anything they wanted to about me but I had other deliveries to do and if they would kindly open the door and I would give them the pizza and be on my way. \n\nA twenty dollar bill slide part way under the door and a mans voice from the other side said hey man I'm just messing with you. I was relieved just some college kids fucking with the pizza guy I thought. I told him the pizza was on the house and there was no need to pay for it. The dude told me it was a tip for being a good sport and just to leave the pizza there. I went to grab the bill when it was pulled back inside and I heard a number of people laughing. Fuck this I thought but not before shouting through the door you think its funny to mess with people like this, I don't have time to play your stupid games here's your pizza and don't call and order from us again. I throw the pizza down and as I did the door opened. \n\"Hey Pizza Boy\" the dude said \"You Can Go Fuck Yourself\". Lovely more shit talking from this asshole. I told the guy thanks a lot your real kind when he shoved me off my feet. What in the fuck is going on here this guy is crazy I thought. \n\nI jumped to my feet as the guy grabbed my by the shirt and screamed in my face \"Hey Pizza Boy\" ima need about tree fiddy. It was about this time that I realized this wasn't a guy at all but that dirty ole loch ness monster. Ahh you god damn loch ness monster I ain't giving you no tree fiddy. I work for my living and don't give no dirty ole lizards hand outs. I grabbed that pizza and ran for the elevator. No one at the shop could even believe what had happened when I arrived back but they did say the guy sounded pretty weird on the phone.

We all had a mutual friend we will call him X, who had a terribly attractive older sister in high school.  We would all hang out together browsing my dad's dirty magazine collection trading vulgar outburst's of what we would like to do to X's sister.  X knew we all had the hots for her but we didn't dare make off color comments about her around him for fear of being banned from hanging at his house and more importantly the opportunity to oggle his sister.  \nWe had just started school again after the summer and X had me and a few of our pals over on Friday evening for some video games and excessive soda drinking.  X's parents went out to dinner and left us under the supervision of his sister and two of her hot friends.  As soon as X's folks left his sister and her friends started to drink vodka they had stashed away.  They were all dancing in the living room when I headed up stairs to get some more Mountain Dew.  I thought my young brain was gonna explode at the site of them shaking it to some 90's pop.  The night rolled on and suddenly I couldn't focus on the games or the dirty jokes the basement felt like a prison.  After a bit I couldn't take it any longer and headed back upstairs to see if I could catch a little more dancing.  X's sister and her friends were now swimming in the pool in the backyard I about puked.  I waited in the kitchen until they all came out and bravely said hello to X's sister. \n She was clearly drunk and said \"hey hot stuff\".  All the other girls laughed and they headed up to her room.  I know now it was wrong but at the time I couldn't help but sneak after them.  When the coast was clear I headed up the stairs and put my ear to the door.  They were talking about who's boobs were the biggest.  It was clear that they were at least partially naked in there actual fucking boobs on the other side of that door.

So we arrive barely are allowed in from the bouncer who can smell trouble from us right away.  \nWe head to the bar take another round of shots and start handing out dollars to the ladies.  I made the mistake of telling my friend I'd never had a lap dance before and he gets all hot and bothered about how i'm just a rookie and he is gonna buy me my first one.  He is wasted and makes good money so he sets up the whole private room thing and the next thing I know here I am just drunk out of my mind with a super hot girl grinding all over me.  \nShe is telling my how cute I am and how she usually has to dance for nasty old men and how its so nice to get to dance for a hot young guy.  \nIn my wasted brain i'm loving every second of it thinking i'm just don fucking juan at this point.  She starts putting her hands down my shirt and boom rips my shirt off.  I'm really getting pretty turned on at this point and she is rubbing my chest and really going for it.  She whispers in my ear that we can do all sorts of things if I don't mind paying a bit extra.  \nGod I know its wrong but at the time I just couldn't help myself.  I ask her what sorts of things with a big smile and she rubs my crotch through my jeans and she you know what sorts of things big boy.  At this point i'm all in I tell her ok I will pay whatever the fuck you want I just wanna keep this going.  She's rubbing my crotch still and with a smile says well big boy ima need about tree fiddy.  At about this time I noticed that this wasn't a stripper at all but a four hundred foot tall plesiosaur from the prehistoric era.  Ah god damn it you dirty old loch ness monster how dare you pretend to be a stripper just to try and get tree fiddy from me you nasty monster.  \nI couldn't believe I let that dirty old devil rub on me like that and worse almost trick me out of my money.

There was no cars behind so I let her chill there. While I waited for her food I noticed her staring me down and she winked at me. I was like huh so I opened up the window and I was trying my best to flirt with her.. She was buying it pretty good and we were kind of hitting it off. That was short lived because her order was up so I handed it to her and she looks up and says hey my 20pc isn't in here. In my mind I was like 'yes I can talk to her a little longer and maybe get her number' unfortunately another car came up to order so I had her park and wait a little. Finally her order was up so I volunteered to deliver it and I did. She says in the most sexy voice 'hey baby would you mind bringing me some sauces?' I was like sure no problem.

{"body": "this is my time to shine... I guess I can tell the story of how I was picked up by a 'cougar'.\n\nSo I was couch surfing following a fall-out with my parents (long story, not worth going into). Anyway, this went on for a while and I ended up staying at one friend's for about a month or so. My friend lived with his single mum (dad had gone out to get milk, never returned type thing). His mum was young-ish considering my friend's and my ages at the time (18), in pretty good shape, lovely smile, always very friendly with me, and I was obviously very grateful to have somewhere to stay at this point. My friend worked in a mobile windscreen repair service and I was between jobs. His mum worked part time so we were often in the house together. Was kind of awkward at first (obviously) but we got chatting. She would make comments about how mature I was and how she couldn't understand how I didn't have a girlfriend etc., I would sort of giggle and brush it aside, but the more it happened the more I thought maybe I had a chance here. A chance for something great...\n\nWhich leads me to a piece of advice: if you think something is on, ask for it. Same with meeting any girls. You can whinge about not getting dates, but are you actually asking? The girl that smiled at you on the train, at the bar, buying coffee, did you just ask them? They are people after all! I digress, of sorts. So, with this spirit of adventure, one time when we were alone, I though I would give it a shot. She was sat on the sofa one morning, I decided to join her. Normal small talk, sly comments, 'why don't you have a girlfriend'... My heart is pounding, but I say something cliche along the lines of 'only being interested in you'. She cottons on, leans into me and says 'what can a young boy offer someone like me'. Excitedly, I ask 'well what do you need?' She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was about that time that I noticed this smoking hot milf was about 500 feet tall and from the paleothic era\". I shouted \"I ain't giving you no free fiddy you god damn loch ness monster, get your own money\".\n\nMy friend came home, and he never knew what went down.

{"body": "I had a young boy in my class a few years ago.  He was just a terrorizer constantly hitting other kids and screaming at me.  Even as a grown man many days I would fear dealing with this little bastard.  I tried many of the classic techniques to assert dominance and establish that he to had to follow the rules.  Nothing worked and after having a yogurt cup thrown in my face for taking away a paint set he was using to deface his desk, I decided enough is enough time to pull out the big guns and call this little fuckers parents.\n\nI left no less than a half dozen messages on his parents answering machine and never got a call back.  This little gremlin continued to disrupt the class and I was out of idea's.  I sent him to the principle on a daily basis.  Little Damian and I had worked out a deal, he would get three chances each day and on the third strike he was out and had to go to the principle.  I must admit as the school year went on I even began to have a soft spot for this little guy.  He was very calculated he would use the first two infractions in a more sparingly way, but the third was the grand finale.  He's be on his last strike and wait until the time was just right and than bam kick another kid in the nuts, or spit in my face and always erupt in laughter as he walked out the door knowing just what he'd done.  \n\nFinally at the end of the quarter it came time for parent teacher conferences.  I had a whole file on little Damian and was ready to throw it down in front of his non responsive folks and say look at this,  look at what your kid is doing what in the fuck type of parents are you.  I made it through a good number of the conferences when it was finally time for his.\n\nWhen his parent arrived I was blown away.  Not only was she a single mother but the most beautiful mother i'd seen in all my years of teaching.  She was incredibly warm and gentle I just didn't fucking understand it.  I reminded myself of the horrors her little rascal had been perpetrating against my class and myself.  I brushed off his mothers beauty and got down to it.  I showed her the file complete with every vile act he had committed over the last six weeks.  She was astonished and completely blown away.  She refused to believe that her little Damian could do anything along the lines of what was in that fill.\n\nThis is were things took a turn for the worst.  I stood my ground and told her I was sorry to surprise her with these facts but her little monster had in fact done these things and was even being considered to be taken out of the class altogether.  She erupted like a fucking volcano.  She told me I was a lier and clearly had something against her boy.  She screamed about how hard he had had it at home with his father walking out on both of them.  At this point she stood up from her chair and continued the conference standing waving her hands around wildly.  She asked me if I myself had kids and of course I said no and she viciously accused me of having no idea what it was like to raise a child and how I had no right to judge her or her little boy.  I was starting to get a bit spooked out by this woman and she was starting to remind me more and more of her son.\n\nHer voice has been continuously raising in volume throughout the conference.  Now she was screaming at the top of her lungs and her language had grown a bit meaner.  \" your nothing but a pathetic sad little man thats all you are\".  \"If you think me and my son are gonna put up with this from a hack like you your fucking dead wrong mister\".  I couldn't believe this shit in all my years of teaching i'd never seen anything like this.  This woman was a tornado of hate coming my way and I sensed I had to end this before it got any worse.  I told her perhaps we could all sit down with the principle and get his opinion on the situation and where to go from here.  This he did not like.  She grabbed the file from my desk and torn the thing into pieces.  \"You pretend to know whats best for my boy and you write down every little thing every little piece of this garbage you have here.\"  \"We won't be pushed around by you sir no we won't\".  I was about to tell her that this conference had reached its end and kindly excuse my self from this nightmare when she really lost her cool.  She leaned in as close to me as she could.  I could see pure white hate coming from her eyes.  I would have jumped up and ran for my life if I could have.  She gently put her hand on my shoulder and screamed with all her might \"you fucking bastard, you no good son of a bitch\" \"you better make this right, you better fix all this\".  I could hardly believe this was real life.  She started to squeeze my shoulder and I thought enough is enough and jumped out of my chair but not before she could scream ima need about tree fiddy.  It was about this time that I realized this was no woman at all but a plesiosaur from the prehistoric era.  It dawned on me this woman and her son had been none other than that dirty ole loch ness monster all along.  I screamed no way in hell i'm giving you no tree fiddy you dirty ole monster this is a place of learning and we work for our money here.  That dirty old monster gave a rascal smile and turned and ran out the door.  Even writing this now gives me chills.  It took two years of off time before I was able to teach again and I still get anxious before parent teacher conference's.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421179202", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

Landing out on the flats was supremely jarring and the pummeling I got immediately after went on for way too long.

I'm headed that way.\" I didn't really need it, but I figure as long as he's offering - what the hell. So I say, \"Sure, ok. I'll take you up on that.\" He says, \"Ok.

Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nIf you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421217646", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Geometry wise, they're a little different from the cast hangers, with their 3mm rake and shallow bushing seat. Cast hangers feature 5mm of rake and a deeper, more restrictive bushing seat.\nAs some may think, \"dat angle\" in a bad way, don't. They turn amazingly well and are pretty lively for being just 38 degrees, due to the raked hangers and super shallow bushing seat, while being one of the most stable trucks I've ever tried. My cRonins feel super twitchy after riding Sabres for so long. I move around quite a bit and adjust my front foot alot, with these it's no big deal. My favorite all round truck, you can do slower freeride and move on to faster hills without even touching the kingpin nut. I love loose trucks, and with these you can get that really loosey goosey leany goodness without sacrificing stability, which can be a little squirrely if you go fast on higher degree trucks. Overall, they're super solid.\nDon't quote me on this, but I think they also are the lowest RKP truck on the market right now. Axle height 54mm, 2.12\" for you overseas folks! If dropped up, 49mm. For reference, my Nessie on Sabres is riding lower than my YoFace on Indys. That's something.\n\n\nPros:\n\n* high quality stock urethane pivot cup\n* high quality stock bushings\n* super leany\n* stable\n* light but strong\n* low ride height\n* runs both normal size and semi-tall barrels (Sabre bushings are taller than Venoms)\n* 8-hole mounting pattern\n\n\nCons:\n\n* wheelbite prone due to being so low, proper wheelwells or cutouts needed if you want to run them without riser\n* no support for full-tall barrels, that is a feature I'd like to see\n* that's about it\n\nRider info: 190lbs 6ft, freeride oriented DH.

{"body": "identical twin here.  My brother and I look startlingly similar and people often get confused.  During college we went to different universities but would visit each other quite often.  My girlfriend at the time would always say how strange it was when we all were hanging out since we looked so much like each other.  So anyway me and my brother get to scheming and decide he should visit and come to a party with me and my friends and wear the same outfit.\n\nHe arrives and we are both dressed to the nines in three piece suits the exact same down to the tie.  We all head out on the town and people are double taking every where we go.  We hit the bar and have a couple of drinks and than head to a house party.\n\nWhen we get to the party my bro goes in first while I park the car and everyone is greeting him as if he was me.  He  just plays it off and goes with it.  We made a point to not be seen side by side through out the night.  As you can guess everyone thinks that I'm basically all over the place at the same time at this party.  News spreads fast that I was seen cheating on my girl with two different girls making out in the living room and parking lot.  \n\nFinally me and my bro throw the final wildcard we had planned for quite sometime.  I tell my girl to meet me in the bedroom upstairs and I will be up in just a second because I had to grab something from the car.  So as you guessed my bro heads up to the room.  Our plan was to pretend that he was trying to con her into thinking he was me and we would burst into a huge fake fistfight and then in the end a fit of laughter.  \n\nSo I wait a couple minutes and then head upstairs.  When I get to the bedroom I knock a couple times to let my bro know its me.  He says something along the lines of hey man we are in here get lost.  I burst in and am like what the fuck is going on here.  What I didn't prepare myself for is that my brother would have my girlfriend butt naked and going to town on her.  All of a sudden the fight was a real thing and the stupid prank was out the window.  I tackled my bro with murder in my eyes.  We were wrestling around on the floor while my girl screamed her head off.  I finally pinned my bro down and with tears in my eyes asked him how he could do it to me .  He didn't know what to say and I could tell he felt bad and was quite drunk.  The only thing he could muster to say was ima need about tree fiddy.  It was about this time that I realized I didn't actually have a twin brother in fact I was an only child this son of a bitch fucking my girlfriend was in fact a plesiosaur from the prehistoric era.  I screamed you no good cheating bastard you dirty ole loch ness monster you get the fuck away from me and my girl you rotten asshole I ain't never giving you no tree fiddy.  Me and my girl broke up that night and I never forgave her for that.  I mean even before she know who that bastard really was she admitted to thinking it was really my twin and not me.

{"body": "Once a story has cooled down from its flash in the pan status you'll probably be getting fifty cents a day or so. Getting fifty cents a day isn't a bad thing. It's a good thing. Let's do a little math.\n\nThere are 365 days a year. Assuming you're past that initial activity where the story sells you'll be making $182.50 pre-tax per year. In a week you'll make about $3.50 (damn you Loch Ness monster). That's every day seven days a week.\n\nIf you were to break that into a 40 hour a week job you have just given yourself a 9 cent raise. If your employer were to give you that yearly you would scowl at him or her, but this is a raise that you give to yourself.\n\nThis is not including the burst of activity you have when it hits the shelf when it makes a hundred dollars or so. I'm not including that. That's more or less instant revenue, but not sustainable revenue, or at least not sustainable on each title long term. These titles are your workhorses. They plod along and make you money slowly. Even when you hit thirty titles you're still only making $15 a day if you are a competent but middling author. However, what I'm measuring are two different things.\n\nIn one model, you make that $15 a day by doing very little. Release a story a week and you can keep up just enough that your new work help sells your old work.\n\nIn the other model, if this were a 40 hour a week job, you are making $2.70 an hour with your backlog of old titles. \"But Onehand,\" you might say, \"That's not even half of minimum wage. It's barely a third!\" And I would say, \"What job rewards you with money for work that you did in the past and continues to do so without stopping?\" You're making money for doing nearly nothing. Add in when you write new stories to fill in the gap and you're just starting to make a livable wage. The dirty thirty isn't a magic number. It's the accumulation of work through diligence and patience.\n\nYou're not making $2.70 an hour because this doesn't have set hours. You're making $15 a day. Are you eating a taco? Are you taking a shower? Are you sleeping? Is it the weekend? Are you working another job? $15 a day. Not five days a week, but every day. That's $105 a week, roughly $450 a month pre-tax and $5,475 a year.\n\nNow let's chop off 25% of that for taxes. You can do your own math from here if you want, but I'll do mine. You end up with $4106.25. Those titles have given you four months of a full time minimum wage job at forty hours a week per year. Did you get sick? No biggie. You still get paid. If you hate yourself you can get half of that out in a month and even more if you have nothing better to do. That's not from your new titles. That's not from the title that you're making a special push to sell. They're the titles that collect dust and occasionally someone likes it well enough to shake the dust off and buy it from you.\n\nPersonally I allot myself around ten hours to write a story. Seven hours writing the story and crafting a blurb, two hours editing, one working on the photo (which I already have picked out), putting in keywords (which I already researched) and publishing everything at amazon (which takes little time at all). Sometimes I put in more time, sometimes I put in less, but lately I have been disciplining myself and have been ending up at about ten hours per story. It might mean that the story isn't particularly deep, that I might have an editing mistake or two, but this is erotica, not Chaucer. To me this is a business and it beats the hell out of flipping burgers. I can pump out a finished 5000 word fuck story about pegging, cuckolding or eating the badwrongfundirty parts of the pig while sitting in my boxers at home and drinking a beer.\n\nDon't turn your nose up at it. It's good money for the amount of work you put into it. You just have to put the work into it, learn from your mistakes, cultivate a fan base and improve your craft. It isn't easy money, but it sure is money.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421293625", "subreddit": "eroticauthors", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I don't know the others reasons for being moderators, but this place has connected me with new friends and contacts, I feel like I could get on a plane anywhere in the world and there will be someone local who will give me a sofa to sleep on and show me the dope hills to skate. It taught me so much to help me improve my ability in a sport I love and I wanted to keep it in check, promote the good vibes and do everything I can to make it improve. I feel like we have something better than Silverfish or those Facebook groups and we have a more restrictive platform to work with.  \n\nThe new rules aren't perfect. There just wasn't a way to make them as fluid as I perceive. I like how now when someone posts a mystery box, instead of it being just a picture and the comments being full of \"what is that?\", they normally list the contents in the post besides the picture.  \nInstead of a picture of a new setup against a wall, the entire thing is described by the OP.  \n\nThere are Facebook groups for \"I just bought a thing, give me reassurance and jealousy\".

If you've done some strange chop or run something unorthadox that **is** an interesting gear post, but another Nessie on 44cal 2s with Hoots and Zealous is nothing new or thought provoking.

If we need more opinions we filter it through the IRC, then the DGT, then make a modpost as a self post to gradually gain more thoughts on it. (and somewhere in there we sometimes direct message brands/pros if it involves them). When people said they weren't informed about the rule changes, we had agreement and discussions with around 100 users, if you weren't one of them you weren't in the right place at the right time to see it.

{"body": "My brother and I are identical twins. Back in high school, there was this girl my brother liked, let's call her Mary. Trouble is, he is an extremely introverted person. He could never build up the confidence to talk to her out of the blue, let alone ask her out. One time she was walking by and I told him to just go for it, and his attempt was more or less \"Hi there. Oh sorry, I thought you were someone else\", facing away, and retreating. I gave him shit about it at first, but he seemed genuinely sad and didn't even fight back so I tried to think of other ways to help him. He wanted me to write a letter to her from him, to which I jokingly responded \"Why don't I just dress up like you and ask her out in person?\". He loved the idea and told me I should do it. I was reluctant at first but after a bit I figured it was about time he got a girlfriend and he wasn't going to make many waves on his own. \n\nSo he asks me what the plan is. Mind you, Mary was by no means a supermodel, I'd call her a 6/10 at best. But my brother liked her and I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I BSed and made up some intricate plan about how I would get info about her that I could use to win her over. In reality, I just walked up to her, said Hi, complemented her hair, made a couple playful jokes, and asked her if she was doing anything on Friday. \n\nSo there it was, after 2 minutes of conversation I had a date for my brother that he'd been talking about doing for 2 months. When I told him about it though, he was horrified. At first I thought he was just being a nervous wreck, but then I realized that he had a theater rehearsal this Friday night, in which he had a fairly major role. I tried to calm him down and said we could just reschedule it for Saturday, but he was mortified by the fact that I'd \"Blown his one shot at happiness\". I told him if he really feels that way he should just go on the date and blow off the practice. He wasn't having any of that, so I foolishly offered to go to the recital for him. Since him suddenly knowing none of his lines and routines would be so much worse than not showing up, he declined that as well. So, with only one option left, we decided: Fuck it, I'll take her out. \n\nSo that's what happened. I showed up at her place, pretending to be my brother. Took her to The Cheesecake Factory, and we actually hit it off pretty well. After the meal we headed to the train and I was headed north and she was headed south, so I told her we should do this again some time. As I walked away, she called me back over, and said that her card was out of money and she needed money for the train and the bus after. I asked her how much she needed, to which she responded \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I quickly fled to my train, popped on my fedora, and rode off into the sunset.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421359791", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm in Scotland. Near here there is a Ghost lady story, my granpapi and family have had some odd runins (I still remain skeptic), there are the whole tales of Kelpies and Nessie, Alien Big Cats...\nI really love Cu Sith and Cwn Annwn. Here in Glasgow theres a lot of rumored haunted places. I recall a story too of a box buried somewhere in the city center which was occult involved somehow. People would go hunting for it. Lots of religious ghosts like monks, and war themed ones.\nThere was a school I went to a kid that is now Demolished. It honestly had big chained doors to the bathrooms. People used to say the bathrooms were haunted, that handprints would appear on the windows. It looked like a prison in there so I feel sorry for any ghosties who would have been stuck there.\n\nFurther away is the Isle of man, home to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gef\n\nMy grandad and my gran were walking down a beach long ago together. A man in old styled clothing walked up to them and asked the time; When he got his answer and walked off behind them, my grandad turned to see the guy had totally disappeared. It was a totally empty beach at the time. Weird stuff!\n\nI and other family members in my last house had weird, weird visions of 'ghosts'. When i was a tiny kid I laid down in bed one night and turned, saw this long black shadow figure laying next to me, I screamed and suddenly with tremendous energy I felt myself being pushed off the bed and I fell, got up... This shadow thing, quick as a flash, had somehow stood right next to me when I had gotten thrown to the ground. I ran out there, right into the living room, yelling about a man being in my room. Other family members and people who stayed overnight seen it too, and we had to move out eventually. There would be crazy loud footsteps, bangs and 'explosions' on the ceiling, total dread coming over me at certain points in the house for no reason... My uncle once told me he read in a newspaper an old man got murdered in that house before, but I can't find it anywhere online :( I wish I could.\nIf I recall though, there was also a gas leak in that house at one point. I don't know when, or for how long it happened. I hear gas causes hallucinations which can explain a lot, but things like the pushing and actually having the same visions and everyone hearing things at the same time is the weird part. My parents, before I was born, had still many experiences in that house even then. They would see bright, vivid flashes of light that illuminated the whole room suddenly come from the bookshelf or something. Somewhere with no reasonable reason to have a glow. A person who said she was a psychic had told them such lights were spirits moving in and out of portals. The 'spirit' I saw was all black, no facial features, no distinct limbs, Just a vague human outline. Shadow man, yeah, they are common! But anyone else who ever seen him in the house always seen him in the hallway with a tophat on. Mine never had a hat. \nOur pets would stare up into the corner of rooms. This one was always curious to me. The dog would tilt his head left and right like someone was talking to him. This dog was very rowdy and disobedient often, never liked sitting in one place and it was very hard to get his attention.  Over here, in old days, the myth behind corners of rooms was that devils would sit in the corners, waiting for a person in the house to die.\nIt's all so weird, and so much more happened. I've had nasty hallucinations too even years later, but soooo glad I'm on meds now. I try to keep away from the whole believing in it because it can be scary when I'm hallucinating, but damn well does it make me curious.\n\nPs. If anyone from Scotland/Glasgow area might be aware of old news reports of murders and stuff in there, let me know. I'd love to see if I can find the info again.

{"body": "Purchasing a derivative is a means to shift risk. That is why they exist, really. \n\nWhat are they?  Say I want to make sure my corn sells for $6/unit. Right now it sells for $8. I can buy a derivative from say JP Morgan that says if corn sells for $5, they'll pay me the difference. In return, I pay them the initial price. So if prices stay high, I wasted money purchasing the derivative. But if prices go down, I'll avoid low-yielding corn!  Obviously that upfront price is very important!  Sometimes they are market based pricing, others are individual and unique derivatives that are bargained between two parties.\n\nThere are countless derivatives on the market. Some are actually market-sold. For example currency exchanges, where I can buy the \"option\" (a common form of derivative) to purchase a Euro six months from now for precisely $x.xx American.  If euros exceed that value, I'd use my purchased option to buy cheaper euros. If they fall below it, I'd let the option go to waste and just buy them at market value at that time.   I said these particular options (derivatives) are market based, so rather than negotiate with a bank or counterparty, I can buy and sell these euro options on the floor of an exchange or online, and the market determines that up front price.

Next morning I notice she's acting really weird, but I assumed she was either hungover or still drunk so I brushed it off.\n\nAfter a few days, in which she kept acting really weird, I get a call from a guy in one of my classes that I played PS3 with once or twice. He calls me in tears, saying he fucked up and he's been banging my girlfriend for 3 months, and he's fed up with lying. Granted, he shows me nude pics of her, timestamped and all that. I am absolutely furious.\n\nSkipping the whole Facebook-gym-lawyer thing, I get home and start getting my shit together in order to be able to kick her out without any problem. I really didn't want this sex addicted bitch in my life any longer. In the middle of making a small inventory of the shit she brought into the house, I get a text from her.\n\n\"I'm pregnant\"\n\nI barely remember what I did next, because I was practically blacking out from rage. I could excuse - not forgive, though - the cheating, but scheming against me like this was too low for me to accept. I knew immediately what she was planning so I looked through the trash and found a bundled up condom, along with its wrapper. I fished it out and put it away carefully, then waited for the **** to get home.\n\nOf course she's crying like a bitch. I keep calm. I can see through her lies. \"I think it happened when we bare dogged it last night\", she says. \"I want to keep the baby.\" She's smiling, saying I'd make a great dad.\n\nA few minutes into her play, I drop the bomb. \"I know about [friend name, censored for privacy]. I want to break up. I don't care if you're really pregnant or not, I want you out.\"\n\nAt this point I can see in her eyes she's sad she's been caught rather than anything else. She bursts into a fit of rage and accuses ME of cheating on her, of being sex-obsessed (!). When I thought it would simply be a matter of physically kicking her out, she says she can prove it's mine (somehow) and if I don't support her financially she'll press charges for rape. She's throwing all these legal terms at me, saying she'll press charges for everything (whatever that meant) and that she'll ruin my life.\n\nI snap. I push her against a wall and start screaming at her. \"Bitch, I found the condom. I know what you did. I don't give a fuck about you anymore, but you've known me enough to realize you can't fuck with me like this. I don't care if you have a baby or not and I don't care whose it is, but it's not mine, and if you dare to get me in legal trouble using this 'baby' of yours I will personally rip it out of you.\"\n\nI was shocked at what I'd said but I kept my cool. She was bawling her eyes out, and manages to choke out a \"sorry\".\n\n\"I'm sorry. I won't press any charges. I'll just leave. But I need ONE thing.\"\n\"What the hell is it?\"\n\n\"I need...I need bout tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this point that I realized my girlfriend was a three story high crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\n\"Goddamn you, Loch Ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam out into the sunset.\n\nTL;DR My girlfriend cheated on me an lied about being pregnant, then threatened to press (made up) charges if I left her.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421390013", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

She knew he would. he failed to assassinate the target because of his lack of finess and experience. \"mission compromised\" she radios back to HQ. \"The rookie failed. his cover is blown. Yes, he pushed her onto the tracks, but she was helped by pedestarians.\" she stays back to witness what is happening. she knows nobody even knows she is there. she moves out the way. after everything is over, she leaves forgetting that the camera crew had recently fixed this camera. why else would they, trained spies, make such a terrible mistake of both being in frame. also the woman is a double agent. she radios her other HQ and says \"The target is safe. We wont have to worry about anything else. she will leave the country carrying all of our drugs. we will become the worlds most powerful drug dealers. BMUAHAHAH!!\"\n\nSeveral years later, on her private island, our spy, who will be later known under the false name of janet, is having a late afternoon sunbath. she hears the humming of helicopter blades. she looks up and sees exactly that. as the helicopter lands, a man in a white suit steps off. he has white aligator leather shoes with gold buckles, a solid gold rolex, and solid gold frames on his glasses. they provide great contrast against his dark skin. \"misses Janet Polcheck. My name is Pep C. Cola and I have a propositon for you.\"\n\nIntrigued by the man's deep voice, she says \"continue\" ignoring the fact that she has zuchinni on her eyes, she is in a robe, and has green goo on her face.\n\n\"I dont have long to chat, and my helicopter is low on fuel. Retire from being a drug lord and in return I will give you anything you ask. do you have a fuel pump on this island?\"\n\nshe takes off her zuchinni on her left eye and says anything in a questioning voice. she then thinks.\n\nthe rest is history\n\njanet, now under the name susan is a brown haired mom with 3 kids whom she picked up from soccer practice. on her way to her house in america, she decides to stop and check the mail. she sees a letter from a Johnny F. Pibb. she doesnt reconigize the name. she ponders opening it, getting a sick feeling of her enimies or a lawyer getting in touch with her. she realizes this is foolish because that life is behind her, and her husband is the head lawyer of the best firm in the state. she opens the letter.\n\n&gt; Janet,\n\n&gt;Almost thirty years ago I made a deal with you. As per our request, your payment is on its way.\n\n&gt; sincerly, Mr. Pibb\n\n*my name is susan now you lying son of a bitch* she thinks immediately after reading the letter. so she waits. and waits. another kid is being born before anything happens. but on that day of the delivery, an old, weak, hotel janitor stops by the door. he peers into the room, noticing the woman and family at the bed. he walks in and makes eye contact with susan. susan catches his eyes and looks back at him. she gets a sick feeling. \"Hi\" she says sharply.\n\n\"janet, it-\" the janitor begins\n\n\"my name is susan\" she blurts out\n\n\"HER NAME IS SUSAN\" the family begins to scream. \"HER NAME IS SUSAN! HER NAME IS SUSAN!\" they start a chant. soon everyone in the whole hotel, patients, doctors, and nurses even are yelling and chanting at the janitor \"HER NAME IS SUSAN\" during the screaming and chanting, susan starts going into labor so she pushes, but everyone is so focused on yelling at the janitor that nobody realizes what is happening. susans baby dies and is a still born. she becomes torn.\n\nsusan slides her finger across her neck and the hotel simontaneously becomes quiet. as though everyone had telepathic powers to communicate with susan.\n\n\"What do you need, Mr. Pibb?\" she says in a deep, angry, and forceful tone.\n\n\"ima need bout tree fiddy.\" he says.\n\n\"the lochness monster. my old enemy.\" susan says. \"you want your tree fiddy? well here!\" so susan picks up her three alive kids and her dead baby and throws it at the lochness monster.\n\nmoral of the story: dont throw your kids, alive or dead, at imaginary monsters named after cola. thats how you get put in the looney bin.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421390505", "subreddit": "JusticePorn", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "once you've been told something is something, in our brains its hard to see otherwise. a youtuber called Veritasium explains this well, he does an experiment where he gets people to guess what the rule of his sequence is. The sequence he gives suggest a very obvious rule which everyone guesses but alas, that is not the rule he is actually using. He then gets people to pick numbers of their own and he will tell them if they match the rule. Everyone then started picking numbers that fit the pattern of the original rule they came up with, they did fit with Veritasiums rule but it still wasn't the rule he was using. He then told the people 'you picking numbers to try and prove the rule you have chosen right, you are certain that you are right and my rule must be your rule, try picking numbers that do not fit your rule' and eventually numbers started not fitting the rule and different numbers did fit his rule. His point is that we constantly search for ways in order to prove ourselves right and hardly ever to prove ourselves wrong.\n\nBecause people have already reported alien abductions, people who have passed out and woken up disorientated wont actually remember anything from their time passed out, but if they believe they had been abducted by an alien their brain will start filling the lost memories from when you were unconscious with what you believed must of happened, your brain starts putting together all this 'evidence' to prove you were abducted rather than putting together evidence you weren't and thus you conjure up an image of being abducted similar to other peoples stories because if it happened to them, that must be what happened to you and that's all the evidence our brains need.\n\nAnother experiment done was at Loch Ness where a straight wooden beam, not in anyway resembling the depicted image of the Loch Ness Monster, was placed in the loch. As people saw it bob up and down, believers in Nessie rushed over thinking it was the Loch Ness monster, whilst non-believers did not react, they could see the possibility of it being a stick, but the believers wanted their evidence to prove their beliefs. No believer stopped and said 'it could just be a stick' because as the other experiment mentioned, we search for ways to prove ourselves right, not to prove ourselves wrong.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421426273", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I'm also not sure what in my post you are seeing as a \"jab\" at you.

Therefore, when we die, we are done. Nothing remains but meat and offal. \n\n4. that the current christian concept of forgiveness for sin is completely selfish: if you do harm to someone, getting forgiveness in your mind from your deity does not make that someone whole again. Your real actions in this realm in which you caused harm are the only hope you have of righting your wrong. The only thing in the universe that changes when you believe that god has forgiven you for your bad action is that you feel better.

{"body": "When I was in love with my now wife of 7 years me and her father didn't exactly get along very well.\nHe was Mormon. I was Atheist. He was Pro life. I was pro choice. He liked Battlefield. I liked Call of Duty. (OK, not that last one) and etc.\nBut anyways, me and his daughter had been together for 3 years when I finally decided that I wanted to marry her. I knew that her father might reject me, but I had to try anyways. Besides, I wasn't asking if I could marry his daughter, I was going to do that anyways, I was asking if he wanted to be a part of our family.\nI came over to his house unannounced and awkwardly brought it up after a short conversation about something, I don't remember what. Of course, I was rejected. After that I was sent out of his house and asked to never go near his daughter again because he didn't like me.\nI was more heartbroken than I thought I'd be. I expected his answer, but didn't fully realize how much it would affect me.\nA few days went by with me mourning, I'd already bought a ring and was going to propose and then tell her what her father thought of me proposing. I was worried she'd get upset and decide that her father was more important than me so I was extremely nervous beforehand.\nI planned to take her on a date skiing and then propose to her at the top of the ski lift, where there was a beautiful view of the valley we lived in.\nI went to her house to pick her up, praying that her father wasn't home at the moment. I walked up to the door, knocked, and unfortunately... her father opened the door.\n\"Umm, hi, sir. Is (name) here? We were going to go on a date.\"\nHe sternly looked at me, his facial expression didn't change for a few seconds (which felt like several minutes...). Then he said, \"Yeah, she's here. I need to talk to you though.\"\nGreat. What's he going to say?\nI'm invited into their house and saw his daughter sitting on a chair putting make up on. She looked at me, smiled, and I told her to wait out in the car for a moment because her father wanted to talk to me.\nHer facial expression went from smiling and happy to, \"Oh, shit. What happened?\"\nShe agreed and went outside to my car.\nWhen her father saw she was in the car, he looked at me and said, \"I've been thinking about what you asked me awhile back. About.. marrying her.\"\n\"Yes, sir. I really love your daughter and I'd like to marry her.\"\nI was surprised because I expected him to be angry about me arriving at his house. But he seemed... sad, instead.\nHe looked at me and replied, \"I know you do. I'm sorry I turned you down. I know we may not get along at all, but you're still a pretty good guy. You have my permission to ask my daughter to marry you.\"\nWow. I was relieved. I was not expecting this at all when he invited me in. \"Umm, thanks sir! You don't know how happy I am to hear that.. I'm going to go on that date with her now. Thanks again!\" I said, then I started to walk out the door.\nAs I was about to open the door he said, \"Wait, stop.\" I was nervous... I thought he had changed his mind, I turned around and looked at him. He said, \"I need one more thing...\"\n\"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"\nIt was around this time I realized that my girlfriend's father was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had gotten me again! \"Goddamnit monster I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I screamed.\nSo there's my story. I'm happy that I could end my story with a happy ending instead of some of the stories here... haha.\nI haven't really seen him since.\nTL;DR: Rejected by father, then he changes his mind.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421461539", "subreddit": "jerktalkdiamond", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was a dark and stormy night. Kyle shivered as the rain poured down around the car, the trees in the background illuminated by a flash of lighting.\n\n“Kyle!” Her boyfriend shouted, pulling her headphones off. Kyle glared at him and paused the horror movie. She looked over to him.\n\n“Yes, Stephen?” She asked, rolling her eyes. She grabbed her headphones from him, starting to put them back on.\n\n“I don’t know how to tell you this…” Stephen began slowly. A deep emotion clouded his eyes. Kyle paused, though her heart began racing at a million miles per hour. “There was an accident...your father was in it.” He finished.\n\n“What? Is he okay?” Kyle’s eyes were round and her voice hoarse. Stephen didn’t reply for a painfully long time. Finally, he spoke. \n\n“Yeah, he just ran his cart into someone else’s at the grocery store. Got yelled at though.”\n\nKyle punched him. “Jerk! You scared me!”. She put the headphones back on and pressed play. However, just as the maniacal ax murder showed his mask for the first time, there was a loud knocking at their door. Kyle cursed loudly in her head, and turned to Stephen.\n\n“I got it,” She said. She walked over to the door, pulling it open. If it was a Jehovah’s Witness, God had better save them, she thought angrily. She was never going to see that guy die in the movie now.\n\n“Kyle. Trust no one,” A lady with short red hair and blue eyes said, then walked away quickly. Kyle watched her go, blinking. The lady got in the car with a her much taller brown haired partner and drove away, backwards. The car hit a bomb lying in the road and heat filled the air. Kyle shrieked as bits of wreckage rained down around her. She spun around to tell Stephen to call 911. She found he had turned into a giant werebat. He flew at her, screaming in Javascript, and then flew out the door. Kyle grabbed the shot gun and shot him down quickly, then wiped her hands. \n“I knew if I tricked him into trusting me he’d reveal his true form,” She said to Dean Winchester as he stepped out of the closet. He shook his head. \n“You were right, I guess.”\n\nKyle nodded. Her arm chair turned into an angry curly haired nerd, who began spewing spells at her. She dodged a flying reddit as the house melted into an apartment building. Soon the transformation was complete. \n\n“Try it again” The director shouted. Joice sighed; they had already been over that scene eight times. She took off her wig and stopped towards the bottled water. \n\n“SHIA SURPRISE” Screamed Shia Labeouf as he jumped from behind the container, a knife drawn. Joice shrieked. She knew she should have taken nin jitsu. \n\nDanielle finished the story of her aunt’s unfortunate demise to her best friend, Mira. Mira nodded sadly, then drew ina breathe. \n\n“Danielle, this might be a bad time, but I can’t hold it in any longer,” Mira whispered. “I love you!”\n\nDanielle blinked. “This might be a worse time to tell you, but...I’m pregnant!”\n\nMira blinked even more. “What?”\n\n“And it’s yours! Thanks to superior genetic technology provided by Obama!”\n\nThey didn’t have time to celebrate, because their microwave was blown into pieces by a plasma gun. \n\nDanielle looked up to see Arnold Schwarzenegger standing in front of her.\n\n“Your nuker was evil, ma’am.” He said. “And so are you,” He added, then blew her up. \n\nHannah woke up face down on the floor. “So that’s what happens if I don’t take my meds,” She said to Kelly, her alter ego. Her doctor walked in and saw her laying down. He sighed. \n“Hannah, I can’t believe this.”\n\n“I’m sorry Dad I forgot.”\n\n“I’m not your dad,” He replied. “But if you want to make it up to me can you do me a favor?”\n\nHannah and Kelly both nodded. “What do you need?” \n\n“About tree fiddy,” The Doctor replied and that’s when Kyle realized her doctor was a 50 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.

In Junior High she met this boy, Dave, and the two dated for about 6 or 7 years. This happened in the last or second to last year of their relationship. Being young adults, they obviously wanted to sex, but both lacked the space to sex in. \nBeing that we live in NYC, most of us (still) live at home because rents here are insane, so like most of our friends, Dave and Laure still lived at home with their families.\nDue to this, they could never sex because every single time they attempted, without fail, a younger sibling would come home, a parent would come home from work or some other stupid thing would happen to prevent the two from hooking up. The two basically had nowhere to go, ever. \n\nOne day, desperate Dave suggested that he take Laure to one of the only motels in the area, one that is SUPER SKETCHY with a shitty reputation in a neighborhood nearby.\n\nSo they are there at night, setting up the mood. Turn off all the lights. Sketched out by the general ambience (or lack thereof), but wanted sex too much to care.\n\nThey start sex. \n\nA couple of minutes into sex, my friend Laure starts hearing weird noises coming from the room next door. It's not uncommon, since the walls were paper thin, but these noises were weird…like muffled yelling and bangs, as if something was being knocked over. \nThen, suddenly, they hear \"OH MY GOD OH MY GOD \n\nAHHHHHHHHH HELP ME OH MY GODDDDDD HELPPPP\n\n AHHHHHHHHHHH\". \n\nalong with some high pitched screams from some dude next door.\nThe two of them, already sketched the fuck out, untangle, and gather their things, freaked out. They stood out in the hallway for a moment literally pulling their pants up and getting their shoes on as quickly as possible, listening for any other noises but hearing absolutely nothing. Dead silence coming from the room next door.\n\nThey booked it, ran down the hall and told the clerk something happened in the room next to theirs, then went the hell home. \n\nThere was nothing in the news nor did they bother to check out what happened, they were both too freaked out to dwell on it.\n\n\nIf potential murder isn't the biggest boner killer, I don't know what is.

{"body": "Jesus Christ. I was going to ignore you and just hope you get downvoted, but since enough members of the community think this is useful, I need to refute it.\n\nFirst off,  you're flat-out wrong. Anatomically modern humans have existed for about 40,000-45,000 years. If you want to get ultra-strict with your evolution, you could say that we were absolutely, definitively modern by 12,000 BC, which was a little bit before agriculture started and civilization kicked into gear.\n\nSecond, group size depended on resources. If a tribe was adjacent to a abundant food source, they would grow bigger. I cite 150 because that's an extrapolation of existing primate brain size data. As it turns out, primate brain size is a good predictor of social group size. If you graph the logarithm of the weight of the brain vs. size of social group, you'll find a very strong correlation. Extrapolate that to humans, and our brain size indicates a social group of ~150. The prevailing theory is, that is the limit on the size of the social group in which everybody is able to remember and track everyone else's status. Group gets bigger, and our brains can't handle it anymore; people start to feel like \"strangers.\" So that's where I got my number. Where'd you get yours?\n\nFinally, I don't think you know what the Paleolithic era means. That started about 2.6 million years ago, and extended all the way to 10,000 BCl. Like I already said, the fossil record shows modern morphology started around 40,000 BC.

{"body": "**(6:00 AM)** 1/19/2015: \"Welcome to the morning edition of 7 ABC News. Today's top story is about a sick out sweeping the nation. Early reports indicated it was in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, but in a 7 ABC News exclusive, we've learned that the millions are actually taking off to read the ongoing updates of \"Jenny,\" \"Carly,\" and \"Zack\" on an underground website called, \"Read-It.\" \n\nLet's turn to our Cyber Correspondent, Amy reporting live from her computer. Amy?\" \n\n\"Thanks, Roger, this is quite the story. It began unfolding on Friday evening, when an Anonymous *Reddit* user wrote a post on the \"Today I Fouled Up\" forum on the *popular* website. He detailed his foul up in reading his wife, Jenny's, text messages and learned of her infidelity with a flat-house dweller named, Zack. Simultaneously bragging about his fortune while lamenting his current misfortune, he painted a compelling picture that struck a nerve with readers. He immediately received hundreds of posts giving support and advice. \n\nThese posts and comments began to snowball when the Original Poster, known only as \"OP\", started providing live updates about hiring a divorce lawyer, two private investigators and telling his brother, whose wife Carly may or may not have been cheating as well. It is still unclear at this time whether she is an innocent wingwoman or another cheating wife.\n\nThe real-time drama captivated Reddit users throughout the weekend, with more than 20,000 comments posted in a 48-hour period. \n\n7 ABC News reached out to some of these supportive commenters, but most seemed reluctant to talk, saying only \"Fake!\" or \"Tree Fitty!\" We are still researching the deeper meanings to these comments. \n\nThe drama culminated when Jenny returned home at 3:46 pm on Sunday. Since then, OP's posts have been sparse, and millions of readers are waiting impatiently to see if \"OP delivers.\" As a result, businesses across the country have been flooded with sick day requests this morning. 7 ABC News checked with local hospitals and urgent care centers; patient visits this morning are actually the lowest the have been since before flu season began. \n\nThis is a developing situation, Roger, and we'll be monitoring it throughout the day. Back to you.\" \n\n\"Thanks, Amy. In related news, the White House has indicated they will be postponing The State of the Union Address if this tawdry affair is not resolved by Tuesday evening. \n\nAfter the break, is your house killing you?\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421629583", "subreddit": "tifu", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[8:24pm 1/18/15] Oh man. Oh man o h man oh man. This just isn't right. Sorry for this post, it's gonna be a long one, and I'll probably ramble a bit. I'm at my buddies place, me and my brother. After what I've just been through, it's going to be a long time before either of us are ok again. Ok, ok, calming down.\n\tSo, Jenny and Carly came home, and it was just lies and contradictory statements all around. She says it was a misunderstanding, that I don't know what I'm talking about, and then she says I have no proof. Of course, I did have proof. I showed her everything the PI had collected. She was furious, yelling at me. How could I be so deceitful, how could I not trust her? \n\tI about lost it then. Carly was having a similar discussion with my brother. I couldn't listen to the same lies from her as well. I went out on to the back porch, and did something I haven't done in years. I lit up a cigarette, and took a long drag. I was fuming. This wasn't right, it wasn't fair. How could Jenny have been so callous and cruel? To not only cheat on me, but to then accuse me of being the dishonest one. Apparently, all the love and affection I showered her with had been for nothing.\n\tA scream broke me from my reverie. I rushed back into the house, only to see chaos. My mind only recalls snippets, flashes of image. Carly, unconcious on the floor, a pool of blood spreading from under her head. My brother, staring at the door, horrified. Blood, so much blood, on the walls around the door. A shredded pile of clothes. The PI's car outside. Andy Jenny, turning to me with a look I've never seen in her before. She was wild, feral. She looked murderous, and... hungry.\n\tI grabbed my brother, and we bolted out the back door. W ran around the house to my car, hopped in and drove. I drove aimlessly for a while, hoping that Jenny wasn't following, trying to throw her off the trail if she was. Eventually, we made it to my buddy's place, then one we were going to watch the game at. We ran inside and locked the door. \n\n[8:36pm 1/18/15] She's here. I think she may have killed the PI, and maybe Carly as well. I don't know what to do. She's peering into the windows, and knocking on the door. I'm not letting her in.\n\n[8:50pm 1/18/15] I...  don't know what just  happened. I thought I was dead. Hell, everyone else is. My brother, my buddy, the PI, Carly. Jenny slaughtered them all. Like it was nothing.  She broke down the door, and immediately lashed out at my brother. She backhanded him... and he went flying across the room, like some shitty movie. His head caved on the brick fireplace. I don't think he suffered. I ran to the back of the house. My buddy stepped out of the bathroom, but he was swatted away as well. I don't think he made it either. I glanced back over my shoulder. Jenny seemed... wrong, somehow. Like her mouth was open too wide, her neck was too long.\n\tI bolted through the kitchen, to the garage, thinking I might find some sort of weapon with which to defend myself. I grabbed a tire iron and faced the door. I heard her coming, but slowly, as if she was purposely trying to scare me. It fucking worked. I was terrified. She... slithered through the door with surprising speed. Slithered is the only word that works. She crossed the garage before I could blink, knocking my makeshift weapon from my hand, and pinning me to the ground with her... flipper? What the fuck is going on, I thought to my self. There was no speaking from me, I was too petrified for speech.\n\tJenny curved her long neck down, brought her gaping, reptilian maw right next to my head, and sybilantly whispered to me, \"Gimme mah tree fiddy.''

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade in High School I took a psychology class, one of our assignments was to do an amateur psychology experiment on some people or someone we knew.\nThere was this girl in the class, lets call her Amy, Amy was a really good friend of mine but she was also fine as hell. At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward. And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.\nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward. So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\n\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\"\nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"\nEveryone in the hall heard. The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.\nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.\nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"\n\nWat.\n\nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying.\nA few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.\n\nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.\nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered. I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.\n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her. Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"\nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her. She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"\n\nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\" I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.\nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear. This is great.\nIt slowly escalates into us having sex, me for my first time. After what felt like only a few minutes (It was actually just over 15 minutes) we finally stopped having sex, I felt so great, I've never felt this great again in my life.\n\nWe're lying in bed cuddling and she turns to me and says \"Wow, are you sure that was your first time? You were great.\"\nI personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time. Then she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\" The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\"\nShe says \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That goddamn Loch Ness Monster had tricked me again.\n\nI stood there screaming at her as she swam off into the distance.\nAs for my psychology project, I never did get it done, and instead dropped the class because of the terrible memories it had given me.

This was an amazing opportunity, because I was really interested in politics, and in the future I wanted to get into politics, maybe even be the president. So, naturally I was really excited...\n\nBut this is when the prankster side of my brain started going off. To prank Barack Obama would put me above everyone else. I started getting ideas of what I can do, but none of them really stuck. Since I couldn't really think, I decided to go for a swim. Swimming always help me think. \n\nWhen I was surrounded by water I got the perfect idea. I would go back to the basics. I would rig a water bucket in the oval office, causing Obama to get doused in water. It was a full proof plan.\n\nSo a few months later I got to the White House and I was led into the Oval Office. The Secret Service was feeling very uneasy around me. I have no idea why. To be able to be alone I had a friend get onto the same wavelengths as the Secret Service's Walkie-Talkies and have him get the agents to relocate.\n\nWhen they left I set up my rig. I'd done this many, many, many times before. My muscle memories worked faster than my brain. I was done in 5 minutes, just before the secret service walked back in. Luckily, they didn't notice the bucket of water above the other door.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later the Agents told me the President was about to come into the room. This was my moment. The door started to open, and with it the bucket started to turn over. I had gotten the President. He looked straight at me, full of rage, and asked me why I had done that. With a straight face, I said, \"I need about tree fiddy\", and they all ran because they realized I was 500 feet tall and from the Mesozoic Era.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421682610", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms.  She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet.  His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name.  Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.  \n\nJoe didn't give a shit.  He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either.  Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom.  His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\".  His name was now legally Adam Adams.  Why?  All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\n\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe,  my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it.  He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember.  But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage.  The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me.  Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son.  This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\n\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.  \n\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on.  She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does.  My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\n\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.  \n\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story.  She does.  Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words).  While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out. \n\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved.  After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad.  I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story.  When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her.  She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. However, there was something different this time. On her head was a crown. Not of gold, but of nails.

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again.

What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once.

{"body": "I worked at McDonald's for 8 years while I put myself through school in order to help pay for my PhD program. So I feel as both a scientist as well as a fast food worker, I am qualified to answer this particular question. Let's travel back in time to the year 1999. The new millennium was almost upon us, and the Y2K craze was in full swing. People were acting like it was the end of the world, and for all we knew, it was! One day I was walking back from school with friends and we passed old man Wilkerson's house. The legends of old man Wilkerson were that of legend. He never gave out candy on Halloween, but that might have been because he was an alleged child molester, but then again who isn't nowadays, amirite? The point I'm trying to make is old man Wilkerson's property was in such a position that one had to walk an extra half mile to get around it to get to the main street that ran adjacent to my friends houses, and more importantly my own house. As is the case everyone would walk by this house and claim that they new a guy who would cut through Wilkerson's backyard to cut the time in half, but it was never them who did it. I knew a guy whose brother swears on everything he once saw a guy go into that backyard, but then again Billy's brother was an avid user of the marijuana, so perhaps he was just on another one of his acid trips and what he actually saw was a stray dog or perhaps the loch ness monster or something of that ilk. The point I'm trying to make here is that the world was about to be sent back into the time before computers and if I was going to die a virgin, I wasn't going to die a pussy, so on this faithful day I decided to summon all of my courage and told my friend to hold my backpack (the child equivalent of hold my beer) and I boldly stepped into Wilkerson's back yard, telling my friends I'd see them on the other side.\n\nThis is where I saw the worst thing I'd ever witnessed. Now before I go on, I should paint you a mental picture of old man Wilkerson. He was roughly 54, with a full head of hair that was about 3 years from being fully gray. He was built like an ox because he was a police officer for many years before. He once saved 34 kids from a bus that drove into a river by free diving down and getting them out 5 at a time. He arrested his own brother for a speeding ticket. This guy was essentially Captain America, but real. To say this man was everything a child would aspire to be at that age is an understatement. Anyway, I turn the corner and the I see old man Wilkerson staring right at me from behind a bbq. A CHARCOAL BBQ! Now I don't know about you, but using charcoal is essentially saying you don't like meat and just want everything you put in your mouth to taste like literally a butt hole that just finished passing a months worth of Indian food. I was horrified. I turned around screaming. By the time I caught up with my friends I had screamed so loud and for so long I had lost my voice. My heart was beating at 187 bpm and I was sweating like a whore in church. My friends asked me what I saw, but I refused to tell them the horrors I witnessed in an attempt to keep their boyish innocence for just a moment longer. We had just started high school, and I knew that would all soon be gone. This was the greatest gift I could give, and so I kept what I saw there to myself until today, as enough time had passed. I will never fully recover from what I saw, but I'm now a successful scientist with a beautiful wife and 37 propane bbq's, so I can once again sleep and only wake up 3 times a night screaming from nightmares of that day.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421783135", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms.  She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet.  His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name.  Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.  \n\nJoe didn't give a shit.  He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either.  Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom.  His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\".  His name was now legally Adam Adams.  Why?  All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\n\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe,  my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it.  He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember.  But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage.  The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me.  Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son.  This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\n\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.  \n\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on.  She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does.  My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\n\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.  \n\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story.  She does.  Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words).  While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out. \n\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved.  After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad.  I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story.  When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her.  She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again.  But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one.\n\ntl;dr: Friend's mom is an overprotective bitch, I get mad at her for being an overprotective bitch.\n\n^^^^(http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xu7ju/just_saw_a_mother_walk_into_a_classroom_with_a/c5pniko)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421819213", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1. Gods are concepts\n2. Concepts exist\n3. Therefore Gods exist\n\nDefinition of concept: an abstract idea; a general notion.\n\nDefinition of abstract: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.\n\nI perfectly agree with you here. I consider God to be a concept, an abstract, an idea of something that exists only in the minds of people who think about God. That puts God on the same level as gremlins, unicorns, leprechauns, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness monster. I completely agree with you. Now let's both go convince the Vatican that God doesn't really exist.\n\n&gt;The first thing to cover is that, as with all objective “truths”, we must accept on pure faith that the external world exists and that there are other conscious people in it. \n\nNot true. Observation of the external world tells me that it is the same for everyone, and that other entities in said world act as though they are agents with a will of their own. While it's impossible to know for 100% sure that we're not in a brain-in-a-vat scenario, 100% certainty is an impossible standard, and should never be used.\n\n&gt;Thoughts are nonphysical, that is to say they themselves cannot be held, observed, and so on. Just because they are partially or fully dependent on the physical brain does not make thoughts, themselves physical. Yet we agree that thoughts exist despite the lacking physical evidence.\n\nThe mind is to the brain what the software is to the hardware. Do you think that Windows is non-physical? That the computer programs enabling you to write on the internet are non-physical? No? Then why do you think the mind works in ~~mysterious~~ immaterial ways? It's not enough for you to say \"thoughts are immaterial because reasons\", then not make your case and assume that thoughts are non-material. We have very good reasons to assume that thoughts are entirely physical. Just because we can't see ideas under a microscope does not mean they are not physical. Remember, you can't see a internet under a microscope either. You have to use the right tools for the right job.\n\n&gt;As with thoughts, concepts can be seen to be held by others and they can be seen to impact the world in objective and measurable ways.\n\nMy thinking \"I wanna kill the guy who plays guitar at 3 in the morning\" does not have any impact whatsoever on the world. My acting on this, however, does have a significant impact. Thoughts on their own can do nothing without a body to express them. A murderous robotic program on a computer cannot do anything, unless the computer is connected to something that will allow it to act on it and follow through with the program.\n\n&gt; One would never argue that a chair that was conceived of, created, and impacts the objective would was non-existent just because the chair did not exist prior to the concept.\n\nI have no idea what you're saying here, but you seem to be saying that concepts existed forever, and floated somewhere \"out there\" until we discovered them. It's not that concepts did not exist before we invented them, it's that they always existed until we discovered them. Is this correct?\n\n&gt;So why would you say that a god that was conceived of, brought in the world via preaching / practice and idol making, and have MASSIVE impacts on the objective world is nonexistent?\n\nSure, God as an idea has impact when people act on their thoughts relating to God. However, God is traditionally defined as omnipotent omnipresent and omnibenevolent. A concept is none of those things. By dint of that, you accept that the idea of God you are talking about is **completely different** from the idea of God religious people believe in.\n\n&gt;by understanding them as creations without prior existence\n\nWhat does this even mean?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421848483", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, let's do the math:\n\nThe $25 in merchandise cost the store somewhere between 5% and 50% of its sale price; let's assume 50%, to be generous. (Something that costs $25 is extremely unlikely to be a loss-leader, regardless of the business in question.) So we're actually talking about, at most, $12.50's worth of loss right off the top. Suppose the employee sees the theft in progress, attempts to stop it, and fails - which is the worst case scenario, given that it's the one in which you both waste the employee's paid time and lose the value of the product. An employee that you're paying $8/hr is actually costing you maybe $12/hr to keep employed, what with the various taxes and costs incurred by being a business with employees. If the employee spends 5 minutes trying to prevent the theft, that has cost you another dollar. If the employee then spends 5 minutes filling out a form reporting the loss, that's another dollar. \n\nWhere does that form go? To a manager or assistant, neither of whom are making minimum wage; they're probably at $12 or $13/hr, costing you $16-$18/hr. Let's say they take another 5 minutes; that's another buck fifty or so. Tree fiddy to log a $12.50 loss? Your losses have gone up 28%. \n\nBut that's just the minimum. Suppose you decide to call the police to actually report the crime (presumably so you can try and recoup the loss - let's assume you succeed at that for some crazy reason). That's a half-hour of both your employee's time and your manager or assistant manager's time while the cop is there taking statements and so on. That's $14 in cost in the wages of those two employees alone. What about what those employees would've otherwise been doing? Presumably what they're doing for your business is worth to you what you're paying them (probably more if you're actually turning a profit). Even if they're only adding their pay's worth of value to your business, though, they're still failing to add $14 in value during that half hour. Now you're effectively out $28 even if you recover the $12.50's worth of product as a result of the police involvement. You've increased your losses 124% - and that's assuming that whatever product you've recovered is still in suitable condition for sale!\n\nThere's just no profit in trying to prevent the vast majority of small retail theft by customers. The majority of valuable goods stolen from retail stores is actually stolen by *employees,* and *that* is worth spending time preventing and reporting. The lady who stuffs a handful of thongs in her bag when she visits Vicky's Secret, though?

{"body": "I named my cat Kelbertinghoess (yes with the double s)\n\nLong ago, which is like two years ago, I was part of a gaming community that had a wide range of people involved in it. One of the people I played frequently with was named Mr. Tyrone. His real name wasn't Tyrone and I honestly have no idea why he chose this name, but that's a moot (rip) point. \n\nWe would play mainly Smite, but we decided to pick up Terraria while it was on sale. We decided that getting a group together to play would be fun. He was going to host, but he didn't have his ports forwarded so we just used Hamachi.\n\nHe gave us the Username and password. Two strings of characters that I will never forget. \n\nUsername: Kelbertinghoess\n\nPassword: flappers\n\nAt the time I didn't realize just how much these two words would mean to me. We played Terraria and Smite regularly, but as many great friendships do, we drifted apart. About a year ago, Mr Tyrone was completely removed from my life and I was no longer playing Smite or Terraria with him. \n\nI still haven't talked to Mr Tyrone in all those months, but I knew I needed to honor his legacy in some way. So when my little cat Lilly gave birth, I decided I would keep one and name it in honor of one of the greatest internet friends of all time.  \n\nI Christensen the fluffy, black creature as Kelbertinghoess Flappers, first of his name. He is as intelligent as felines come, and each time he looks at me with those eye filled with wisdom beyond his cat years, my mind wanders back to a simpler time. A time where I would be able to hop on Team Speak and find hours of entertainment with this man named Mr Tyrone. Sometimes a tear will rim my eye as the fond memories fade into the pit of my stomach and I am brought back to the harsh realities of my life. Sometimes a smile will find my lips as I remember exploring caves in Terraria and fighting goblin invasions with my internet pal. \n\nSoon though, I must be brought back to the present. And as those red eyes bore into me, I soon realize that it is not in fact my cat i'm looking at, but an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again. I needed not speak, for the look in my eyes told the cryptid he would find to spare change here. All he would find are the memories of better times and a friend I will never forget\n\ntldr; named my cat after an internet friend\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421877633", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "OK I have a story for you and it does NOT involve anything from the paleolithic era.\nWoman here, 34 years old. \nI have always had problems with hemorrhoids and they just got worse after I had my daughter. I'd have flair ups maybe twice a year at first, they'd get really bad and I'd be down and out for a couple of days. And then it started getting worse. They started happening every other month, and then every month, and then every week, and finally they were just there all of the time. I couldn't squat down to get something out of the bottom of my fridge, I couldn't pick up my daughter and swing her around, and I certainly wouldn't even CONSIDER anal.\nFinally I got sick of it and went to a hospital. I saw a colorectal surgeon who told me immediately that I needed surgery. Banding, lasers, none of that would help he said, only surgery. The problem was, I didn't have insurance. So I was given fiber and an anti inflammatory and sent home.\nFast forward 4 years later and it's unbearable. It feels like I have testicles between my cheeks and the pain is unbearable. I spent an entire week in my tent at Burning Man unable to walk because it got so bad. I missed the entire thing!\nFinally, a light at the end of the tunnel! I was accepted for the Oregon Health Plan! I went and met with a doctor who said yes I needed the surgery immediately but he had some bad news.. OHP doesn't cover this type of surgery because it's cosmetic. Are you kidding me? I don't care what my wax lady thinks, or my boyfriend. It hurts! It's ruining my life and I can't even do the simplest of tasks. He said \" I know and believe me I have gone to the members of the OHP board and explained to them multiple times that this is a completely necessary surgery. So here's what i want you to do: I want you to call our financial aid office and explain your situation. Tell them you are a single mother living on her own and going to school, tell them how badly it hurts and that you can't even pick up your daughter and put her to bed. Chances are once they read your story, they will offer either a payment plan, or financial assistance. So I got home and wrote a letter. I wrote several actually. I spent days on the phone with the hospital and filled out forms that proved my income was really low, my doctor wrote a letter explaining that it was medically necessary for me to have the surgery and OHP declined to pay. But still, I pursued. Finally, a month later I received word that they would give me 50% off of my surgery cost. My mom generously paid half of the doctors visitor fee (about 400.00) which would allow them to schedule me.\nI had the surgery the following week and let me just tell you that recovering from that is NO joke. BUT it's way less awful than what you are going through now. I'd say what you are going through now is far worse by about 30 times. I was down for about 2 weeks and felt almost normal by 3 but it took a lot of rest. I had to drink laxatives to keep my stools soft, and the pain meds I was on stopped me up. So once I learned how to balance it all out it wasn't THAT bad. 3 weeks later I get a call from the hospital asking about my balance. I owed about 5500.00 and I told them that I'd be happy to set up a payment plan. The kind lady on the phone said to me that the hospital had decided to write it off. Total. Miracle.\nIt sounds to me like you have rectal prolapse, which is very serious. You should think about seeing a colorectal surgeon, somebody who specializes in not only dealing with your rectum but also your bowels, which might be affected by your self surgery. I am so sorry about your mother and the pain of losing her. I can't even imagine. I sympathize with you so deeply my dear and I have been there *not as bad but I have been there. SO I would see a colorectal surgeon and explain your situation. Most hospitals have a budget for procedures that they write off. Bang on doors, blow up office phones until you have an answer. Set up a payment plan if they allow because your situation sounds extremely serious. And if you have to have a colostomy so be it. It sounds better than what you have to deal with now. And I would stop the anal sex immediately. It's only going to make things worse. If the boyfriend doesn't get it, than he's NOT WORTH IT. You have to look out for your health so you can take care of your children.\nPM my if you want to chat ok?\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421884080", "subreddit": "sex", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I mean I just wanted to make it a movie is all, but going the PI route is probably the best solution:\n\nSo like I said I wanted to make the story a movie. I always wanted to make a good movie with a good story that people would like, and this one even shut down reddit. Fire flames like you read about. I followed this since the second update and think it has *huge* potential, just like OP's dick. Since all of /u/MyLifeSuxNow is getting deleted, and he clarified in his disclaimer to contact him for consent for rights, I decided to hire a PI and read his texts/reddit comments.\n\n(9:47): I decided to research PI's. Gotta get the best amirite??? I checked Yelp and Grubhub, not so much on the latter. I keep getting results for \"qt 3.14\"; not exactly the \"PI\" I'm looking for, but I'll take it.\n\n(9:51): I found one guy. He's chinese, I was hoping he was a ninja but he said he was just a cop that got tired of the dirty cops in his department and decided to go rogue in search for something called the lochness monster. This case and OP instantly reminded it of the monsta. He said he usually doesn't go straight out and investigate people as soon as a client calls him, but because of MLK day and the fact that it might be connected to the Nessie, he agreed. I also got a justice of the peace and a divorce lawyer just in case. I found these guys on a bus stop ad.\n\n(9:55): The PI just arrived at OP's house. He said he's on Pornhub. I asked what he's watching and he said \"football\". I told him the porn and he said he couldn't share that info because he (PI) was too busy masturbating. (TMI bro). He said he can share just about any and all info. Cool.\n\n(9:59): Sunny in Philly just came on. Great show. Kind of hungry. Wish I had chinese food. I think I might make a pizza. Not delivery, DiGiorno.\n\n(10:12): PI just texted me a dick pic. Like WTF.\n\n(10:20): PI said sorry about the pic. Meant to send it to \"Jenny\" who would send it to \"Zack\" to \"show him what a real dick looks like\". Whatever. He said OP still hasn't left. He's on Reddit now. Be on the look out!!\n\n(10:25): I started to work on the screenplay of the movie. Incase I can't get \"consent\" (like who needs that), I took the initiative to change the names of the story. \"Jenny\" is \"Penny\", \"Zack\" is \"J.D.\", \"Carly\" is \"Barly\", \"X\" is \"Kunta Kinte\".

{"body": "Here is the difference:\n\nChristianity is a philosophy. It's a system that has rules, ways you should behave, who you should kill, ways of having that murder washed clean. There are leaders, authority is not challenged and was - in the past - seen as heresy for which you were killed. Following orders was required. If leaders decided to invade countries or kill people for imaginary things like witchcraft, that was just how things were done because it was, as told to everyone, God's will. God put these people in charge, they decided to do something, therefore God explicitly supports this action.\n\nWhat does atheism have? Nothing. There is no philosophy, no ideology, no leaders, no ways to behave, no anything. It's one thing and one thing only: lack of belief in Gods. If you want to play the \"but it used to be belief in no Gods\" then fine - it still doesn't tell you anything.\n\nSo with that lack of anything, how is any action - good or bad - tied to atheism? It's like, if I don't believe in unicorns, I will therefore wear shoes. My lack of belief in the Loch Ness monster means I will kick that puppy. It's a non-sequitur.\n\nIf your point is that without belief in Gods, atheists have no problem doing evil then what's the difference between that idea and the idea that those who believe in Gods do actual evil in the name of that God and who are forgiven by religious leaders?\n\nI'll take Stalin in particular because I know him better - he's responsible for killing a few of my family members. The mindset of Soviets was still that of the tsar, that the leaders are divine, can't be wrong, and rule with the approval of God. There are even documentaries made in 1980s of Russians in remote villages who still believe the tsar is alive, they have an icon hanging on the wall and everything. The communists visit the village and pretend to be their representatives for taxes and that's how it goes. This strong faith has been in place for centuries. Considering the past history of the entire region - city-states and numerous conquests - having a unified Russia is critical to the population and to do that, you need to have full faith in the leader to keep them safe. The mindset of a God-king is ingrained into the society so when the Revolution came, it didn't change much. The leaders were still the leaders and considering most of the population are peasants, they didn't know any better. We now know that the best way to kill a bunch of people is to send them away somewhere. Hitler sent away Jews in concentration camps, Stalin sent away all his enemies to Siberia. So it's actually the case that not only did most people didn't know that people were being killed on this mass scale but everyone was afraid of Stalin to say or do anything.\n\nI'll give you two examples. When Stalin gave a speech and everyone clapped their hands. However, Stalin didn't raise his hands as a sign to stop clapping and everyone continued to clap. A minute, two, three... five. He was testing everyone in the room to see who will stop clapping first - and he was watching and so were the NKVD. Peoples hands began bleeding and he finally stopped it. If you don't believe that this kind of a thing can happen, go to YouTube and watch when Hussein took power and people were taken away during their meeting (Edit: [here's the link](http://youtu.be/bm64E5R12s8?t=2m24s) ). The second example is that when Stalin actually died, nobody believed it. People thought it was another test. Weeks went by and people still believed he was alive. This is the power of a tyrant for a ready-made population who believed in a God-king. Does atheism do all this? No. This is people submitting to corrupt authority. Stalin made sure a cult of personality was forged and fed - he saved Russia from Hitler, don't forget, he's a great hero. Never mind what actually happened, like Stalin royally messing up the war from start to finish and the sheer number of Russians being thrown at the Nazi's, often unarmed, is what won it.\n\nThere is a historical anti-Christian vibe in Soviet Russia from its foundation and that's the massive corruption of religion who propped up the king and his decisions to get into lots of debt and pay it off with grain rather than feeding the local population. Millions died and Christianity said this is the best decision for the God-king. So you can see why there's quite a bit of anti-religious vibe in the beginning. Is this what atheism causes? No. Some Christians in the US hate Muslims because of 9/11. Does their Christianity cause that hate? No, it's probably because these Muslims killed our citizens on 9/11. Same thing here.\n\nI don't know as much about Mao but it's possible something similar happened there. Considering North Korea is a shining example of what cult of personality does, it's not atheism that's required to do this. In essence - and this has been mentioned many times before by others - when you become the ruler of a nation, you do everything you can to make sure that you're a critical component, especially if the country is not free. After all, it's you're not above the people, special, and critical to the country's survival, then why can't the population simply rise up and kill you?\n\n**Edit** \n\nThank you for the gold :]", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1421935559", "subreddit": "TrueAtheism", "score": 57, "controversiality": 0}

And what's the utility redefining God to mean \"everything.\" When I ask someone, \"Do you believe in God?\" it's understood that I'm asking them if they believe in a conscious entity which created and/or exerts influence over the universe. No one thinks I really mean \"Do you believe everything that exists exists?\" Saying \"God is everything\" is equally as useful as saying \"God is my left foot\" and then expecting people to know about my redefinition. I can't carry out a conversation with you if you've arbitrarily decided that words have a diffrent meaning than the ones in the dictionary. Do you think [Bigfoot](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Bigfoot) and the [Loch Ness Monster](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster) are real? Well, you do now, because I've just redefined those to mean \"the planet Jupiter\" and \"the element of sodium,\" respectively. Annoying, isn't it?\n\n&gt;Because if it was the other way around things would appear exactly as they do, as though the body creates the mind, because the mind is non-physical we cannot test that it is there\n\nIf the claim that the mind is a non-physical entity is non-testable, then I cannot distinguish between a universe in which that statement is true and one in which it false. In which case, I should take up the default null hypothesis that the claim is false, until it can be proven otherwise.\n\n&gt;If there was a world, created by the mind, which there are, the dream worlds\n\n\"Dream worlds\" are hallucinations; the perception by a mind of something that does not exist. There is no reason to suppose that everything a mind perceives actually exits, or is being \"created\" by a mind. If I take LSD, I may perceive that my walls are melting, but I have no reason to suspect my mind is somehow creating a world where that's actually happening. Again, every available line of evidence points to the imagining of things to be a chemical process.

Unless you've been dating them four years and she grabs your phone and starts crying and screaming and stands in front of the door and the only way you can actually call the cops would be to physically assault her for your phone which if you do the neighbors will hear and then the cops will have a 50/50 chance at worst to take her side because she's the one crying and she is probably crazy enough to hit herself to be able to blame you. So... good luck not fucking around with that bullshit, don't stick your dick in crazy. Oh wait, she probably wasn't crazy when you started dating her, she probably just saw a bunch of facebook posts of how all her friends are having babies and getting married, but you don't want to do that yet because you want to start your own business and don't want to allocate your funds towards a child and you don't want to marry somebody who clearly has different long term goals then you.

{"body": "Edit: this turned into a novel, sorry. Slow day at work.\n\n&gt;Why guys cheat.\n\nEveryone acts like cheating is this thing that has to be morally and logically defensible for one's entire life. Wanna know why people cheat? Because it only has to make sense for the two or three moments leading up to you saying \"yes\", not for your entire life. Sure, you know, in the moment, you will regret it later, but later is not now. Now this feels good.\n\nHow do I know? I've been there. I'm not proud, but this is my story.\n\nLet's say your a hot, young attorney and the boss sends you across the state to conduct your first deposition. Let's say it goes well. Let's say the lead attorney compliments you, and this means the world to you because you know fuck all about what you're doing. Afterwards, you're in the hotel gym to blow off some steam and you see her. She's beautiful, and she's a brunette, and she's fit and she's just your type.\n\nBut your eyes go to the floor. You're in a very, very serious relationship. And whatever, the male gaze, safe spaces, etc. Etc. You try not to look between sets, but you do because you're human and her ass in those tight yoga pants as she jogs... Window shopping isn't stealing. She's looking at you, occasionally, too. Eventually, she leaves. You finish the work out. You shower, and forget about the whole thing.\n\nLater, alone in a hotel bar because you've never been to this city and know absolutely no one she approaches you and she is so beautiful. She's cleaned up, now, and she looks like the sun rise after a year of nights and she introduces herself and you talk. Later, you make the world's worst joke about kids on leashes and she laughs one of those embarassing, braying laughs. The kind that if you did it, you'd cringe so hard that you would disappear into yourself. \n\nAnd you know, then, that she wants you.\n\nAnd where's your girlfriend? Across the state. You've been texting this whole trip, but it's not the same. Her looking for a job has really taken a toll on her self esteem. She's cold. Distant. She doesn't initiate anymore. Or, at least, this is what you tell yourself. You use your fake bitterness like a shield to guard against the guilt you know you'll feel. It almost works.\n\n6 drinks later the new girl, Danielle, her name was Danielle, puts her hotel key in the back pocket of your jeans. She tells you to come upstairs whenever you're ready. And everything is so fuzzy, now. You're drunk on the drinks and the sexual attention and the way the night feels warm and safe. She leaves and you stay and think, but you're not thinking. You're rationalizing. You're making excuses.\n\nYou're convincing yourself you're not the enormous piece of shit you actually are.\n\nIt continues in the elevator, and you look at your phone. Your girlfriend texted you: \"Goodnight, sweetie! I love you.\" You feel sick, but your finger doesn't push the button to your floor. It goes to Danielle's. You text back \"I love you more!\" And you approach Danielle's door. And you knock.\n\nAnd, standing there, just inside the threshold, is a paleolithic sea monster. And she asks \"Can I get about tree fiddy?\" And that's when you realize that Danielle is actually the Loch Ness Monster, and you've been tricked. Again.\n\nThat's why guys cheat. Because sometimes, in the heat of the moment, we only care about the present. The past, the future, the things we should care about?

{"body": "&gt; Essentially, I don't think that materialism is capable of adequately explaining all that I've experienced as a human being, and to reduce those experiences to mere chemical interactions in synaptic clefts is reductionist.\n\nYou're making the same misconception here that I alluded to before -- that materialism is simple and that non-materialism allows for more complexity. It is the opposite that is actually true: materialism allows for complexity and non-materialistic parts of the mind would make no room for complexity at least arising from those parts of the mind. The same thing is true of the body and of human physiology for the same reasons. Nobody would invoke non-physical parts of the body to explain the weird things that their bodies do because that hypothesis would not be able to explain anything about physiology.\n\n&gt; I'm a philosopher and not a neurobiologist, so while I'm willing and able to discuss the metaphysical implications of the human mind, I really can't approach the issue from a purely biological standpoint, nor do I think that would be appropriate.\n\nIf you understood the human mind from a few different biological perspectives you would understand where you are going wrong. (I'm not surprised that you're a philosopher and not a biologist.) One perspective is the evolutionary perspective. Everything about the \"structure\" of our minds including all of our basic ways of thinking and feeling (common to all healthy humans) evolved because they aided in survival and reproduction. These structures were essentially engineered by natural selection over evolutionary time. People who might invoke Cupid to explain love do not appreciate that love evolved for particular reasons. Another perspective is the computational theory of mind. It actually allows people to explain how the mind works by means of information processing in the mundane ways that people usually take it as a given. Read the following passage. It discusses the visual system and a few others in particular but the message applies to every single human psychological faculty including our thoughts deepest emotions:\n\n--------------------\n\nThe mind, I claim, is not a single organ but a system of organs, which we can think of as psychological faculties or mental modules. The entities now commonly evoked to explain the mind — such as general intelligence, a capacity to form culture, and multipurpose learning strategies — will surely go the way of protoplasm in biology and of earth, air, fire, and water in physics. These entities are so formless, compared to the exacting phenomena they are meant to explain, that they must be granted near-magical powers. When the phenomena are put under the microscope, we discover that the complex texture of the everyday world is supported not by a single substance but by many layers of elaborate machinery. Biologists long ago replaced the concept of an all-powerful protoplasm with the concept of functionally specialized  {28}  mechanisms. The organ systems of the body do their jobs because each is built with a particular structure tailored to the task. The heart circulates the blood because it is built like a pump; the lungs oxygenate the blood because they are built like gas exchangers. The lungs cannot pump blood and the heart cannot oxygenate it. This specialization goes all the way down. Heart tissue differs from lung tissue, heart cells differ from lung cells, and many of the molecules making up heart cells differ from those making up lung cells. If that were not true, our organs would not work.\n\nA jack-of-all-trades is master of none, and that is just as true for our mental organs as for our physical organs. The robot challenge makes that clear. Building a robot poses many software engineering problems, and different tricks are necessary to solve them.\n\nTake our first problem, the sense of sight. A seeing machine must solve a problem called inverse optics. Ordinary optics is the branch of physics that allows one to predict how an object with a certain shape, material, and illumination projects the mosaic of colors we call the retinal image. Optics is a well-understood subject, put to use in drawing, photography, television engineering, and more recently, computer graphics and virtual reality. But the brain must solve the *opposite* problem. The input is the retinal image, and the output is a specification of the objects in the world and what they are made of — that is, what we know we are seeing. And there's the rub. Inverse optics is what engineers call an “ill-posed problem.” It literally has no solution. Just as it is easy to multiply some numbers and announce the product but impossible to take a product and announce the numbers that were multiplied to get it, optics is easy but inverse optics impossible. Yet your brain does it every time you open the refrigerator and pull out a jar. How can this be?\n\nThe answer is that *the brain supplies the missing information*, information about the world we evolved in and how it reflects light. If the visual brain “assumes” that it is living in a certain kind of world — an evenly lit world made mostly of rigid parts with smooth, uniformly colored surfaces — it can make good guesses about what is out there. As we saw earlier, it's impossible to distinguish coal from snow by examining the brightnessies of their retinal projections. But say there is a module for perceiving the properties of surfaces, and built into it is the following assumption: “The world is smoothly and uniformly lit.” The module can solve the coal-versus-snow problem in three steps: subtract out any gradient of brightness from one edge of the scene to the other; estimate the average level of brightness of  {29}  the whole scene; and calculate the shade of gray of each patch by subtracting its brightness from the average brightness. Large positive deviations from the average are then seen as white things, large negative deviations as black things. If the illumination really is smooth and uniform, those perceptions will register the surfaces of the world accurately. Since Planet Earth has, more or less, met the even-illumination assumption for eons, natural selection would have done well by building the assumption in.\n\nThe surface-perception module solves an unsolvable problem, but at a price. The brain has given up any pretense of being a general problem-solver. It has been equipped with a gadget that perceives the nature of surfaces in typical earthly viewing conditions because it is specialized for that parochial problem. Change the problem slightly and the brain no longer solves it. Say we place a person in a world that is not blanketed with sunshine but illuminated by a cunningly arranged patchwork of light. If the surface-perception module assumes that illumination is even, it should be seduced into hallucinating objects that aren't there. Could that really happen? It happens every day. We call these hallucinations slide shows and movies and television (complete with the illusory black I mentioned earlier). When we watch TV, we stare at a shimmering piece of glass, but our surface-perception module tells the rest of our brain that we are seeing real people and places. The module has been unmasked; it does not apprehend the nature of things but relies on a cheat-sheet. That cheat-sheet is so deeply embedded in the operation of our visual brain that we cannot erase the assumptions written on it. Even in a lifelong couch potato, the visual system never “learns” that television is a pane of glowing phosphor dots, and the person never loses the illusion that there is a world behind the pane.\n\nOur other mental modules need their own cheat-sheets to solve their unsolvable problems. A physicist who wants to figure out how the body moves when muscles are contracted has to solve problems in kinematics (the geometry of motion) and dynamics (the effects of forces). But a brain that has to figure out how to contract muscles to get the body to move has to solve problems in inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics — what forces to apply to an object to get it to move in a certain trajectory. Like inverse optics, inverse kinematics and dynamics are ill-posed problems. Our motor modules solve them by making extraneous but reasonable assumptions — not assumptions about illumination, of course, but assumptions about bodies in motion.\n\nOur common sense about other people is a kind of intuitive psychology  {30}  — we try to infer people's beliefs and desires from what thley do, and try to predict what they will do from our guesses about their beliefs and desires. Our intuitive psychology, though, must make the assumption that other people have beliefs and desires; we cannot sense a belief or desire in another person's head the way we smell oranges. If we did not see the social world through the lens of that assumption, we would be like the Samaritan I robot, which sacrificed itself for a bag of lima beans, or like Samaritan II, which went overboard for any object with a humanlike head, even if the head belonged to a large wind-up toy. (Later we shall see that people suffering from a certain syndrome lack the assumption that people have minds and do treat other people as wind-up toys.) Even our feelings of love for our family members embody a specific assumption about the laws of the natural world, in this case an inverse of the ordinary laws of genetics. Family feelings are designed to help our genes replicate themselves, but we cannot see or smell genes. Scientists use forward genetics to deduce how genes get distributed among organisms (for example, meiosis and sex cause the offspring of two people to have fifty percent of their genes in common); our emotions about kin use a kind of inverse genetics to guess which of the organisms we interact with are likely to share our genes (for example, if someone appears to have the same parents as you do, treat the person as if their genetic well-being overlaps with yours).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422046328", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

He goes off the path, through the woods. i'm slowing down due to having heavy boots and a bookbag full of trail mix, camera gear, and a water bottle. i keep him in sight, but i'm losing him. we get to a clearing in a field, and he just stops. i sit at the treeline behind a tree, waiting for his next move.\n\nthe wait goes on for a few minutes, and then he suddenly sprints towards me. Can he see me? does he know i'm here? fearing for my life, i take my trusty spyderco knife out and open the blade, clutching it in preparation to defend myself by any means. He gets within a few feet and i drop my bag and spin around the tree to blindside him. He comes around the tree to see only a bag, and i grab him from behind, pushing the knife to his back so he knows i've got the drop on him. \n\nhe is panicking, breathing like a rabid dog. he is covered in sweat and trembling. i have no idea what to do now. i tell him to lay down on his stomach, hands behind his head. he ignores me. i repeat myself, and he replies \"just give it to me!\" what? give you what? \"right now, give it to me!\" i ask him - What do you want? after a few labored breath's, he relaxes and says - \"imma need bout tree fiddy\" it was about this time i noticed this man was 8 stories tall and prehistoric creature from the proterozoic era. i said \"dammit monster, i ain't giving you no damn tree fiddy!\" and stabbed him in the neck and then he died.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422109954", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

So I was just talking to some people when we all decided to go outside to the party tent on the beach. It was around 1:30 when people started taking XTC and other drugs. I didn't however. So the party goes on when his sister comes up to me and starts making out with me. Mind you, I have known this guy and his sister for around 4 years already, I met them when I was 12. I was shocked she was kissing me, but I had never made out with a girl before so I didn't stop. Then after around 2 minutes of making out she asked me if I wanted to go up to a dune together (you couldn't see us from there). Obviously I agreed and we left, when we got there she instantly took off her clothes and I started eating her out. It was at that point that I realized I didn't have a condom with me, I told her and she said I could get some from her  bag. So I walked back to the party and found her bag, however when I was walking back with the condoms we all heard a loud scream, I start running towards Amy and BAM, there's two guys trying to rape her (or at least touching her). So I run towards them screaming to go away and they do when they saw me, however Amy is in shock. I ask her \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" \"Yeah, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized Amy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

We ended up back at the penthouse apartment I shared with three friends, (gigantic fucking eight room apartment.) and I was reasonably happy that this was going somewhere.\n\nWe end up watching a film called 'Eighteen Years,' with two of my other housemates, and chatting through almost all of it. She clicked with me, she clicked with my friends, someone breaks out the wine. Half an hour later someone suggests we should make brownies.\n\nDate pulls out a bag of weed and suggests we spice the batch up.\n\nNow, some of you are thinking that's where I drew the line. Fuck no. That was the moment where I was sure she was girlfriend material. We cooked up those brownies, and started to work on a second batch.\n\nAnd then a third and fourth, by which point we were all stoned as fuck. One of my housemates, Gregory, throws a handful of brownie batch batter at my head, and hits me smack in the temple. That's where it kicked off, the first and only food fight of my life. Each of us grabbed a bowl of brownie mix, though two were almost empty so the fight was a bit unfair, and we had at it right there. So there's brownie batter from every brownie batch flying everywhere, we're all disgustingly covered, an absolute mess, when suddenly the doorbell rings. I answer it, covered head to toe in brownie batch batter man butter.\n\nMy fourth housemate is standing at the door, unable to use his key, because he's broken two fingers on each hand. Clever man.\n\nNow, I feel at this point it's important to note...my other two housemates, Gregory and Mark, and I are white. My fourth housemate, David, is black. You see right away where this story is headed. Tip: No one wanted tree fiddy.\n\nSo David comes in, Gregory prepares to throw another buttered brownie batch batter ball and suddenly Date throws her hands up.\n\n\"Hold on a minute. You live with a black guy?\"\n\n...we are all stunned here. \n\n\"What the hell is wrong with you?\" For a moment, just one moment, I'm praying she's about to make a joke, but she isn't.\n\n\"Doesn't matter that he has broken hands, does it. Not like he's gonna have a job.\"\n\nJaws are on the floor.\n\n\"I'm done. This was a fun night til now,\" she drops the brownie mix in her hand on the floor, wipes as much off herself as she can, and just walks out.\n\nMy housemates and I stare at each other, amazed, laughing about how she covered three of us in brownie mix, and giggling at Davids broken fingers.\n\nTL;DR - I ain't sayin she a gold digger, but she ain't messin with no broke n*gga", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422136705", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

If you look at the [original article](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/?single_page=true) that all these others use as a source, it doesn't say that. It talks about a pre-existing market for diamond engagement rings that is in decline:\n\n&gt;In their subsequent investigation of the American diamond market, the staff of N. W. Ayer found that since the end of World War I, in 1919, the total amount of diamonds sold in America, measured in carats, had declined by 50 percent; at the same time, the quality of the diamonds, measured in dollar value, had declined by nearly 100 percent. An Ayer memo concluded that the depressed state of the market for diamonds was \"the result of the economy, changes in social attitudes and the promotion of competitive luxuries.\"\n\n&gt; Although it could do little about the state of the economy, N. W. Ayer suggested that through a well-orchestrated advertising and public-relations campaign it could have a significant impact on the \"social attitudes of the public at large and thereby channel American spending toward larger and more expensive diamonds instead of \"competitive luxuries.\" Specifically, the Ayer study stressed the need to strengthen the association in the public's mind of diamonds with romance. Since \"young men buy over 90% of all engagement rings\" it would be crucial to inculcate in them the idea that diamonds were a gift of love: the larger and finer the diamond, the greater the expression of love. Similarly, young women had to be encouraged to view diamonds as an integral part of any romantic courtship.\n\nThe subsequent campaign increased diamond sales by 55%, but that means that 65% (100/155) of the market existed *before the campaign*.\n\nThere are *many* examples of diamond engagement rings in the literature of the 19th century. Here are a few examples: \n\n* 1830 [*The Armenians: A Tale of Constantinople*, Volume 1, by Charles MacFarlane](http://books.google.com/books?id=uH8lAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=%22It+is,+in+fact,+the+betrothal%22)\n\n&gt; It is, in fact, the betrothal, and on its reception the time of marriage is fixed for the affianced. The present to the bride was accompanied, d'obbligo by tokens of respect to some priest of the Armenian church, in the shape of mahmoodiers—or in common parlance, we might call them fees of office.\n\n&gt; On the afternoon of the same day, the bridegroom sent by the hands of his mother an additional donation of a cachemere shawl, a rich piece of stuff for a robe, and a diamond ring.\n\n* 1852 [*Chamber's pocket miscellany*, p.14](http://books.google.com/books?id=VjYCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22my+son%27s+betrothal%22+%22diamond+ring%22)\n\n&gt; And now this is the day of my son's betrothal,' added he, taking from a little box a splendid diamond ring, which he placed on the finger of Monime; 'and in a fortnight let us have the wedding.'\n\n* 1856 [\"The family on the Wing\", *The National Magazine*, p. 226](http://books.google.com/books?id=PCgAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22diamond+ring%22)\n\n&gt; \" ... That because he was the best laugher, the sweetest tenor singer, and had the handsomest moustache she knew, our lively Charlotte was quite contented to dance through life with Mr. Cuthbert, and decidedly proud of having his diamond ring on her third finger, and being considered \" engaged\"—as, indeed, they were likely to remain, if their minds changed not, for the next ten years.\n\n\n* 1858 [\"Prunes and Prisms\", *Harper's New Monthly Magazine*, Vol. XVI, No. 93, p. 372](http://books.google.com/books?id=YQ8wAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA372&amp;dq=%22diamond+ring%22)\n\n&gt; \"... If I were you — excuse me, my dear— I should remove that diamond ring from my finger, and—\"\n\n&gt; \"It was my engagement ring, and the first thing he ever gave me. It has been the greatest comfort—oh, you don't know—\"\n\n* 1859 [\"Such a mistake!\", *Harper's New Monthly Magazine*, Vol. XVIII, p. 807](http://books.google.com/books?id=thAwAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA807&amp;dq=%22engagement+ring+was+first+shown%22)\n\n&gt; There had been, it is true, a slight decadence of bliss when the engagement-ring was first shown her. She had imagined its splendors so radiantly beforehand that the pretty little *gage d'amour* which Rosalie one day exhibited seemed to her almost shabby. No diamond solitaire this, blazing like the Koh-i-noor cut down a trifle. It contained three stones: the central one of fair size; those on each side much smaller. \n\n* 1866 [*Sir Julian's wife*, by Emma Jane Worboise](http://books.google.com/books?id=AcwBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=%22diamond+ring%22+betrothal)\n\n&gt; Her last recollection of Mr. Jenkins was his standing in a very maudlin state in the middle of the dreary kitchen, preferring the modest request that she would give him as a keepsake the diamond ring he had seen glittering on her hand. He did not know it was her betrothal ring, but he did know that diamonds might be sold or pledged for money.\n\n* 1869 [*Roland Yorke*, by Mrs. Henry Wood, Vol III, p. 287](http://books.google.com/books?id=aeQBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=%22On+her+finger%22)\n\n&gt; On her finger flashes a valuable diamond ring, the pledge of their engagement.\n\n* 1870 [*Lady Wedderburn's Wish: A Tale of the Crimean War*, Volume 1, by James Grant](http://books.google.com/books?id=he4BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=%22diamond+ring%22+betrothal)\n\n&gt;He drew the glove from her left hand, and while placing the diamond ring upon her wedding finger—a slender little finger it was—he drew her still closer to his breast.\n\n&gt;\"Mary,\" he whispered, \"my darling Mary, you are the secret wife of my heart. Never let this betrothal ring—the ring that binds you to me—leave your finger until I replace it by one that shall be consecrated\" and he kissed her on the eyes, and then the hand that bore the symbol which was indicative of affection long before the days of Juvenal.\n\n\n* 1870 [*Nessie's Hero*, by Maggie Symington](http://books.google.com/books?id=AcQBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=%22diamond+ring%22+betrothal)\n\n&gt; A creeping chill pervaded Nessie from head to foot as she gazed. Moved by a sudden impulse she drew the golden head backwards to her knee; Reuben silently pressed his lips upon the little hand, one slender finger of which was encircled by his diamond ring of betrothal; he had only gained permission of his uncle to place it there, within the last few days, by his most earnest entreaties.\n\n\n* 1876 [*Daniel Deronda*, by George Eliot](http://books.google.com/books?id=WZEdAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=%22diamond+ring%22+betrothal)\n\n&gt; Gwendolen sat up in bed, and opened the packet. It was a delicate little enameled casket, and inside was a splendid diamond ring, with a letter which contained a folded bit of colored paper and these words:\n\n&gt;\"Pray wear this ring when I come at twelve, in sign of our betrothal.\"\n\n* 1885 [*The Squatter and the Don: A Novel Descriptive of Contemporary Occurrences in  California*, by C. Loyal](http://books.google.com/books?id=HwYmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=%22I+had+not+seen+this+diamond%22)\n\n&gt; \"I had not seen this diamond.

{"body": "It was a cool morning, the Scottish sun barely breaking the fog.  I sipped my tea, letting the rocking of the boat ease it past my lips.  The wool sweater lent to me by Seamus was the same brown as my drink.  It may have been white when we first got on the boat.\n\nThe loch, which I'm pretty sure isn't the correct spelling but rather the phonetic spelling of a Scotsman saying 'Lake', was majestically still.  It was Seamus shifting his hefty frame from bow to stern in search of haggis that led the boat to rock.\n\n\"Think we should maybe keep quiet for a bit?\" I said, smugly sipping my tea like I'd seen muppets like myself do before.  I thought back to my father taking me fishing when I was younger.\n\n\"Nonsense, boy!\" Seamus exclaimed.  \"Ole' Nessie loves this haggis sheep shite as much as you Yanks!  Don't matter how much noise you make.\"  He poured a splash of scotch into a greasy bag and chucked scoops of what looked like steaming chum overboard with one hand while drinking a few fingers of the bottle with the other.\n\nThis was it for me.  I had been ostracized from my cryptozoological community after faking 'squatch calls in the Wisconsin wilderness.  *It was an act of desperation after a career of failures,* I kept telling myself.  The chupacabras turned out to be coyotes.  The forest elves turned out to be LARPers.  I couldn't go back to being a surgeon.  \n\nThis time, I would come home with something real.  This time, I was taking Nessie with me.\n\nOr a picture, whichever ends up being easiest.\n\nI walked to the bow and looked out in front of me.  The water must have been four feet away, but a thick layer of fog, topped with a layer of smog covered everything a foot past our faces.\n\nI spent everything on this, I thought.  I fumbled through my pockets and pulled the last things I hadn't sold to get here.  A disposable camera, a Swiss army knife (for Nessie's head), and about two pounds thirty three pence.  Without Nessie, I will be nothing.\n\nThe boat shifted again, this time lifting the bow several feet.  I called back to Seamus, \"You mind coming up here, buddy?  I wouldn't mind seeing the loch at some point today.\"\n\n\"Even if you capsize the damn boat...\" I continued under my breath.\n\nNo witty retort.  No \"Yankee shite\" this, \"Yankee bollocks\" that.  Nothing.\n\n*Probably taking a piss off the back of the boat,* I thought.\n\n\"Is this another bottle of whiskey?\" I asked, looking blindly into a sheet of grey.\n\nStill no response.  This is when I got *really* worried.\n\nI began walking to the back of the boat, hands out to find the table, a rail, anything that could guide me to the main cabin.  The boat was small, but it was getting harder to see just a few feet ahead.  I made it to the cabin and heard a thumping coming from the back of the boat.  I moved closer and saw Seamus's leg from around the corner, slamming itself onto the ground.\n\nI quickly ran over, grabbing at his foot, locating the rest of his body through the fog.  I found his face with what looked like a giant seal flipper covering it.  Our arms grasped at it, trying desperately to pull him from underneath it's gargantuan strength.  The veins in his hand turned bluer and grew larger as he stopped moving.  I quickly dove through the cabin door, desperate to not see the rest of the creature.\n\nTo my dismay, his face materialized through the mist, moving directly at me through the door.  It was Nessie.\n\nHer teeth were large and in rows, mouth gaping wide like a shark ready for a snack.  My boots couldn't get traction; I slipped and began making my way backward until I was backed against the control panel.  Her neck was long, just like I'd imagined, steaming as it reached through the fog.  She stopped with her face inches from mine, slowly closing her mouth and moved her eyes forward.  I sat there, frozen, unable to breathe.\n\nHer head turned to its side revealing a series of embedded fishing hooks, spear scars, and bite marks.  *She's just hungry, looking for food,* I thought.  *Please don't let me be the food.*\n\nI began talking to Nessie like I would a dog, knowing the tone of my voice was all that was important, \"Let's go get you some food, huh?  You don't want to eat people, you just want some *good* food.  Come with me.\" I began to stand up slowly to make my way toward the steaming bag of haggis that lay at Seamus's feet.\n\n\"I don't want that shite.\" Nessie said.\n\nI froze again.\n\nNope.\n\nNope nope nope.\n\nI looked back at Nessie.  Just as I opened my mouth to try again, she spoke, \"Nope.  Nope nope nope.  Not eating any more bloody haggis.\"  This had to be a joke.\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nNessie quickly reared her head and maneuvered it around the cabin.  She began twisting her body while resting on the back.  The boat began to capsize, as I was thrown against a window.  Water began pouring into the cabin, rushing past my face.  This was the first time I got to see, or get a taste of, Loch Ness.  It tasted like sheep, whiskey, and salt.\n\n\"Okay! Okay!\" I shouted.  \"No haggis!\"\n\nThe boat levelled out, dropping me to the floor after just in time for the escaping water to pull me closer to Nessie.  I lay on my back and opened my eyes to see her face, inches from mine once again, staring down at me.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked.\n\nShe paused, slowly drawing a smile across her slimy smooth complexion.  She inched forward and began talking slowly.  \"I've tried your fish filets.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I asked again.\n\n\"Your fish filets, from a man named McDonald.  Tourists leave them half eaten by the parking lot trash cans.  I bet they're way better fresh.  Breaded and battered, unlike the fish in this damned loch.  I want one.\"\n\nThis was past the point of belief.  Now I was discussing fast food with a myth.\n\n\"You want me to get you a McDonald's Fish Filet?\" I asked.\n\nNessie laughed and reared her head.  Clearly, I had said something out of place.\n\n\"You fool!  Do you really think I'd trust you to come back with my sandwich?  You obviously don't know much about how the real world works, huh?\"\n\n\"Clearly not,\" I said as I wiped the Loch Ness Monster's saliva from my face.\n\n\"I want all the money you've got,\" Nessie retorted with a changed tone.  I looked up to see my swiss army knife in her mouth.  It must have slipped out of my pocket when she nearly capsized the boat.\n\nI reached in my pockets for the last of my money, the last £2.33 to my name.  I opened my palm and she quickly placed the money in her mouth, graciously dropping my knife back when she did.  She pulled her head back into the fog.\n\nAfter a second, her head darted back.  \"Two pound thirty three?!\" She shouted, nearly spitting out a coin.  \"Is that all you have?\"\n\nI nodded, \"Is that enough for a meal?\" I asked.\n\n\"Americans,\" she shook her head.  \"Yeah, it's enough for *most* of the meal.  In US dollars, I think it's about... maybe tree fiddy.\"  She pulled back into the fog.  With that, the back of the boat popped back up, leveling out.\n\nI walked out to the deck and stood in the fog a moment.  To my right, I saw Seamus's dead body, grey as the fog and bag of haggis surrounding his body.\n\nMaybe I should go back to being a surgeon.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422164062", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Blood dripped down like tears around my broken headlight. I had hit something while I was fiddling with the radio on my way back from the bar. Now I stood on the side of the road, surveying the damage to my fender and looking for a sign of whatever I hit. \n\nThere are deer in this area. They come in from the deep forest to pillage people’s gardens. I had probably clipped one while it tried to cross the road. Damn, I still have payments to make on the car and now I’ll have to foot a repair bill to boot. I can’t call AAA until I sober up a bit.\n\nI walk around to the back of the car and open up the flashlight app on my phone. The light dances across the pavement and settles on a shiny, dark streak. The trail of blood leads from the road into the woods. Christ, whatever I hit must be in pretty bad shape.\n\nI step off the road and follow the trail of trampled plants. The bloods stands out starkly against the matted down blades of dying grass. The light from my phone darts ahead of me and searches for signs of life. The beam catches on a little girl’s shoe and I nearly vomit. The shoe is sticky with semi-dried blood as I pick it up. It shines like a ruby in the light.\n\nI break into a trot looking for the girl. God, she has to be okay. \n\nI see her as soon as I step into the clearing. Her blonde pigtails have somehow managed to stay pristine through it all, but her leg is bent at an impossible angle and the protruding bone glints in the light. One side of her ribcage has collapsed under her sash of merit badges. She clutches her bag of cookie boxes as I approach.\n\nIt’s clear that she’s not going to make it. I’m surprised she was able to drag herself this far through the undergrowth. I kneel down next to her surprisingly large frame. Her breath rattles and sputters as her eyes open and turn to my face.\n\n“Oh god, I’m so sorry.” I stammer.\n\n“It’s… alright.” she manages. A cough brings up more blood from her ruined lungs. She winces in agony.\n\n“I’ll go get help.” I say and turn to head back to the road. She reaches out and holds onto my pant leg.\n\n“Don’t go. Stay here with me. I don’t want to be alone.” she cries.\n\n“What can I do to help?” I ask.\n\nShe somehow smiles through the pain and whispers, “I need... I need about tree fiddy”\n\nThat’s when I noticed that the girl scout I had hit was a crustacean from the paleolithic era. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a few bills and some change. The loch ness monster’s fingers closed around the money while her other hand held mine. I stayed with her as her breathing slowed and then finally stopped.\n\n“God dammit loch ness monster” I cried. “God damn”\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422167071", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I haven't. But I\"ve watched someone die of dehydration. I almost did as well. It happens faster than you think. You've probably went your whole life without missing a day with water or liquid in your food. But when that's gone, after about 27 hours the first serious symptoms start to become noticeable. The first thing that happens if you are overcome with a serious sense of dread. It is a complete mood overhaul and all you can feel is anxiety and near panic. You know at this point it is serious and you need water. The next thing that happens is your muscles and joints begin to ache considerably. It's a shooting and piercing pain that travels up one arm and down the other. Your shins will feel like they are detaching. After 2 or 3 hours of increasingly worse physical and mental symptoms, your mouth completely dries out and your lips start to slowly crack. So does your tongue and the insides of your cheeks. It gets so bad that you start biting your tongue every time you attempt to speak. But you can't really say much at this point because your tongue is like a dry sponge that words get stuck on. Into hour 30 and beyond, you start to consider the absurdity of the whole situation. At this point you would drink motor oil if you had it just to feel anything but the dry sting of dehydration. They have plots in movies where the guy drops someone in the desert and gives them a bottle of motor oil or a gallon of gasoline. If anyone ever does that to you, throw it immediately and start walking away from it because when you're already dying of dehydration, you don't want to finish dying from something internal like that. Anyway, you know you're going to die unless some miracle happens, and you know by now it's going to be painful and scary. But what really gets you is knowing that it could all go away if you just could afford a bottle of water, which at the vending machine is tree fiddy.

{"body": "So on reddit, I have an incredibly disturbing story to tell about a girl who posted to/r/gonewild that I recognized. I have been thinking hard lately about whether or not I ever want to share this story with reddit and this seems like a pretty good idea to share it after. So, around some time last week there was a thread somewhere in /r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do. Almost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in/r/gonewild . Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild . How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to /r/gonewild ? I'll tell you how... Any man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her /r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was. It turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild . I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild[13] and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted/r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her /r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to/r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more. Now, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her /r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was insanely open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about. I managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her/r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" Well, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\" Not only did I walk away without any extortion money, I didn't get any new nudes from her which is what I was holding out for more than anything else. The only good thing about the failed sextortion deal is that she never contacted the FBI which works out perfectly for me because if she did, I wouldn't have been able to share this cautionary tale with you", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422199803", "subreddit": "FIFA", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Wrong. If you're not immune, you're not immune. There is no such thing as \"herd immunity\" as in if you are around people who are all immune you will not catch it.\n\nThat is clearly untrue, as if you're not immune and you come into contact with it, you very well may catch it.\n\n[Read this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Eradication), I'll quote specifically the information I want to emphasize.\n\n&gt;Concern has been expressed by some that artificial gene synthesis could be used to recreate the virus from existing digital genomes, for use in biological warfare. Insertion of the synthesized smallpox DNA into existing related pox viruses could theoretically be used to recreate the virus. The first step to mitigating this risk, it has been suggested, should be to destroy the remaining virus stocks so as to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of the virus.\n\nThat is about Smallpox, which they didn't \"eradicate\" until 1980 officially, although technically they have never \"eradicated\" it as there are still samples of it out there that could be used to create mutated forms of it.\n\nThat is the thing about viruses, they change and can be changed. They can also be weaponized.\n\nThere's this thing about Wikipedia. There's a lot of information on Wikipedia, that is clearly bullshit. I could link a lot of it, but that would take up a lot of space and time, but I will say that it does cover werewolves, the loch Ness monster, ghosts, greek mythology, and other \"information\", you can't automatically take every statement on it at face value and must read into everything and check the sources used.\n\nNote how many articles have the tag \"Claim has yet to be verified\". If the claim has yet to be verified, why is it on the page? Wikipedia pages have unfounded claims that have yet to be proven.....\n\nNow I'm not saying there isn't factual information on Wikipedia, that's why I used it myself, but note how I still pointed out how what I quoted is wrong its claim of having \"eradicated\" Smallpox.\n\nSo, to sum up, Herd Immunity only means that more people immunized lessens the chance of spreading, although immunization doesn't always work.\n\nAlso, you have to be careful with Wikipedia articles.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422227650", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, I was six years old and I had my first dog, Sadie. A beautiful chocolate lab, I felt so excited to be given an opportunity to show my parents how responsible I could be (I know, kinda weird for a 6 year old but whatever). Anyways I took this dog on magical dog adventures in the woods, fighting dragons and raccoons, normal kid stuff. Couldn't have been happier. One day, I get home from school, my parents were still at work, and Sadie is no where to be found. Stick with me here. I call my mom, completely hysterical and she says it's fine, Sadie just needed to get some shots at the vet. \"Okay, okay\"... I collected myself, made some wafflezs, as I'm prone to do, and watched some biker mice from mars. Best. Show. Ever. Anyways, mom gets home and says she's gonna go pick up Sadie, I ask if I can go with her and she says \"Sure\". Well we get to the vet and he tells my mom they needed to talk in the back. I'm just sitting in the waiting room tryin to catch em all. About fifteen minutes pass and my mom comes out and says she needs to tell me something. I'm like okay... She tells me that \"Sadie and a few other dogs were kidnapped\". Okay, wtf, they aren't even kids. We go home, I'm totally fucking hysterical.  A few weeks go by, and we get a call from the police saying they think they've found out what happened. They had received an anonymous tip that this. Fucking. Vet. Was stealing dogs and taking them to his home for god knows what. My mom immediately goes to the vet, and low and behold he admits to it. I wasn't there but I later found out she literally begged him for the dog back, offering him whatever he wants. He tells her he's gonna need about tree fiddy. Later in life, I stopped by his office and noticed he was actually an eight story crustacean from the protozoic era, but that's moot. Being almost broke she obviously can't afford this kind of dough. So she went to the shelter and got another dog that looked just like Sadie. She Brought it home and I never knew the better until I was about 20 and she admitted to it.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422300392", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Send help if I don't edit again in 30 minutes. \n\nEdit:  The sun slowly went down, me overlooking the Emerald Coast in a deep embrace with a dream. A dream that my delusion's were a reality. Lost in a state of love. Love for what I walk past every day, for most people walk under and take for granted. Light shines for them as they walk the dreary streets of life; how many take the time to look up and thank that which shows us the way. \n           \n               I take that time. I normally give it a light slap on it's circuit box, and then caress the grooves on that masculine body. Some times I like to get up on the cord and rub it deep in my ass crack. And that's not strange at all, do you know why? Because in the end, our bodies are no different than a tree without the mind. Just a dead-less Heep of matter. Of mass. Never being fully destroyed. Becoming food for all of the life just blooming and becoming apart of that.

You become the memory of a murderer. You become a word in a boo- word on the internet. A video. You become truly immortalized within the internet. You are in a massive database.

Challenge each other to discussion but do not blow each other the fuck up. For fucks sake. What's the point? Don't do damage to each other's physical livelihoods. Do damage to their ego. Do damage to each other's points of view, and in the end...we will have evolved to a people who have come to a conclusion. A massive power of collective minds, when we all can't help but come to the same conclusion. This is how we evolve as a species. And truly work together for a common goal. When we all discuss the shit out of fucking everything. Just be open minded and take it all in and process it with no bias. And when we get to the point of a common mind we will all look up at the bright light on a dark point in life. On humanities life. Every point in life when we kill each other is a dark point. Please. Stop. When we do, God's face will shine through that light and speak to you. And do you know what he will say? -I'm going to need about $3.50- And you wont believe it!

Being the little brats that we were, we decided to pull a prank on her.\n\nWe sneaked into the school about one and a half hours before classes started. I was in middle school, and the doors opened two hours before classes started. Of the many doors of the school, the front door and one of the side doors were the only open. The front door was surrounded by the janitors who opened it, so we found a good time to go through the side door and got to Mrs. Martz's classroom, room 150. \n\nI have to admit, I didn't really know the plan at this point. One of the two friends there with me, the one who generally administered this whole plan, pulls a baggie out of his coat pocket. I kid you not, this was *straight fucking cocaine.* I thought it was flour, and I asked why he had that. He explained that it was cocaine and that we were going to put it in Mrs. M's desk and tell the principal. He said his (much) older brother did it in junior year of high school.\n\nI FREAKED out. My friend calmed me down. I told him there was no way we could do this, and he yelled at me.

If he thinks it's feasible I may just order a couple of jinhaos and he and I can try it. If it works out well, I could get him a dozen or so pens and he could work them over and put them on etsy.\n\nIncidentally, the kaweco pen in any other color is about a $50 pen, if you hadn't noticed; apparently it's the hand labor that goes into the fire tempering process that makes that one so expensive.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422342174", "subreddit": "fountainpens", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*puts on safety goggles*\n\nPreface: While this comes off as overly negative (sorry, I've tried to re-write it twice), my point is to bring up some things you might not have realized that are implicit in your offering. Also, apologies for not citing more stuff, it's late and I've got work in a few hours.\n\nYou're effectively selling \"marketing as a service\" or an on-demand sales team. This isn't a new idea, but there's many reasons why you don't see it applied to Kickstarter. Here's a few guesses:\n\n1. Back of the envelope: Kickstarter rewards typically start at a fairly low level. If you're paying someone to chase down a $35 sale, and they get even 10% of that (about a tree fiddy), and they want to earn a living wage, they have to average 5 sales per hour. A good sales person has a maybe 30% hit rate. That means they're spending at most 4 minutes per lead convincing them to back your project. Not a lot of time, right? And that's assuming you can supply them with enough leads.\n  - What about people who can set up referral programs, devote whole sites / tools, run ad campaigns, get news coverage or in some other way get lots of people to notice? Congratulations, you've invented Marketing! People who do this well are at a higher skillset, and more money is expected (often up front). People who have the skill, experience, and access to an audience to introduce a new concept to the right market should be well into the six-figure salary, and often have their pick of good jobs. Someone who works on spec in this field is probably not as good as they claim.\n1. The Kickstarter community, on the whole, is pretty wary of people abusing the platform. If you've got a sales/marketing team, why use Kickstarter? Why not just fund directly?\n1. The cost of paying your sales team comes out of the money you should be spending on developing the 'thing' you're Kickstarting. While you might argue that more spending on sales means more money brought in, most funders won't see it that way, and it will harm how much they're willing to give you and how invested they are in your success. I can't find the articles at the moment, but foggy memory (damnit, age) recalls a band who Kickstarted a tour and whose fans were upset at the quality of hotels they stayed at. Kickstarter fans are fickle, and many will turn when it seems you're not doing it 100% for the love of the project and just barely covering costs (if that).\n1. Appearing \"too business-y\" is a death sentence for Kickstarter projects. People want to feel like you're being scrappy and hip and independent. Finding out you've got a sales team makes you seem like a crusty old business just looking to hijack something young and cool.\n\nThat being said, there are many consulting firms or even full-blown platforms that offer these kinds of services for companies who don't want to expose themselves to the risk of hiring up an entire sales and marketing organization on an unproven idea. Looking for \"on demand sales team\" yields a few, including [Salesify](http://www.salesify.com/) or [SalesStaff](http://salesstaff.com/demand-generation-marketing.html) (just a quick search, not endorsing / recommending them). These are your competitors, learn how they work and what they cost, and then explain why you can be different. \n\nIf you have some novel or unique model for quickly getting relatively un-trained people into a customer-facing, sales-ready position, awesome! That's a super cool business. Building a services company around \"we can be the marketing department you can't afford and the sales team your competitors fear\" is a powerful message. If you have an army of folks with hustle, good connections and a willingness to work cheap, you've found a highly unique resource - the world is your oyster.\n\nIf you have though, reconsider if \"I'll increase awareness of your Kickstarter project\" is the best use of those resources.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422347283", "subreddit": "startups", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Right, bad design really is a great way to demonstrate evolution and debunk ID to laypeople.\n\nThe bowels of humans sometimes get tangled up and tie themselves in knots. We often get trouble with our knees if we live past 40, and many of us suffer from back pain. Apes and other mammals don't have those problems. The reason for this is that most parts of the human body didn't evolve for walking upright, but for walking on four legs. Our intestines, like those of our mammalian cousins, evolved to hang nicely from the backbone. Our knees haven't evolved to support our full weight all the time. The backbone of an ape or of other mammals is shaped to be a nice bridge, but the human backbone is bent. This is bad and vulnerable design that causes terrible problems for many people, but it has been a necessary evolutionary step to make upright walk easier. \n\nHumans evolved in the Paleolithic Era in Africa to love fatty and sweet food because that would increase our fitness in that environment. Nowadays, those desires are killing us.\n\nWhen our skin is injured, it heals. We can lose a part of our liver, and it regrows. But we can't regrow a limb. When our heart is injured, it doesn't heal. Neither does our brain. Newts on the other hand can regrow limbs, or fish can regrow parts of their hearts. Why is that? Because for the most part of our evolutionary history, those abilities wouldn't have provided any advantage to humans. If you lost a limb or had your heart injured, you'd died anyway. \n\nThe human eye is also badly flawed, with a blind spot, terribly placed blood vessels and tons of ways to become ill. The eye of the octopus is superior to ours is just about every way. The reason for this? Bad luck. If built from scratch, it's easy to engineer a much better eye than the human.

{"body": "The theory about that is, it cuts out motivation.  A naive view of that perspective says that nobody will bother inventing the Post-It Note if there's a cap on what they make.

There are many rules governing the way that businesses run, and the requirements of those rules have to be met whatever it takes.  Fiduciary duty is one of them.  Suppose that we cap pay.

My wife and kids are at home, and I don't get much time with them.  I'll die one day too, so when do I get to enjoy my life?  Plus, I have to be a total asshole sometimes in order to obey these regulations.  What do I get out of sacrificing all my time, a significant portion of my life, and even my character and values?\"  \n\nThere are other ideas about taxation that have the same spirit as your suggestion, but approach it from a different angle.  But similarly, they all have consequences.  Capital gains taxes make it harder for money to make money, and that hurts savings and investment accounts of all kinds, to include accounts held by ordinary working folk just trying to make sure they don't die in an alley box in their old age or trying to put their kids through college.  \n\nIn principle I agree with you.  In sentiment I agree with you.  But the real business world is sophisticated enough that approaching it that way is like trying to fix a video game bug by changing only the code about what you want to fix.  It's going to have side effects, and it's going to be more tricky than you think.  Sometimes, those side effects won't match with your principles and sentiments.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422377215", "subreddit": "technology", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The reason that kept playing chivalry was that I kept getting rewarded. Maybe things just lined up perfectly but when I was rank 10, I saw my first high level spamming laugh and raping everybody. I wanted his power. After 50 hours of playing, I was good. I could wipe the floor with most people, people my rank and much higher. That was when I discovered the interitus FFA duels server.\n\nThe people that hung out there were insanely good and I couldn't touch them, but that didn't deter me, it encouraged me. I showed up every day for hours dueling them just so I could unravel their secrets. I knew they didn't have any more tools than me - access to any perks or upgrades, because this game doesn't have such things. They were demolishing me through skill difference alone. And what a skill difference it was. It was all the more frustrating because you have to get near them for them to kill you. In counterstrike if you encounter someone with 2000 hours  you're dead before you can think about it. In chivalry you get to watch them do their beautiful and deadly dance and you *choose* to walk up to them and die.\n\n[Here's](http://cloud-2.steamusercontent.com/ugc/920127547776567685/D90CBF675B7AE652C081DBCE2B6D01B7FE439098/) a link to one of the first screenshots I ever took, at one of the first times people tried to kick me for \"hacking.\" That was around 100 hours in. I had already been honing my skills on the Interitus duels server, which made me like a god compared to my \"peers\" of similar playtime and rank. Instead of playing for fun, I spent my time practicing. But I still couldn't beat the originals.\n\nIt took me 500 grueling hours of dueling the *same people* over and over before I started to be able to understand their strategies and adapt them into my own fighting style efficiently. It was like a second life to me, and in the early days of the summer of 2013, I was playing upwards of 8 hours a day. The sense of progression that I got when I learned new ways to kill multiple people, or I killed someone who I had never been able to kill before - and I *understood why I could do it* - was like nothing else I've ever had. You can hone real life skills and get the same satisfaction but more often than not you're hindered by unrelated things. Money. Injuries. Weather. Having to travel for 30 minutes to practice. Chivalry had, from what I could see, a nearly unreachable skill ceiling, just like any real life sport or activity, and it was easy - just start up a program and then start killing people.\n\nAfter 500 hours, I was beginning to consider myself on par with those \"originals\" who I had grown up beside, so to speak. That was when I applied to join Interitus, the clan of elites who I had watched cut off heads with fawning eyes since hour 50. They knew me by name and they had been watching me. After the tryouts were over, their leader, Bada, moved me into a private channel in their ventrilo server. \"Alice,\" he said. \"You did really well during the tryouts. I think you might fit well with our clan. There's just one thing I that I need from you.\" I had no idea what he might ask. Was he going to ask for nudes? Did he want me to perform some horrid blood ritual to seal my initiation? Or worst of all, was he going to make me switch to Dane axe? \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy,\" he said. Well, it was about that time I realized that Interitus was filled with 8 story tall crustaceans from the paleolithic era. \"I ain't givin you no tree fiddy Bada\" I said and I didn't join Interitus until way later, but that's a story for another day.\n\nAnyway my point is that the game has enough motivation for the right kind of player. I do believe that it could be better, but I don't think that traditional matchmaking is the way to go. With that type of system, since you're always facing players of the same skill level, you never get that sense of improvement that you do when you lop off 3 less skilled players' heads with one swing, knowing that you were one of them yourself not too long ago. I can only hope that chivalry 2 will have something good for us. A better tutorial would probably be a good start.\n\nHere's hoping.\n\n**tl;dr we don't need no matchmaking, but we do need a tutorial**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422417123", "subreddit": "ChivalryGame", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I peeked out my window trying to make out the shape obscured by the blinding light coming from my yard. I live in the middle of nowhere you see, at least 30 minutes from the nearest shop and my neighbours live 2 kilometres down the road in the countryside. The thing on my wrist was nothing i had ever seen before, it looked almost alien but i had no idea how it had gotten here. It almost looked like a watch with a green quadrilateral shape instead of the time on the face. I jiggled around with it a bit, twisting and poking it but it was stuck firmly on my wrist. Suddenly the light coming from my yard began to intensify and a large, terrifying figure began to emerge. It reminded me of Cthulu with its tentacle face but it had a muscular body with two freakishly muscular arms with claws. Whatever it was it wasn't happy and i was coming towards my house.  I began to put two and two together and figured that this alien must be after this \"thing\" on my wrist, i started fiddling with it again whilst keeping an eye on Cthulu at the same time. In my haste i twisted the face of the watch which caused it to protrude out, this made the green quadrilateral on the watch turn into a diamond shape with a sillouette in the middle. Confident i could get it off soon i took another look out the window and realised Cthulu was pointing some sort of alien blaster at my house, i started to panick. I tried to jump out of the tub but slipped and whacked my wrist against the tap, pushing the watch face back down. Then i felt my body change, a green light filled my entire house as my arm started to burn, then my face then my whole body. Suddenly the sensation stopped and i opened my eyes to look at my hands. They were on fire, my skin looked like molten rock and i realised i was no longer me, i was something else. Then i heard a voice from the yard. \"GIVE UP THE WATCH OR FACE DESTRUCTION HUMAN!!!\". I had no idea what was going on but i was curious to see what this new body could do. \"GIVE ME WHAT I WANT AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOUR PLANET.... FOR NOW\" the voice yelled. \"What do you want?\" i replied as i peeked out the window again. Then i saw Cthulu talk \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time i realised Cthulu was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Dammit loch ness monster, i ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" i yelled at him as he swan away into the distance.

{"body": "No offence, but this sounds like [Stephenie Meyer biology](http://applesparkles.wikia.com/wiki/Scientific_Inaccuracies)...\n\n&gt; \"The shape-shifters, formerly known as werewolves, are said to have 24 chromosome pairs. In the real world, such edits generally cause problems for the organism rather than benefits. For example, an extra chromosome 21 causes Down Syndrome, and other extras will cause other health problems. However, in Stephenie Meyer's books, it gives you the ability to morph into a giant wolf when angry. Where this extra chromosome came from is not explained, leading many to wish that Meyer had stuck with a mystical explanation....Since apparently Meyerpire venom carries DNA, instead of logical things like enzymes, it is possible to argue that the magical Meyerpire venom could impregnate someone. However there are other problems with Nessie's conception. Bella has 46 chromosomes, so her egg has 23. Edward apparently has 50, so his . . . uh . . . venom - has 25. According to Meyer, via Carlisle, this means that Renesmee has 24 chromosome pairs, which explains her bizarre growth acceleration and why Jacob imprints on her. This is apparently because Meyer believes that when you have too many chromosomes on one side they just fold down and make another pair. In real life, chromosomes do not work that way: Renesmee would have 23 chromosome pairs and 2 extra chromosomes hanging off on their own. While it is remotely possible that she would survive and be reasonably normal, the odd chromosome structure would prevent the DNA from pairing up properly in most fetuses, and she would be mostly, if not completely infertile.\"\n\nThat being said, I wanted to provide one of [the more scientifically accurate answers:](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080419161216AA0fv2s)\n\nNormally, a baby inherits 23 chromosomes from each parent, for a total of 46. Each chromosome matches the corresponding chromosome from the other parent, forming 23 numbered pairs. \n\nBiological errors can happen during the early stages of cell division, causing some fetuses to develop with 47 chromosomes: Instead of 23 matched pairs, they have 22 pairs plus one set of three, a chromosomal abnormality called trisomy. \n\nMost fetuses with trisomy are miscarried during the first trimester. Most of those who survive have Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21 because it's caused by an extra chromosome 21. \n\nWhile all babies with Down syndrome have some degree of mental retardation, it's severe in only about 10 percent. Many people with Down syndrome have rich and fulfilling lives into adulthood. \n\nOther babies with chromosomal abnormalities have trisomy 13 or 18, which are almost always associated with profound mental retardation and other congenital malformations. These babies rarely live more than a few days or months. \n\nThe risk of having a baby with trisomy increases with the mother's age, which is why healthcare providers suggest genetic testing for women who will be 35 or older on their due date.\n\nSo therefore, it is very unlikely that the \"magic gene\" is an extra human chromosome.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422488140", "subreddit": "harrypotter", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

This goddamn gorilla is persistent! \n\nYou run up your treehouse and hide in there, leaving a fire going. You can hear the creature stomping below you, sniffing the air, hungrily licking it's lips. You're deathly afraid, but exhaustion wins out and you fall asleep. And as you awaken from your slumber, you see a hulking figure standing above you. The gorilla huffs a breath of hot air and spittle into your face and gets closer. Then, when mere centimeters from those tusk-like teeth, that gaping gullet, it whispers into your ear.\n\n\"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422557218", "subreddit": "TheForest", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, so, I always thought i was a wizard. When i was a little boy, (like ages 5-10) I was never interested in the things that my peers were. I was a lonely child who didnt have any friends. I wasn't like my brothers, and they always seemed to be bothered by me. They weren't angry or at me or afraid of me, they just always seemed uneasy around me. Like they thought i was weird. Also, I have memories of me being very young, like age 1-3, Most people i talk to don't claim to have memories that early, but i have brought things up to my parents that they were astounded to learn that i remembered because I was so young. When I turned 13, that's when i began to suspect that I was a powerful wizard. I started having urges. Urges that i can't really explain to mortals, but I suspect other wizards/ witches know the feeling. \n\n   If you didn't know, each wizard has there own special field of skill. Whether it be talking to animals, reading minds, manipulating physical objects, etc etc. My special field of skills was the arcane arts. I found myself able to not start, but manipulate fires. Many people didn't believe me when i tried to tell them, so I tried to keep it to myself as mush as possible. \n\n\n   Because I didn't fit in well with the other kids, I never really socialized. I always ran around my neighborhood, prating my abilities and teaching myself how to better channel my energy. One day, in one of my magic channeling hideouts, I met *her*. she was just there. nobody had ever been there before, it was my place. I asked her how she found this place, and she  told me she knew what I was and that the aura from my skills had attracted her there. We talked some, and I found out that she was a witch. her special area of focus was talking to animals, specifically white tailed deer. She was amazing. She was the first person that I ever really connected with. At this point in my life, I was still skeptical to accept the fact that i was a wizard, and that every thing every body has ever told me was wrong. She told me that she knew i had suspicions as to what i was and reassured me that I was correct. It took a lot of convincing, but i finally believed her and accepted the fact that I was a very powerful arcane wizard. I had to be careful with my abilities because she told me that i was very dangerous, and that if i wasn't careful i'd lose my control and could hurt somebody.\n\n   My friend and I were growing very close. One day, we decided to run away together and try to find more people like us. It was great, she asked deer everywhere we went for directions, and where to find food and water. The deer were always very helpful, and i found most deer to be more intelligent, kind, and helpful than any person i have ever met. She befriended some deer, and they followed us all around the country. We were gatherers, living off of what nature gave us. She said that eating food directly from nature was good for our skills, and that eating anything processed or made for normal people would be bad for our skills and could poison us. And she was right. Once we staring eating Nature's food, i could feel myself gaining control over my abilities.  I was able to concentrate more, and found myself able to do things much faster.\n\n   One day, i asked her how she knew all of this. She said that she met a great wizard who had taught her much about the magic powers that some people have. She talked about how some people may live their whole lives, never even knowing that they were special, others know, but don't know that there are others like them.\n\n   That was when we decided we were ready to find and help others. We went out, finding other witches' and wizards' aura trails and helped them, educated them about what they were. Some were grateful, and came with us. Others, hated us and wished to be left alone, and a few wouldn't even believe us. Those ones hurt the most. We put everything on the line for them and this is what they gave us in return? it just felt really ungrateful.\n \n\n   After our coven was about 150 strong, we decided we were ready to start training them to live off of nature on their own, so that we could split up and have multiple groups of wizards and witches each staring their own small covens to recruit more gifted people more quickly. Once they had found enough people, they would bring them back to the coven headquarters. \n\n   Eventually, my partner and I found ourselves leading a coven about 3,500 wizards/witches strong. That's when she started to act odd.\n\n   She stopped eating a lot. She used to eat every meal with me, but she started only eating once a day. She stopped talking to her deer friend as much as she used to, and even seemed reluctant to talk to me. We did everything together before, and she could tell me anything. She knew that, it didn't make sense for her to be acting this way. I asked her if she was okay, to witch she replied that even though she had never been happier, a part of her felt empty, like she needed something more. Thats when she kissed me, and she told me she loved me. I didn't even know which if the hundreds of emotions that I was feeling at the moment act upon, but i just smiled, said \"I love you too,\" and kissed her again. And I meant it. I loved her more than anything else in the world. \n\n   We spent the rest of that night talking. Talking about each other, about our coven, about what we were going to about anything. We talked all night, and she seemed happier. I know I was happier. I was always happier when i was with her. \n\n   Fast forward 3 months, we are deeply in love and are spiritually connected. I'm starting to develop some of her powers, and she is developing some of mine. This is not uncommon among witches or wizards who are very deep in love. Up until now, she hasn't seemed off since that night. But slowly, she seems to be getting less and less social. She starts eating less. Not less often, but less amounts of food. I talk to the deer, and they are noticing it too. As her spirit bond, its having a noticeable affect one me as well. Im starting to feel odd at this point. So I confront her, and I regard that decision as the worst mistake of my entire life. I ask her if everything is okay, and she is feeling alright. Again, she tells me like she needs something more. I ask her what she needs, and she tells me it would hurt me too much if she told me. I insist that she tells me, to which she replies \"I need bout tree fiddy.\" its at this heart breaking moment that I realize the woman that I am in love with, the only person who has ever really mattered to me at all as a person, is a  hundred-fifty foot sea monster from the Paleozoic era. \"Get the hell outa here you god damn lock ness monster, you!\" i screamed at her, heartbroken. She waddled away, and I never saw her again. She really did break my heart, but she was truly a monster and I couldn't even bare to look at her anymore. She drove me insane. I loved with everything that I was, and she betrayed me. Our entire love had been a lie from Day One.\n\n   After that, i found myself stuck with a huge coven to take care of all by myself. It was hard and tedious,but i managed. I have never felt attracted to any other girl after her, and never even thought about loving any one ever again. She was my sun and my stars, but i meant nothing to her. She truly broke my heart, and not even the most skilled wizard can fix that.\n\n**TL;DR:** Realized I was a wizard at a very young age and met another witch who i fell in love with and started a coven with. She ended up betraying me and breaking me heart over something that was incredibly stupid.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422586578", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was pretty interesting, It was late July back in 1991. I was with three of my buds when this guy came up and offered us 100 bucks to go back to his apartment and chill with him and drink some beers. My buddies didn't want to go but I felt bad and agreed. 100 bucks to drink beer and chill a bit didn't sound bad at all. When we got to his place I noticed a weird and powerful smell which he said was just supplies to clean bricks. I guess he worked in that profession at the time. We started talking and drinking some beers, he was pretty cool and nothing really out of the ordinary. He asked if I wanted to look at his fish tank and right when I looked over I felt something metal clasp around my wrist. I turned around to notice this guy trying to handcuff me to his wrist, the dude took me into his room and told me that I was going to strip naked and pose for him, I was drunk and wasn't thinking much so I just walked in there without much of a fight. When we entered his room, I noticed a bunch of naked dudes plastered up on the walls, he also had that movie the Exorcist 3 playing. In the corner he had this huge blue drum like the one that Walter White and Jessie Pinkman would use to dissolve bodies in. The dude then pulled out a knife and told me that he was going to take pictures of me, I was freaking out at this point so I tried to make him happy and save myself, I started to take off my shirt and I told him he could take pictures if he put the knife away and took off the handcuffs. Instead he looks at the tv and begins chanting and rocking back and forth. My heart was racing so hard, I knew I wasn't going to be free after this. Then he does the weirdest thing, he puts his ear to my chest with the knife pressed into me and tells me that he's going to eat my heart like bruschetta. Now I knew I had to get the fuck out asap. I looked at the window wondering how high up it was and then looked at the door hoping I'd be able to just rush out. I told this guy that I was his friend and that I wasn't going to run away hoping that he would calm down a bit and lower his guard. I guess it worked cuz I asked if I could use the bathroom then if we could go out to the living room where there was AC and drink some beer on the couch. On the couch we drank some more beer and I watched him carefully, I noticed he had a small break in concentrating on me so I asked to use the bathroom again, as soon as I got up I saw that he didn't have the handcuff on his wrist and I popped him right in the face and ran out the front door. I finally was able to get some cops to pull over and they couldn't get the handcuff off my hand so we went back to this crazy dudes apartment to get the key and he was all calm and shit. He told the cops that the key was in his room so one went inside to get it and after I told him about the knife and stuff he took a quick look and found all these pictures of victims before. They got in a fight and finally handcuffed the dude. When they opened the fridge they found a black dudes head and I just noped the fucked out. So I guess I was a victim of attempted murder, I don't know what the murder is like, but I know what the attempt is like. It's like tree fiddy.\n\nEdit: you should already know what I edited.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422723695", "subreddit": "shittyaskreddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Thousands must have perished, but, eventually, so many bodies filled our pits that their brethren were able to climb atop their corpses and over the wall.\n\nAnything they touch immediately shriveled away, fading into depreciation. The Johnson family had lost their home last week in one of the earlier waves. Tom, the patriarch of the family, had fought valiantly. He'd stood on his lawn heroically, shotgun in hand, threatening to call the authorities. \n\nBut the time for such threats was long past.\n\nThey had barely survived, thank God they had remembered to charge their Tesla the night before. When they made it to our outpost they were shaken, but they seemed to slowly return to normal. We gave them outfits and stock options, just the necessities. Little Jenny Johnson got her iPhone back and the poor girl broke into tears, distraught to have missed so many snapchats. All seemed well.\n\nThat peace, however, was short lived.\n\n\"Hey James,\" Tom had asked his friend a few days after the rescue, nervously scratching behind his neck.\n\n\"Think you might be able to spare me a couple bucks? I'm running a little low this week.\"\n\nWe didn't even have time to reach them before Tom turned, ripping James's brand new Armani suit to shreds, devouring his Rolex whole.\n\nAfter that, we had a new rule. No survivors. We were all that was left. Anyone, friends, family, it didn't matter. If they'd been touched, it was over.\n\nUnfortunately, I fear that caused our undoing. Our ranks plummeted when we shut ourselves off. We only had enough caviar and vitamin water for a few more weeks. We were starving and none of us had ever cooked a day in our lives. Starvation seemed imminent, but it seemed the lord had another fate in mind.\n\nI had been on watch that night when I heard it. Footsteps like thunder marched through the sacred hills and I heard a scream pierce the night.\n\n\"Can I borrow about $3.50?\"\n\nI paled. They even had turned the Loch Ness Monster. I reached for the alarm and our defensive troops stormed into action. We lined along the walls and prepared to fire, but our guns only made clicking noises when we pulled the trigger. The others stared, horrified and confused at their malfunctioning weapons, but I knew the truth.\n\nWith no servants, who would have loaded the guns?\n\nSilently, I walked over to my family. I had them sit, un-wrinkling their Blazers and dresses, next to my wife and I as we stared at the approaching horde.\n\nThis was the end. The War on Poverty was over.\n\nAnd we had lost.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422734186", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The man in that photo is my grandfather.  He is still alive but very sick.  I remember back in the days he used to tell us stories about giving free milk to the cats. He said how great they were in keeping the ranch mice free.  Until one day one of the cows had mad cow disease and its milk was infected.  The cats got very sick after drinking that milk and most of them died. Mice started spawming like crazy. Then they found out the reason the cow got the disease. The mouse king was sending his scouts with infected needles and demanded around tree fiddy to stop sending the scouts. Thats when my grandpa discovered that the mouse king is ten story high lochness monester and he was using the trick to get his dirty ways. Anyways i dont remember what he said after but he went to sleep. Now they are selling the ranch. \nIt is so sad that they are building a walmart in its place...

{"body": "Yes, exactly, most educated people realize that we shouldn't just appeal to God to answer any question that we don't know how to answer in a secular fashion, because that is how science works, and science has provided a worldview that has such a degree of coherence, evidential support, and comprehensive detail that no intellectually responsible person can afford to ignore it.\n\nIf I baldly asserted that the only way to define evil was to invoke fairies, and refused to provide any reason to believe this claim other than the fact that I didn't find any of the analyses that didn't invoke fairies convincing, would I be making a reasonable argument?
