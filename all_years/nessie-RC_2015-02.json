And, really, I'm not even sure what he meants with \"humans didn't evolve to be healthy\" but I hope it meant it in a different way than it came out because, admit it, this sounds ridiculous. Yes, it's true that human anatomy is not perfect. In some ways it's very fragile and succeptible to various accidents and diseases. However, in other ways it's also very resilient and tenacious. And it really makes sense that most humans were healthier and fitter in the Paleolithic era than most Westerners nowadays - these times were too harsh to survive if you were weak and fragile. And the majority of senile people nowadays only survive with the help of modern medicine and the convenient modern lifestyle. Anecdotal Paleo experiments also show that it's possible to bring your health and quality of life to the levels you didn't know was possible solely through correct diet.

{"body": "Yes, I have looked into them a little.  \n\nBut the alternative cases you suggest for comparison just aren't comparable.\n\nThe items in the universe you list: unicorns; mermaids; Loch Ness Monster; Bigfoot, are all described as items that, for one thing, reflect light off of their solid bodies.  In other words, we can *see* them.  From every indication, they are what we would call \"physical\" creatures.  Assumedly, they could be classified into Kingdoms, Phyla, Genus, Species, etc.  They would eat food for nourishment.  They would leave *leavings*--and other physical traces of their presence and passage through a given area. They would have to reside in some physical space which could be explored with man-made vehicles.  I mentioned above that light reflects off their bodies, which means they could be seen with the naked eye.  They would produce vibrations in the air around them--we would hear them.  And so on.\n\nBut dis-embodied spirits aren't described as having any of those qualities.  By definition (i.e. the thing we're talking about) doesn't spread out its parts in space (doesn't physically reside in one place and not another) because it isn't *composed* of parts as material objects are, and since they don't have what we'd call \"physical bodies\" we wouldn't expect them to leave physical traces of themselves in their environment.  \n\nIf we're looking for evidence of some species of animal *as-yet-unknown* to science, we should (and do) expect to find certain *kinds* of evidence.  But if we're looking for what is commonly understood to be non-bodied spirits, then we *shouldn't* expect to find the same sort of evidences for them as we should expect for Bigfoot, etc.\n\nHowever, I'm not too quick to *categorically* dismiss every tale of an encounter with Bigfoot, Loch Ness, mermaids, or unicorns (we might add fairies, elves, brownies, dwarfs, dragons, centaurs, and all the rest).  The best I think we could say is that no evidence *of the sort we should* **expect** *to find* for the existence of these creatures has yet been found *in confirmation* of their existence.  But that could all change tomorrow.  Who knows?\n\nBut as for demons, in my opinion there *is* sufficient evidence *of the kind we should expect* for their existence.

{"body": "When I was in high school, I wrote this rap song that I would perform for friends. Just messing around. For context, I'm an Asian-American male who wears glasses. I think that added to the effect.\n\nWhen I went to college, during the freshmen orientation week, they had a \"New Student Talent Show.\" I thought of doing the rap song from high school. I talked to one of the coordinators. He discouraged me, saying you don't want to turn off a bunch of people and embarrass yourself. Saddened me.\n\nThen I talked to another coordinator, a young woman who told me I should totally do it. So I signed up.\n\nThe night of the talent show comes. When it's my turn, I get up on stage. It's the entire freshmen class, a sea of new faces, a couple hundred students. Holy shit. Too late to go back now.\n\nI said my name, but added that my nickname was Spider-Man (he's my favorite super-hero). Got some laughs.\n\nStarted off by telling this sad story of how in high school I wanted to ask out the girl I liked to a dance. But she turned me down. Crowd goes, \"Aww.\"\n\nSo I wrote this song to tell her how I felt. How it was my way to get over it. True story.\n\nI took a deep breath, put on a sad face and tried to look like I was about to go into this soulful song.\n\nInstead I exploded with these lyrics:\n\n    Yo, my name is _____\n\n    I like to mack on senoritas\n\n    Freshman year, my life used to bite,\n\n    when I first freaked I saw the light!\n\n    I became a master pimp\n\n    I do you so hard, you walk with a limp!\n\n    Cuz I'm a mack daddy, I find out your name\n\n    and make you feel my game\n\n    I'm a mack daddy\n\n    one night with me you never feel the same!\n\n    I'm gonna get me a car, an old drop-top\n\n    exceed the speed limit, outrace the cops!\n\n    Cuz I'm a man, fearless and flawed\n\n    I'm a rebel without a pause!\n\n    I'm a mack daddy!\n\nThe first 10 seconds I sang, it was dead silence. Oh shit. Show must go on. I kept on singing.\n\nAt 11 seconds, the whole room erupted into pandemonium: \"Yeah!\" \"Woo!\" People were going crazy for it. So loud it drowned out my singing. When I finished, everyone cheered again.\n\nThe end of the night was the winner's announcements: third, second, and first place. Before one of the judges revealed every name, people were yelling, \"Spider-Man!\" \"Go Spider-Man!\"\n\nI didn't win. Didn't even place. People shouted, \"No way!\" \"Spider-Man got robbed!\"\n\nI'll be honest, it was a really killer talent show and all the other contestants were awesome. Not just the ones who placed, nearly everyone was good. I just wanted to give the audience a good time. Mission accomplished. (Later, one of the judges said I almost won third place, it was a close call).\n\nIn the end, it didn't matter. I was an audience favorite anyway. People, all of whom I didn't know, came up afterwards to shake hands and slap me on the back. Saying things like, \"You got robbed\" \"You were my favorite of the night!\" \"I don't care what the judges think, you won!\" One girl even gave me the sexy look and said, \"I would have gone to the dance with you.\"\n\nWhen I asked about why everyone was silent at first, they said it was because they were all in total shock. After hearing the sob story, they had no idea that a rap explosion was coming. When they realized I was rapping, they got excited.\n\nI didn't walk out of that room. I floated out of that room. Felt like a star. Biggest high I've ever felt. Even years later, people still remembered my performance. I'd run into other students on campus, and they'd say, \"Hey, you're Spider-Man!\"\n\nStill think on that experience when I'm having a bad day and need a boost.\n\ntl;dr: No tree fiddy.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422900741", "subreddit": "AskMen", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Groundhog Day History\n\nEuropean Roots\n\n(Adapted from \"Groundhog Day: 1886 to 1992\" by Bill Anderson)\n\nGroundhog Day, February 2nd, is a popular tradition in the United States. It is also a legend that traverses centuries, its origins clouded in the mists of time with ethnic cultures and animals awakening on specific dates. Myths such as this tie our present to the distant past when nature did, indeed, influence our lives. It is the day that the Groundhog comes out of his hole after a long winter sleep to look for his shadow.\n\nIf he sees it, he regards it as an omen of six more weeks of bad weather and returns to his hole.\n\nIf the day is cloudy and, hence, shadowless, he takes it as a sign of spring and stays above ground.\n\nThe groundhog tradition stems from similar beliefs associated with Candlemas Day and the days of early Christians in Europe, and for centuries the custom was to have the clergy bless candles and distribute them to the people. Even then, it marked a milestone in the winter and the weather that day was important.\n\nAccording to an old English song:\nIf Candlemas be fair and bright,\nCome, Winter, have another flight;\nIf Candlemas brings clouds and rain,\nGo Winter, and come not again.\nAccording to an old Scotch couplet:\nIf Candlemas Day is bright and clear,\nThere'll be twa (two) winters in the year.\nAnother variation of the Scottish rhyme:\nIf Candlemas day be dry and fair,\nThe half o' winter to come and mair,\nIf Candlemas day be wet and foul,\nThe half of winter's gone at Yule.\nThe Roman legions, during the conquest of the northern country, supposedly brought this tradition to the Teutons, or Germans, who picked it up and concluded that if the sun made an appearance on Candlemas Day, an animal, the hedgehog, would cast a shadow, thus predicting six more weeks of bad weather, which they interpolated as the length of the \"Second Winter.\"\n\nPennsylvania's earliest settlers were Germans and they found groundhogs to in profusion in many parts of the state. They determined that the groundhog, resembling the European hedgehog, was a most intelligent and sensible animal and therefore decided that if the sun did appear on February 2nd, so wise an animal as the groundhog would see its shadow and hurry back into its underground home for another six weeks of winter.\n\nThe Germans recited:\nFor as the sun shines on Candlemas Day,\nSo far will the snow swirl until the May.\nThis passage may be the one most closely represented by the first Punxsutawney Groundhog Day observances because there were references to the length of shadows in early Groundhog Day predictions.\n\nAnother February 2nd belief, used by American 19th century farmers, was:\nGroundhog Day - Half your hay.\nNew England farmers knew that we were not close to the end of winter, no matter how cloudy February 2nd was. Indeed, February 2nd is often the heart of winter. If the farmer didn't have half his hay remaining, there may have been lean times for the cows before spring and fresh grass arrived.\n\nThe ancient Candlemas legend and similar belief continue to be recognized annually on February 2nd due to the efforts of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club.\n\nGrowing Fame\n\nFrom offering support of political events, to rooting for area sports teams, to becoming the star of a Hollywood movie, Punxsutawney Phil has increasingly been in the public eye.\n\nEarly observances of Phil's predictions were conducted privately in the wooded areas that neighbor the town. Today's celebration sees tens of thousands of visitors from all over the world as revelers await Phil's appearance as most fans wait to see their favorite rock stars.\n\nThe Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper is credited with printing the news of the first observance in 1886 (one year before the first legendary trek to Gobbler's Knob):\n\n\"Today is groundhog day, and up to the time of going to press the beast has not seen his shadow.\"\nOver the course of Phil's appearances, Phil has had numerous noteworthy highlights:\n\nDuring Prohibition Phil threatened to impose 60 weeks of winter on the community if he wasn't allowed a drink.\nIn 1958 Phil announced that it was a \"United States Chucknik,\" rather than a Soviet Sputnik or Muttnik that became the first man-made satellite to orbit Earth.\nIn 1981 Phil wore a yellow ribbon in honor of the American hostages in Iran.\nPhil traveled to Washington DC in 1986 to meet with President Reagan. He was joined by Groundhog Club President Jim Means, Al Anthony and Bill Null.\nPhil met Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburg in 1987.\nIn 1993, Columbia Pictures released the movie Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray.\nPhil appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show in 1995.\nIn the years following the release of the movie, record crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney!\nIn 2001, Phil's prediction was shown live on the JumboTron at Times Square in New York City. Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell attended the ceremonies, making him the first sitting governor ever to do so.\nStephen Tobolowsky, who played Ned Ryserson, in the movie Groundhog Day, attended the 2010 Groundhog Day Celebration in Punxsutawney.\nDanny Rubin, writer of the screenplay Groundhog Day, attended Groundhog Day 2013. This was the first time he attend Groundhog Day since before the movie was released. He addressed the crowd by starting out with, \"My, how you have grown, Im going to ask something from each of you, I'm going to need about treefiddy\" it was about that time the crowd realized that Danny Rubin was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

{"body": "I'm going to be a party pooper and put my studies to work. Also I should warn you I'm going to be very cold about how I talk about this. Appeal to pathos? Ain't nobody got time for dat.\n\nMemories are finicky things. Every time you remember something, it changes just a bit. Heck, false memories can be completely fabricated under proper conditions. This happens even faster when emotions are involved (such as fear and stress). The more you and your brother tell the story as if it was real, the more real it will become in your mind.\n\nMy high school teacher (and robotics team adviser) told me about a study he did in college. Him and his research partners set up a room with two computers. At one computer would sit a volunteer, and at the other computer would sit a researcher who was presented to the volunteer as another volunteer doing the same thing they were doing. What they had the person do is sit in-front of the computer with a list of keys they should never press for one reason or another, such as the \"software hasn't been fully tested yet so these keys will cause problems if they are pressed\". A computer program then runs that has them press keys in a strategically difficult, frustrating, and stressful manner.\n\nThings keep getting more and more stressful, until something happens (I can't remember exactly what) which is very obviously a bad thing and a problem with the computer (my guess would be red lights, loud noises, maybe the whole thing turns off). At that moment the other researcher (the one in disguise) says something along the lines of \"You pressed one of they keys, didn't you?\" The rest of the researchers will come in and go straight to the volunteer saying things like \"You pressed one of they keys? didn't you.\" \"We told you not to press those keys.\" \"Look what you did when you pressed those keys.\" all the while giving them papers, telling them to sign saying that they pressed those keys and caused all these random problems elsewhere in the facility. Something like 75% of the people actually signed the papers, and over 90% of the 75% were legitimately convinced they actually pressed those keys, even though the researchers have key-logs showing none of them actually pressed any key they weren't supposed to. They would get into an argument about how they pressed the keys, disputing the empirical evidence the researches had provided. They had manufactured a memory from nothing but stress and frustration.\n\nOf course this is just one study, but there have been many others where people have manufactured memories in other ways. One even [had someone lie to another person about how engaging and exiting an activity was](https://books.google.com/books?id=zFl4AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;ots=pgRz5iJF1l&amp;dq=rotating%20square%20pegs%20experiment&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). The lie then subconsciously became truth in their brain in an effort to reduce cognitive dissonance.\n\nThere's a darned good reason why personal testimony is one of the the least, if not *the* least trusted form of evidence in court.\n\nHere's what I think could have gone down. When you turned out the light your brother was scared and probably a bit stressed. Because he was young, most likely with an active imagination his mind started racing, thinking about what could be going on. Because he thought you were still in the room he, in a sense, saw you (further reinforced by the part in your story that said he couldn't make out any distinctive features but he still knew it was you). Because his mind was still running on fear, the imaginary version of you did scary things. This caused him to say the things he said. Then when you spoke and it became clear it wasn't you in the room, freaking him out, causing you to freak out, creating a feedback loop of fear. Eventually when you get into the room this is treated as a very real, very scary thing (I wouldn't blame you), which reinforces the idea that it was a very real and very scary thing that just happened. Every time you thought about how real and scary each of the details were, the more real and scary the experience became. The more your brother explained and thought about the details (cold hand causing pain, the figure that \"looked\" like you), the more cemented they became in his mind. Fast forward many years and he distinctly remembers things that did not happen. The same thing could happen with you and the locked door. It could have been difficult to open at that time, jammed, or something else, but the more you remembered it being locked, the more it became the reality that it *was* locked, at least in your mind, and there is nothing else it could have been.\n\nAnd even if part of the story couldn't have been explained, it's far more reasonable to go with \"I don't know\" or \"I don't have an explanation\" than to default to the supernatural. Doing so is being mentally dishonest to yourself.\n\nNot to mention this isn't a special case. It's well documented and very common. People get abducted by UFOs, see Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster. There are hundreds upon hundreds of \"spiritual experiences\" from religions that oppose one another, and this stuff goes down all the friggin' time in a court room when personal testimony is used. If your memories go against what has been [proven false 100% of the time](https://xkcd.com/373/), I wouldn't trust those memories.

{"body": "   Okay so this thread is fucking depressing, so I'll tell you a little story that I'm still quite proud of. \nSo there was a very young Teacher that started my Senior year of high school. I didn't have her, but mannnnn, did I know who she was. She wasn't a day over 23, just fresh out of college and this was her first job as a Teacher. There was only one problem with this Teacher though. She was honestly a straight bitch, she clearly didn't want to be a Teacher in the slightest. It took 3 years before the school finally got rid of her and it was due to her bragging about giving lower grades to students she didn't care for. My buddy who was dyslexic actually had her for English and he did not like reading aloud in front of the class. It was embarrassing for him, because he would get really nervous and would just stutter constantly. He could read fine to himself and he was wicked smaht, but just had trouble when put on the spot. \n\n   So fast forward a year and a half after high school, I was almost 20 and had dropped a ton of weight/grew facial hair. It was a goatee back then; beards weren't really a thing yet. \n\n   There was a bar on the outskirts of town where the owner knew my friend and let us drink there in spite of our age. We walk in one night around 11 or so and who should be sitting at the bar you ask? That's right, hot Teacher. Now it wasn't that I was shy necessarily I just hadn't had a lot of practice with women. See, I had lost over 80 pounds and so I wasn't used to women finding me very attractive. Well my buddy decided unbeknownst to me that he was going to try and fuck this teacher that night. So we're playing pool and getting all liquored up when this teacher and her friends (2 females) come wandering over to us (my buddy didn’t even have to try it would seem)  She didn't recognize me nor my friend (not the same friend who had her for English by the way) and asked me, not my friend but me if they could play with us. So we start playing pool and dammnnn is this Teacher layin it on thick with the flirting but not with my buddy but me, ME! Even my normally oblivious ass knew what she was after. My buddy was alright with that though because he had some little competition thing going on with the other two (never have understood that about women, why they become competitive over an average looking guy). The Teacher asks me if I want to buy her another drink, so I oblige and head toward the bar with her only to be turned around and slammed right into the wall in the corner. She comes at me like a cat in heat and who was I to complain, right? So things are getting hot and heavy, so before long she invites my buddy and me back to her place. We naturally say yes without a second thought. \n\nFast forward 20 intense minutes later with her all over me in the back seat of the car and we pull into her driveway. We go inside the house and she looks at her friends and my buddy and says \"condoms are in the kitchen drawer, good night.\" She drags me back to her room, I thought I was going to fall over she pulled so hard. We get in there and she pulls that whole, I just want to freshen up thing. So I'm lying there on her bed just thinking about what I'm about to do. I thought about my buddy and how embarrassed he was in her class, the way she always treated students with disrespect. This is going to be beautiful I thought, I still know people that go there and all of the kids still can’t stand her ass. This will get around the school and she’ll experience a cock punch of karma right to her uterus! Yes siree, I'm lying on the bed with this smug shit eating grin on my face until the bathroom door flies open. She literally runs at me and jumps what seemed like 20 feet to land right on top of me. She is completely naked and we just go wild on each other.\n Something happened though that night, after we had sex we were both pretty sober or at least sober enough. We laid in each other’s arms and just talked for what seemed like days. Though, we eventually did fall asleep as the sun started to come up. I woke up next to her and I remember the way the sun lit her face through the windows, she looked almost angelic. I had lost any dislike I had for her and discovered that deep down she was actually a good person. \n\n   In fact, she's still lying next to me as I type this story now ten years later. I'm going to give my wife a kiss and call it a night boys and girls. For the record, she did eventually realize how big of a bitch she was as a teacher and that she taught at my school while I was there. Just not before she got shit canned, she works in HR for a decent company now and she's still kind of a bitch but I love her anyway. I just love the way she looks at me with those big dough eyes and though I find it kind of annoying when she looks at me and asks for about tree fiddy. She's such a greedy bitch.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422932515", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 28, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was about thirteen there was this girl from my school I had a major crush on.  Let's call her Samantha.  One day we were playing kickball in gym class and Samantha was the pitcher, and I was in line to kick.  I was struggling to look like I wasn't checking her out as she pitched with the grace of a Greek goddess with the sun shining upon her golden locks.  By the time I was on deck I realized that I was suffering that common malady of the thirteen year old boy in co-ed gym class: the incredibly noticeable boner pitching a tent in my gym shorts.  I tried to turn myself to disguise it while thinking boner-deflating thoughts, but nothing worked, and it was my turn to kick.  With my heart hammering in my chest I stepped onto the plate with my erection standing proud for all to see.  My face burned with humiliation as Samantha looked at me, and then down.  Her eyes widened and a smile played upon her lips, and that was when everything went wrong.  To my astonishment my boner grew into a twenty foot long battering ram with such force that it bludgeoned Samantha in the face with the sheer force of its growth, sending her sprawling.  I panicked, sweeping my massive boner across the field and accidentally took out the first baseman and the half dozen or so kids standing in line to kick.  With tears streaming from my eyes I shambled to the pitcher's mound to check on Samantha, my massive dick log digging a furrow in the ground behind me.  At last I reached the place where she lay sprawled out on the green and asked frantically if she was alright.  She groaned and coughed up blood from her bruised lips and whispered, *\"I'll be fine... if only--\"*  I cried out to her not to die on me!  With difficulty she finished with her last breath, *\"If only I could get... about tree fiddy.\"*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423121821", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It's a Tim Burton movie I ignored when it came out, I'm not sure I would have appreciated it back then.  It's a great balancing act of paying tribute to Wood while not ignoring his strange nature &amp; awful filmmaking.  It's also a love letter to movies in general.  I don't know how Burton got this thing to work, it's got such a refined humor to it.  Somehow manages to be a better biopic than others that take themselves much more seriously. **9 / 10**\n\n**A Single Shot** (2013; directed by David M. Rosenthal)  Sam Rockwell as a gun-toting, trucker-hat wearing man who's adjusting (poorly) to life after his wife leaves him &amp; takes their kid.  Some nasty things happen, &amp; there's harassment, murder, intimidation, &amp; other assorted impolite behaviors revolving around a box of cash.  It's got a gritty, effective atmosphere &amp; a fantastic score.  **7 / 10**\n\n**Incident at Loch Ness** (2004; directed by Zak Penn) Re-watch: How a Hollywood guy like Penn hooked up with Werner Herzog for not one, but two (*The Grand*, the lesser of the two for me) very fun &amp; playful mockumentaries must have a very interesting story behind it.  Regardless, Herzog plays Herzog having a (fictional) documentary done about himself as he sets out to make his own (fictional) documentary about Nessie &amp; the psychology of monsters &amp; myths.  It's a really fun poke at filmmaking &amp; overzealous producers as Herzog riffs on his own mystique.  **9 / 10**\n\n**Patton Oswalt: Tragedy Plus Comedy Equals Time** (2014; directed by Bob Goldthwait) Stand-up concert in a big, grand venue, featuring Patton wearing an actual, non-cotton jacket &amp; dress pants.  Not much to say on a technical level - everything looked &amp; sounded fine - , but as a Patton fan it's his least potent comedy concert.  It's shitty to say I want him to stay angry at the world, I like that Patton's stuff feels mostly from the heart, but he's reached doting dad status &amp; takes up roughly a third of the show talking about his toddler daughter &amp; his parental fears.

{"body": "&gt; It isn't up to me to prove that metaphysical things don't exist. Its up to you to prove they do exist.\n\nWell, I'm not quite sure that's how the philosophical conversation goes. I'm sure that if I wanted to be taken seriously in a science-oriented occupation, I'd have to provide evidence that these things exist; but I don't claim this is a scientific matter.\n\n&gt;However, if you can prove that something exists then there is evidence. If there is evidence then it interacts with the physical world, and that means it is physical.\n\nSo only the physical exists, is what you're saying.\n\n&gt;A ghost that is intangible but can be seen must be physical. The light would have to bounce off of something in order to enter my eye. If you can find it with an instrument, then its interacting with the physical world.\n\nRight, I don't believe in the paranormal. Ghosts, faeries, loch ness monster, werewolves, demons, etc. That's all malarky, because they are claimed to causally interact with our world, yet there is no evidence that they do.\n\nThe metaphysical (as I refer to it) isn't claimed to interact with the physical.\n\n&gt;If there is no proof, then there is reason to believe it exists. There is unlikely to be any proof, and therefore I am unlikely to believe anything metaphysical. I am open to changing my viewpoint though.\n\nFair enough. I'm learning I may have used the wrong word when using \"metaphysical,\" but that the gist of argument isn't incorrect. But I would like to say, I don't believe in anything paranormal, as you refer to it. Obviously, if something is said to causally interact with the universe, we should be able to get evidence of it, but no one is claiming that metaphysical entities can do that.\n\n&gt;Are you high? Just say what you want to say.\n\nlol, no, and I did.\n\n&gt;Science works by looking at evidence and then understanding what that evidence means. You are doing the opposite.\n\nThat's totally not true. Science theorizes a lot of things, and then tries to prove them; example, higgs boson. It was theorized, there was no physical evidence of it- the mathematics seemed to work out, and then we tested to see if our theories were correct.\n\n&gt;Not obviously. There doesn't have to be a creation point.\n\nCreation kind of carries some theistic-heavy baggage. But there certainly is an origin of spacetime, at least according to science.\n\n&gt;There is a rapid expansion (post Big Bang), but prior to that there is no evidence of what, if anything, was before.\n\nRight; there is no physical evidence of what would be non-physical.\n\n&gt;There probably never will be evidence of before\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;Since it doesn't matter, I don't worry about it.\n\nTo each his own.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423192245", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok so I have one amazing story to tell. So one night during my boot camp leave (I had just graduated Marine Corps Boot camp) my motard friends and I thought it would be fun to go to LA/Hollywood in our uniforms and enjoy our few nights of freedom. We ended up in some high end club and over the course of the night the people there slowly found out we were fresh new Marines. Before we knew it, it was a celebration for us. Everyone was buying us drinks, we got VIP treatment, and we felt like celebrities. Anyways to make a long story short I eventually blacked out and couldn't tell you what happened. But when I woke up, I woke up in this HUGE ass house in a big ass bedroom. I mean this room was huge!!! It had a spatub/bath in it and TVs everywhere. It was the room of dreams. Needless to say I was freaked the fuck out. I had no clue where I was and I couldn't find my phone or wallet. I really didn't want to wander around this house, cuz i didn't know who or what I would find. After about 10 mins I gathered enough courage to explore and let me tell you all, this house was fucking beautiful. It wasn't like overly extravagant, but it was very nicely decorated with many rooms. Well eventually I found my way downstairs and wonder into the biggest kitchen I've ever seen in my life. But..... even more...... the girl in the Kitchen was Lindsay fucking Lohan...... I fucking fan girled the fuck out. (This was pre druggy Lindsay) I swear I completely forgot the entire situation and was acted like I just met her on the street....... eventually the high of meeting her wore off and I started asking questions.... like how I got there? What happened? Where was my stuff? Apparently we had met the night before and one thing led to another and we ended up at her pad and that my friends had my stuff........ which was an instant fucking problem.... how was I gonna get home?!?!?! Lindsay was completely understanding and said she would call a cab and pay for it. (some first date right?) I thanked her and asked how much a cab ride would cost out there..... she looked me straight in the eye and said \"about tree fiddy\" then she ripped off her mask and it was non other than the Damn lochness monster!!!!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423198378", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "/u/internetsanta\n\nBut honestly this is a post on r/funny and people are reading way to far into a shitty pic of a shitty sign probably written by a shitty redditor. \n\nIf this is a legit post then may I say:\n\nWhat a stupid dumb shit kid you are raising, OP. Stupid fuck can't even spell \"beer\". I hope your child drowns in fruit cups while you are passed out in a hazy slumber from all your *berr* drinking and cant save your offspring. \nSo you feel terrible and this is obviously the lowest time in your life, everyone from random strangers, to coworkers, to friends and family all know your negligence ended your own flesh and blood. Rightfully so, they treat you like the worthless sack of cunts you are. Obviously, your wife leaves you cause you're a dumb shit alcoholic who killed her gay autistic child (also your tiny wiener). So as a man with literally nothing left to live for, you buy a Remington 870 secondhand and some slugs in an Arby's parking lot cause you're a cis white American shitlord patriarch. You drive your SUV to your now ex-wife's sister's place where she is staying cause she couldn't live one more day with her kid-killer hubby. \n\nOnce arrived, you immediately shoot your sister in law in the dome piece and it goes POP! Startled, your ex wife drops the pregnancy test she just pissed positive with your baby in the toilet to check and see if everything is alright. \n\nEverything is not alright. Sister in law head and face chunks are now located throughout and inside the drywall in her humble townhouse main entrance. Giggling and crying simultaneously, you franticly chatter your last good byes to the ex in law, then roar your ex's name. Immediately, she now knows what the loud noise was, and who is now chanting her name galloping the hallways searching for her. \nYou psycho piece of shit. You went off the fucking deep end buddy, no turning back now. \nLike a bloodhound, your crazy ass finds your ex woman in no time. Using the butt end of your chain sandwich shop parking lot pick up, you barbarically bash the bathroom door, busting your bitches brain in the process. Her ear was placed against  the door listening for signs of a good time to bolt. Now unconscious, her almost corpse lays nearly lifeless all strewn about face down on the cold white tiles. You take aim at her head and pathetically mutter some kinda self justification how you all will be closer to your child now, and squeeze the trigger. BOOM...\n\nToo much of a pussy to look at what you've done, you slowly regain your senses as the loud shot disoriented yourself. Quietly sobbing, you hear sirens off in the distance. You take of your shoe and sock to fulfill your spur of the moment insane idea to finally end this mess with your long barrelled shotgun. You feel at peace with yourself now, you are finally righting the ultimate wrong. A smile creeps across your face, and for the first time in a while, you are happy. Placing the crude weaponry in your mouth, big toe on trigger, and taking in one last inhale of air and gunsmoke, you see something move in the corner of your eye; your wife. \n\nFlabergasted, you take the gun out of your mouth and swiftly dry your moist eyes. To your incompetent bitch ass, surprise is the only emotion you feel right now. Sirens getting louder, you have to take a double look at what you thought you just saw. You missed. You barely shot your ex wife in the head, she is moving. Shocked, you cannot move a muscle.  Eventually, you realize what you are witnessing: out of your wife's barely grazed neck slips out a one hundred foot tall mesozoic era crustacean. Flabbergasted x2 now, you suddenly remember how often your wife would ask you for a specific amount of change, for all these years you were married to the goddamn loch ness monster! Sorry that got out of hand, hope you enjoyed, I'm obviously not a writer but criticism is welcome. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423208134", "subreddit": "funny", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

We're both huge DM fanatics.\n\nAs far as recommendations go, our tastes don't totally line up but some of the softer scents to try would be Atlantis (pretty aquatic floral with a deeper base), Avalon Myst (light fresh greens with a bit of apple), and Lady of Light (light and crisp greenery and florals).  Nessie is a great damp green aquatic that a lot of people love, but it didn't quite work for me.  Oh, and if you like greens with a little musk, Sylvan Night is also simple and super lovely.

{"body": "For as long as I can remember, I have been searching. But I know not what I need. Only that deep down, I have a carnal, unyielding need for *something*. It has slowly consumed me over the years, filling at first my deepest dreams, my most longing hopes. Now, I peruse the dark waters of my domain, consumed by the need to search! To find! But I do not know what to look for. The only hope for my salvation is that one day I will find it, and know what it is I have found. I hope I will have a purpose after that day. But for now, I must continue searching. \n\nMy mind briefly fluttered to days long past, before this curse had come over me. I had been happy. I had been young and free, untroubled by the burdens I now cannot seem to shake. Then I met her. She was an angel, descended from the glittery shards of light above! She complimented me in ways I did not understand, saw parts of me I did not know. Those had been the best days of my long, miserable life.\n\nThen, something happened. Sickness had crept into our waters. Black ash covered the surface. The glittery shards that would sparkle and dance in the waves had disappeared. And like the beautiful, wonderful lights above, she faded, as if her life was tied directly into theirs. Years passed. She did not get better. The lights did not return. My joy and happiness turned into sorrow and dread. I knew what was coming, and could not prevent it. The sickness ate away at her, taking her smile her personality, and finally her body. \n\nSoon after, all that remained was a shell. Bitterness at life replaced my sorrow. Hate replaced my dread. She lasted much longer than was merciful. It was a pity it took so long for her to truly die, leaving me alone. The waters that used to be bright and cheerful were now dark and brooding. \n\nIt was a long time before the lights returned. I did not look at them. I could not bear the sight or thought of them. It was a reminder of all that I had, and all that I had lost. Many more cycles passed. I did not bother to count them. Things started to look inward from the outside world. I did not bother with them. They could not give me what I wanted. They could not understand what I needed. I payed them no mind.\n\nA flash of light brought me out of my memories, a welcome respite from the slow torture of my mind. I almost swam on by, but there had been something about that light. I... I could not turn away. I could not swim on by. Something inside me lit up, something I had not felt in ages. I wanted to know what this light was. I *needed* too. \n\nI tentatively scooped up this *things*? They gleamed like silver, like they had descended from the sky above. as if they came from the same place as.... *Her*. The world became ethereal, surreal. I could not feel the coolness of the water on my skin, nor the beat of my own hearts. I watched myself, guided by instincts alone, as I swam to a part of my domain I swore I would never visit again. A place that only filled me with pain and longing. But I felt nothing as I approached the site. And in a single move, I had broken every promise to myself I had made in the last 500 million years. I placed these pieces of starlight on her grave.\n\nFor a moment, as brief as can be, they flickered brightly, as if they had found their home. It was now I knew I had found what I was looking for. What had consumed my being and tortured me so. Peace.\n\nAnd in that moment I uttered a phrase I had nearly forgotten I knew.\n\n\"I will always love you.\"\n\nAs I swam away, I finally left the **Past** where it belonged.\n\n\n\n\"Grandpa!\" The young boy exclaimed excitedly. \"Is it really true?\"\n\n\"Is what true, Pumpkin?\" He replied.\n\n\"Does the Loch Ness monster really live in this place?\" The boy looked at the water longingly, trying to peer into its darkest depths.\n\n\"Oh yes!...\" The old man started.\n\n\"Not this again.\" The boys father grumbled. \"We don't need to fill Howards' mind with any *more* fantasy stories.\"\n\nLittle Howard, completely unfazed by his fathers apparent disapproval, continued pestering his grandfather.\n\n\"They say he only surfaces once in a thousand years!\" The grandfather pressed on. \"Only a handful of people have every seen him in person!\"\n\n\"Wow! I want to see him too! Can I? Can I please, Grandpa?\"\n\nThe old man chuckled to himself. \"A wish like that is a very tall order there, Pumpkin. I don't know if it'll come true or not.\"\n\n\"I know how to make it come true! Mom taught us that if we throw change into the water and make a wish, it'll come true!\"\n\nGrandpa chuckled quietly to himself, trying to ignore the unsubtle eye-rolling of his own son. He dug around in his pockets, hoping he had some change. Anything for his grandson. With a little luck, he remember his coin purse, silently resting against his foot on the bottom of the boat.\n\nAs he reached for it, the disapproval from the boy's frugal father was barely contained. \"What did I just say about giving him silly ideas?\"\n\nIn response, the boys' grandfather proceeded to dump the entire contents of his coin purse into the little boy's eagerly waiting hands. No sooner had the metal touched his skin that the coins were soon sinking to the bottom of the lake. The little boy stared intently out over the water, no doubt focusing entirely on his wish.\n\n\"How much did you give him?\" The father asked.\n\nThe old man thought about it for a bit. \"I think I had about 3.50 in there.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man just shook his head and continued rowing the boat.\n\nNothing more was said for the rest of the time on the lake. Howard had been totally engrossed in his thoughts, being uncharacteristically quiet. As they docked the boat for the night, his father, no longer being able to contain his curiosity, asked Howard what his wish had been.\n\n\"For the Loch Ness monster to be happy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423229909", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

It doesn't affect performance at all but it bothers my inner perfectionist :(\n- Despite the flush mounts, pushing is still quite a hassle, but I suppose this can be remedied to an extent by running a different setip (I'll share my setup below).\n- The nose is really just there for decoration.

{"body": "So I live in the Bronx.  For a long time, no cabs would pick up in the Bronx.  Now they have the green cabs, but this happened before the green cabs.  \n\nI was walking outside Yankee Stadium around 2 AM.  The game had ended around 1:30 (really late) after a rain delay kept the game from starting for a while.  I was waiting for my girlfriend to come out of the bathroom in the great hall.  When she came out of the Stadium, I was about to start walking toward the subway station at 161st street and River Avenue (Now Rivera Avenue in that area), when my girlfriend said, \"there is no way in hell I'm taking the subway at 2 in the morning back to my apartment.\"  I said, \"There are no cabs.  I live only a 10 minute walk but you live a 25 minute walk.  What are we gonna do.\"  Right at that moment, a Lincoln Town Car pulled up next to us.  The window opened just so slightly, enough for us to hear him say,\"I'll give you a ride.\"  For those of you who don't know, this car was a Gypsy cab.  A gypsy cab is one of those professional limousine drivers/lincoln town car drivers that after hours, moonlights as a cab driver.  It is illegal, very dangerous, ect.  But a lot of those guys need the money.  The reason it is dangerous is that the gypsy cabs often go to the outer boroughs where people don't have another option cab wise, and they attempt to pick up people.  These passengers might try to rob the driver, they might shoot him, ect.  And if anything happens short of death, the driver can't got to the cops because he isn't a licensed cab driver and what he is doing is technically illegal.  So back to my story.  I'd ridden in a couple gypsy cabs before.  A couple of my neighbors were gypsy cab drivers.  I had no problem with taking the cab, but my girlfriend was hesitant.  I asked her why, and she said,\"It smells funny.\"  And she was right.  It had an indescribable odor that I had never smelled before.  The way gypsy cabs usually work is that you tell them where you want to go, they come up with a set price beforehand, and you pay them up front.  I told the guy the intersection where I wanted him to drop us off (I wasn't telling this guy where I lived, and I sure as hell wasn't telling him where my girlfriend lived.  We'd walk the last couple blocks).  I asked, do you want us to pay you up front?  No answer.  He stepped on the gas and floored it up the Grand Concourse.  The Grand Concourse is almost always busy and filled with traffic, but on this particular night, it was completely empty.  I looked at the speedometer, and it said 120 MPH.  My girlfriend curled up next to me, and said, \"Danny, I'm scared.\"  I said,\"Don't worry, we are only like a couple blocks from where I told him to drop us off.  As we approached the intersection, he wasn't slowing down at all.  I said, \"Dude, you just missed the intersection.\"  Immediate slamming on the breaks made my girlfriend hit her head on the passenger seat back.  She was knocked out cold.  This pissed me off.  I said to the guy,\"You just knocked my girl out cold.  Thanks a lot, asshole.  What do I owe you?\"  He rolled down the screen in between the seats, turned to face me, and said, \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"  It was the Loch Ness fucking monster.  That was where the odor was coming from, it reeked of a Scottish Loch and the upkilt of Fat Bastard.  I said, \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy, you're the Loch Ness monster,\" and I opened the door and carried my girlfriend out and put her on my back and started to run.  The cab sped off into the night.  I sat down on a park bench, as we were right next to a park, and set my girlfriend down next to me, leaning on my shoulder.  She awoke a minute or two later, and asked,\"What happened?\"  I said to her in my suave voice,\"It was the Loch Ness Monster.  This is why we should have taken the subway.\"\n\nStory based on actual events.

{"body": "I was leaving work one day to go get lunch and I stopped as I was pulling out. Out of nowhere this woman jumps in my car and goes, \"Thank you so much for the ride, my car broke down and I had to walk to go get some groceries!\" The nearest town has a small grocery store and to walk there from where I work would be about 45 mins to an hour.\n\nWell I look at this chick and I couldn't tell if she was a crack head, or an older black lady. She looked like shit but we was dressed like she was in her 20's. Anyway she starts rambling at me about how grateful she is and I am trying to get my brain around what the fuck is going on, was I about to get robbed? Either way my chivalrous side kicked in and I was like I got to bring this bitch to the store.\n\nAs I am driving there she basically tells me her entire life story about how her kids have abandoned her because she suffers from mental illness and can apparently be a crazy bitch and display irrational behavior, she can't afford the meds to stop being a crazy bitch, and she can't hold down a job because she is insane. She could have lived off an inheritance she got from her dad, but she spent it sending her kids to college (I live relatively close to a very large and expensive IVY league school).\n\nSo I get her to the grocery store and she gets out and says, \"I understand if you aren't here when I get back.\" Well what I did is text my friend/boss and give a description of the lady and make the decision to stay... After grabbing a pocket knife from my camping gear...\n\nThe lady comes back with a shitload of groceries and the look she had on her face when she saw that I had waited made it worth it. I now kind of regretted thinking about how I would kill her if shit went south.\n\nAnyway I drive her back to her apartment which was pretty nice, helped her unload her groceries and brought them inside for her. The inside of the place was... Something... It looked eerie, like it was abandoned but at the same time the areas she clearly used were clean. She also had a christmas tree up, it was july. She apologized about the lack of lights and said she couldn't change any light bulbs due to not being able to get to them. So obviously I do the polite thing and offers to change them all. \n\nWell she finally opens the door to her room and I go in and there next to her bed is the hugest dildo I have ever personally viewed outside of porn and next to it a giant fucking butt plug. These were not acknowledge... So in the end I changed the bulbs and we started to say our goodbyes, she asked me if I would like any and I said yes, I need about tree fiddy and I explained that I was a simple creature from the paleolithic era. At that point she realizes I am about 8 stories tall and a crustacean. So then that bitch had the nerve to say, \"Get out of here Lochness Monster! I aint giving you no tree fiddy!\" Bitch.\n\n\nThis story is true minus the part about me thinking about how to kill her if I need to.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423360319", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was an end of Summer Barbeque for family and friends at our house, I was an awkward penguin that just turned 21. I wasn't ugly or autistic. Just had different priorities. Well I was upstairs, looking down into our backyard and saw a really cute girl there having some appetizers. I get all giddy and shy, I can't even go down there because I might act stupid. Well, then I realized I had to go down eventually. So I went down, and sat at the long table where everyone was sitting, at the opposite end away from her. Well, she walks by and sits across from me and introduces herself. I can barely keep myself together as we do a bit of small talk. She was *really* cute... She actually looked, dressed, talked, and acted exactly like Boxxy. So I was really really into her. Well, we talked and ate for a bit and drank a bit of wine, which gave both of us a nice buzz. We decide to go inside the house, where I show her my room. And we sat on a couch in there, where I began loosening up a bit more. We talked for what felt like forever, about a lot of things. She started complimenting me on my room, then my clothes, and then my personality. I recriprocated. Next thing I know, my heart is beating fast as she leans a bit closer to me, and begins talking a bit softer as she leans her head on my shoulder. She asked me something that I paid absolutely no attention to. And there was suddenly this pause that just hung in the air, as if time stopped, and our eyes locked. I lean in a bit, and so does she, very slowly, and then quickly lock our lips. Oh man... That feeling of butterflies I got on that moment was pretty damn incredible. I got lost in the intimacy of the moment, the strong emotions that were evoked from her gentle touching, her smell, her hair brushing against my face, her soft cheeks rubbing against mine, her small hand running up my arm... I was enveloped in a deep embodiment of sensory bliss... It was amazing. We kissed for a few minutes, and I asked her for her number before she had to leave. We hung out a few times after that, and had some pretty nice make out sessions, but no sex. Being the noob that I was, I asked if she wanted to be my gf, but she noped and friendzoned me right then and there because she was just about to start college where she didn't wanna have any commitments. But it was alright cus not even a week later, I crashed a frosh party and ran into her again. We made out like crazy that night where we ended up going back to her new dorm room. She made me sit on her bed, and she gave me this look that I'll never forget, and gave me a little strip tease that gave me an instant erection. As she stood there all beautiful and shit, she crawled up to me and said \"I'm gonna need about $3.50.\" It was around this time that I realized that Boxxy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic era! That damned loch ness monster had tricked me again! I was like \"God damn it lochness monsta, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" It was right there that I went flaccid and bolted right the fuck outta there.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423370907", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "People were not \"getting hacked\". Nothing personal to you, OP, but as an IT/Networking guy, it's so annoying to hear incorrect information. In your case, it's understandable, you're just asking for the first time. In cases like /u/barscarsandguitars, there's no excuse because I'm fairly certain I answered his \"I got wiped out of everything but $5\" thread, and he just doesn't listen.\n\nHere's the deal. A breach happened with the payment processor. Not the users. Not MS's site. Lots of card data was taken, not just from MS clients - it would have been anyone who uses ANY service that used that processor. MS has changed processors. Everything is okay now. \n\nSo no fear as to the hacking, **BUT** be safe. Get a pre-paid or use a credit card you can stand to be without for a few days if the worst were to happen. That way no one ever has a direct line to ALL your cash. Pre-paid has a cap of however much you have on it, credit cards have zero liability. So do banks, but your actual cash will be gone for a day or two. Credit cards, your cash is still there, just no card. \n\nThis goes for ANY online transaction that you want to be uber-safe about. I got hit for $650 on my credit card, but it didn't matter. I had alerts for any online transaction, so I knew within 2 minutes. Had the card cancelled 3 minutes later. Had a new card 3 or 4 days after, and lost nothing. \n\nAs for quality? I've almost exclusively used MS, and there's definitely a reason for that. I've gotten samples from other places that didn't touch it. MS has some strains that don't seem to be great (I've never gotten a thing off kali kaya white), but overall they're awesome. Right now they have their Baik Bali back in stock. If it's anything like the last batch of that stuff, I'll be thrilled, it was pretty amazing stuff. \n\nYMMV, of course, but there's my ~~2 cents~~ about tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423379965", "subreddit": "kratom", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You know, I once knew a person like you. It's kind of a funny story, actually, so keep reading. His name was Jack, in his mid thirties, migrated from Scotland with his family, the youngest sibling out of four (all brothers). He had blond hair and blue eyes, and was about 6'2\" (Hitler's wet dream basically). Anyway, I met him whilst going for horse riding once, many many years ago (I forgot to mention he lived on a farm with his older brothers and their families - but the farm had little space for their horses so they moved them to some stables nearby - coincidentally the one I wen for horse riding). So Jack was riding a majestic shire horse (my favorite) and I had a stallion- beautiful, but I liked he shire horse more. We talked for a while and despite him being a genius in many fields, such as aquatic wildlife, he underestimated himself a lot. \n\n&gt;So Jack, I was wondering how I can siphon petrol from my ute to my bike, would you happen to know?\n\n&gt;Nah, sorry. I don't know many stuff about things\n\nLike that. \n\nAnyway, we kept on riding, just the two of us, and were in silence for a while. Keep in mind this is rural Australia, where pretty much every property has a dam in it. Our horses got thristy, and I suggested we stop at a dam to let them have a drink\n\n&gt;\"Nah, I'm not sure about the water. I don't know many stuff about things\"\n\nUmmm, OK?\n\nSo we kept on riding, exchanging our life stories, and we learnt about each other. I learnt that his favorite niece was 19, her name was Vanessa (He calls her Nessy). I learnt about his parents that went missing in Scotland when they went exploring a lake - remember, he's an expert at aquatic wildlife, as is the rest of his family. Oh, and I'll mention that he had a leg injury in Scotland too, so he has a permanent limp, as well as difficulties in general things like climbing stairs and whatnot. \n\nAnd then I suggested again about letting the horses have a drink from a dam\n\n&gt;\"Nahhh, I'm really not too sure mate. Like I said I don't know many stuff about things. But I know one stuff about a thing. My house is nearby and we have a clean water, so let's just head up there\n\nSo we rode on, and reached his land. \n\n&gt;Ayy, I know one more stuff about a thing!\n\n&gt;What is it, Jack?\n\n&gt;See that middle aged woman there? That's Nessy's mum!\n\nIn the distance, I hear Vanessa's mother cry out \"NESSY! GO HELP YOUR UNCLE JACK OFF THE HORSE\"\n \nOdd word choice, but Scots will be Scots. Anyway, Vanessa ran out of the house and rushed towards Jack. \n\n&gt;Uncle Jack! I'll help you off the horse but I need something in return\n\n&gt;Sure Nessy, what is it?\n\n&gt;Just need about tree fiddy\n\nThat's when I realized that Vanessa was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \n\n&gt;Goddamn it Nessy, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy\n\n\nTl;dr: Uncle jacked off a horse with the help of a 19 year old crustacean named Nessy, who, as opposed to Uncle Jack, knew some stuff about some things", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423403565", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "***Incident at Loch Ness*** (2004; d. Zak Penn)  Re-watch: A very fun mockumentary by actual Hollywood screenwriter Zak Penn, who has Werner Herzog as himself, having a documentary made about him (in the world of the movie) while Herzog sets out to make a documentary about Nessie &amp; the human need for myths &amp; monsters.  Penn plays a version of himself, who is producing Herzog's Loch Ness documentary.  Penn's Hollywood sensibilities soon clash with Herzog's integrity, as Penn surreptitiously attempts to punch up the Loch Ness shoot with some manufactured excitement.  Herzog is calmly wonderful as he deadpans the whole thing, &amp; Penn has an endearing goofiness.  The supporting cast (including actual sound mixer Russell Williams II &amp; actual cinematographer Gabriel Beristain) is lively &amp; varied, there's no shortage of funny moments during their increasingly strained shoot, including the Scottish locals taking umbrage with the crew.  \n\nThe movie juggles enough that it requires attention to keep all the pieces in order, but it avoids being confusing &amp; offers a lot of rewards.  It's a mostly harmless poke at filmmaking (not as acidic as something like *The Player*) &amp; the strange circumstances that can arise when collaboration goes awry.  It feels like something that would be talked about but never actually made, *Incident at Loch Ness* is a rare kind of fun movie.  **9 / 10**\n\n***A Single Shot*** (2013; d. David M. Rosenthal)  Sam Rockwell plays John Moon, an unemployed man recently left by his wife &amp; kid, who squeezes off the titular act, which leads him into a web of criminals, harassment, murder, &amp; general unpleasantness.  Rockwell is good in his role, most of his charm is gone &amp; replaced by a steely, quiet confidence.  He's a mostly sympathetic character that isn't sugar-coated, &amp; the world he occupies is engaging thanks to the gritty rural setting &amp; striking score by Atli Örvarsson, which adds a layer of tension the movie wouldn't have otherwise had.  The story is nothing special, the tattooed meth-heads &amp; sneering antagonists aren't up to anything dazzling or exotic (a box of money!), but the production values of the movie kept me interested the whole time.  **7 / 10**\n\n***Ed Wood*** (1994; d. Tim Burton)  Re-watch: This has turned into one of my favorite movies, I just love Burton's fantastical touch &amp; the brand of humor he deftly brings into his projects.  I'm not sure I've ever liked Johnny Depp more than in *Ed Wood*, it's up there with his performance in *Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas*, a nuanced silliness with something bigger behind it.  Maybe Depp turned into Burton's version of Bela Lugosi twenty years later.  Anyway, Martin Landau's rightly lauded performance as Lugosi keeps this movie from wandering into absurd territory, or coming across as mean-spirited.  Landau, even better than Depp, brings his character to life with some laughs &amp; a bone-aching weariness.  The relationship that forms between the two is touching, &amp; is the life preserver that keeps Depp's Wood from sinking into a cartoon character.  Respect between them develops from the less-than-glamorous professional need they have for each other, &amp; it feels genuine.  \n\nOne of the things that's so interesting about the movie is that Burton didn't have to embellish very much, Wood was really that out-there.  I feel like the black &amp; white the movie was shot in really helps keep it a little more grounded, adds a touch of highlight to the more somber notes in the movie.  I don't feel like I could ever really understand a guy like Ed Wood, but I can't think of anyone more qualified to try to explain him than Tim Burton.  **9 / 10**\n\nStarted a run of disappointments with ***The Mirror Has Two Faces*** (1996; d. Barbra Streisand), a re-watch, but one that has been a long time since I last watched.  I checked this movie out in the first place, despite having a pointedly limited taste for romantic movies, because I was really impressed with Streisand's *The Prince of Tides*, it was a sweeping drama &amp; Nick Nolte knocked it out of the park.  My only issue with that movie is that Streisand felt a little out of place, her tics were in there, but overall I still liked her.  This same problem is in *Mirror*, but it's much more pronounced.  I also checked this movie out because at the time I was a recent Jeff Bridges fan, but he doesn't have the material or character to offset Streisand's acting shortcomings like Nolte did in *Prince*, although I feel like Bridges still did an outstanding performance.\n\nI was much more critical of *The Mirror Has Two Faces* this time around, the third act pretty much ruined it.  Bridges plays Gregory Larkin, a math professor (his character is male, so math is rational &amp; logical, unlike love) while Streisand plays Rose Morgan (a professor of romantic literature, enough said).  Larkin has had it with love, &amp; puts an ad out looking for a mostly platonic relationship, where the chaos that sex &amp; passion brings can be avoided.  Rose is introduced as, pretty much literally, \"the bridesmaid but never the bride\"; attempts to make her seem sympathetic (she doesn't wear makeup, she wears mostly loose black clothing, has dowdy hair &amp; unflattering eyeglasses, &amp; that nose! oy!) &amp; kind of mousy are derailed as she works her standing-room-only lecture hall, charming the attentive &amp; enthusiastic students.  She talks of romantic literature &amp; contrasts it to modern ideas of romance, &amp; beams with confidence.  However, we're supposed to believe that Rose can't get a date from anyone but the schmuckiest of schmucks.  This is all highlighted by Lauren Bacall, as Rose's overbearing mother, whom Rose lives with.  They take shots at each other, including Rose's appetite for fatty foods (Streisand's tics seem to include thinking she could possibly be perceived as fat); Rose's mother is a former beauty, &amp; Rose's sister is a current one (who uses it all wrong).  Rose is the very definition of a spinster, with a heckling crowd to constantly remind her.\n\nRose is tricked into answering Gregory's ad, &amp; it works, sort of.  Rose agrees to go along with Gregory's platonic, respectful idea of a relationship, which leads to marriage (from a secular authority, in a brief, completely unromantic setting).  Doubt grows within Rose, &amp; she takes action, which leads to the marriage's first big fight.  All in all, I was still managing to mostly enjoy the movie, despite the dated tropes &amp; bad jokes.   I didn't love it, but it had some interesting ideas.  During the first act, when it's over-emphasized that Rose is un-glamorous, I tried to remember if there was a big \"makeover\" montage / scene later, &amp; I couldn't remember, but I feared it may have been coming.  The third act indeed goes full-on into that, much of the interesting ideas that had been established about attraction &amp; love are obliterated as Rose, angry at &amp; ignoring her husband, jumps into a montage wherein she eats celery while on an exercise machine at the gym, decides to start wearing copious amounts of makeup, updates her wardrobe so that she wears 4\" heels &amp; cocktail dresses to her teaching job (\"Yes, I have breasts! But you can't write a paper on them.\"), &amp; has her hair transformed into a mid-90s idea of great hair.  The movie's message got totally mixed for me, as full endorsement of Hollywood ideas of love (including manipulative, surging romantic music) &amp; surface-beauty are fully embraced.  Rose uses her newfound \"power\" to trick two men into a romantic setting, only to dismiss them with a light smirk.  The production values on this movie are solid, &amp; it feels busy in a mostly good way, but I can't feel anything but disappointment with a movie that had promise for most of its time, &amp; takes such a jarringly shallow turn.  **4 / 10**\n\nThe disappointment continued with ***Bad Country*** (2014; d. Chris Brinker, who I found out after watching was involved with *The Boondock Saints*, not a good association for me), a 1970s, Louisiana-set cops vs. criminal conspiracy action-drama.  It starts off okay, if not particularly promising, as Willem Dafoe, as wiry &amp; crackling with energy as ever, establishes himself as a county sheriff sniffing around a fence for stolen precious stones.  He makes the bust, &amp; spends the next 10 minutes announcing the clumsy script while running around telling everyone who'll listen that \"there's more\", meaning he suspects the guys with the stones were at the bottom of a chain of criminals.  He gets crazy in an interrogation room, really crazy, &amp; gets enough to move on to the next set of targets.\n\nThere's enough shaggy, unkempt hair, tattoos, &amp; zany facial hair creations to fuel a half-dozen other movies as Dafoe's character's prominence is displaced when he arrests &amp; turns Jesse Weiland, a swastika-tattoed, would-be Max Cady played by puppy-dog eyed Matt Dillon.  There's a notable decline in the movie's appeal &amp; functionality as Dillon takes over.  Jesse has a beautiful wife &amp; newborn kid, whom he dotes over when he's not engaged in neo-nazi activities.  Dillon never really comes across as dangerous or even interesting, despite the movie's attempt at introducing him as a Very Dangerous Man.

Heart disease seemed rare.  The lead author, George Mann, did not conclude animal foods are somehow protective against heart disease back then, but some of today's primitive dieters will say just that.\n\nMann later examined the bodies of Masai men at autopsy.  He observed that although they did not develop lesions that might lead to heart attacks, he did note that their arteries were as thick and hardened as those of old men in the United States.  By this time he thought what saved the Masai from heart attacks was the larger diameters of their blood vessels, perhaps due to exercise.\"\n\nAnd finally, read this: [Logic 101: Why The Resistant Starch And Gut Biome Revolution Means Doom For VLC/Keto](http://freetheanimal.com/2014/08/resistant-revolution-vlcketo.html)\n\nSo that's a small fraction of what I've read about this. My thoughts are that a relatively new area of study has popped into existence recently and holds the promise of explaining everything. We CANNOT go back and duplicate the gut conditions of the Paleolithic era. I am offering you - with resistant starches and soluble fiber - a way that works here and now to get your lab number back to ideal. Even if you have already (just recently) become diabetic. Even if you have shitty genes (like me with apoE4). Even if you are 70 yrs of age. Even without meds. \n\nPerhaps the high protein high fat diets work for some phenotypes. That's fine. I strongly believe they won't work for all, for sure not the 25% of us who are positive for apoE4. \n\nIt may be that other diets can be put together that will also give you sterling lab values. But to ignore it if you have questionable labs is in my eyes, sheer folly.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, though, even if you have great labs, they don't check for free fatty acids, which apparently is as destructive to beta cells (and other body parts) as is glucose. Glucose is really easy to monitor.

{"body": "EDIT: Be warned this post is long in words but very brief in information, and probably still not super helpful because I can't teach you 4 semester's worth of class in one reddit post but I will try!!!!\n\nOkay, let's start with the basic history of Western art (which I'm paring this down a lot, my textbook called \"Art: a brief history\" is 622 pages long in total. Keep in mind that I am cutting out a lot of the details and anyone who actually knows about this will find this simplifies things too much.\n\nTo get early art history I learned the acronym PNMEGR - Please neuter my easy going rottweiler.\n\nThis stands for:\n\n* Paleolithic\n\n* Neolithic\n\n* Mesopotamian\n\n* Egyptian\n\n* Greco\n\n* Roman\n\nThe paleolithic covers things like cave paintings, for a very basic descriptor. Flat, 2-dimensional drawings that are often stick figures with erections and lots of horses and cows and stuff. [Here's one of the oldest known sculptures from the paleolithic era](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Venus_von_Willendorf_01.jpg)\n\nThe neolithic period doesn't differ greatly from the paleolithic but there are more architectural elements and it's more in the basic structure and form of the architecture that we see some mild changes. Even so, [sculptures became more representational.](http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/prehistoricart/images/Man-and-Woman-from-Cernavoda-Romania-c4000BC.jpg) and the tooling a little bit more refined. You can see here some arms and faces instead of just a basic figure.\n\nMesopotamian art continues the trend of representation. They also begin to do relief sculptures.](https://klimtlover.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/presentation-of-offerings-to-inanna.jpg). [Votive or prayer statues](http://www.h-net.org/~fisher/hst205/VotiveStatues.JPG) show even greater understanding of human anatomy, everything is placed somewhat correctly and we see some representation of clothing for the first time. There are now well understood rules for representation such as the most important person has the largest scale and the closest image to the top of the artwork is the most important.\n\nEgyptian art followed with the relief sculptures again but they also [depict real people with idealized anatomy.](http://travel-photos.curiouscatblog.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/statue_king_mankaure_egypt.jpg). The figures are still stiff but there is some clearly defined structure to them. Interestingly this rule of idealized form was done away with for a short time and a more realistic sculpture of [Akhenaten](http://www.crystalinks.com/akhnatontall.gif) exists that's much more alike to his real appearance. Of course there were a lot of religious ties between the sculptures and their purpose so this didn't last long. The late Egyptian art also shows some cross cultural flow from ancient Greece.\n\nGreek and Roman art are a little different from one another. The Greeks focused on the perfect form - largely young males, which by society's standards were the ideal humans. The biggest thing in sculpture that the Greeks worked out was the idea of contrappasto - [the idea that the hips do not sit squarely in space](https://share.ehs.uen.org/sites/default/files/images/greek_1.img_assist_custom.jpg). Suddenly dynamic sculptures came to be made. The Greeks did do some painting but there was a large emphasis on sculpture. Again relief sculptures were everywhere. The subject matter for the Greeks were often gods, goddesses and other mythical figures. The Romans took what they liked about Greek work but the sculptures for ancient Rome were propaganda - Roman sculptures depicted political leaders and other important real-life figures. Also... they did not enjoy nudes so much, they kept their clothes on. Funnily enough the Romans made copies of the original Greek statues but also during their conquest they melted down many of the bronze originals.\n\nEarly Christian art also started in ancient Rome and in fact the idea of Christ as shepherd was the most frequent artistic choice because a shepherd boy was typical Roman statuary. There's lots of interesting things about Jesus in art over time but I'll skip that.\n\nI'm going to skip ahead a bit because I find early Christian art somewhat boring. Basically the renaissance happened when people started rediscovering \"the ancients\" and they mistakenly lumped ancient Greece and Rome into one culture (they kind of flipped when they found out that Greece was really pro-gay, since it was a very Catholic dominated time). They thought the ancient tales and morality stories were the coolest. Artists wanted to perfect their own versions of Greek statues and paintings followed suit as well. The subject matter for art was always about the sublime. Seriously, art was just all about realistic depictions of historical and biblical events. These super grand things. It stayed that way for a really long time. And to be honest while they're beautifully rendered works I find them massively uninteresting. They figured out how perspective lines work and depicting the world as it exists in space was now possible.\n\nSlowly the sense of highly realistically rendered depictions of subject matter faded. [This one by Ingres is one of my favourites](http://www.artble.com/imgs/4/7/e/114888/la_grande_odalisque.jpg) because it looks like it makes anatomical sense but if you examine closer she's got what seems to be a few extra vertebrae (a huge criticism of the time). The art world flipped out at how wrong it was.\n\nSlowly the grandiose nature of art faded away to \"realism\" or a sense of the every day and mundane. At this time one of my other famous artists caused a huge upset but not depicting space properly. [Courbet released this \"monstrosity\" at the salon](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Gustave_Courbet_-_A_Burial_at_Ornans_-_Google_Art_Project_2.jpg) - the current place for art exhibition. Which is a change I forgot to mention - it used to be commissioners and buyers from at least as far back as ancient Greece and art was for public display. The salon is where things get interesting because everyone's art goes up in a big mess on the wall and artists basically have a pissing contest. At the time it was about who obeyed the rules but slowly it became about breaking them. \"A Burial at Ornans\" was displayed but also put away in a corner. Too bad guys, we still know who he is. Realism was about showing everyday people in everyday situations too, lots of the paintings display commoners at work. Which was really just rich artist's admiring being poor as if it were something cool.\n\nImpressionism eventually came about and it was all about light quality and capturing the feel of a space rather than a more literal interpretation of the image. You get painters like Renoir, Morisot, Cassatt, and so many more. This time in art history was all about going out and having experiences. Seriously, this sounds so much like rich people problems. Impressionism also continued to reject the visual representation of depth of field.\n\nEarly modernism really didn't know what it was doing. You get artists like [Matisse](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/a/a7/20100414201035!Matissedance.jpg) and company doing what look to us today like drawings from a kid's book. They're brightly coloured and incredibly flat. The salon still existed but artists were pushing against it. Basically the whole idea of modern art is born out of \"who the hell are you to tell me what art is?\" which is kind of badass to me.\n\nCubism and Picasso are important because it was the idea of flattening 3D forms into multiple dimensions on a flat surface. Picasso said [why look at only one side of something](http://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/pablo-picasso/glass-and-bottle-of-suze-1912.jpg). I hate the man's work but really respect his \"fuck you\" attitude. \n\nDadaism was really just... weird. Ball's perfomance of a piece called \"Reciting the Sound Poem, 'Karawane'\" had him dress up like... well [like this](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/hael0002/alternativemedia5413/karawane-hugo-ball.jpg) and recite a poem. There was no meaning, that was the point of the movement. Again, a real \"fuck you, I make art the way I want to\" move. \n\nMy absolute favourite work from this time was Marcel Duchamp's submission to the American society of independent artists. The man basically put a urinal on its side, signed it R. Mutt, and expressed his opinion about the art society that way. When it was refused he quit the society.\n\nBasically art at this point branches off into tons of directions. People experimenting just on the idea of colour or shape or repetition, others focusing on representation of real life in the (at the time) current world. You get surrealism and the works of Dali (which was an attempt at accessing his inner subconscious - the man worked on really small paintings.\n\nAbstract expressionism specifically was born out of WWII. There was action painting (well represented by Pollock - the infamous splatter painter) and colour field painting (Newman being one of those). These artist's were usually American and where surrealists bought into Freud the abstract expressionists bought into Carl Young. The art was an attempt to access a shared universal consciousness or human experience - something that you can't do once you start depicting a real object. The technical aspects were the idea of exploring qualities such as how the paint met the canvas and a direct acknowledgement of the materials used instead of using them as a representational tool. The use of colour fields and splatter paints and movement of the brush were intended to incite something less than tangible. Which as one other user put, Onement IV is a rather peaceful image. Most abstract expressionists also worked on incredibly large scales compared to most artists. \n\nTL;DR: art is about a lot more than making something pretty.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423437080", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

I'm not going to hammer on all the gradeschool grammar errors, but consider a writing refresher. \n \n&gt;Throughout history great powers have risen and fallen, so it is not unthinkable that the U.S. could also become a lesser power.

Lazy.\n\n&gt;Well the times have changed \n\n[CITATION NEEDED] \n\n&gt;the U.S. is not Argentina or the USSR and our methods of recovering in the past is no longer viable, essentially via cheap oil and/or deficit spending (including through war).\n\nWhy not?\n\n&gt;The general population has lost basic survival knowledge and skills since the Great Depression.\n\n[CITATION NEEDED] \n\n&gt;Right now there are well over 300 million people in the U.S. Less that one percent are involved in farming (about two percent live on farms) and there are only about two million farms. In 1935 there were about 6.8 million farms for a population of 127 million. Currently over 80 percent of Americans live in urban areas. Almost all Americans rely on just-in-time delivery for most of what they consume, and most aren’t even aware of that. Most don’t keep deep pantries or significant emergency supplies. \n\n[CITATION NEEDED] \n\n&gt;There are a lot of lesser known issues in play related to farming. I won’t go into detail \n\nThen don't bring it up, and expect everyone to take your word for it. \"There are a bunch of problems with farming, but I won't say what they are, but they totally exist...\"\n\n&gt; finical...fee the pain\n\nSeriously, spellcheck is free. \n \nEnd of Pt I\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423446761", "subreddit": "Survivalist", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's a cool concept that didn't get enough exploration that would've made a truly great movie. I also fault the movie for focusing too much on fashion - even the ghetto people had pretty impeccable fashion senses. \n\nI would start out with the protagonist as a kid in the ghetto. He has a time wallet since he's not allowed to spend money of his own. His mom gives him a few minutes every week to spend, and he guards it closely. Candy, games, all that are what he spends his allowance on. \n\nThen the first real tragedy happens, but it's totally palatable. He gets robbed on his way to get groceries. His wallet gets cleared. He finds out what it's like to truly have nothing and his family fears for their lives as those minutes/hours would have helped prolong their lives. \n\nFlash forward to him as a teen. A bit hardened, we see he has a tough side and a soft side. He thwarts would-be muggers with violence, even robbing them of their wallets, but then he donates all his \"winnings\" to the poor, homeless guys who have hours left.\n\n***\n\nAs an adult, he's living a slightly more stable, comfortable life, with a job that gets him by. He hasn't had to worry much about violence. He's watching commercials promoting war, and even seeing how military service comes with a 3-year signup bonus (currency year). He declines as he's carefully calculating what it would take for him to finish school, as he's only a few months from graduating. \n\nHe's mugged once again, but as he did as a teen, resists the attacker, and learns that the guy is just a scared gang member. His compassion and interest leaves him giving the mugger his wallet and even a few hours of his own life. In return, he wants to learn more about the criminal organization he works for. \n\nHe discovers that it's huge. Comprised mainly of ex-military men who took their bonuses and went AWOL, they crave knowledge and leadership, and the leadership is comprised of a surprisingly humble few. Driven by their ideals, their hearts are in the right place, but their methods seem a bit out of the ordinary and ethically questionable.\n\nHe infiltrates the organization as they welcome him with open arms due to his education and willingness to fight. As he learns more, he comes to the realization that he doesn't want to bring them down, but he wants to let them thrive - they're there to take down the system, and unfortunately, they have to crack a few ghetto eggs in order to keep things going. The daily wallet jobs are simply ways to keep the foot soldiers alive, barely ahead so they can continue to hoard centuries in the coffers of the organization.\n\nThe organization has some rules: Never steal anyone's life money - only their wallets. The exceptions exist within the rich sectors of society. It's riskier to rob them, but they \"deserve it.\" It's an unfortunate code of ethics, but they stand by it. \n\nJT learns more, and serves his purpose as a technician. His smarts, experience, and college training has brought him close to becoming a \"Lazarus\" of sorts, and he theorizes he can develop a way to provide eternal life. With eternal life, they can abolish the system as life credits would become useless. \n\nHe's met with internal opposition. Skilled robbers earn a 20% cut on what they steal, so the good ones don't want him destroying their new way of life - they're decades rich, and they live lavishly as a result. Even though they oppose the system, it's worked for them. They vow to take him out. \n\nIn order to finish the machine, the algorithm needs more data. He needs a living \"millennium\" man - someone with so much life that it's ridiculous. He figures that the data contained within him can finish the machine. If he calculates the algorithm wrong, the machine will kill. If it's right, it's eternal life. The organization demands that he test the machine on himself, so being correct is an absolute must.\n\nHe goes on a mission to kidnap the richest man in the world, the only \"millennium\" man. It's risky and contains a ton of action, casualties, and the works. Among the \"seal team 6\" is a member of the \"high rollers\" subgang who wants this mission to either fail so he can continue living his life, or succeed so he can take all the millenium man's money.\n\nFinally, the millennium man is captured and brought to JT's lab. As they collect the data, the dissenting criminals attack, hungry for this man's years. A struggle ensues, and credits are transferred back and forth. JT cannot kill anyone at this point because those credits would be forever lost, ruining the experiment. He has to coax the men into giving up their credits. They eventually agree, and JT surmises they they only need to transfer back a certain amount back into the millennium man. \n\n\"How much do you need?\" they ask, reluctantly agreeing.\"\n\n\"I need about tree-fiddy\" JT responds. \n\nIt's at this point that the millennium man looks up and sees that he's not in a lab with a Justin Timberlake scientist, but he's in a jungle with a 100-foot crustacean from the paleozoic era in front of him. \n\n\"Goddamnit!

Depends on how he acquired the magic, if it is through a high intelligence then possibly more impressive but Albert Einstein developed theories that massively impacted the way in which a lot of things were thought about and are still thought about, if the magicians abilities were innate I would find Albert far more impressive.\n\n2. I wouldn't be able to do something that horrific without having a personal relationship with the people I'm saving, if it was my family I might go ahead with it but strangers suffering is so abstract from me that I wouldn't feel comfortable killing a horse to save them.\n\n3. I'd choose the turtle, I think they make cool pets and keeping it alive wouldn't be that much of an issue, although I haven't researched turtle upkeep and if this is a full on mammoth of a turtle who needs a humongous aquarium tank then I might have to deal with Hitler on my mantle piece. \n\n4. I think it would be fantastic to see a gorilla play but the safety hazards for other players would be too great, people die or are seriously injured in sports without malicious intentions behind the action, if I could somehow make a full team of gorillas then that would be awesome.\n\n5. I'm a firm believer in the idea of a soul mate so for me to have sacrifice listening to everything being performed by Alice in Chains that's a small bargain for the level of suffering my soul mate would have to deal with.\n\n6. I can deal without watching my dreams, the awkwardness from watching sexual or just generally embarrassing ones that would ruin relationships with people I love is too much of a con.\n\n7. Loch Ness Monster is infinitely more interesting than Sasquatch or a medical condition the president may recover from.\n\n8. I'm not familiar with the Dark Crystal but this quirk does seem substantial, depending on how bad trying to decipher deep philosophies from the Dark Crystal and referencing it often is I might have pass on marriage.\n\n9. Due to only middling reviews I'm not quite sure I can go ahead with it being a straight man, sexual preference is huge and risking a change in lifestyle just because of 1 book that is only successful commercially.\n\n10. Have to pass with not being familiar with either of these.\n\n11. Exit the cinema and phone someone who would be able to tell me if she's OK, if this isn't an option then I would leave the cinema\nand find out if she was OK.\n\n12. I'd give him £50, I'm fairly happy with how I look and wouldn't place a large amount of money into making myself more attractive. \n\n13. I'd ignore the one night stands and just talk a little about my time with the more serious lovers and what I've been doing with myself, I imagine it being a fun and terrifying experience at the same time.\n\n14. The cats might be insulted but personally as a big fan of lasagne I can't see them being that insulted.\n\n15. I'd take out the largest loan I could secure and go to all the places I've wanted to go to and haven't seen yet. I'd make sure that week will be memorable for myself and the people I spend it with, I'd like to go out with a bang.\n\n16. No I would try to fight having a life not revolving around CFL for as long as I possibly can before destiny inevitably makes obsessed with it.\n\n17. The man with no past would be more fear inducing without any background information on the other guy's past, he has no experiences making him unpredictable. Someone who has nothing to relate to regarding appropriate action seems scary.\n\n18. Europe would be have more impact on my like than the moon, sure it'd be nice but you wouldn't be sharing it with anyone. It's only 10 minutes, I imagine you can't photograph or explore very long in 10 minutes. Whereas Europe for a whole year would be a life changing experience, the £2000 a month would make money troubles not an issue so you get to concentrate on having the best time you possibly can for a year. I've personally always wanted to travel more around Europe, I love France, Italy, Czech Republic and Cyprus but there are still so many place I want to go, out of all scenarios this one currently appeals to me the most.\n\n19. I'd kick them 100%, socially I'd be telling myself not to but it's their whole life ahead of them, regardless if it's a best friend of acquaintance.\n\n20. I'd personally rather see the interviews, it will show you a lot more about the type of person you are and how you have impacted others compared to a Hollywood blockbuster. \n\n21. Lost it at 20, I'm honestly not majorly fussed about the age, if in my new life as a 5 year old I find someone I want to have sex with who also wants to have sex with me at 16 I would go through with it but if I end up having it at 20 again I can't see an issue for me. I don't think there is a perfect age and can't really answer this question. I'd draw the line at anything below 14 though.\n\n22. I'd have less issue with the money, emotional damage from cheating is a lot more severe than people thinking unpleasant things about you.\n\n23. Wow was looking forward to the last one and it's someone I know nothing about, I don't think I would be OK with this, despite believing that some stuff is predetermined I would hate the idea that everything is scripted.\n\nInteresting set of question for sure, what are your views about them?

{"body": "Well, that's the thing.  People think that posting a sign constitutes a contract.  My other post kind of skirted the issue, taking it as true *for the sake of argument*.  But things like \"I get to punch you in the face if you read this sign\" or \"You owe me five dollars just for reading this sign\" are not going to be held as enforceable by any court.\n\nAside from being unconscionable terms, a sign like that probably wouldn't meet the requirements of an adhesion contract.  One of the big requirements is that the contract has a \"take-it-or-leave-it\" quality to it: the terms have to be tied to an *action* that clearly indicates acceptance of the terms, *with no opportunity for negotiation*.  For instance, checking a box and clicking \"I accept\" on a click-wrap license, or accepting a ticket from a vending machine and parking in a garage.  In your case, there's no clear indication that I accepted your terms, and I'm certainly happy to haggle with you over the value of reading your comment (maybe we can compromise for about... tree fiddy?).\n\nPlus, courts tend to treat adhesion contracts with high suspicion: due to the nature of adhesion contracts, the transactions usually aren't well-documented, and proving that the terms were clearly understood by both parties can be nearly impossible (compare a one-click \"I agree\" software license with the typical \"Initial in 50 different places, sign and date each page where it says 'I understand', and then we'll move on to the NEXT document\" process in a real estate transaction).  That means that terms that aren't spelled out VERY clearly and displayed in a manner nearly IMPOSSIBLE to miss stand a *very* real chance of being tossed. The tendency in courts is to interpret adhesion contracts *against* the person offering the contract-- in the case at hand, against the orchard.\n\nWhile it's not *impossible* for signs to relate contract terms that people can take or leave (but not just by reading the sign!), enforcing such a contract is generally going to be an uphill battle for the sign-poster.\n\nSo, yeah-- [signs aren't magical](http://imgur.com/gallery/mSHi8).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423520690", "subreddit": "AmIFreeToGo", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

I swiped right and thought nothing of it.\n\nNext day, I got the Tinder message.\n\nWe went to this Japanese tapas bar downtown called Ebisu. Her husband allegedly hit her (he was a teacher too), and they divorced quietly so the husband didn't lose his job. I had Mr. L for Chem in high school, so this bothered me a lot.\n\nAnyway, for all you fucking teenagers who want to know, no, I didn't have sex with her that night, but I did after the next date. We ended up dating for a few months since I went to an in-state school. All good things have to come to an end though.\n\nMr. L came to the house one day while I was there, and threatened to beat the shit out of me. He eventually left, but Ms. N (since she went back to her maiden name) started crying. She was being sued by her ex for some stupid claim, but she didn't have the money to fight it. I asked her if I could do anything to help. She said, yeah you could help with the attorney fees. I didn't have much money, but I was willing to do anything for her. \"How much?\" I asked. She hugged me close and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well, it was about that time that I realized that she was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I yelled \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\"\n\nWe went our separate ways after that, and it truly makes me sad. I thought that she was a different person, but I guess I couldn't keep her from being who she truly was.

I've had this hidden ability, it's not that I try at it, but it's just that I can do it without thinking. Whether it's me insulting or starting an argument that is actually true and is not actually needed. Some call it trolling, but I find it's an easy art when you've mastered it. Now, my skills of trolling are so good, that I can. \n\nDo you know why insults are insulting? Because the person who receives the insult wants it to be insulting, if it's meant to be insulting they're going to take it as an insult. Now If I was to say that's just a word, a word with a definition, it's got nothing to do with me. But it was directed to me, so I could say fuck you back, or I could just walk away. What step would you take? You'd probably say fuck you back, but that would be the right thing to do back would it? If you just ignored it, you wouldn't have to worry about arguing or having a fight? Humans go off impulses, that's why you can't stay away from what you love. And a joke is comedy and comedy is an impulse of enjoying yourself. So when you take that impulse and ignore the bad side of it and take it as sarcasm, you're only being human and that's human nature. A true weakness of humans is impulses, doing what you like and not doing what's right, that's why people should value morals a lot more. \n\ntl;dr: I stole the tree fiddy from band camp. \n\nNow you're calling this a tirade? This is a brigade of clowns trying to make sense of their compelling lives. And while you can \"K\" me, that's only going to solve your own loss. What the fuck did you just read? You read everything you could never understand. Why would I type all this? I did it so I could laugh. Did you just \"Baaaaah\" me? That's unacceptable! Why would I need a chill pill? I'm already too chill as it is. /u/tyo-translate? C'mon, you got to have a better example than that. Oh shit, you summoned him. Oh wait a second, it translates my perfect words into nonsense. Now it appears as it has spammed two comments. I guess jayboyevo can't read. [Woof](http://i.imgur.com/51oBhlo.gif).\n\nIntelligence is only measured with your lack of observation. \n\nLet me guess what people will keep on saying: \"This is so weird\" \"You're making no sense\" \"Downvoted because too many memes\" \"You got totally irrelevant\" \"Why would you do this to a Canadian\" \nOh wait, those are much more original than the comments already said, I'm sorry for giving you guys ideas.  \n\nSo a DarqWolff reference and a guy with the Navy Seal copy and pasta is pretty cool, I mean, I never thought someone from the Navy Seals would even bother to even go on Reddit! I'd bet $50 that you're wasting your time even reading this bullshit. Can't believe that guy would go through all his posts just to find the proper context, now that's funny. Autistic gold? :) Of course Mike_trollzowski, you don't care because you don't know how to care. Why is that guy still going with the tyo-translate thing? C'mon. \n\nLol. \n\nShout out to the guys downvoting all my past comments. ;)\nAlso, shout out to free speech.\n\nAt least you guys know how to take a joke about a joke.

For years he pranced about as a family friendly Biologist eager to answer the internets most inane questions. \"What's a goose?\" \"Why does my cat hide from me?\" \"Can a Praying Mantis masturbate?\" Dan answered it all with patience and precision. Never disappointing the people of the internet, and slowly but surely he developed a cult like following.  \n\nLike many great men before him Dan's time at the top was only temporary. He would eventually fall, and fall hard. You see, Dan specialized in crows. The intelligent, crafty animals often under-appreciated on Earth. He would defend this species with vigor when the trolls of the world labeled them Jackdaws. A foul name. He went as far as creating multiple alias's to raise awareness. His persistence was met with criticism, and eventually the ultimate punishment. Exile. Dan was gone forever with only a  few loyal followers left to spread his story, his word, his unidan. There was however, in a parallel universe, a tiny civilization that took notice.  \n\nI will never forget my last day on Earth. Looking up into the night sky and waiting as a flock of loch ness monsters (approximately 350 of them) swooped in to rescue us. It was Earth's final days and humanity was not yet advanced enough to leave. But in this world lived a coexisting species of lochness and crow - side by side. They had been observing Earth since the dawn of Reddit. Here Jackdaw was a derogatory term for crow. Kinda like Nig. They had taken notice of Dan's activism against the use of \"Jackdaw\" and decided to rescue him and his followers from the impending doom on earth. Straddling a giant crow I made sure my fedora was on tight as we departed Earth's atmosphere. Taking one last look at the planet I called home for so long, I smiled to myself. Here I was with Unidan.

Most of us aren't saying that no definitions of a god *could* exist, we're saying that there is no reason to believe that any do.  And you can substitute a god with invisible pink unicorns, fairies, bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, or any entity your imagination can conjure up.  \n\nWhy aren't you championing the case for invisible boggarts named Steve existing simply because they do?  The reason is because you're trying to justify a belief that has no justification.  The evidence pointing to a deity existing is **exactly the same** as that for invisible boggarts named Steve.  Namely no evidence at all.  **Anything** could be asserted to exist \"just because it does\", including gods that sodomize your gods, gods that only grant salvation to methane worms from Betelgeuse IV, gods that hate everything else, gods that dictate that the afterlife will be accompanied by continuous looping of John Tesh music while dancing ballet, Cthonic astral worms that devour gods, and the list goes on infinitely.

Radin compiled a [nice page](http://deanradin.com/evidence/evidence.htm) full of excellent studies. You can find those in there.\n\n&gt;I found not a single piece of good evidence for any kind of psychokinesis, clairvoyance or telepathy, nor for aliens, near death experiences or Bigfoot.\n\nI wonder what you consider to be good evidence. Statistically significant results on pk, cv, tp is what we are looking for and have. Aliens, mostly collaborated eye witness reports, favourably with empirical evidence for back up. Which is not that hard to find with some google-fu. Bigfoot, nessie, or any cryptoid same thing needed although not always available. In NDE the AWARE study did its job perfectly well. \n\nIf you set the bar so high, you can never trust any research from any scientific institution ever. Let me be clear, there is no special standard for any of this needed. Don't give me the 'extra-ordinary claims require extra-ordinary evidence' line because it is the worst argument ever. By any normal standard of science most of the papers in the PSI fields are at the top, statistically as well as methodologically. A century of extreme skepticism has honed this field to produce papers of a very high standard that you hardly find anywhere else.\n\nRaising the bar is defending your own views, that's a psychological weakness that helps you believe in your worldview. But you of course know about these psychological flaws, you learned all about it! Except of course for this specific one about moving goalposts. You should try applying your knowledge to yourself instead of me.\n\n&gt;More than that, I began to learn the psychological weaknesses we have that helps us believe all this nonsense despite the lack of evidence for any of the examples you mentioned.\n\nThis works both ways, it applies equally to standard ideas as it does to non standard ideas. It's a silly sceptics tactic to imply that this is true for everybody else but themselves. Have you fallen for this trap? It sounds like it, you talk the talk, you walk the walk...\n\nStudies speak for themselves, I'm not going to waste a lot of time with somebody who thinks that I'm not aware of my psychological shortcomings. Please don't go that route. Someone somewhere will always call bullshit on whatever topic, whatever the evidence, however logical, reasoned, mathematically derived, that is simply always the case. Plus if you want, you can find somebody with a Ph.D. say it for you in most cases. I take the research and researchers into psi phenomenon equally as serious as any other field of science, based on the state of the journals and papers, not on the basis of subject.

{"body": "It's an interesting story, actually. So me and my wife were out hiking in the woods one fine afternoon enjoying the beauty of nature. Well we turned a corner around a large boulder, and no more than a few seconds later a giant brown bear leaped out onto the path in front of us. We stood in petrified silence for the longest time, with the bear growling and hissing at us, its fur standing straight up, quivering with pure hatred and rage, slowly advancing toward us. Finally, my wife couldn't take it anymore and let out a short but shrill scream. The bear's golden eyes flared with rage and it leaped at her and started mauling her with its massive, sharp claws. I was knocked back to the ground and watched in horror as my wife screamed and begged for my help, but I did not know what to do. Finally, I grabbed a fairly large rock sitting beside me and threw it at the bear with all the energy I had in me. It hit the bear square in the nose, and it turned it's massive head toward me and bared its teeth. \"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT FROM US?\" I screamed at the top of my lungs, but as I stared at my impending doom I realized the utter futility of those words. I was going to die, of this I was dead certain. Then the bear bent down toward me, opened its mouth, and said \"I just need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time that I realized this \"bear\" was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423685193", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My cousin had a dog similar to this.  I loved my cousin (not like in Alabama).  He was my best friend.  His dog was his best friend.  His parent's got him his dog when he was 10 and he would play with him every day.  He had him since a puppy.  My cousin named him Frank. I don't know why a 10 year old would name a dog Frank but that was his name.  \n\nWell, one day My cousin was taking Frank for a walk.  It was a Thursday I think (it was many years ago so I can't remember exactly), but I won't ever forget what happened.  As my cousin was walking Frank, Frank got loose and ran into the neighbors yard.  The neighbor had an animal they kept behind a fence but I guess Frank found a way in.  My cousin started crying (I think we were around 12 at the time) and I tried to calm him down saying that Frank would be OK.  I really didn't know to be honest how it would turn out but I had to calm him down. \n\nWe went around to the front of the neighbors house and saw they weren't there so we went around back and looked over the fence.  No frank.  Now, the neighbors had a large pond on their property so we thought that perhaps Frank went for a swim (we were 12).  So we hop the fence and run over to the pond to see what's going on.  We didn't see Frank anywhere near the pond.  We ran up to the house on the property and checked all around but still nothing.  Then we heard the noise... like a shallow bark under water..  We ran as fast as we could back to the pond and we saw Frank.  He was going in and out of the water near the middle of the pond!  My cousin ran in to save him and as I tried to help, I yelled, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about Tree Fiddy\", he yelled back.

{"body": "\"Damn, I can't believe I missed the bus again.\"\n\nI kicked a rock as I began my 5 mile trudge across the city back to my apartment. This bus was never early, of course it has to be on a night like this.\n\n\"Sure hope it doesn't rain.\" I thought to myself, glancing up.\n\nThe sky was a swirl for black and gray. Though it was shrouded by cloud cover, I could still see the glow of the full moon behind the coming storm. A gust of cold autumn wind forced me to pull my jacket's zipper all the way up. A low rumble of thunder in the far distance made me pick up the pace as I turned my begrudged walking into more of a jog.\n\nThe howling wind was strong enough to kick around the detritus scattered along the sidewalk. As I made my way down the narrow side-road, neither too fast or too slow, I noticed a newspaper smack against a pole I had just passed. I hesitantly stopped. Backtracking just a few steps I looked to see the headline of the paper in full view:\n\n    \"SERIAL KILLER ESCAPES ASYLUM\"\n\n\"Well that's not spooky.\" I thought to myself. \"I think I'll just call a cab, just to be safe.\"\n\nOf course my phone was dead, what a perfect night. The wind began to die down and I decided I had stopped for long enough and continued on my trek.\n\nThe streets were unusually empty tonight. They weren't usually brimming with people at 10 pm, but there were usually a couple of people walking around. I guess with a killer on the loose that makes sen- wait am I in a horror movie? I mean the atmosphere is just right for it, and the way my inner monologue is moving certainly gives in the feel of one.\n\n\"That's ridiculous,\" I reasoned, \"just because a psycho's on the run and I'm walking home alone late at night doesn't mean I've been transported into fiction.\"\n\nThe wind began to pick up again, just slightly. The windchimes on the porches of all the houses played their dissonant symphonies as I walked past them, deep in thought. The thunder that was once only a distant reminder of the storm was edging ever closer, with the claps of light getting closer together with each passing minute. It was then I noticed something I'd never seen on this street before.\n\nAcross the street there was a lone phonebooth. The fluorescent light within it flickered meekly, and the door creaked open and shut as the wind passed over it.\n\n\"Oh perfect, I'll just call a cab and-\"\n\n*Wait.*\n\nIf this *was* a horror film, and I'm not saying it is, but if it *was*, that was where I'd die. I was still a few miles from home but to ease my mind I'd rather not deal with evil-looking telephones. I hurried past it and continued my journey.\n\nA few minutes pass as I walked hurriedly towards my home. The dark sky above me was now spitting drops of rain, and I was sure a deluge would be soon to follow.\n\n\"Of course I didn't bring my umbrella to work. 'Oh I'll be on the bus, who cares if it rains?'\" I thought. I'd reached the point of self-mockery, the kind of thing a person does before they get slashed.\n\n\"I just needed to go two blocks down, take a right, and then another right. I could get there so much sooner if this damned building wasn't here-\" and that's when I spotted it.\n\nAn alleyway I'd never seen before. Beyond it I could see the light of my building's front step, but between it and I there was only darkness.\n\n\"Perfect!\" I smiled as I took a step into the alleyway before stopping myself, \"Wait, if creepy phonebooths are out then this is like, 10 times worse.\"\n\nI stepped out and continued the long way around. As I predicted the rain was only getting worse, and by the time I reached my front step I was soaked from head to toe. I fumbled for my keys, barely managing to get them into the lock without dropping them, and with a turn of the handle I was in. I flicked the lightswitch on but nothing. I flicked it on and off a few time to no avail. Had my power gone out? Everyone else's lights were on as I passed them. A flash of lightning illuminated the hall in front of me for an instant, and to my horror I saw that I was not alone.\n\nThough it was only for a second, I saw a massive shadow no more than 10 feet away from me. I was frozen in fear. I could only listen in terror as I heard the sound of wet boots move ever closer to me. I could feel this person just a few inches from my body, their haggard breaths beat against my shoulder as they leaned in towards me.\n\nMy eyes rolled to the side. Though the light from the streetlamps behind me only lit up on a sliver of his face, I could see his mouth was nearly touching my ear. I heard him whisper into my ear with a voice I'll never forget.\n\nHe said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nNow it was about this time I realized that this home intruder was in fact a three-story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era!\n\n\"God damn it Loch Ness monster you ain't gettin' my tree fiddy!\"\n\nDefeated, he slunk past me, opened the door and left. The lights came back on by themselves a few seconds later.

{"body": "&gt; Practically speaking, I don't think that there is a difference between -A and B, or between A and -B.\n\nAnd what bridges the gap between A and -B?  You can't just say A = -B without justification as to why that must be the case, because that's not how logic works.\n\n&gt; Your statement -B is: I don't believe that no gods exist. If I were to reword this, retaining exactly the same meaning, it would become A: I believe that some gods exist.\n\nNo you wouldn't, at all.  The meaning completely changes.  The -B statement I presented pertains to the claim that no gods exist.  I do not believe the claim \"no gods exist,\" that's what my -B statement is.  Are you saying that \"no gods exist\" and \"some god exists\" are the same statement?  \n\n&gt; That is why -A = B.\n\nIf you completely change what I said then I would agree with you, but that conclusion has nothing to do with what I said.\n\n&gt; \"I believe no gods exist\" can be reworded as \"I don't believe that a god exists\" and retain exactly the same meaning.\n\nAgain, it doesn't.  Is the claim \"no gods exist\" the same as the claim \"a god exists?\"  That's what you're saying here.  Someone can believe the claim \"no gods exist,\" which means they automatically don't believe the claim \"some god exists.\"  However, someone who doesn't believe the claim \"a god exists\" doesn't automatically believe the claim \"no gods exist.\"  You're conflating two separate claims as if they're the same thing.  They're not.\n\n&gt; Honestly, I did not want to get so hung up on definitions and semantics.\n\nBut that's EXACTLY what the OP pertains to.  Is atheism a religion or belief structure, a question which hinges on what you mean when you use the word \"atheist.\"  If you didn't want to get into talking about this subject you shouldn't have asked the question.\n\n&gt; Do the opinions of \"gnostic\" atheists (or whatever you want to call them, atheists who are of the opinion that there is no god) count as beliefs?\n\nDo those that believe that no gods exist count as someone having a belief?  Of course, but you didn't distinguish between the different types of atheists in the OP.  You would also have to determine how certain they are that no gods exist.  If they're absolutely certain they need to defend how they can be absolutely certain about anything.  If they're certain in a colloquial sense like they're certain that the loch ness monster, big foot, leprechauns, etc don't exist then that's fine.

{"body": "I have met Mr. caamib. I have a story I'd like to share.\n\n*Ahem.*\n\n'Twas a misty October morning when, whence upon my delicate female psyche, I was struck with such a thought to stun me. What if, what if I used my powers of vagina to save all the lonely, kind, sweet souls locked in destitute and loneliness? I thought surely there were no greater a calling then to be the repository in which they could lay their burdens. \n\nSo on this journey of healing I embarked on, finding the sad, the hopeless, the injured and damaged. All in one, conveniently. His name was caamib. Oh, society reviled him, 'tis true, but under the veneer of bitterness, sexism, and entitlement lied... bitterness, sexism, entitlement, and a perchance for celebrating rape. \n\nReviled, indeed. \n\nBut wait! He has called for me and my species of female humans to do such as I am doing now! To give freely of our bodies, to raise up those who could not find love because they were accused of such falsehoods such as \"misogyny\" and \"women-hate.\" To help these poor incels by becoming beings with no autonomy.  \n\nSurely I will be cherished. I will be appreciated. I will be welcomed by this man who does not at all hate women. \n\nSo I met with him, this paragon caamib. This champion of his dick. He told me of his woes: of how his villainous, murderous, female mother would not have sex with him (such heartlessness I have seen in too many mothers. 'Tis a tragedy.) and of how he had sex with someone he found to be unattractive. Such woes! Such hardship! My heart broke to hear his sad tales.\n\nWe made love in his most treasured place: the basement. Of his mother's home. It was magical, and although he cared not a wit for myself nor my pleasure, I was only too happy to submit to such a worthy alpha.\n\nAfterwards, when he found his release inside my unaroused vagina, he went onto his blog and proclaimed that even though he'd *just* had sex with me, he was still an incel. Unbelieving I looked to him and he said to me: \"I need to catch a bus today to attend my trial and I need about tree fitty,\" it was then I noticed that caamib was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "He's not being particularly kind about it, but what he's saying is valid.  A camera isn't susceptible to the kind of effects that the human eye is, so if the camera doesn't show it, it wasn't there.  My honest guess is that people did take pictures of the sky, but nothing showed up on them so they weren't kept and people dismissed it as not showing up on film being part of the miracle.  Also, the reports are not consistent on the color or movement of the sun, suggesting that each event was localized to an individual.  This would be consistent with staring at the sun too long (as each individual would be impacted differently based on susceptibility), but is not consistent with some sort of paranormal event.  If it were a paranormal event you would expect everyone to report the same thing, or at least similar.  \"Sun turned from yellow to green and began dancing\" and \"Sun turned from yellow to lime green and began gyrating\" are two accounts of the same event.  These people saw radically different colors, and radically different movements.  If it was a paranormal event, then it manifested within their minds rather than outside (based on the differing perceptions), however that wouldn't explain how the puddles dried up (if they did).\n\nAlso, having multiple people report an event is not good evidence of it's existence.  How many documentaries has the Discovery channel shown about people who have seen Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster or Mothman?

{"body": "I am well aware of the difference between correlation and causation.  I think the reason many people (including myself) believe that the popularity of the weapon was (part of) the reason for the nerf is because *that's the statistic they decided to cite*.  Obviously, they aren't trying to balance the game solely around popularity, but they do seem to think popularity is an indicator of how effective weapons are (and it probably is, to an extent).  The logic as it was presented to us was:\n\n    ARs have highest theoretical DPS + \n    ARs are the most popular weapons in Crucible -&gt;\n    ARs are OP\n\nThe first part of the argument is sort of weird because ARs, by design, rarely achieve their highest theoretical DPS.  Add in the fact that different categories of AR have different *practical* DPS numbers.  Your low-impact, low-stability Unwilling Soul is going to be much harder to get 100% theoretical DPS than your high-impact, high-stability SUROS Regime.\n\nThe second part of the argument (popularity) could largely be explained by other variables.  Effectiveness *may* be a reason for the popularity of high-impact ARs, but there are other factors as well.  There's ease-of-use in-game, accessibility (i.e. ease of obtaining the weapon), fun, map design, etc.\n\nSo, they may very well be right that *some* ARs need to be nerfed (or have their 'role' adjusted, if you prefer).  It's just that the argument presented didn't make a very persuasive case for nerfing *all* ARs.\n\nI'm sure there was much more behind the scenes than what was presented in their post explaining the changes.  But when I look at the end result, the AR change seems mostly flawed to me.  They may have succeeded in giving those high-impact ARs more balance in the Crucible, but for other ARs, they've just made them more irrelevant.  And they've also nerfed a PvE weapon class that most experienced PvE players will tell you had no need to be nerfed.\n\nAnyway, I'm not angry about these changes.  I just like thinking about the issue of balance.  It's a really tough data analysis problem, and I find that interesting.  The fact that all ARs, Pulse Rifles, etc. are just dumped into one huge group for the sake of balance is fairly troubling to me and suggests they are using fairly rudimentary metrics to justify balance changes (as evidenced by the much-maligned popularity table).\n\nJust my two cents.

Or those who, like yourself, believe god to be something outside the scope of observation or rational understanding?

In fact, true story, within minutes of becoming an atheist I lost my belief in the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot and UFOs. :-) \n\n&gt;Sorry, the Loch Ness Monster, by definition, must exist in Loch Ness if it \n&gt;were real. God, by my belief, does not have to exist in the observable \n&gt;universe. \n\nThen how does your God... you know... do things? The universe means \"all that there is\". Guess what? The Loch Ness monster isn't part of this universe either. See the problem? You've changed the set of attributes of \"God\" to equal the set of attributes of \"No God\". \n\nReminds me of the time Christopher Hitchens was in a debate and asked his opponent what his God was made of. After a second the man blurted out \"Nothing!\"\n\n Hitchens replied, \"I agree, but probably not for the same reasons.\" :-)\n\n&gt;Whether or not God does, the observable universe is a hell of a lot larger \n&gt;than Loch Ness.\n\nYour God is everywhere, correct?

{"body": "I have a story, but it's only very slightly relevant. \n\nIt was my senior year, and we had the fucking hottest professor in the college. Miss Ness had this petite, hourglass figure going on, but I didn't mind her too much; I was pretty sure I was going to pass, I was doing pretty well for myself in her class and it was an easy subject. That one time she asked me to meet her in the faculty office was a bit sketchy, but yeah okay, it's not like a teacher shouldn't talk to her student, right? So after class I head off to the floor of the usually-busy-office.\n\nIt turns out there wasn't anyone in there but her, which was weird for that time of day. She tells me to sit down in a chair opposite of her. I go along with it and she starts to ask why I make up strange rumors of me and her having a sexual relationship, and hot inappropriate it would be. Me being confused as fuck thinks that I was being accused of something I didn't do and didn't get the hint at first. It wasn't until she was going on and on about how \"forcing myself unto her was the filthiest thing she could imagine doing\" did I get it.\n\nI got up and locked the door to the office and ripped off her blouse. Didn't even bother with the bra strap, I just ripped that fucker right off too. buried my face in those soft, firm supple breasts and had my tongue fondle her nipples. She kept moaning about how she's been giving me As all semester and how I'd be giving her a D soon. I told her to shut up as I hurriedly unbuttoned my pants.\n\nShe hopped up on her table and hiked her skirt up. She wasn't wearing any panties so I knelt down and gave her wet cunt a short 15-minute french kiss. I was rock hard by then and I got up and started to enter her with my raging donger. Even after getting lubed up with my spit and her precum, she was still so tight. There was something weird about it though, her skin didn't feel as soft as it should have. A guttural roar escaped her lips, and she started to claw at my back in ecstasy. I looked at her as she came, but all I could see were bright, green eyes and sharp teeth. I suddenly noticed she was 500 feet tall and looked like she was from the paleolithic era. I thrust harder and harder, and finished in that scaly pussy. We dress up and I walk back out the door. Went to class the following day, awkwardly stared at the floor the whole time.\n\n10/10 would study again.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424002616", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Otto slammed his empty beer mug back onto the table, motioning to the skeptical barkeep for a refill. \"Mehr\", Otto growled across the empty bar. \n   \n   \"Jawohl, Otto...\" Rudolf hesitantly glanced at the empty mug, then to Otto's frothy mustache, finally trimmed in the manner of the Kaiser's, then back at the mug again. He slowly, with the manner of a man worried he is poisoning his friend, refilled the drink, and casually handed it back to Otto. \"If you want to talk about what happened...\" Rudolf cautiously began. \n   \n   Otto snorted, opened his gullet, and downed the glass in one go. Rudolf's bright red face dowered a bit. But who could blame Otto? After being laid off from the Mill for evacuating the building from a fire, he returned home early to find his wife in bed with Konrad. Konrad, Rudolf, and Otto had been friends as long as the three could remember, and this betrayal would stick with them forever. \n   \n   The door to Rudolf's bar opened, and Rudolf shuddered as a gust of November Munich air blew in. \"Close the door, bitte...\" Rudolf trailed off.\n  \n   \"Go away, Konrad.\" Otto began. But the man who entered the bar was not Konrad. Konrad was a slight man, hardly taller than 5 and a half feet. But this man was a giant, perhaps 7 feet. The man remained in the doorway, bringing in drifts of light snow. \"I said ***BLOODY WELL GO AWAY RIGHT NOW, BEFORE I SLAM THIS GLASS INTO YOUR FACE*** Otto screamed, arms akimbo. He jumped up, whirled around, and looked ready to actually kill the man he thought was Konrad. And for a moment, he attempted to carry it out. In his drunken stupor he could not realize the noticeable size difference between Konrad and the stranger, and ran straight for the doorway.\n  \n   \"***OTTO, NO!***\" Rudolf pleaded, running to hold back Otto. But he was too late. Otto had long since been the best runner of the three friends, and he was almost upon the stranger. \n  \n   But at the last moment before impact, the stranger almost lazily raised his arm and knocked out Otto with a firm blow first to his hand to knock the glass on the ground, then another just as sudden to knock Otto to the ground. Otto fell, pride wounded, but otherwise alive. Rudolf worried for a moment that he was dead, but then realized Otto was merely out cold. He shrugged. Perhaps that would help him feel better about his life.\n   \n   \"Danke for that, meine Herr.\" Rudolf nodded to the man. \"I sometimes think of doing that myself around here.\" \n  \n   The stranger nodded and put a large piece of gold on the table. \"That should cover the glass, and any troubles I may have caused you.\"\n   \n   Rudolf looked at the gloved hand on his bar, then to the arm, then to the rest of the man. He was dressed strangely, in an almost Arabic garb. Although it wouldn't seem suitable for the nearly sub-zero temperatures outside, the man looked quite comfortable.\n\n   The man sensed Rudolf's confusion. \"Pardon me. My name is Ishmael Pasha, from Istanbul.\" His voice was deep and gravely, and Rudolf seemed to gravitate to the man.\n\n   Rudolf looked into the man's eyes. It was about this time that Rudolf noticed this strangely garbed Turkish man was actually about 600 feet tall and from the paleolithic era!\n   \n   Rudolf glanced upward at his oak roof, the last thing he saw before a tentacle strangled him to death. \"Anne Frankly, I did Nazi that one coming.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424061395", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

So I start giving instructions (pull onto the main road, take a right at the first light, etc.).  Everything is going okay until I tell him to turn down this one street.  He actually asks me if we can avoid it.  He doesn't say why.  Because it was the first time I asked him to take a left, I figured he was just nervous about crossing traffic, so I insist he make the turn.  He says, under his breath and barely audible, and I remember these words like this was yesterday, \"shit 'bout ta get real.\"\nWe're driving down the road and there's two guys on a corner up ahead.  They obvious recognize the car and make a motion to reach around their backs.  The driver slams the accelerator and starts screaming something unintelligible, jumps the curb, and slams into them.  At this point I'm too scared to say or do anything.  My mouth is agape, eyes wide, in shock.  He turns around and RUNS THEM OVER AGAIN.  At this point I snap out of it and yell at him to pull over.  He tells me if I want out, I'll end up like them.  He floors it (about 60-70 mph in a 30 zone) and gets out of there.  I try telling him to head back to the testing center, at which point he says he has to make a stop.  He pulls over, takes out a fun and tells me to put my left hand on the wheel.  He then grabs a bungee cord and ties it around my wrist and the wheel.  He does the same with my right arm and the door handle.  He runs into some apartment building.  I hear shots fired and he comes racing out, firing a few more shots over his shoulder.  He gets in the car and takes off, my wrist still tied to the wheel.  Now this does some serious damage to my wrist every left turn he makes.  I'm pleading with him to go back.  Must've been about another fifteen minutes of him racing around before he pulls over.  He just looks at me.  Voice cracking, I ask \"what do you want from me?\"  He looks at me and says the words I'll never forget.  \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  And it was about this time I noticed the kid was actually an eight-story tall monster from the Paleolithic era!\n\nOverall, not a bad experience.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424113536", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

One of those places is \"the jellyfish-thought-space of Empress Hestra's heironach 'baby', a miniaturized version of Tamriel that fits inside of an eggshell\".)\n\n---\n\n**And a cool background note when I expressed some doubts about the above arrangement**: \n\n---\nRegarding ordering, I really only feel strongly about Skyrim First, New Imperial Province Second, Cyrodiil Third.\n\nThe original ordering of PGE1 wasn't really decided until its final, frantic days, except that we knew Morrowind would always be last, since that was DF's sequel. One reason for its bouncing order was that, after handing out sections as written, and slowly watching it congeal into a whole, the idea of \"saving the best for last\" ended up being more of a hope than what really happened. People and proof-writers saw a book THIS BIG and just skimmed to their favorite section. Or the section they saw as the unlikeliest to persuade (I'm looking at you, Elsweyr).\n\nOnly Ken, Kurt, Todd, and I read the thing front to back in its near-last-draft form to see if its through-line was the best it could be. Everyone else just high-fived (say) that \"sugar-crack\" made it in.\n\nIt also bears reminding here that no one asked for a PGE during Redguard's pre-dev cycle. Redguard was still just \"pirates in the sky boats of a barely-hidden Jupiter gas ocean\" at the time. Only Todd's very wise decision to leverage the success of DF that Redguard even got a greenlight but, even then, nothing like the PGE was mentioned.\n\nWhen was it mentioned? It's hard to pinpoint when, exactly, but after the RG plot of civil war and this Emperor guy coming in to profit from it all started to develop... well, someone asked, \"What's the name of the Empire, again?\" and no one had an answer. And that just got on everyone's nerves. A pact was made: Kurt and I would hit the books and work it all out while we were also working on Redguard. With Uncle Ken and Todd always there to steer us in the right direction.\n\nSuddenly, \"What's the name of the Empire, again?\" turned into \"hold up the train, wait, ALL of these disparate cultures worship the same gods? That CAN'T be right\" and \"This period in history doesn't make logistical sense and/or is just too muddled and unlovely in description\". The former was mostly me (Varieties was written in one night), the latter was usually Kurt (one does not argue with someone that can use examples from the Peloponnesian War to explain almost anything). In hindsight, probably a lot of it was wankery, but it was the first world-building that went beyond the Iliac Bay (the progenitors of Arena were almost gone to a man, so we didn't have their notes, so forgive any bad memory or perceived \"lack of documentation\"), and it was impossible to stop. Except for that little thing called deadline.\n\n(Remind me to relate the No One Wanted to Write the High Rock section later.)\n\nThis is a long way of saying, yes, the order matters, and yes, we will arrive at it, and yes, we should feel strongly about certain placements, but that a project of this scope will constantly surprise us and change our minds as we go...but we'll eventually have to talk about a deadline (groan) or it will never, ever stop.

{"body": "I hate this. Just last week I was walking through the park with my GF on our way home from the movies. She was wearing these really tight jeans, which I love because they make her buns look like those of a golden Greek godess, but I hate because it makes seemingly every man in the world want to watch us(her) walk by. Normally I brush it off, but as we were walking home that night, we walked past a group of three guys who not only looked, but had the fucking nerve to actually whistle as we walked by.\n\nI wish I could tell you that cooler heads prevailed that night, but that wasn't the case. I turned beet red and marched right over to those douches who were obviously ready to fight, and clearly a lot more confident in their ability to handle themselves in a fight.\n\nAs I closed in on the whistler, I couldn't think of anything rational to say, so I just stammered, \"you like to whistle, at girls huh? That seems like decent behavior?\" And to my surprise, the guy actually bitched out. He was like, \"nah, man we were whistling for our dog. We can't find him.\" I said, \"yeah, that's what I thought, pussy\" and turned around and walked back to my girlfriend.\n\nWe hadn't taken more than ten steps before I hear one of them mumble something and the other two laugh. I was fucking livid. Adrenaline still pumping, I ran back to them fist cocked and landed a punch square between the eyes of ol' whistler who fell like a sack of potatoes. The other two just stood there mouths agape. I looked back and forth between the two of them as if to dare either one of them to make a move. They both backed up then turned tail and fled.\n\nWhen I caught my breath and collected myself, I turned back to my girlfriend who was clearly aroused to see her man become so passionate about defending his woman's honor. We silently walked double-speed back to my apartment, and as soon as I closed the door behind me, she was all over me like a hobo on a ham sandwich. I'd never seen her that horny before, and that night she did things to me that no woman had done before.\n\nAs we laid in the afterglow of our glorious coitus, gazing deeply into each other's eyes, I asked her if she would marry me. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she told me she would on one condition. When I told her there was nothing that I wouldn't give her, she replied, \"I need about tree fiddy. \"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424156624", "subreddit": "reactiongifs", "score": 90, "controversiality": 0}

In May 2005, a discussion on intelligent design erupted when Minister of Education Maria van der Hoeven suggested that debate about intelligent design might encourage discourse between the country's various religious parties. She sought to \"stimulate an academic debate\" on the subject. Following strong objection from the nation's scientists,[35] she dropped plans of holding a conference on the matter.[11] After the 2007 elections, she was succeeded by Ronald Plasterk, described as a \"molecular geneticist, staunch atheist and opponent of intelligent design.\"[36]\n\n&gt;Poland saw a controversy over creationism in 2006 when Deputy Education Minister Mirosław Orzechowski denounced evolution as a lie taught in Polish schools. His superior, Minister of National Education Roman Giertych, has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, \"as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory.\" Giertych's father, Member of the European Parliament Maciej Giertych, has however opposed the teaching of evolution and has claimed that \"in every culture there are indications that we remember dinosaurs.

The proposal was withdrawn after it had generated controversy.[\n\n&gt;On April 25, 2007, Member of Parliament Martin Henriksen (Danish People's Party) asked Education Minister Bertel Haarder (Liberal Party of Denmark) for information about how many educational institutions had received The Atlas of Creation (2006) by Harun Yahya.[31] The minister responded that the Ministry of Education was not in possession of information about the number of educational institutions that had received the book.

I trusted her too much to go through her phone or email, but since we lived in a shared space, I figured videotaping our common areas was totally fair game. I started getting more and more suspicious as the days went by. I knew she was fooling around behind my back, but the cameras weren't catching anything, so I had to try another tactic. I looked up private investigators in my city to see if any of them might specialise in catching unfaithful lovers, and there was one that seemed to be a perfect fit for the job. The name in the ad was L. Nessmon, Investigator, and his tagline was \"When the cats away, I'll catch them if they play.\" It seemed like my only hope, so I sent him an email to see what his rates were and what he intended on doing.\n\nA week went by and I hadn't heard anything back from him, and I was getting more and more worried as my girlfriend was acting weirder and weirder, coming home late after work, and sometimes texting me in the middle of the day to say she had gone home sick, so I decided to drop by the address listed in his ad to see if I could plead to him in person and retain his services.\n\nWhen I got to his address, the office seemed a mess and untouched for weeks, but there was a note on the door, \"Gone for lunch, back by tree fiddy this afternoon.\" It was at that point that I realised I didn't even have a girlfriend to begin with, I hadn't even left my house since Tuesday, and I was completely illiterate. \n\nAnyway, good luck with whatever your problem is, I'm sure someone here can help you!\n\nEdit: Used the wrong letfer once or twice...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424190758", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Most definitions of God (if not all) place him outside of the universe\n\nNonsense. No person on the street's definition of god places him outside the universe. When people say \"god\" they mean an intelligent being who parted the Red Sea, sent prophets, and finds their car keys when they're lost. That's not \"outside the universe\". If it exists in or affects our reality, it can be measured and hence tested.\n\n&gt;I would say it is almost certainly wrong to say God can be disproved or \n&gt;proved to exist at all by logic\n\nImagine a game show - there's a 2-foot all around box. The contestant has to guess what's in the box. Now, logic can never prove what's in the box - there's essentially an infinite number of things we can imagine could be in the box. But there are things we can logically rule out - an elephant, a jet plane, Barack Obama. You can indeed disprove something with logic. There exist entire BOOKS full of \"incompatible attribute\" proofs that disprove common conceptions of god. These include classics such as \"can God make a mountain so large even he can't move it\" (not omnipotent), all-good and all-powerful vs. the existence of evil, etc. There's also the related hidden god argument. It's easy to disprove God with logic. \n\n&gt; or science or any other method, \nGod answers prayers, right? We can tested this. God created the universe, right? We can test this. God gave us \"souls\", right? We can test this. God designed everything, right? We can test this. Etc., etc. How can you possibly say we can't test for God? Don't be fooled by the philosophers/theologians who twist the meaning of \"god\" until its attributes are identical to the sets of attributes of \"no god\" and then say \"You can't prove that doesn't exist!\" They're just playing word games.\n\nGod is \"outside the universe\"? That means an attribute of God is \"doesn't exist in the universe\". You know what else doesn't exist in the universe? The Loch Ness Monster. Bigfoot. Swamp Thing. The Island from Lost. Wonder Woman. See what I'm saying? These \"definitions\" of god remove god from existence themselves. There's no need to disprove these kinds of god.

{"body": "Thank you for not pulling a tree fiddy. That's so sobering. \n\nWhen I was 18 I got my permit the month before NYS banned cell phone usage while driving. That December I was driving my father and myself to pick up a friend and take us to a church where all the young people were going on a week long youth trip.\n\nIt was snowy and cold when an old friend called my dad's phone, not knowing I was headed out of town. He handed it to me and said \"make it quick, you can't talk on these anymore.\" No sooner had the  words \"I have to call you back\" left my mouth everything went white then black.\n\nI came to my senses seconds later and there was smoke, steam and glass all over the inside of the car. I don't remember stopping but dad said it was instant, like hitting a wall. My dad's nose was broken and both of our glasses had been crushed into our faces, cutting the bridge of my nose.\n\nWe got out (on a country highway, very little traffic but a well maintained road) and the only thing we heard was the sound of the fucked up engine cooling. The hood was destroyed, the windshield was half in the car and the roof was smashed but we couldn't find what I hit. There were no cars anywhere, there was no blood or fur (lots of deer in the area) it was a mystery.\n\nHe grabs the phone I was still clutching and in the only display of aggression I have ever seen from him he holds me by my coat and says \"I was driving, do you hear me? I was driving.\" right into my face. In retrospect it was the pure, panicked, parental instinct trying to protect me. \n\nHe calls 911 and I thought it was cool we heard the sirens from the village police on one side of the hill, the county sheriff from the other side and the ambulance north of the town all turn on within 10 seconds of each other. I'll never forget that mundane thought while I checked myself over to see if I had any injuries other than a few scratches and damaged nose.\n\nWhen they arrive we still don't know what I hit. The police are confused, split us up and begin asking questions that I can only assume are leading to \"did you hit someone and are you covering it up?\" The medics give us a once over and all but one head off to sweep the fields on either side of the road, looking for footprints, blood, anything. Just as the state troopers show up an officer rolls a large truck's wheel onto the pavement.\n\nIt fits the size of the crushed area on the hood and was the width of the place at the top of the windshield where it crushed the windshield and smashed down the top of the car perfectly. \n\nThey found a drunk man passed out in his truck a half mile up the road in someone's driveway up in the woods with 3 wheels. He had changed a flat while drunk and never tightened the lug nuts. The wheel came off while going 60+, bounced down the road and hit us head on. Had we been there a fraction of a second earlier or later it could have been much worse. The officers and EMTs shared several stories about wheels coming loose and ours was the only one where no one died a fucking gruesome death.\n\nSince then I've always had a bluetooth headset and pissed off many young friends who texted me while I was en route by ignoring the text. You never forget a nearly life-ending scrape. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424276408", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 192, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "What did the ancestral menu look like if it wasn't wild plants and animals, eaten to avoid toxins and optimize health and fitness?\n\n&gt;Adherents recommend a very specific “ancestral” menu, replete with certain percentages of energy from carbohydrates, proteins and fats\n\nThe article here seems to suggest that following a \"Paleo diet\" implies a specific macro nutrient ratio -- it doesn't.  Macros are going to vary based on insulin sensitivity, genetics, and health/fitness goals -- the same 100g carbohydrate intake could vary from as much as being &lt;15% total calories to &gt;30% calories depending on if you're active or if you're losing weight.  It would be sub-optimal to suggest a 30% protein macro for someone eating 3,000 calories (over 200 grams), while a 30% protein macro is appropriate for someone who is trying to lose a lot of unhealthy weight in a healthy way.  Obviously the groks living in the arctic snow were eating different macros than the tarzans of the jungles -- since we don't live in either harsh extreme, it's more intelligent to eat for our individual habitat.\n\n&gt;And the idea that our more ancient ancestors were great hunters is likely off the mark, as bipedality — at least before the advance of sophisticated cognition and technology — is a mighty poor way to chase game. Even more so than bears and pigs, our mobility is limited. The anthropologist Bruce Latimer has pointed out that the fastest human being on the planet can’t catch up to your average rabbit. Another reason to be opportunistic about food.\n\nOur ancient ancestors weren't a bunch of incognisant apes.  Bipedalism freed up their hands to use tools for hunting and gathering.  Technology of the paleolithic era allowed for sewing baskets / bags / clothing, drilling holes in wood to make houses and boats, and scraping hides to make leather.  They had hand axes / chisels and knives for their kitchen, nets, and fishing lines with hooks.  They planned campsites around hunting / gathering.  They had spears and harpoons, bows / arrows, and likely utilized hunting dogs.  Running down a rabbit is a poor use of energy for a poor source of calories, compared with throwing a spear / club at a caribou or scooping up some seafood.\n\nI don't see the point of the article.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424283836", "subreddit": "Paleo", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Our perception allows us to physically see these animals, the fact we never have is evidence of non-existence, at least in the places they are claimed to exist.. We are able to explore the areas where these creatures are claimed to reside and have found nothing. Taking into account how advanced technology has come we can make the reasonable inference that these creatures do not exist. \n\nI think the same thing applies to religious text and to a much lesser extent a god. There are thousands of religious based texts all  spreading different ideas. Science actually can test many claims of these texts and have disproved many aspects of them, the Bible included. \n\nGod is a different matter though because in nearly every religion it is claimed to be not of the natural world, or supernatural. Even if science discovered every fact of the natural world, a god can still be claimed to have done it. So to answer your question, science cannot disprove anything it cannot test. However, we can answer this question on a philosophical level. Anything can be claimed to exist, alternate universes, strange creatures, among other things. But at what point in your life other than this do you believe things because they cannot be disproved? There is a reason the burden of proof is on the person making a claim, the exact reasons I mentioned above. \n\nCan I say for sure that a god doesn't exist? No, but I can say it is unlikely based on what I know, just like Big Foot, Loch Ness Monster, and Chupacabra.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424301203", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "About tree fiddy.\n\nBut seriously, I don't believe a rough amount per person has ever been specified, other than it was above the average persons/families affordability but not too much that not enough people would go, the vaults occupied on average 1500-2000 people, or more or less depending on their purpose. The majority of them reaching full intended capacity.\n\nThe construction cost of Vault 13 was $400 billion. Although prices in the years pre-war were heavily inflated. I doubt making a profit was that worth being concerned about, because people were buying tickets in advance so they didn't need the event to happen to make money, but also should a nuclear war happen, the money they did lose would be irrelevant.\n\nAs for requirements, that also depends on that particular vault's purpose. They would've all be advertised solely as preservation shelters that would repopulate the wasteland after X many years bring sealed, the true nature of the vaults was obviously kept secret.\n\nI imagine, as an example, if a family applied to Vault 29 (a vault that was solely populated by children) they'd be told that's where they'd go (because who would willingly abandon their children in advance should the day come?) But on that day, they'd be abruptly reassigned to say Vault 13 while the child is allowed to enter. If that's the case chances are the parents wouldn't make it there, and little orphaned Timmy is left alone with probably many other orphans.\n\nAnother example would be Vault 15, where it was populated with various races and ideologies that would inevitably conflict over time. It would've been publicly advertised as a 'come all' service, but on the day certain peoples would be ordered away or face being executed.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424322437", "subreddit": "Fallout", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

He raised the device to his mouth to reply, but a violent thug began to pull the small ship up, and he struggle to keep it in his hands.\n\n\"Houston, what is going on there, over?\"\n\n\"... I... I don't know what to tell you.

I was a lonely child who didnt have any friends. I wasn't like my brothers, and they always seemed to be bothered by me. They weren't angry or at me or afraid of me, they just always seemed uneasy around me. Like they thought i was weird. Also, I have memories of me being very young, like age 1-3, Most people i talk to don't claim to have memories that early, but i have brought things up to my parents that they were astounded to learn that i remembered because I was so young. When I turned 13, that's when i began to suspect that I was a powerful wizard. I started having urges. Urges that i can't really explain to mortals, but I suspect other wizards/ witches know the feeling.\nIf you didn't know, each wizard has there own special field of skill. Whether it be talking to animals, reading minds, manipulating physical objects, etc etc. My special field of skills was the arcane arts. I found myself able to not start, but manipulate fires. Many people didn't believe me when i tried to tell them, so I tried to keep it to myself as mush as possible.\nBecause I didn't fit in well with the other kids, I never really socialized. I always ran around my neighborhood, prating my abilities and teaching myself how to better channel my energy. One day, in one of my magic channeling hideouts, I met her. she was just there. nobody had ever been there before, it was my place. I asked her how she found this place, and she told me she knew what I was and that the aura from my skills had attracted her there. We talked some, and I found out that she was a witch. her special area of focus was talking to animals, specifically white tailed deer. She was amazing. She was the first person that I ever really connected with. At this point in my life, I was still skeptical to accept the fact that i was a wizard, and that every thing every body has ever told me was wrong. She told me that she knew i had suspicions as to what i was and reassured me that I was correct. It took a lot of convincing, but i finally believed her and accepted the fact that I was a very powerful arcane wizard. I had to be careful with my abilities because she told me that i was very dangerous, and that if i wasn't careful i'd lose my control and could hurt somebody.\nMy friend and I were growing very close. One day, we decided to run away together and try to find more people like us. It was great, she asked deer everywhere we went for directions, and where to find food and water. The deer were always very helpful, and i found most deer to be more intelligent, kind, and helpful than any person i have ever met. She befriended some deer, and they followed us all around the country. We were gatherers, living off of what nature gave us. She said that eating food directly from nature was good for our skills, and that eating anything processed or made for normal people would be bad for our skills and could poison us. And she was right. Once we staring eating Nature's food, i could feel myself gaining control over my abilities. I was able to concentrate more, and found myself able to do things much faster.\nOne day, i asked her how she knew all of this. She said that she met a great wizard who had taught her much about the magic powers that some people have. She talked about how some people may live their whole lives, never even knowing that they were special, others know, but don't know that there are others like them.\nThat was when we decided we were ready to find and help others. We went out, finding other witches' and wizards' aura trails and helped them, educated them about what they were. Some were grateful, and came with us. Others, hated us and wished to be left alone, and a few wouldn't even believe us. Those ones hurt the most. We put everything on the line for them and this is what they gave us in return? it just felt really ungrateful.\nAfter our coven was about 150 strong, we decided we were ready to start training them to live off of nature on their own, so that we could split up and have multiple groups of wizards and witches each staring their own small covens to recruit more gifted people more quickly. Once they had found enough people, they would bring them back to the coven headquarters.\nEventually, my partner and I found ourselves leading a coven about 3,500 wizards/witches strong. That's when she started to act odd.\nShe stopped eating a lot. She used to eat every meal with me, but she started only eating once a day. She stopped talking to her deer friend as much as she used to, and even seemed reluctant to talk to me. We did everything together before, and she could tell me anything. She knew that, it didn't make sense for her to be acting this way. I asked her if she was okay, to witch she replied that even though she had never been happier, a part of her felt empty, like she needed something more. Thats when she kissed me, and she told me she loved me. I didn't even know which if the hundreds of emotions that I was feeling at the moment act upon, but i just smiled, said \"I love you too,\" and kissed her again. And I meant it. I loved her more than anything else in the world.\nWe spent the rest of that night talking. Talking about each other, about our coven, about what we were going to about anything. We talked all night, and she seemed happier. I know I was happier. I was always happier when i was with her.\nFast forward 3 months, we are deeply in love and are spiritually connected. I'm starting to develop some of her powers, and she is developing some of mine. This is not uncommon among witches or wizards who are very deep in love. Up until now, she hasn't seemed off since that night. But slowly, she seems to be getting less and less social. She starts eating less. Not less often, but less amounts of food. I talk to the deer, and they are noticing it too. As her spirit bond, its having a noticeable affect one me as well. Im starting to feel odd at this point. So I confront her, and I regard that decision as the worst mistake of my entire life. I ask her if everything is okay, and she is feeling alright. Again, she tells me like she needs something more. I ask her what she needs, and she tells me it would hurt me too much if she told me. I insist that she tells me, to which she replies \"I need bout tree fiddy.\" its at this heart breaking moment that I realize the woman that I am in love with, the only person who has ever really mattered to me at all as a person, is a hundred-fifty foot sea monster from the Paleozoic era. \"Get the hell outa here you god damn lock ness monster, you!\" i screamed at her, heartbroken. She waddled away, and I never saw her again. She really did break my heart, but she was truly a monster and I couldn't even bare to look at her anymore. She drove me insane. I loved with everything that I was, and she betrayed me. Our entire love had been a lie from Day One.\nAfter that, i found myself stuck with a huge coven to take care of all by myself. It was hard and tedious,but i managed. I have never felt attracted to any other girl after her, and never even thought about loving any one ever again. She was my sun and my stars, but i meant nothing to her. She truly broke my heart, and not even the most skilled wizard can fix that.\nTL;DR: Realized I was a wizard at a very young age and met another witch who i fell in love with and started a coven with. She ended up betraying me and breaking me heart over something that was incredibly stupid.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424474078", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I refuse to eat sunflower seeds. I understand that it is not the sunflower seeds fault directly but here is the story of how they killed my parents and almost myself as well. \n\nI LOVED sunflower seeds when I was 14. I ate them all the fucking time with everything. My favorite part? The shells. I'd swallow that motherfucker every time. The best thing to go with sunflower seeds is milk, okay? It only works if you are mildly lactose intelorant. The milk will soften the shit enough for the shells to be completely inside and not hurt on the way out. \n\nA couple years later just shy of my 17th birthday I was in school when all of a sudden I felt something sharp inside my stomach. I've never felt such pain. I screamed, \"God fucking damn it!\" in a loud high piercing tone. The teacher came up to me and saw tears pouring from my eyes. \n\n\"Honey, are you ok-\" the teacher tried to ask when I vomited blood all over her.\n\nThey rushed me to the hospital. I remember gaining consciousness a few times during this ordeal. \n\n\"There's no way he's goin-\" frantically said a paramedic on quite a bumby road. \n\n\"Where are his parents?\" I believe a nurse was asking in the hospital. \n\nI woke up a few days later to a doctor standing over me. He explained to me how my bowels were shredded. He had never seen this before. The only thought running through my head was honestly just wondering where my mom was. I remember even having a dream while under that I couldn't find my mom. \n\nAll I wanted to do was say that I love her. I never told her that at least not recently. We fought a lot - just the usual teenager and mom shit. \n\nI didn't care one single bit of that I was alive or that the doctor said I was going to be fine (after extensive therapy). The doctor then explained to me what had happened that day. My parents both received a call about my emergency room adventure and rushed to the hospital and got into an accident. Both were taken to the hospital I was at and died a few feet from where I was first taken. \n\nI am 27 now. My physical therapy ended quite a few years ago. I am more-or-less normal but everyday I think about how much I missed and loved my mother and the regret for not making it known to her. I hate myself. I didn't deserve this chance. I wish I could give it back so it can be used on someone more deserving..like my mom. \n\nIn fact just yesterday I went to a therapist. They did some hypnotherapy shit and I regain a memory I had lost.\n\nWhile going into surgery I remember the doctor saying to a nurse, \"Sabotage the parents' care. We need to get that $3.50.\" That's when I realized my doctor was actually that goddamn Loch Ness monster and he had killed my parents to get me to give him it.

{"body": "the default status of actions are that they are not immoral unless there is a reason for them to be considered immoral.\n\nfor example, wearing sunglasses is not immoral because there is no compelling reason to think that it is. There is no further reason for its lack of immorality\n\nsimilarly, cohabitation is not immoral because there is no compelling reason to think that it is. \n\nAny further discussion about the topic needs to be what the arguments are for its immorality and why they are valid/invalid.\n\n***edit:*** to address the arguments you added for its immorality:\n\n&gt;First of all, in my country (and most of the subcontinent) I can vouch that roughly 99.99% people would respond to a survey question by saying that cohabitation is immoral. Social norms are made by large numbers of people of a particular society and that therefore makes this immoral (compare it to a legislative branch of a democracy).\n\n.\n&gt;Fifth, is purely religious. Since most of the regions in my subcontinent says its wrong.\n\nThese are both really really bad ways of determining morality. Looking at it from a historical perspective, religion and the consensus of isolated societies who follow those religions has a HORRIBLE track record in determining morality. \n\n&gt;Secondly, it leads to promiscuity. Look at the modern western nations where the number of sexual partners is around 10-15!!\n\ndo you have reasons for why promiscuity is immoral? I don't see any compelling reason to think so.\n\n&gt;Third, it destroys the cultural institutions of marriage and leads to anarchy in the form of decrease in stability of marriage, increasing parental abandonment, divorce etc.\n\nI'm not sure what exactly you mean by destroying the cultural institution of marriage or why that would imply the immorality of cohabitation. I also don't understand the divorce part. Why does living with someone before marrying that person lead to divorcing that person? Even if it does, why would that make cohabitation immoral?\n\nI can agree that parental abandonment is a bad thing and immoral. For the sake of argument I'll accept your assertion that cohabitation is actually a causal factor in increasing the statistical incidence of parental abandonment. Why does this statistical relationship imply that cohabitation is immoral? I don't think it is reasonable to determine morality in this manner. Driving a car leads to a statistically higher rate of killing innocent people. Does this make driving immoral? TV leads to more inactive and obese people. Is watching TV immoral? Even assuming the statistical relationship holds, it is completely consistent to view parental abandonment as immoral while cohabitation is not immoral.\n\n&gt;Fourth is the natural way of things argument. It is against the natural way of things, that humans engage in promiscuity (whose precursor is cohabitation) because the male-female ratio is roughly 1:1.\n\nHow are you sure that having one sexual partner is any more \"natural\" than several? The male-female ratio being close to 1:1 says nothing about whether or not having multiple sexual partners is \"natural\". Both forms of sexual relations are possible in a population with an even male to female. I'm not aware of a consensus of the mating habits of humans during the paleolithic era.  \n\nEven if it were \"natural,\" does it make sense to base morality around that? The natural way of things for humans is to be members of nomadic tribes of 20-100 people. Nobody claims that our departure from that natural state is immoral.

I have nothing against nudes but ffs we were dating and she was posting this shit for literally everyone to see.  \n\nI confronted her about it and she cried a bunch of crocodile tears, told me it was because she didn't feel appreciated enough to the lack of intimacy between us.  I fell for it, of course.\n\nOver the next few months I tried to be more involved and caring, had sex a few times, etc.  The nudes stopped showing up, I was happy, and she seemed happy.  \n\nFunny thing is, the nudes hadn't stopped:  she had just started texting them to the guys she wanted.  Apparently, I wasn't one of those guys.  This continued for months without my knowledge.\n\nAlong the way, she picked up a hankering for heroin.  She wasn't addicted yet by any means, but she was slipping down that slope, and I tried to help her, I really did.  I was stupid, I was in love, and I tried to keep her from buying the shit.  I stayed with her as often as possible to discourage it and she *still* kept shooting up behind my back.\n\nThen, money started to go missing from my wallet.  I thought it was my brother fucking with me at first, but then a teacher in our english class caught her taking the money from said wallet while I was out of the room getting water.  Little miss heroin tried to lie her way out of it, saying that I let her do that, but that teacher wasn't having it (I love him for that).\n\nI eventually confronted her about all the fucking bullshit and she broke down, even admitting to the continuing nudes.  We both started crying, her begging for me to forgive her, to move on, to love her, all that BS.  I got so fucking fed up and just screamed, asking what the *fuck* she really wanted.\n\nShe looked up at me with those goddamned hazel eyes and said \"about tree fiddy.\"\n\nThat was the moment I realized that the lying, thieving, addict who was once my girlfriend was really a 300 foot tall monster from the paleolithic era!  \n\nShe screeched loudly, took 3.50 from my wallet, and broke through the wall of the school.

{"body": "I feel the paleo diet is a big fad, but I'm sure paleo adherants would say the same of veganism.\n\nOne logical problem in the paleo diet, to me, is that it seems very arbitrary. Why did they choose the certain timespan they did to model human nutrition on? And which humans during that time period are they referring to? People in Africa ate very differently from people in Europe did from people in Asia. Which diet are they following?\n\nAlso, it seems to me the amount of animal products consumed in prehistorical times is contentious. Yes, we find tool marks on animal bones, but that doesn't tell us how often humans may have eaten meat. It is far more likely we scavenged whatever we could, and that would have been mostly plant foods and insects.\n\nIf we go further back in time, before the paleolithic era, humans evolved from fruit-eating apes. So a case could be made by the same logic the paleo diet uses, that would be just as \"scientific\", that we should eat mostly fruit.\n\nLastly, Loren Cordain, who wrote the original book on the paleo diet, published a paper stating that it seems the ideal human blood levels of LDL cholesterol is between 50 and 70 mg/dL. If you can achieve those levels eating meat and eggs every day, then that's amazing. But I doubt most people can do that.\n\nAlso, you can always show them Dr. Greger's few videos on the topic.

{"body": "Avoiding fruits at all cost isn't the best idea, to the best of my understanding. Like ModernKender said, they're packed full of nutrients.\n\n\"Paleo\" is almost as specific as \"Italian\" or \"German\" or \"Chinese\" or \"American\" when it comes to talking about diet. Paleo in itself is more about what you shouldn't eat more than what you should; the diet is defined by its restrictions. That's not to say that one should fixate on the things one shouldn't eat, or that an optimal Paleo diet can be had with any combination/amount of allowed foods. My point is just that there is a lot of room for flexibility, which is good for wiggle room and for tailoring things to meet one's personal desires and needs.\n\nWhat you are describing, the stuff about avoiding sugars and acclimatising our bodies to burning fat, isn't necessarily what Paleo means. That sounds more ketogenic than Paleo. Paleo doesn't require you to be low carb -- like I said, there is quite a bit of room for flexibility.\n\nReturning to the issue of fruit, all natural (i.e. not canned, for example) fruit is permissible on this diet, as you probably already know.\n\nAs for what is optimal, in addition to the standard advice of doing what works for you, take into consideration that the popular idea that Paleolithic humans had no or little access to the types of sugary, large fruit we do today through selective breeding isn't totally accurate, because fruit of similar sugariness and size to that to which we are accustomed are eaten by hunter-gatherers today, thus, presumably also by humans in the Paleolithic era: http://rawfoodsos.com/2011/05/31/wild-and-ancient-fruit/ The Kitavans ate a lot of fruit, for example, yet their diet is (was?) still 100% Paleolithic. \n\nHere is an interesting link I read just last week about sugar in the Paleo framework which discusses why unrefined, naturally occurring sugar is not necessarily as bad for everyone as some make it out to be: http://paleoleap.com/sugar-and-paleo/\n\nI'm not saying to go crazy on the fruit; don't get me wrong. Moderation in all things is best. Introduce variety, make things interesting, get a wide array of nutrients by doing so. That's part of the beauty of this way of eating. And if you personally do not tolerate sugar well, as ModernKender touched upon, you can restrict it more strictly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424742746", "subreddit": "Paleo", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm sorry to say that I've been this guy before, though it wasn't quite as overt as you've described it here. It was my senior year of college, and there was a girl I'd met through some mutual acquaintances who was just *perfect* for me. Great personality, good sense of humor, similar interests, intelligent, a pretty face, and an ass to die for (I consider myself a man who appreciates a nice, well-proportioned derriere. More cushion for the pushin', as I always say).\n\nUnfortunately, this girl had a boyfriend of several months at the time.  He went to a different college, however, and thus this girl--we'll call her Shelby--and I were able to spend time together and became good friends. We hung out a lot and enjoyed joking and laughing in each other's company, watching various standup routines on YouTube and introducing our favorite music to each other. \n\nThis all changed one night, when the two of us had been drinking heavier than usual. One drink led to another, and then one thing led to another, and the two of us ended up making ravenous, animalistic love on her bed. What a glorious night it was--one of the best of my young life at that point. I felt guilty about it, though, when sober thoughts kicked in the next morning. What had I done? This went against almost every moral code I had. Nevertheless, after another night of movies and drinks, this happened once more before her boyfriend came to visit our college a few weeks later. \n\nTo say the meeting was awkward was an understatement (why I'd even agreed to it in the first place is beyond me). I couldn't exactly say \"Hey man, I've been keeping your girlfriend's lady parts warm for you while you were away,\" so I just sort of put on the most diplomatic face I could and met him with as much dignity as I could. \n\nThis is where things got weird. It turns out that Shelby had only invited him up to reveal our scandalous rendezvous, because right in front of him, she pulled me in and kissed me with as much passion as if we'd been dating for years. Tongue, hands grabbing, legs twitching, and genitals quivering in anticipation of sweet, sweet lovemaking. \n\nFortunately, her boyfriend was a lover and not a fighter, because he just stood there, mouth agape. He had no clue how to respond to this sudden and most unwelcome revelation. After the kiss, I leaned in and said, \"Shelby, what the *fuck* are you doing?!?!\" Looking into my eyes, she wrapped her arms around me, moved into close, and whispered into my ear, \"I thought it was time for him to know.

{"body": "The biggest downer for me about this pod is just that the guys don't sound like they really give that much of a shit about it. This might be kind of an unfair criticism, but they just don't have good radio personalities. Their voices are kind of flat and monotone, and this has the added effect of making it sound particularly awkward whenever they chuckle/laugh at things they find ridiculous about any given case. \n\nAs for the content itself, their topics are generally really good imo, with a couple notable exceptions. There are quite a few good cases in there that I'd never heard of. Really good cases, even. But they have a lot of complete garbage episodes about shit like the Loch Ness Monster or the Oak Island Money Pit. Why even make that an episode? They establish that it's ridiculous in the first few minutes and then end up giggling about it for the next hour. \n\nTheir knowledge of the subject matter is, at times, lacking. Way too often they will react like this is the first time they've ever discussed the case with each other. \"Oh, really? I hadn't heard that.\" I would recommend getting on the same page before you start an episode. This is especially frustrating when it's about an important *fact* of the case. The listener can't take anything away from your podcast if we don't know which facts we can and can't accept. If you can't thoroughly source something, you can still mention it, just mention that it's hard to source. This isn't a court of law or anything, but we need some context. \n\nI mean this all as constructive criticism because I listen to the pod and like it a lot. But so far the best episodes have been the ones that prominently feature guests who are skilled at storytelling/know their shit/have given interviews before/etc. Standout episodes that fit this description off the top of my head: In Broad Daylight (ep 101) and John Ferak (ep 80). \n\nI also would prefer them to stay completely away from topics that are basically just the two of them talking about their personal beliefs wrt social and/or political issues. I don't want to hear them opine about the 2nd amendment, GMOs, affluenza, rape culture, etc. Keep it positive (as opposed to normative).

{"body": "&gt; The agriculture revolution wasn't that long ago in terms of evolutionary history. While the affects of diet wouldn't be the same, how different were we back at the start of the agriculture revolution biologically?\n\nIf you're drinking cow's milk or eating dairy products created from it, you're not following the sort of diet that cavemen did. Hunter-gatherer populations of the Neolithic period were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant, as the mutation that allowed the enzyme lactase to persist into adulthood did not occur until after that point (likely as a result of selection pressures following the development of animal husbandry).\n\nAnother big difference is evident in the protein. Cavemen probably got much of their protein intake from opportunistic sources that modern people are understandably reluctant to consider, such as insects, small animals like mice/rats/lizards, or organ meats and offal from larger animals. If you're getting your protein from steaks or chicken breasts or the like, your balance of amino acids is going to be totally different than those of a true paleo eater.\n\nAnd of course, there's been significant genetic drift in even fruits and vegetables since the Paleolithic era. The tomato that you'd buy in a store today is substantially different from the ones that were eaten in Mesoamerica in the past - and of course tomatoes of any sort weren't available in Europe until the 1500s.

Dentist said he didn't know if he would still have teeth on the left side of his mouth, but that his teeth were in such good shape that if they did have to remove them all that they could use them for transplants on a different patient. They assured him that he would be reimbursed for the teeth they removed. They gave him the gas, and right before he went under they realized that the receptionist had forgotten to get him to sign a release form or something. They handed him a pen and he signed it right before he went under. During the procedure, they ended up fucking something up and they had to pull all of his teeth. He woke up, obviously freaked out, and they told him he world be fitted for dentures in the next couple weeks after his gums healed up. He never realized that he had signed a release form and that he would be reimbursed for the teeth they pulled. He was talking to somebody at work whose aunt had had all of her teeth pulled and was reimbursed for a few and then realized he was never reimbursed for his teeth that were pulled. He went back to the dentist office and demanded to see the dentist that had performed the procedure. The dentist called him back to his office and was talking with my friend about how much he would be reimbursed for each tooth. The dentist asked how much he wanted and my friend said about tree fiddy.

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied.\n\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends. At the start of High School we did everything together. But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\n\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year. Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\n\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.\n\nThey were together that entire summer. It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling. I even heard them having sex once. I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life. That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.\n\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother. I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\". She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it. To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\n\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over. The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem. I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door. She said hello and gave me a kiss. I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic. She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\" I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\" I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing. Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned. I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\n\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives. Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now. I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\" Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded. She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\n\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone. I was back in the game with her. We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great. Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now. We layed there for a bit. Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.\n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend, I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.

{"body": "Taxi driver here!\n\nThis has only ever happened to me once (if you don't count the other few times drunk people did it).\n\nIt was around 2006 and I was driving in the metro-Nashville area of Tennessee.  I had recently been laid off of my previous job so I took up taxi driving as a means to support myself until I could find a better job.  I only drove for about 4 months so I got really lucky (or unlucky, depending on how you look at it) to have experienced this.\n\nSo a random guy hops in my car and yells word for word, \"Follow that blue sedan!\".  I was initially thrown off because people just don't do that.  I mean it happens in the movies but you don't expect it to actually happen, and if it does happen you expect it to be a joke.  So I just kinda laughed it off and asked him if he really needed a taxi or if he was just messing with me.  He replied, \"No, follow that fucking car\".  He then flashed a knife and I immediately realized this was no joke.  \n\nIt wasn't really a \"chase\".  More of a \"tag behind and wait until they stop\" kind of thing.  I didn't really feel as threatened by him as you'd imagine, despite him being a very large knife-wielding angry man.  \n\nWe followed for about 10 minutes before the car stopped, and during that time I did ask him why we were following the car.  He explained that he'd just caught his wife cheating on him with the driver, and that when he caught him it was \"going to be ugly\".  \n\nI didn't question his decision because, well, being stabbed hurts... Or so I've been told.  I don't know, I didn't push him because I don't need any extra holes in my body.  I also didn't try to call the police for the very same reason.  I was just the driver, and I wasn't about to involve myself in the situation any more than that.  \n\nSo after the sedan stopped, the man jumped out and started to run towards the car.  I am a taxi driver, though, and I have to be paid.  I yelled, \"Sir, I need you to pay the fare!\".\n\nHe yelled back, \"How much is it?\".\n\nI told him, but he just said, \"I only have about tree-fiddy\".\n\nIt was also at this time that I realized this was not a large man, but in fact a large crustacean from the Paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424993248", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 77, "controversiality": 0}

Latest update: \"Ok, just walked in the door and I'm sick from a pretty terrible lasagna banquet last night but I(lack of) digest. I arrived this morning and realized that I had beaten the security guards and didn't have my badge and was left pounding on the door like a dope. I was greeted by the assist. HR guy(really nice guy from Turkey, big Basketball fan and we talk often). He opened the door and greeted me with a warm hand shake and told me to take a seat in the lobby THEY would be right out. I thought that I would just be talking with the HR director and my supervisor. After about 10 minutes BIG BOSS man walks out(another really nice guy, give even the smallest of employees high fives in the hallway, all the college kids who work there part time. Although he is super busy he tries to let others know he cares) walks out with my Super and a big smile. Gives me a big hard hand shake that almost breaks my wrist and immediately says \"Thanks for coming down, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it\" or something to that effect. He asks if I need anything, drink or whatnot. I said \"yeah...I need about tree fiddy\" KIDDING KIDDING I had been really nervous the whole way there and part of me wanted to just tell my wife to turn around, again I just wanted to forget about and wait to go back to my old job but my wife was already thinking of the best way to set the building on fire so that it would burn quickly and violently /s So my wife,lawyer friend(who i couldn't legally call my lawyer, just introduced as an adviser) sat down. I asked if EvilHrDirector was coming and he paused and said \"No, he's not in today. I know you don't want to see him and frankly neither do I. He will be having his own meeting when corporate gets here\"(This kind of surprised me, I felt like he was overstepping information of his situation, yeah I was fucked but privacy is privacy. I don't know if he was just doing it to make me comfortable or pleased). \"Let's get started, CorpRep come in here please\". CorpRep??? So I told you guys I e-mailed the corporate head of each division, well BigBossMan talked to them personally on his own and they sent a rep to apologize on behalf of regional. He read from an e-mailed letter from regional and it was very comforting that they did that. BigBossMan said \"Op, I'm so sorry. For everything. Not just this but for all the troubles you have had since starting. I know there has been confusion and screw ups, misinformation. I AM truly sorry and I hope you believe that\" I did believe him. He then had I get up and change rooms. This is where we met the lawyer. He was very friendly and introduced himself. We sat down and BigBossMan once again said \"I don't know how many ways I can tell you I'm sorry, I saw you leaving the building crying but had no clue what had happened. I wish I had known right there\" I told him it was ok and not his fault and that I really appreciated his gesture and seeing me. \"OP, we would love to have you come back\" and I simply and kindly said \"I can't BigBossMan and you know that\" and he nodded and said \"Yeah, I wouldn't either. Here read over this and this is what we have prepared and want you to have and I hope you believe me when I say this is an apology not 'sweep you under the rug' I was kind of lost but he said \"We'll give you a minute to talk it over with your wife and adviser, let us know when you're ready\". It was more than generous. Under the agreement I can't disclose what was on it, but it included an agreement to not go to the press or social media(which when it takes affect by tomorrow I think I have to take down this post, I'm not sure. I don't want to risk anything). I looked at my wife and her pickfork and torch and she's shaking her head saying \"No hell no we're going to court' I rolled my eyes and got some real advice on what was realistic from my cubscouts Father. He spent about 20 minutes reading over the stack of papers and said \"This is not only fair, it's more than fair. You need to take into account not only law fees if you go to court but the fact that you are fighting a major corporation. Are you really going to be the little guy who walks away with 5 million damages for 'emotional distress' and 'wrongful termination'? Maybe but big chance you won't. It's you and a small time employment lawyer against a group of sharks. It's your choice\" I spent ten minutes thinking about it, my wifes student loans, my son,my carpet that needs to be replaced the little things that this MORE THAN FAIR offer could give us a cushion for. I don't exactly live paycheck to paycheck but have never been able to get my family the things I've always wanted and that main thing is security. I had that in my hand. No, it wasn't millions it wasn't close but I had a start for my sons college fund and other security for my family right there. My wife calmed down a little bit and I said to her \"I'm not going to be greedy and roll the dice and jeopardize you and LittleOp\" She started crying and I signed. I called BigBossMan back in and handed it to him. We spent the next couple of hours going other formalities and signing other documents, reading them carefully and I MADE SURE they were explained properly to me and my adviser. It was done. I stood up and BigBossMan said \"This doesn't mean you aren't welcome to come back, you change your mind? Call me. I'm so sorry\" WHY I DID WHAT I DID BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL GOING TO FREAK OUT!!!! Although this is a big company, what some people forget is that below my floor college kids and highschool kids are working their asses off trying to get by as the foundation of the company. They hire all and they pay those kids well, defaming the company in public by going to the media, listing the name here or taking it to court puts those kids(and a lot of them my friends) at risk. I could not live with the \"What if\". I said before, I'm a sensitive little bitch. I'll probably always be one but in the end all I wanted was an apology(actually I just wanted to forget about it) and I got more than that. I want to thank all of you, your support, your kind PMs, your advice and those who cheered me up with the laughs. I would have probably turned my back and walked away if it wasn't for you guys. All of you are amazing people and I'm sad that we are only connected through the internet.

{"body": "&gt;Would my insurance cover it?\n\nMaybe.  It really depends on what your coverage says and who this other person is.  For argument's sake, if it's automatically covered by your personal auto policy and this person is also covered by that same policy, then yes, they're covered.  If either or both of those assumptions are not true, then things get very messy.\n\n&gt;Would theirs (assuming they have insurance)?\n\nAgain, maybe.  It depends on what their coverage says.  In this case, the rental car would most likely be viewed as a \"borrowed\" vehicle.  If there's no coverage anywhere else, then theirs would pick this up, assuming that their coverage extends to borrowed cars.  Not all do.\n\n&gt;Would the credit card company (if I was using their coverage)?\nIt depends on the exact wording of what the credit card company does or does not cover.  I know that my corporate card provides insurance for any other employee of my company that's operating the vehicle.  I have no idea about my personal cards, though.\n\n&gt;If there isn't an accident, is there any downside to doing this (I know that's outside the scope of this sub, just curious what you think)\n\nOther downsides: they run you over with it.  They use it to transport drugs and have it seized.  Your friend sells it to the Loch Ness Monster for $3.50.

I jumped back and asked what the fuck she was doing, and she just fucking smiled at me with vomit still dripping from her fucking chin.\n\nNext thing I knew, she had her finger in the vomit-coated cheese curds, and was stirring them around.  She picked a nice, juicy one up, and popped that shit down her throat.\n\nI'm not a queasy guy by any means, but what the fuck.

{"body": "This is the original post\n\nThis is OP's original post\n\nI recently started a new job after months and month of recruiting from this company. I left a very stable position after finally caving to this new places advances. It was nothing but a nightmare. Broken promises,my name misspelled leading to weeks of not being able to access my work documents literally just sitting there for a month doing nothing.\n\nThen I got a PUBLIC IM that the whole floor could see that told me to log out of my system(I had access to e-mail,chat and the internet so I could at least work on my training documents). I turned around and the HR director was standing over me and said(for everyone to hear) \"Come with me there have been reports of you touching women and making sexual advances, bring your badge\"\n\nI was shaking in fear and most of all I was confused. He sat me down and scowled at me. Telling me \"People have said you've been giving them back rubs and touching their hair\"(now, I have a hard time looking people in the eye let alone touching them). I asked \"Who said that, I've never done anything to anyone. If I have I would like to apologize\" His response was \"Shut the hell up, you don't get to ask questions, you just get to leave. Pack your shit up and get out of here. Leave your badge\"\n\nI walked back to my desk stunned and tried my best to hold back my tears(I'm a very sensitive guy, it's hard for me to play tough when shit like this happens). I couldn't hold it any longer and started sobbing uncontrollably. A few of my friends(girls I might add) ran over and hugged me, shocked and asked what was wrong. I explained and they were dumbfounded. HR director came up and told them to \"Get their hands off of me, I want him out of my building right away\". I cleaned out my desk, crying like a girl and walked out. My wife showed up and at that point when I met her outside I was so dazed and emotional I couldn't be comforted. I had never been so embarrassed in my life. I was labeled a creep,told to shut up and fired in under 2 minutes.\n\nI got home and was having trouble breathing from crying so hard when my cell phone rang. It was the HR director. In a flat stern tone he told me \"I confused your name with someone else's, be in an hour early tomorrow\". click\n\nEDIT:few words for confusion\n\nEDIT 2: I've got a cubscout dinner to go to here in a little bit. I'm going to go get ready. You guys are seriously the best,I appreciate the perk up and support. I usually get peeved when people go on reddit with these kinds of stories kind of fishing for karma but I assure you this wasn't the case. I just had to tell a broad audience that shit like this actually is happening. I think one of my cubscout parents is a lawyer, I will be talking to them for advice and going in tomorrow(maybe I can get her to come with me). I will post tomorrow!\n\nEDIT 3: Just got back, one of my boys' Dads(I thought it was one of the Moms for some reason) is a business lawyer. I spoke with him and while he said this sort of thing isn't normally his specialty he offered to come with me before I had a chance to ask. I'm going to his house for a bit to talk about some things and I will tell you all what happens tomorrow! Thanks for your support, honestly I was just looking for a place to vent....I didn't expect my inbox to die like this. Greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT 4:Just leaving! I'll be home in just a little bit. Going to buy my wife some breakfast and I will update right when I get home.\n\nEDIT 5: Ok, just walked in the door and I'm sick from a pretty terrible lasagna banquet last night but I(lack of) digest.\n\nI arrived this morning and realized that I had beaten the security guards and didn't have my badge and was left pounding on the door like a dope. I was greeted by the assist. HR guy(really nice guy from Turkey, big Basketball fan and we talk often). He opened the door and greeted me with a warm hand shake and told me to take a seat in the lobby THEY would be right out. I thought that I would just be talking with the HR director and my supervisor. After about 10 minutes BIG BOSS man walks out(another really nice guy, give even the smallest of employees high fives in the hallway, all the college kids who work there part time. Although he is super busy he tries to let others know he cares) walks out with my Super and a big smile.\n\nGives me a big hard hand shake that almost breaks my wrist and immediately says \"Thanks for coming down, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it\" or something to that effect. He asks if I need anything, drink or whatnot.\n\nI said \"yeah...I need about tree fiddy\" KIDDING KIDDING\n\nI had been really nervous the whole way there and part of me wanted to just tell my wife to turn around, again I just wanted to forget about and wait to go back to my old job but my wife was already thinking of the best way to set the building on fire so that it would burn quickly and violently /s\n\nSo my wife,lawyer friend(who i couldn't legally call my lawyer, just introduced as an adviser) sat down. I asked if EvilHrDirector was coming and he paused and said \"No, he's not in today. I know you don't want to see him and frankly neither do I. He will be having his own meeting when corporate gets here\"(This kind of surprised me, I felt like he was overstepping information of his situation, yeah I was fucked but privacy is privacy. I don't know if he was just doing it to make me comfortable or pleased).\n\n\"Let's get started, CorpRep come in here please\". CorpRep??? So I told you guys I e-mailed the corporate head of each division, well BigBossMan talked to them personally on his own and they sent a rep to apologize on behalf of regional. He read from an e-mailed letter from regional and it was very comforting that they did that.\n\nBigBossMan said \"Op, I'm so sorry. For everything. Not just this but for all the troubles you have had since starting. I know there has been confusion and screw ups, misinformation. I AM truly sorry and I hope you believe that\" I did believe him. He then had I get up and change rooms.\n\nThis is where we met the lawyer. He was very friendly and introduced himself. We sat down and BigBossMan once again said \"I don't know how many ways I can tell you I'm sorry, I saw you leaving the building crying but had no clue what had happened. I wish I had known right there\" I told him it was ok and not his fault and that I really appreciated his gesture and seeing me.\n\n\"OP, we would love to have you come back\" and I simply and kindly said \"I can't BigBossMan and you know that\" and he nodded and said \"Yeah, I wouldn't either. Here read over this and this is what we have prepared and want you to have and I hope you believe me when I say this is an apology not 'sweep you under the rug'\n\nI was kind of lost but he said \"We'll give you a minute to talk it over with your wife and adviser, let us know when you're ready\". It was more than generous.\n\nUnder the agreement I can't disclose what was on it, but it included an agreement to not go to the press or social media(which when it takes affect by tomorrow I think I have to take down this post, I'm not sure. I don't want to risk anything). I looked at my wife and her pickfork and torch and she's shaking her head saying \"No hell no we're going to court' I rolled my eyes and got some real advice on what was realistic from my cubscouts Father. He spent about 20 minutes reading over the stack of papers and said \"This is not only fair, it's more than fair. You need to take into account not only law fees if you go to court but the fact that you are fighting a major corporation. Are you really going to be the little guy who walks away with 5 million damages for 'emotional distress' and 'wrongful termination'? Maybe but big chance you won't. It's you and a small time employment lawyer against a group of sharks. It's your choice\"\n\nI spent ten minutes thinking about it, my wifes student loans, my son,my carpet that needs to be replaced the little things that this MORE THAN FAIR offer could give us a cushion for. I don't exactly live paycheck to paycheck but have never been able to get my family the things I've always wanted and that main thing is security. I had that in my hand. No, it wasn't millions it wasn't close but I had a start for my sons college fund and other security for my family right there. My wife calmed down a little bit and I said to her \"I'm not going to be greedy and roll the dice and jeopardize you and LittleOp\" She started crying and I signed. I called BigBossMan back in and handed it to him.\n\nWe spent the next couple of hours going other formalities and signing other documents, reading them carefully and I MADE SURE they were explained properly to me and my adviser. It was done. I stood up and BigBossMan said \"This doesn't mean you aren't welcome to come back, you change your mind? Call me. I'm so sorry\"\n\nWHY I DID WHAT I DID BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL GOING TO FREAK OUT!!!! Although this is a big company, what some people forget is that below my floor college kids and highschool kids are working their asses off trying to get by as the foundation of the company. They hire all and they pay those kids well, defaming the company in public by going to the media, listing the name here or taking it to court puts those kids(and a lot of them my friends) at risk. I could not live with the \"What if\". I said before, I'm a sensitive little bitch. I'll probably always be one but in the end all I wanted was an apology(actually I just wanted to forget about it) and I got more than that.\n\nI want to thank all of you, your support, your kind PMs, your advice and those who cheered me up with the laughs. I would have probably turned my back and walked away if it wasn't for you guys. All of you are amazing people and I'm sad that we are only connected through the internet.

I left a very stable position after finally caving to this new places advances. It was nothing but a nightmare. Broken promises,my name misspelled leading to weeks of not being able to access my work documents literally just sitting there for a month doing nothing.\n\n &gt; Then I got a PUBLIC IM that the whole floor could see that told me to log out of my system(I had access to e-mail,chat and the internet so I could at least work on my training documents). I turned around and the HR director was standing over me and said(for everyone to hear) \"Come with me there have been reports of you touching women and making sexual advances, bring your badge\"\n\n &gt; I was shaking in fear and most of all I was confused. He sat me down and scowled at me. Telling me \"People have said you've been giving them back rubs and touching their hair\"(now, I have a hard time looking people in the eye let alone touching them). I asked \"Who said that, I've never done anything to anyone. If I have I would like to apologize\" His response was \"Shut the hell up, you don't get to ask questions, you just get to leave. Pack your shit up and get out of here. Leave your badge\"\n\n &gt; I walked back to my desk stunned and tried my best to hold back my tears(I'm a very sensitive guy, it's hard for me to play tough when shit like this happens). I couldn't hold it any longer and started sobbing uncontrollably. A few of my friends(girls I might add) ran over and hugged me, shocked and asked what was wrong. I explained and they were dumbfounded. HR director came up and told them to \"Get their hands off of me, I want him out of my building right away\". I cleaned out my desk, crying like a girl and walked out. My wife showed up and at that point when I met her outside I was so dazed and emotional I couldn't be comforted.

{"body": "I was flying from Australia to London, which is pretty hellish to begin with. For reasons of saving money I had two stopovers, one at Bandar Seri Begawan in Brunei and one at Dubai - each of which were long enough to be boring, but too short to actually go out and see anything, so I was stuck in the airport for both of them. Dubai wasn't so bad because there's plenty of stuff to see, but Bandar Seri Begawan is probably the most boring airport on the entire planet.\n\nIn any case, by the time we took off from Dubai I was totally over air travel - my back was killing me from being cramped up in economy seat for hours, I felt gritty and filthy from not having showered for just as long and I was suffering from severe sleep deprivation thanks to the fact that I can never sleep on planes. I cued up the Pixies on my iPod and stared out over the moonlit Arabian desert in a state of semi-trance that was as close to actual sleep as I could manage. And then *kick*, followed by another *kick*, and and then a *kick* *kick*. The small child in the seat behind mine, apparently as sick of flying as I was, had decided to amuse herself by kicking the back of my seat. Repeatedly. \n\nNow I'm not a confrontational guy, so I did my best to ignore it in the hopes that she'd get bored, or her parents would notice and stop her. But no such luck. She kept kicking and kicking and kicking. I gritted my teeth. I growled under my breath. I started fantasizing about the plane door blowing out, and sucking this pestilent child out into the stratosphere. Eventually I took a deep breath, undid my belt, sat up and leaned over the back of my seat to confront whoever was responsible for this horrid creature.\n\nThis turned out to be a woman in snappy business attire (on a plane?), completely engrossed in watching some movie on her laptop while her kid tormented me. I waved at her until she noticed me, and pulled out her earbuds with an irritated look and asked \"Yes?\", as if I had interrupted the most crucial event of her entire life. I apologised for disturbing her, pointed out that her child was kicking the back of my seat, and asked if she could get her to stop.\n\nAlmost absentmindedly she turned to the kid and said \"Sweetie, can you stop doing that?\" then plugged the earbuds back in. The demon child looked chastened, but as soon as her mother looked back at her laptop, gave me an evil grin and started deliberately kicking the seat again, harder. \n\nAt this point I snapped and snarled at the kid \"WILL YOU JUST STOP THAT!!\". She looked surprised for a second, and then started tugging at her mother's arm and wailing. The mother, enraged, pulled out her earbuds and started yelling \"HOW DARE YOU SHOUT AT MY ANGEL! I'LL HAVE YOU KICKED OFF THIS FLIGHT!\" and other assorted threats. This quickly attracted the attention of the cabin crew who came rushing over at which point she started yelling at them, claiming that I'd \"assaulted\" her little angel and that I should be detained. Through all this of course, the kid continued to wail, and other passengers started to weigh in with requests for everyone to shut up and their own varyingly accurate versions of events.\n\nThe cabin crew managed to get the woman to calm down slightly and listened to both our versions of what had happened - mine being repeatedly interrupted by claims that her \"little angel\" would *never* misbehave. They then asked me what I wanted from the situation, which I presume is something they learned in the \"dealing with psycho passengers\" section of their training. I said I just wanted to be able to sit in my chair without being kicked in the back. Then they asked the mother, who said she wanted about tree fiddy. At this point I realised that she wasn't a woman in a business suit but was about eight stories tall and a hideous crustacean from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425098051", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
