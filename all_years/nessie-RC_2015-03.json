{"body": "Man, I had this happen when I was in highschool.  \n\nI was taking Algebra 2 and I nearly failed because the teacher was a 70 something half blind/deaf woman named Mrs. Barnes.  \n\nEvery single lecture... I shit you not, she would stand in front of the board and everyone would be bobbing their heads around trying to take notes.  You'd think being hard of hearing she'd speak loudly, but no, she was incredibly soft-spoken.  She spoke in what seemed to be just above a whisper most times.  \n\nShe also opted to use a chalkboard despite every other teacher in the building using dry-erase boards.  It wouldn't have been such a big deal if she'd asked a student to clean it after each class.  Nope, just tons of chalk dust clogging up the board, and in turn, making it even more difficult to read what she wrote.  She wasn't really bad about erasing things before we could jot them down, but standing in the way was absolutely a problem.  \n\nAnywho...  I liked Mrs. Barnes but that was definitely an issue in her class, and students did complain a couple of times but I think administration went easy on her because it was her last year before retirement and they didn't want her to go with any hard feelings about anything after 50+ years of teaching in the same school.  \n\nExams were obviously more difficult because of her inability to teach.  I mean don't get me wrong the woman was a great teacher, but she was past her prime.  It'd be like throwing Muhammad Ali in the ring and complaining because he wasn't as good as the other boxers in 2015.  \n\nSo mid-terms roll around and I'm struggling to get through the exam.  Not because I didn't study, not because I was dumb, but because I didn't have proper notes to study.  It was probably 15 minutes into the exam when I spoke up and told Mrs. Barnes that we weren't ready because our notes were sub-par at best.  She took this as an insult to her teaching ability and angrily told me to hush and finish my exam.  It wasn't really meant to be an insult, I was just being straightforward with her.  I knew some of us would likely fail because of this and I couldn't let that happen.\n\nI asked to be dismissed to use the restroom after I finished my exam and she gave me the go-ahead.  I immediately went to the assistant principal's office and asked him if he'd help.  He walked me back to her classroom after realizing how distraught I was and spoke to her personally.  \n\nWe could hear them talking in the hallway.  Nothing crazy, just a calm \"would you mind allowing them to retake the exam next week?\" sort of thing.  Very polite.  She said no.  \n\nShe was pretty pissed that I'd \"tattled\" by this point and leaned inside the classroom to pull me outside to speak to me.  \n\nShe said, \"Since you aren't satisfied with the way I teach my class, you will be moved to Mrs. Philpott's room on the other side of the building, where you will be allowed to retake the exam under her instruction\".  \n\nI wasn't familiar with that side of the building so I had to ask her the room number, to which she replied, \"My old mind means memory doesn't serve me well, but it's around tree-fiddy\".  \n\nIt was also at this time that I realized Mrs. Barnes was not an algebra teacher, rather a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1425209619", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 627, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't give a crap what an entire field of experts say if that entire field of experts can't produce evidence to back their claims. This is the same reason that I don't give credence to UFOlogists, ghost hunters, or cryptozoologists.\n\nBecause physicists can make a career by upsetting commonly held beliefs in their field doesn't mean that that is true for all fields. Do you really think that a Cryptozoologist announcing that he has determined the Loch Ness Monster to not exist really would make his name in the field? Or that he would upset the \"scholarly consensus\" that the Loch Ness Monster exists, but is just really, really good at hiding? Of course not, because coming to that conclusion *excludes* you from that field of study. Concluding that UFOs aren't real means you're no longer a UFOlogist. Just like deciding that the Bible is not historical makes you no longer a Biblical Historian. Unsurprisingly, the departure of said people from the field leaves behind a remarkable \"scholarly consensus\" despite a total lack of evidence to support it.\n\nBiblical history only enjoys more credibility than the other pseudoscientific fields because of the historical accident of being created by a culture which believed in its conclusions absolutely before any evidence was looked for. If Rome had have converted to Scientology in the third century, we'd all be crawling around volcanoes with Geiger counters, drawing unsubstantiated conclusions from random natural uranium deposits. Finding evidence to support a preexisting conclusion is bad enough, but they haven't even been able to do *that.*\n\nThis is all beside the point that you're continuing to try to divert the discussion away from actual evidence for said claims.

If i could choose where to die, it would be in that bedroom. \nAnyway, we jumped into the bed, me on top. We are making out and start playing the little clothing simon says game - she took off her top, i took off mine, she took off her pants, i attempted to do so but fell backwards and accidentally nudged the bedside table, knocking off what looked like a very expensive lamp. But what do you expect...im inexperienced, anxious, and clumsy as hell. Anyway, we continue after laughing at me busting my ass.

Legs shaking, back arching, out of breath, she leaned in as we embraced and fucked until we couldn't move. \n\nI woke up the next morning with her smiling at me. God damn i might just love this woman. We laid in bed and talked for a while before she said she had to get up and ready for work, so i gathered my things.\n\"God damn last night was fantastic.

{"body": "[part 3/14] Know your DATE RAPE drugs\n\nHere’s what you need to know about “date rape drugs”:\nThey’re a myth.  An urban legend. \nAs in “Sasquatch and The Loch Ness Monster walk in to a bar, and slip a Roofie into the drink of a Unicorn…”   Know how I know that didn’t happen?  Cuz it doesn’t make sense to try to drug someone in a public place.\n\nAs obvious and self-evident as this should be, it turns out I’m the only one who knows it.  And now you know it too.  But sorority girls, feminists, cops, jurors, judges, prosecutors, journalists, college administrators, screenwriters, Dads, Moms, boyfriends, girlfriends, husbands, etc.  are all, somehow, oblivious to this knowledge. It has escaped them.\n\nDoctors, nurses, and pharmacists PROBABLY know it—but they’re not talking. Certainly anesthesiologists know it.  Why are they biting their tongues?  I can’t imagine.  It must really grind their gears to know that they spent a decade and a fortune to learn how to do properly something that drunken frat boys get blamed for doing on the fly every Saturday night all across America.  \n\nAs usual, Occam’s wonderful Razor can help us cut through the bullshit and expose the truth, which is this:  You don’t have to track down a shady, Mexican druggist, or knock over a drugstore, then distract a hottie while doing the slight-of-hand needed to slip the pill or powder into her drink, hoping against hope that it dissolves before she notices, and that it doesn’t affect the taste, and that she doesn’t have a date-rape drug testing coaster, or swizzle stick, or fingernail polish, and also hoping that you got the dosage exactly right (not enough, and she’ll remember everything, and be able to resist leaving with you; too much, and she’ll collapse, making it hard to not be noticed when you fireman-carry her out of the room.  Oh, and she might die.  Oh, and, unlike on TV and in the movies, traces of the drug can be found in her hair for MONTHS after she ingests it.)   \n\nYou don’t have to worry about ANY of this.  And face it, if you don’t have your Doctorate, you’re not smart enough to pull it off.  Note that even Bill Cosby at least has an honorary Ph.D.  Why would you fuck with any of this, when the best date-rape drug ever invented by man is ALREADY IN HER CUP.  It’s called ALCOHOL.  And if I were working against a tight deadline, and had to make this chapter just one-word long, the word would be ALCOHOL.  Because it’s all the drug knowledge that any date-rapist needs.  \n\nIt’s common knowledge that women regularly self-ingest this drug, knowing full well that it will impair their judgment, and lower their inhibitions with regard to sexual consent. Then, they go to places where there will be drunk men. The women are fully informed about the fact that drunken, horny men do not like to take “no” for an answer when it comes to sex.  \n\n“He-said/She-said” drunken rape cases have very little hope of successful prosecution.  Feminists hate this fact, but they can go soak their head in canal water.  “Drunken consent doesn’t count” they gurgle from their cum-flooded voice-box.  But that only begs the question “then who raped who? The guy was drunk, too!”\n\nSo as any respectable rapist should, we must all raise our glass in a toast to Alcohol:\nIt’s been facilitating rape for over 2,000 years, and that’s not likely to change anytime soon.\n\nI’ll drink to that!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425283348", "subreddit": "RapingWomen", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Little did he know she had posted a add on craigslist titled \"Cum gang bang my boyfriend while I watch and spit on him\" So on her birthday he decided to go along with her Fantasy and \"take one for the team.\" He had said she was super excited. So he lead her into the bed room and tied him up face down ass up. She put a blind fold on him. He said the first couple of minutes was kind of fun and erotic. But after a couple of minutes he started to get sore and he could feel what felt almost like a burning sensation. But he could tell she was really into it so he asked for it harder. She replied oh im going to give you harder. Shortly after he felt her move away  and then come back he could feel something cold against his ass cheeks.  He heard her chuckle as she started to go in. Suddenly he felt a burning sensation and felt like he was getting torn open. She slowly picked up speed and the pain kept getting more intense. He screamed out stop it hurts. She wouldn't. She kept going he tried to move but she was stronger than normal and had him pinned. Her hands didn't feel quite like they normally do and she was way stronger than before. He screamed out STOP!!!!! He kept struggling and she leaned over and said...\"I need about tree fiddy.\"...\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425378912", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": -9, "controversiality": 0}

That was the first earthquake I had ever lived through...\n\nThe quake was like the guy above me described but much more intense and prolonged. I ran into my friends girlfriend as we both darted around like wounded animals. The house was tiny so we just ran outside and sat on the ground. The shaking was fucking unbelievable.\n\nBut like everyone knows, that wasn't the worst part. I didn't think of it, but as soon as the shaking stopped she mentioned the possibility of a tsunami. We never considered the nuclear power plant just a few miles away though...\n\nShe had the sense to suggest going inland. We walked together for about 5 minutes while she started talking about how worried she was for her boyfriend. I tried to calm her down but I had no idea how bad things were going to get.\n\nShe suggested we find a cab. I'm like, \"What the fuck are you talking about? I never see any cabs here and there has just been a major earthquake!\" I'm just thinking she is hysterical.\n\nShe says, \"Well if we do see one do you have any money?\n\n\"How much would it be?

He still gives lectures about how the scientific community unfairly rejects novel ideas. He has a point and is a clever guy, but he went way too far, and was a bit bitter when I saw him talk (probably because he couldn't get his work on the Lock Ness Monster published).

I asked him, how much did he need, with I concede a trembling voice.\n\n''About three fiddy '' , he said to me.\n\nAnd it's at this moment that the true come before my eyes. This thing was not an angelic creature from the Golden city, but a 500 feets tall monster from the paeolithic era.\n\nI said '' Go away, go away you stupid loch ness monster, I will not give you tree fiddy''.\n\nThe creature, startled, flee, but not before giving me some pre-historic slurs.\n\nAnd it's what happened when I first set foot in the Golden City.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425401117", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Arghh. Rant time: My mom's not getting any younger (she's in her late 60s) and has dealt with a lot of health issues over the past year - she hadn't seen a doctor in 20+ years until last year. She got really weak and agoraphobic, until it got to the point of calling an ambulance because she just couldn't stand up one time last April. Fortunately, her health is doing much better, but she's not 100%. She's still driving, and I think she's capable of doing so - but if I'm with her, there's no reason for her to be the one driving.\n\nAnyway, I've been helping her with sorting out finances with my dad's passing, and went with her to get her taxes done on Saturday. In advanced, she asked me, \"Are you ok with driving the truck?\" (it was my dad's primary vehicle). Change of plans, my husband came with me, too, so we couldn't take the truck. Asked on the phone if she was okay with us driving the car instead, and she said that was fine. When we got to her house, she was waiting in the car in the driveway, ready to go. She put up a fight, saying \"if we're taking my car, I'm driving\" and refused to move from the driver's seat. Fine, whatever, I'll drive and we'll take my car, she's not driving (especially not when she's now pissed off and acting like she's 5 years old). \n\nShe proceeded to sulk the entire trip. Both hubby and I tried to be nice and engage her in conversation, I offered to buy her lunch when we stopped, we helped her with things around the house when we got back, etc... nothing. She barely spoke with us. I normally talk to her after work, so I called her yesterday afternoon, and she asked, \"So, if I'm not capable of driving, are you driving me back down there to pick up my taxes?\" I've repeatedly told her that I think she's capable of driving, but if she's got someone else with her, then they should be driving, not her - if nothing else, because her reaction time and awareness isn't the same as someone who's half her age. \n\nI made the mistake of checking her e-mail earlier (I keep an eye on it for finance things, etc., and she welcomes it/is well aware of it) and happened to see this in an e-mail to one of her friends: \"Got taxes done Saturday ([nessie] went with me - she didn't think I could handle it alone???).  She made me so upset - I was going to drive to [town 30 minutes away] and she wouldn't let me because of \"my condition\"!!!!!!  Who does she think is driving me to and from.  Didn't speak to her the whole time unless necessary.  I can be should a witch sometimes (well most of the time).  She'll get over it.\"\n\nFuck you, mom. I was concerned about getting in a car with you because you're not as capable as you once were, and I was doing you a fucking favor by going with you in the first place. \n\nTo top it all off, she did the same damn thing with my grandmother when my grandmother was my mom's current age (ie, I was ~5, my mom was ~45, and my grandmother was late 60s) - my grandmother NEVER drove if my mom was in the car, 'cause my mom wouldn't let her. Also, my mom was supposed to go on a road trip with her best friend recently - and guess what, her friend was going to do all the driving. Uhm, I'm noticing a trend here, but somehow I'm the horrible one? \n\n::sigh:: I'm contemplating if I should even call her after work today.

{"body": "The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was originally signed in 1689, but not officially established until three years later, in 1692. The Statute was decreed by the International Confederation of Wizards to protect the Wizarding world from the Muggles by hiding its presence.\n\nThe Seventeenth Century was the peak of discord among Muggles and Wizards, which culminated in witch-hunts and public executions. Not least of these \"executions\" were the public burning of witches; which was less than successful on many occasions. Most witches or wizards would employ a flame-freezing charm, which rendered the fire harmless; and, in fact, created a tickling sensation that was enjoyable. Of note on this matter is Wendelin the Weird, who enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught and burned no less than 47 times (under different disguises, so as not to be recognized). However, not all were so lucky as to escape death. One notable victim of these witch hunts is Sir Nicholas De Mimsy Porpington; who was publicly executed by attempted beheading.\n\nThe International Statute of Secrecy is, by its very title, international law. Each country upholds this law in its own fashion, a task relegated to the local Ministry. Each Ministry is held responsible for things such as: the control of magical beasts, curbing public displays of underage magic, and ensuring that magical games and sports are played without risk of discovery; to name a few of the responsibilities.\n\nIn 1750, Clause 73 was added to the Statute. Clause 73 is notable because it states, “*Each wizarding governing body will be responsible for the concealment, care and control of all magical beasts, beings, and spirits dwelling within its territory's borders. Should any such creature cause harm to, or draw the notice of, the Muggle community, that nation's wizarding governing body will be subject to discipline by the International Confederation of Wizards.*”\nOne very noticeable, seeming, exception to this clause would be the world’s largest Kelpie housed in Scotland’s Loch Ness; which draws many Muggle tourists in an attempt to sight the “Loch Ness Monster”. These sightings are clearly a breach of Clause 73, yet appear to not warrant any action on the International Confederation of Wizards’ part, as most sightings are discounted by the majority of Muggles.\n\nClause 73 also states, in regard to dress guidelines while interacting with the Muggle world, “*When mingling with Muggles, wizards and witches will adopt an entirely Muggle standard of dress, which will conform as closely as possible to the fashion of the day. Clothing must be appropriate to the climate, the geographical region and the occasion. Nothing self-altering or adjusting is to be worn in front of Muggles.*”\nThis is, by a very large amount, the source of most infractions of Clause 73; in spite of the very clear and precise instructions.\nIt may also be noted that the Clause very explicitly states that wizards are not allowed to take part in any Muggle sport; though they are allowed to support any team they so desire.\n\nThere has been opposition to the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy since its inception. Notable families of wealth and/or prominent stature were unwilling to relinquish their attachments to the higher echelons of Muggle society, as they were rarely ever the subject of persecution; due to their political and economical sway. Still others argued that it was the place of wizards to rule over the Muggle world, as they were “clearly” lesser beings. In opposition to this view, there have been those who argue that it is the place of wizards to encourage and inspire the Muggles via the use of magic.\nMore recently, there has been a campaign to reunite the long-separated worlds, spearheaded by one Carlotta Pinkstone. Ms. Pinkstone believes that the unification of Muggle and Wizard societies is opportune and convenient. She has been an active supporter in this movement, and has been imprisoned in Azkaban on more than one occasion for her indiscriminate use of magic in full view of Muggles. Most notably, she has cast several spells without the use of her wand, in view of Muggles.\n\nThe separation of Wizards and Muggles has led to a number of small Wizarding communities to spring up. Some of these communities are Hogsmeade Village, Godric’s Hollow, Ottery St. Catchpole, and Tinworth. Hogsmeade Village being the only all-wizard village in all of Britain; with the other communities being mixes of wizards and, often, confounded Muggles. These communities provide support, comfort, protection, and a general feeling of comfort to the witches and wizards living in them. Many children who show magical ability are spotted early, and educated quickly so as to not draw attention; as might happen with a Muggle-born witch or wizard in an all-Muggle community. As Wizarding families stay in contact in these communities, travel becomes much easier for whole families, as the community may pile resources instead of having to rely upon their own means.\n\nIn closure, the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy has impacted the Muggle world greatly, though it remains a secret to them. The Statute has kept the Wizarding world separate and safe from persecution; and kept the Muggle world from knowing of our existence. If it is still necessary remains up for debate, but it is unlikely to be annulled any time soon.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425489655", "subreddit": "harrypotter", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Dick caught in you magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it.

{"body": "&gt;No, just that they themselves don't have the knowledge.\n\nActually, that's not right; I'm not entirely interested in starting a quibble over semantics. And no, before I go any further, and get accused that that was what I was doing with this post, let me say this: the point of the post was to:\n\nA) Demonstrate why infallibilism is untenable, and thus, why agnosticism is unnecessary when it comes to labeling oneself as an atheist.\n\nB) Confer a professional philosopher's (Norman Malcolm) elucidations on the difference between strong and weak knowledge.\n\nC) Demonstrate in a coherent fashion how all of the labels have their own distinct meaning and build on each other (instead of being wishy-washy about what each dichotomy currently means)\n\nand \n\nD) Demonstrate how anyone cognizant of the theism/atheism debate cannot possibly \"lack a belief,\" and therefore, much justify their own claims, if they say they are an atheist.\n\nBack to agnosticism: \n\nWeak agnosticism is the belief that we currently don't know about god(s) existence, but that it is not necessarily unknowable.\n\nStrong agnosticism is the belief that we can never know about the existence of god(s).\n\nNeither speaks to the way you've defined agnosticism.\n\nThe way you've defined agnosticism is an upshot of one of these two beliefs.\n\n&gt; Yes, but more than that they also believe they have knowledge on the matter in question.\n\nRight, because they think it is possible to have knowledge about god's existence.\n\n&gt;Wait really? So the magic pixies that hide in my garden that you can't get any evidence for it is illogical to not believe in? Weird...\n\nAre magic pixies immaterial? Or do they exist IN your garden, like you said? Immaterial entities don't exist in spacetime, which is what precludes them from being debunked by science.\n\nNessie, Bigfoot, garden pixies, ghosts, demons, werewolves, vampires, unicorns, the Easter bunny, Santa, etc. are ALL material entities that exist IN spacetime (even if it is only for a few moments at a time); this means that if we don't find any physical evidence of their existence, which would be apparent because they are physical (read: spatiotemporal) beings, then we can conclude they don't exist on the basis of lack of scientific evidence where there should be some.\n\nOn the other hand, God would be immaterial. He is not a physical, material creature of spacetime, and therefore, he wouldn't be debunked by a lack of scientific evidence.\n\nWeird... right?\n\n&gt;There really is. Here, consider a court case. A jury must consider if a person is guilty or not-guilty. They are not asked if the person is innocent. This is the same as things are with the matter of a god. There either is a god or there isn't a god, a person either did the crime or did not. \n\nBut this is missing the scope of atheism. Atheism is the belief that \"one or more gods don't exist,\" it's not just the belief that \"The Christian God doesn't exist,\" because then other types of believers would be atheists; and it's not just the belief that \"1 god doesn't exist,\" because then polytheists would be atheists by definition.\n\n&gt;That is definitely a dichotomy. \n\nA false dichotomy, like pascals wager, when it comes to the position of atheism.\n\n&gt;However a person can indeed be not convinced a person is guilty without being convinced they are innocent. They do not think they are guilty and they do not think they are innocent. However the only thing they need to consider is do they think the person is guilty? If they do they say guilty. If they don't, which is either because you are convinced they are innocent or neither side has made a convincing case, you say not guilty. Or if that take doesn't work\n\nIt doesn't work as written, because you haven't demonstrated HOW (or given an example of how) someone can believe that someone is not guilty, yet not believe they are innocent.\n\n&gt;imagine someone flips a coin and catches it and doesn't tell you what it is. Do you believe it is heads? Do you believe it is tails? It is one of those two sure but you don't have to believe it is either one. Just because you do not believe it is tails does not mean you believe it is heads.\n\nCorrect, and this is called a binary answer space. This is completely different than what atheism entails, as atheism is the belief claim that one or more gods do not exist.\n\n&gt;Just because you do not believe there is a god does not mean you believe there is no god. They are very different things.\n\nBut an atheist doesn't just believe that \"god doesn't exist.\" Atheism is the belief that \"one or more gods do not exist.\"\n\nThat's the difference.

{"body": "The woman in the first picture is named Lynn Smith.  She's currently on death row for murders connected with her running a cocaine and heroin distribution ring.  Authorities have connected her crime ring to over 45 murders in the Atlanta area.  She was known for her extreme sadism towards her victims, which included police officers.  She would cut off her victims eyelids, and make them watch in a mirror as she peeled off their faces with a vegetable peeler.  She would leave strips of their skin hanging off their face, then cut off their fingers one by one and show them one by one.  She had a system where rats and police were castrated at the end.  The most egregious offenders were given valium as they were tortured to prevent them from going into shock before the torture, which sometimes lasted days, was over.  Sometimes, she would peel of their face, pack salt and hot sauce into the skin, staple the skin back in place, then peel it off over and over again.  Then she would send video tapes of the murders to the victims families and children as a warning to police or others who might investigate or snitch against her organization.\n\nShe also pioneered the trend of spiking heroin shipments with fentanyl, which greatly increased overdose deaths in the region.  She used her profits to establish connections with musicians, who she used to move her product across state lines, and schools.  The picture with Gucci here was presented as evidence at her trial, shortly after this picture was taken, she handed Gucci a suitcase with 24 kilos of heroin laced with fentanyl.  She was finally convicted when one of the children she used to carry her drugs was killed in a car accident and police found the drugs and a burner phone with her voice on it.  \n\nShe is currently on death row in Georgia.  She recently gave an interview to Vice, where she talked about torturing police officers and using Gucci's tours to distribute heroin and coke across the country.  She complained about conditions in prison, saying \"The commissary is so expensive I cannot meet my needs.  If you want to interview me again, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time that the reporter from vice noticed Lynn Smith was about 70 feet tall from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "I haven’t actually read the Lord of the Rings novels… nor have I seen any of the films (bar the first) within the last 5 or so years. So, bear with me.\n\n——-\n\nYoung Frodo stood up amidst all the ruckus. The fellowship seemed to immediately wane into silence—what was once a heated argument was now a mixture of confused looks, eyes darting back and forth between its members and the young hobbit who, as it may be, was now the centre of attention.\n\n“Gandalf,” Frodo said, immediately turning to the old wizard, “there has to be another way, hasn’t there?”\n\nGandalf could sense the fear in Frodo’s eyes; it was ever-growing. He lit his pipe, took a long, deep breath, and slowly exhaled. He, too, knew Frodo could never go to Mordor. It was simply a preposterous assumption — its only supporters, and I use the word ‘supporters’ lightly, as Samwise and Frodo himself were the few, were not the most knowledgeable concerning the dangers ahead.\n\n“Young Frodo…the Ring must be destroyed,” he slowly told the hobbit, taking another concerned breath of his pipe, “This is unavoidable.”\n\nHe began to pace around the circle; what eyes were before on Frodo now slowly followed his footsteps.\n\n“However..” he said, slowly turning around, “there may be less…or day I say, more, direct methods.”\n\nGandalf was keen, now. The Fellowship could sense an idea brewing within him, but not one was brave enough to prod him further. Instead, they waited patiently for the wizard to speak.\n\n“There are some magics…magics I haven't familiarized myself with in quite some time.”\n\n“Oh, nonsense,” someone shouted, standing up pridefully. It was Gimli, the dwarf, as everyone came to find out. “We have to go to Mordor. There is NO other way.”\n\nGandalf took another breath of his pipe, more slowly this time. Not a sense of urgency nor irritation overcame him.\n\n“The Ring must be destroyed, yes..but not necessarily by our hand.\n\nYou see, these magics…well, they are old magics, quite old indeed. They may allow us to bring about the Ring’s demise through the hands of the creator himself—“\n\n“Sauron?” Frodo asked, ever more curious.\n\n“Yes,” he replied. Everyone was keenly listening now. Even Gimli, who, while still standing, was as silent as the rest.\n\n“Well, go on then,” Frodo nudged, the bravest of the bunch. “What will we need?”\n\nGandalf turned to him once more. “Well, young Frodo…I’m going to need about tree fiddy.”\n\nIt was at that moment that everyone gasped. They realized that Gandalf hadn’t actually been the old wizard they once knew, but in fact a 500 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era.\n\n“Argh! You damned monster! We don’t have tree fiddy!” Gimli shouted, lunging towards him.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425591126", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had always loved music. Just the sound of it, feel of the rhythm filling a room. Music calmed me, relieved me.\n\nBut not today. \n\nI had been working at this particular job for a few years now. My purpose was to listen and make notes about classical music, things written by the Greats of the 18th century. Spend my days listening to music? Seems like a dream come true.\n\nI was eating a sandwich, humming along to the tune of Beethovens Symphony #3, Eroica. Many people refer to it as his worst work, but it is still Beethoven. You can't really go wrong with the B.\n\nI was listening along to the third aria of the piece when I heard something... *under* the music. Just a blip, a whisper, a bump in the flow. Frowning, I just chalked it up to a faulty recording and continued listening. Until three measures later, when the disruption came back. \n\nI frowned, rewinding the recording, then playing it again. I wasn't imagining it - it was something in the music. I decided to ignore it, but it started getting on my nerves, so I switched to a different arangement - Mozart Symphony Number twenty-six. Finished with my lunch, i sat back, relaxed. But the disruptions were in this one, too.\n\nNow I was confused. It wasn't my recordings, nor was it my imagination. I decided to look at a sound-graph of the music, and found something startling.\n\nAt each of these disruptions, a very, very low note or a very, very high note was created by the clashing of two specific notes by two specific instruments. The results on the graph were a sudden either positive or negative spike. Confused, I recorded these spikes on a graph, then looked at Eroica. The spikes, replicated in the exact same order, appeared. \n\nI was onto something now. I knew it. But what was it?\n\nEvery piece of music I listened to from the 1800s had these very same notes at these very same intervals. I spent days, weeks, months trying to figure out what it meant, then I had a revelation.\n\nMorse? No, it wasn't properly spaced to be morse code. Binary, though?\n\nThey didn't even have computers... why would this pattern be binary? I thought it was stupid. I was just pulling at straws at this point. But, when I converted the graphs into binary...\n\nA location. Or, more accurately, a set of coordinates.\n\nI took a break from my job, and traveled by plane to this location. It took me to a sandy cove by a small lake, and I was nervous as hell when I sat on the shore by the lake. *Now what?* I asked myself.\n\nFor hours, I sat there, trying to see if there was a hidden message or buried treasure or something. I got bored, then decided to play some music. \n\nI sat there listening to Mozart for a solid hour, then sighed, deciding to rent a hotel for the night and come back tomorrow. I turned to head to my car, then heard a voice behind me.\n\n\"Stop. Don't turn around.\" It was a throaty. deep-seated voice, like the sound of waves on a shore.\n\nI stood stock still, terrified to my very bones. \n\n\"So, you found the code, did you?\" The voice said. I nodded slowly, then realized that I had my back turned to whoever it was. \n\n\"Y-yes. Yes I did.\" The voice let out a slow chuckle.\n\n\"Three centuries I've been waiting for someone to come here. Those great men, those wonderful musicians - they knew what i wanted, but they could not give it to me. Maybe you will.\"\n\nI cleared my throat. \"What... What do you want from me?\" I asked, and the voice hummed behind me.\n\n\"Well. Keeping in track exchange rates and inflation... I'd say about $3.50.\"\n\nIt was then that I realized that the person talking to me was eight stories tall and covered in green scales, and I chuckled. \"You got me again, Loch Ness Monster.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425665817", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Discussion can be both serious, comical, and anywhere in between. You can make serious posts calling out meta cancer or you can make posts where you mock meta cancer so that we can all laugh at these people and shame them in this subreddit. This sub isn't even two weeks old so you're going to see people using it in different ways. You're also going to see shitposting from metacancer in this sub and a lot of the users have been banned. Some use alts to troll and screw with subscribers. It's going to happen but will be dealt with better over time by the mods and subscribers. Right now, the upvote system will filter out good and bad posts and content. Over time the mods will start to mod a little tighter and start guiding the subreddit in a more clear direction. Right now, it's a free for all among posters and the hope is that the best posts rise to the top of the sub so that people can vote and try to establish the type of content they want to see here.\nOne thing needs to be clear among subscribers and that is I'm an atheist. I come from quite the religious upbringing, but I let go of it. My family and few select friends know, but other than that, it's kept secret. I actually play drums for my church. This was during some event where a friend and I went somewhere for something while our pastor had just begun preaching. My house was on the way back so we decided to stop and smoke right quick and head back because they had food there, haha. But I trouble no one about their religion. I used to be the kind of atheist who constantly brought it up, but that's because I had just converted and I was in that state of mind where I had just found this new way of life and I wanted to share it. Kind of like a Christian getting saved, or being born again. When I got \"saved\" I wanted to do the same thing and tell everyone about Jesus and bring him up in any kind of conversation, but eventually I got over it and just let people live and that's how I am now with my atheism. You call me delusional. You claim I'm in a cult. You're calling me one of those Bitcoin crazy people. To your eyes I may be. But I am not. I am NOT forcing anyone to BUY Bitcoins, HODL, all hail the decentralized system to bring down the banks!, NO. Just no. I was and am simply asking for help.\nIF YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP, JUST WALK AWAY. Next time a homeless guy genuinely asks for help, maybe you should lecture him on how he shouldn't have been that way in the first place. That should help him. Right? People like you think you are so smart, and you probably are, but too blind to see what really matters.\nAnd you called this project based on greed.\nCan I ask you where you got all that from?\nThis is what I sexually Identify as ... an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me \"Apache\" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly.

Fuck you and your rules, you sounds like a fucking theist sucking the dick of your Almight Mods and Admins. So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, \"See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to.\" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said \"Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all.\" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment. To tell you the truth, I've never thought about it. I've never thought of me doing a whole lot that I would categorize as brave. Other people have said that what I do standing up to the establishment and speaking my piece of mind and not backing down as being something brave, but I don't think of it in that manner. So I don't have a good answer for that, but I appreciate it when people compliment me on sticking to my principles. If you downvote freedom of speech, you're basically like the nazis before they started killing. A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist\n”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”\nAt this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.\n”How old is this rock, pinhead?”\nThe arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”\n”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”\nThe professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!\nThe students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.\nThe professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.\nSemper Fi. CTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed.\nWait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\".

{"body": "I met Reggie last summer at a fan meet-n-greet event. He was gracious to everyone, genuine, a gentleman. I had the opportunity to ask him a question at our dinner. I stood up, cleared my throat, and asked \"Can you spot me tree fiddy?\"\n\nNo, that's a joke. Seriously though, I asked him \"Tonight you've spoken about coaches and players you've played with over the years who have obviously influenced you on the field. Who do you credit for making Reggie Wayne the man we know off the field?\"\n\nHis demeanor changed immediately. We were all laughing from previous exchanges, off the cuff remarks and the like. But this hit home. He immediately got teary eyed and a bit choked up. His voice wasn't as strong in this response, \"My parents. They raised me right, and I'll always love them.\" He lowered the mic to his lap and sniffed. I looked him in the eye, hoping to return any level of genuine feels that he just put out. \"Thanks Reggie, I appreciate it,\" was all I could say. \n\nLater, after dinner my fiance and I joined a queue to shake hands with him and have a picture taken together [(and sign a football in the process)](http://imgur.com/7b4V3tu). As we walked up to him I said, \"Reggie, thanks for answering my question tonight.\" \"Of course,\" he responded, \"I'm glad you asked.\" \n\nI continued, \"Reggie, you didn't even realize it at the time, but last year you helped a good friend of mine.\" I won't get into details, but I have a friend who made the squad the previous year, and had his first payout from the team stolen out of his locker. It was what he had to live on, to start his career on. When the smoke cleared, Reggie stepped up and took the equivalent out of his own wallet, handed it to him and said \"Don't worry about paying this back. We need you on this team, this is what teammates do.\"\n\nI said, \"Thank you so much for looking after my friend. You have no idea how happy I am that you are a Colt.\"\n\n\"Of course, wait, you know (name withheld)?\" He asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I answered, \"We kinda grew up together.\"\n\n\"That's great!\" Reggie responded.\n\n\"Just be sure to give him a hard time next time you see him.\"\n\n\"Sure thing.\" He said with a grin.\n\nYou might hear stories about Reggie's demeanor on the sidelines, his game-time attitude, but do not ever say Reggie was anything less than a stand-up gentleman. My heart has sunk with today's news.

{"body": "Alright, here it goes, for my first post I'm going to sum up the series. I don't know how to do spoiler tags, so here goes:\n\n...\n\nMetal Gear - 1989. Snake, a Foxhound rookie (but otherwise decorated soldier) goes into Outer Heaven in order to rescue Grey Fox, the company's top operative (toprative) and Dr. Kio Marv, a guy who made a bacterium called Oilix - a bacteria that shits out petrolium. Grey Fox's last transmission was simply \"Metal... Gear!?\" NOBODY KNOWS WHAT A METAL GEAR IS BUT SPOILERS ITS A GIANT FUCKING ROBOT Snake's CO is a guy named Big Boss, who is a wacky Sean Connery looking fellow who asks the important questions, like whether or not the guards are wearing \"Cute little sailor suits.\"\n\nAnyway you save them both, and Big Boss is the bad guy. He sent Snake in thinking he'd fuck up and then he could report back to the US that there is no Metal Gear, Grey Fox, Oilix, or Loch Ness Monster but now we know they're all real.\n\nMetal Gear 2: Solid Snake - 1995. Snake is sent to a place called Zanzibarland which is basically Disneyland with nukes. Long story short, Big Boss is alive, Grey Fox defected, there's another robot (or Metal'ed Gear, if you prefer) and Snake is pissed. Well, not really, but he's not happy about it. Big Boss reveals he's Snake's dad, Snake laughs at the irony cos he JUST finished Star Wars, and then he shoots Big Boss in the fucking face. Suck it, dad. \"You should've pulled out.\"-Solid Snake\n\nSnake retires to Alaska and the series ends.\n\n...\n\nEXCEPT METAL GEAR SOLID\n\n1998 - Shadow Moses\n\nSnake gets pulled out of his drunken haze by Roy Campbell, his CO from MG2SS, and from now on the series will be in bullet points:\n\n-Snake infiltrates and Alaskan military base\n-Base is run by Foxhound operatives: Liquid Snake, Revolver Ocelot, Sniper Wolf, Vulcan Raven, and Steve Buschemi\n-Snake kills them all\n-Liquid is his bro, but they're clones so not really\n-Ocelot doesn't get killed. He steals the data on the new Metal Gear and ends up talking with the president, Kevin Spacey. Kevin Spacey is actually the third clone. See the Netflix series House of Cards for more information.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2\n\n2001. Two years after shadow moses. Snake infiltrates a tanker and fucks it up, but steals everybody's dog tags and gets a longer bandanna. He gets high for two years until\n\nRAIDEN APPEARS\n\nMetal Gear Rising - The Devil May Cry of Metal Gears\n\nThe Year Is 20XX\n\nDr Wiley Is At It Again\n\nMetal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater - 1964\n\nBig Boss kills his mom because Lyndon B Johnson was an asshole. Forrest Gump was in Tslenoyarsk, and saw the whole thing go down.\n\nMetal Gear Solid Portal Ops\n\nNOTHING HAPPENED! NOBODY WAS THERE! IT WAS A BAD DREAM! WHY AREN'T YOU USING YOUR PSP TO PLAY SNES GAMES!?\n\nMetal Gear Solid: Peace Walker\n\nTired of war, Big Boss and his roommate Kaz take a relaxing vacation. They shoot balloons, fight dinosaurs, and play hide and seek with a Russian man. At the end of the day, they visit the beach and hop in a Love Box. SIMPLE AND CLEAN IS THE WAY THAT YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL, TONIGHT\n\nI'm pretty sure that's everything.

{"body": "When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms. She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet. His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name. Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.\n\nJoe didn't give a shit. He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either. Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom. His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\". His name was now legally Adam Adams. Why? All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\n\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe, my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it. He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember. But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage. The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me. Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son. This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\n\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.\n\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on. She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does. My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\n\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.\n\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story. She does. Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words). While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out.\n\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved. After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad. I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story. When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her. She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was an 500-foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again. But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one.\n\ntl;dr: Friend's mom is an overprotective bitch, I get mad at her for being an overprotective bitch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425872279", "subreddit": "Smite", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You've got a lot of answers already, but I might as well throw my hat in.\n\n\n&gt;I really don't want to offend anyone\n\n\nGenerally speaking, I don't think most people here are going to be offended by questions, provided they're asked honestly. Many atheists are quite happy to engage with theists in conversation, and talk about what atheism is about try and establish an understanding.\n\n\nWe are painfully aware of how few people, in America at least, fully understand what atheism is. That's something we want to address, and it's a good sign when people come to us to ask. If you're here to talk and not to preach, then your questions are welcome.\n\n\n\n&gt;So the questions I wanted to ask are; Why are you an atheist (if you know)?\n\n\nAnd here is where my answer is going to become generic: I'm an atheist because I have never been provided with any good reason to believe a god or gods exist.\n\n\nFor any proposal, there is what is called the 'default position', or the 'null position'. In cases where the proposition is that something exists (in this case, a god), then the default position is to disbelieve until evidence for the thing is presented.\n\n\nIt would be the same if we were talking about unicorns, bigfeet or the loch ness monster. Until evidence is provided, the correct position is to withhold belief.\n\n\nNobody has ever presented evidence for a god or gods. Therefore I adopt the default position of non-belief.\n\n\n&gt;Were you raised into a different religion?\n\n\nI come from a very secular country, where most people my age are atheists. My family were not religion either and I did not have a religious upbringing (if you ignore the attempted indoctrination that took place at my first school).\n\n\n&gt;Do you find it awkward to be around Christians during Christmas?\n\n\nHonestly....I don't actually *know* any Christians. Atheism is so commonplace in this country that virtually every single person I know is either an atheist or a second or third generation Muslim from immigrant parents (the former being far, far more common than the latter).\n\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that we celebrate Christmas too. We simply celebrate it as a secular holiday based on goodwill and being together with family.\n\n\n\n&gt;How old were you when you realized you were an atheist? How did your friends react? How did your family?\n\n\nAs implied above, I've been an atheist since birth. My friends and family are also atheist.\n\n\n&gt;What is one thing you wish people would understand about atheism?\n\n\nThat we don't 'hate god' and that we're not all 'just angry'. Also, that we're not trying to take anyone's rights away; we simply don't want government agencies to endorse religion.\n\n\n&gt;Are you scared of death?\n\n\nNot scared of death, just scared of dying.\n\n\n&gt;Has anyone cut ties with you because of your lack of faith?\n\n\nNope.\n\n\n&gt;What do you personally think happens after death?\n\n\nI think that, once my brain stops working, so do I.

Older sister would point at different headstones saying \"That's your real mom, there's one of your real brothers.

Returned by Julio Jones to the 24 yard line.\n\nFirst play of the ensuing drive:   Roethlisberger bombs one deep to KELVIN BENJAMIN WHO IS WIIIIDE OPEN.  Benjamin gets tackled after a 47 yard gain.\n\nNext play:  QB Sneak.  Roethlisberger runs it up the gut himself for a gain of two.  But wait, there's an injury on the play?  Brian Cushing is holding his right arm as it appears to have been... popped?  Mike, this is a catastrophe!!  Brian Cushing has never used steroids in his life, he just overinflates his arms!!  After being taken off the field in what will be looked back upon as the most controversial minute in football history, Maresen realizes that he has no bench players due to a drafting error.  The crowd goes silent as the fullback Kuhn takes the field at Cushing's vacant MLB spot.\n\n2nd and 6:  End Around with Julio Jones.  Julio receives the ball AND KUHN IS IN THE BACKFIELD WITH THE BIG HIT.  JULIO CRUMPLES FOR A LOSS OF FIVE.  The crowd is going berserk right now.  Julio looks like a ragdoll after a hurricane, but he slowly gets back up to his feet.\n\n3rd and 11:  This is a big third down right here.  Roethlisberger takes the snap in shotgun.  Snaps the ball, play action, AND KUHN IS THERE AGAIN WITH THE HIT.  Julius Thomas has just gotten bowled over by Kuhn AND THE BALL IS OUT.  JOHN KUHN SCOOPS IT UP AND TAKES IT TO BUGGIE'S 3 YARD LINE BEFORE BEING TACKLED BY JARED VELDHEER.  \n\n1st and goal:  Easy three yard run here by John Kuhn as he stiffarms Cameron Wake and Kiko Alonso at THE SAME TIME.  However, as the crowd gasps, Phillip Rivers is on the ground grasping at his ankles.  It appears the seismic waves caused by Kuhn's footsteps may have tripped him up.  He is taken off the field for medical review. Extra point is good, 28-30 Buggie.\n\n2:48 left in the fourth quarter now.  Buggie fans are getting nervous after that huuuge momentum change.  As Maresen once again sends the kickoff to the endzone, Julio kneels it. \n\n1st and 10:  Roethlisberger looks mildly concussed as he stands in the shotgun.  He snaps the ball, barely not having to call a timeout.  Short checkdown pass to JT, tackle made by Greg Hardy.  Gain of five\n\n2nd and 5:  Roethlisberger takes the snap out of a pistol formation.  He airs it out deep to Benjamin BUT WHO ELSE IS THERE BUT JOHN KUHN.  KUHN LEAPS INTO THE AIR WITH AN ATHLETIC ONE HANDED CATCH.  Never seen one of those before.  He pulls in the ball and slides to a halt.  The stadium is taken aback.  The tension is so thick it could be cut with a knife right now.  John Harbaugh is in the crowd shouting at the ref that something's probably illegal right now.\n\n2:06 left in the fourth quarter, Maresen's ball at Buggie's 48 yard line.  Phillip Rivers is not back in the game yet.  Filling in for Phillip Rivers is... John Kuhn?  After the game, Maresen would go on to fire all of his coaches for incompetence and for filling their 53 man roster with long snappers and punters instead of backups.  As Kuhn takes the snap, he hands the ball off to... JOHN KUHN!!!  JOHN KUHN IS RUMBLING DOWN THE FIELD, TRUCKING PLAYERS LEFT AND RIGHT.  IN THE WORDS OF JOHN MADDEN, \"Football don't need to make no sense if John Kuhn is playin'\"  JOHN KUHN SCORES THE 48 YARD TOUCHDOWN.  THE STADIUM IS DEATHLY SILENT.  XPA is good.  35-30 Maresen, 2:00 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nMaresen sets up to drive it deep and IT'S AN ONSIDE KICK.  EVERYBODY IS REALLY CONFUSED AS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING AND IN THE FRACKUS JOHN KUHN DIVES UPON THE BALL.  HE IS UNTOUCHED AND RETURNS IT FOR YET ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN.  GRUDEN HAS LEFT BY THIS POINT AND IS MAKING A SMOOTHIE.  MIKE TIRICO IS SEEN LYING ON THE GROUND IN THE BROADCAST HYPERVENTILATING.  Buggie is shouting profanity on the sideline which CBS cuts to and replays exactly 23 times during the commercial break.  \n\nMaresen sets up to kickoff yet again.  3:50 left on the clock.  It was at about this point that I realized that John Kuhn was actually a eight story high crustacean from the Mesozoic Era.  \"GIMME TREE FIDDY\"  he yells at Maresen as he realizes he has earned the last of his incentives.  \n\n\"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy you stinking loch ness monsta!\" Maresen yells back!\n\nRoger Goodell resigns afterwards.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425961848", "subreddit": "nfl", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Pre-vet major here: dogs are closely related to cats enough so that they can actually develop feline leukemia.  It has to do with the way that the reverse transcriptase in retroviruses (like FLV) interact with the cells in the animal to insert their genetic material into the cells and infect them.  The bovine growth hormone in the burgers, while harmless to humans, includes reverse transcriptase as well as the genetic material that causes FLV.  If ingested by the dog, they can, because of their close linkage to felines, develop FLV.  It usually lies dormant until an extremely stressful event occurs, causing the cortisol levels in the dog's body to shoot up and suppress the immune system.  This allows the virus to multiply and infect more cells to the point that it becomes an issue, and is potentially deadly.  It is typically misdiagnosed as some other canine retrovirus.  In the meantime, however, these dogs can infect cats with FLV.  If you want your dog to be okay, I'll gladly direct you as to how to help him.

{"body": "When I lived in Eugene, I was living under a friend's staircase inside their duplex. So not \"living on the street\" homeless, but not \"registered tenant on an apartment lease and totally safe\".\n\nI had been out of work for almost three months when I got a job with a temp agency ringing a bell for a Salvation Army bucket outside a Fred Meyer.\n\nI didn't even own a real coat so I'd layer up with a long sleeve underneath a short sleeve, with a pullover hoody then zip up hoody or zip up jacket.\n\nIt was fucking freezing. The wind had a mean bite to it and the humidity made the wind chill worse.\n\nIt was in a pretty upper class neighborhood. So one day about a week before Christmas this really pretty middle aged soccer mom rolls up in her big fancy SUV. She walks in with her 8 or 9 year old kid in tow. I opened the door for her and greeted her trying to get eye contact like they tell me to. She saw me so I tried to cheerfully stutter \"Merry Christmas!\" like the Salvation Army taught me.\n\nThe more you make people acknowledge you the more they'll donate.\n\nShe looked at me and got a really angry look on her face. I just shrugged it off. People glared at me all the time. Lets face it, its basically just legalized spanging. \n\nShe came out about 20 or 30 minutes later and I didn't even see her come out but she angrily shouts \"HEY! BELL GUY!\"\n\nSo I panic thinking here comes some bullshit hassle. And she goes \"all right now don't you DARE tell me you can't take these.\" and she reaches into one of the grocery bags and pulls out these really, really nice brand new gloves. Wool lined, black leather. She just pops them apart and throws the tags in her bag. Then she pulls out a wool hat, pops the tag off of it. Thrusts them at me.\n\n\"Its FREEZING out here! You should NOT be standing out here in the cold like this without taking care of yourself.\"\n\nThen she put about tree fiddy in the bucket.\n\nThen she walks away, stops, turns around and says, \"I saw you here yesterday. You're a good looking kid. You seem really smart, too. You're better than this job.\"\n\nLoaded her kid and her groceries up and drove away.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425968498", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 51, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As a weird coincidence, I actually met my fiancée - the person I trust the most in the world - when she asked for \"tree fiddy\". \n\nBefore I met her, my fiancée was homeless. I walked by her one day and she asked me for change, which is normal enough, but it was strange because she specifically asked me for $3.50. I don't really believe in giving money to the homeless, but the request caught my attention, so I offered to buy her something to eat instead.\n\nWe went into a cheap restaurant and I started asking her about her life. It was fascinating. The poor girl had been abused and neglected since birth. Her father left when she was three, and her mother claimed that he abused her. She didn't know if it was true or not - her mother was a compulsive liar. By the time she was 13, though, her mom got addicted to crack and left her, too, so from then on she was alone.\n\nShe actually wanted the money to go see her estranged father. I was a little worried about how safe she'd be, so instead of just giving her the money, I offered to accompany her to make sure she was safe.\n\nThe meeting turned out fine, if a bit tearjerking. More importantly, we fell in love on the way. In short time, I invited her to move in with me. \n\nYou can imagine the grief that I got from friends and family when they learned I was living with a woman who had been homeless when I met her. My mother was convinced she wanted something from me, and my friends were worried she'd get back on drugs -- she'd been selling LSD to get by before I met her. \n\nStill, I found I could trust her more than anyone in the world, and she asked for nothing. Even when I offered her things or took her shopping, she'd turn them all down, telling me the nice clothes and jewelry weren't what she needed.\n\nWhen I proposed, I let her pick out her own ring. She picked out the smallest, cheapest ring I'd ever seen, and still looked embarrassed about asking for it. I smiled and told her of course she could buy it, and asked her how much she needed. \n\nShe looked me in the eye, smiled shyly, and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it's about this time I noticed that I was bethrothed to be married to a 500 foot tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said, \"Goddammit, Lochness Monster! I told you when we met! I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nIt was heartbreaking to say goodbye.

{"body": "Pt. 1\n\n&gt;There is a default position on absolutely everything.\n\nWell, now you've changed your wording. The phrase \"null hypothesis\" was not the proper term to use. Like I said before, that is used when conjecturing an explanatory model, such as \"god created the universe,\" which is much different than the question concerning one's personal beliefs with regard to the question of \"does god exist?\"\n\nLastly, there is no \"default position\" on the issue of god's existence, just as there is no default position on the existence of mathematical objects as entailed by mathematical platonism. If you haven't heard of it, then you lack a position on the topic. That's pretty simple. \n\nThe default on the theism/atheism debate is a \"lack of a position,\" as it would be for a baby. This is why calling a baby an atheist really doesn't make sense. A baby lacks either position. If atheism is really defined as a lack of a belief in god(s), then everybody (and everything, including theists/atheists/rocks/stars/etc.) but henotheists are atheists, which detracts from the usefulness of the term \"atheism.\" If everyone is an atheist, we're back at square one: what makes an atheist different from other people?\n\nImplicit atheism is just a reference to one of the many parts of the spectrum that a self-proclaimed atheist, i.e. a person who believes that no gods exist, would fall onto. For cases in which he has not heard of a particular god, he is an implicit atheist; but this does not allow for one to call babies atheists, because babies don't take a position on the existence of god, and thus cannot be atheists.\n\n\"Lack of belief\" as the most inclusive definition of atheism must not be misconstrued: it is referring to the fact that atheists -that is, people who believe no gods exist- cannot possibly be explicitly atheist about every conception of god there is. Therefore, they are going to be implicitly atheist about some gods.\n\nTo misuse this label, and apply a position to a person/thing not-currently-capable of holding a position is disingenuous, and speaks to a political-hypocrisy that atheists should wish to combat: no small child is a theist, because they lack the mental capacity to maintain a position on such an issue; likewise, children, dogs, and rocks are not atheists, because they are incapable of holding such a position given their mental capacities.\n\n&gt;So, agnostic atheism - not believing in Gods but not knowing - is the default.\n\nSo truly, this is incorrect. There is no default position, because being non-partisan for lack of an ability to do otherwise is merely a lack of a position. The default \"mindset,\" which is what we're really trying to come to understand (i.e. what someone believes) is \"no position\" or, lack of a belief. Again, to disingenuously misconstrue the inclusive definition of atheism so as to include such persons/things is simply incorrect: atheism is a position, things that don't/can't have positions aren't atheists. \"Lacking a belief\" is strictly referring to the fact that self-proclaimed atheists can not explicitly disbelieve in all god conceptions (which, for all intents and purposes, is impossible).\n\n&gt;That position is: I don't believe in anything you say but I don't know for sure. \n\nThis position described above is atheism. It's not agnostic atheism, because knowledge is not infallible; therefore, there is no reason to claim that one believes, but doesn't know that god doesn't exist. If you believe that god doesn't exist (as conjectured by your interlocutor), then you think what they're saying is untrue, and you also have reason to believe that it is not true: that being that \"there is no good reason\" to believe in god (a reason in itself). Is this a strong reason? Absolutely not. It's incredibly weak: but it's the fallible starting point from which the fledgling atheist grows into an epistemologically rigorous philosopher (as atheism has absolutely nothing to do with science, because science doesn't care about one's personal beliefs. The default position in science, which is exploring explanatory hypotheses, is always agnosticism). The point is that if you think something is true, and you have a reason to think it is true -and you also understand the nature of knowledge as inextricable from belief- then you realize that you think you know that god doesn't exist, and that therefore, there is no reason to proclaim, \"I believe, but I don't know.\" What you really mean to say is, \"I believe, and thus, I think I know, but I don't know that I know,\" which is how everybody is on the subject, so it's not even worth discussing.\n\nA reminder: knowledge is known in two senses, and if you deny this, then scientists know absolutely nothing, because they know nothing for sure, if \"for sure\" is meant as \"absolute certainty,\" or \"won't change their mind given future events/circumstances\" as shown by Norman Malcolm in his analysis of \"knowledge.\" Therefore, there is no reason to say, \"I'm an agnostic atheist.\" The quadrant chart is ratheism apologetics at its finest.\n\n&gt;I think this is fair to say. Is there a problem with this view?\n\nIf this is the case, then calling oneself an agnostic atheist is said under false pretenses (and again, that's not even mentioning the misunderstanding of \"knowledge\" that I summarized above). You're really an ignostic atheist, or a theological non-cognitivist: that is to say, you address god on a claim by claim basis, because you realize the meaninglessness of the term \"god\" as known in general. It's disingenuous to claim to be an agnostic when you know for a fact that you are gnostic about some (in fact, most- once you realize how \"knowledge\" is actually defined) god-claims.\n\n&gt;Sure though it's awfully inconvenient - we used to be able to see him and he seems to be MIA for a while now.\n\nNow that we've developed the natural sciences, we realize where we were ignorant. But \"god\" as a non-empirical \"entity\" (for lack of better words) has always been known throughout the ages, but just under different names: i.e. \"the one,\" \"the demiurge,\" etc. It's only recently that we've decided to use the word \"god\" to refer to these concepts, instead of thinking of gods as the anthropomorphic entities that we enjoy reading about when it comes to greek literature (etc.). We've refined our concept of god over time and relabeled things that weren't originally called god, \"God.\"\n\n&gt;You are. I have no proof that unicorns don't exist.\n\nBut you also have no proof that the **theory** of gravity is true; and yet you claim to know the theory of gravity is true. The fact remains that when it comes to empirical endeavors (and others as well of course, but this is used a salient example as you are probably a science fan like myself), we claim weak (provisional, fallible) knowledge.\n\n&gt;It's possible that the actual animal (rather than its magical properties) did actually exist at one point. \n\nIt's logically possible, but where there should be physical evidence (a unicorn would be a physical animal that lives on earth, no?) there is absolutely none; and so for our purposes (as in the rest of science) we can claim to know based on a lack of evidence where there should be, that there are no unicorns. This is, again, knowledge in the provisional sense. Do we say there would be absolutely nothing to change our minds on such a subject? Of course not. It may come to light that unicorns really did/do exist, and that we just aren't aware of them. But according to our best understandings of science in numerous fields, we know that unicorns don't exist, because we only have good reason to believe they don't- as we do with bigfoot, nessie, ghosts, etc.\n\n&gt;Yes it is. If you're into Judaism or Christianity, God definitely used to appear and talk to you. Some people claim he still does. So, in the context of my typical debates with Christians, this behavior is expected.\n\nOkay, but we know, in a strong sense of the word know, that that god is illogical. In either conception (judaic or christian), if god can help us by providing us knowledge (judaism) or by preventing us from all going to hell (christianity) then there is absolutely no logical reason he cannot intervene now to stop rapes and murders at the least: and thus, the problem of evil shows that this god doesn't exist, logically speaking.\n\nBut the PoE doesn't necessarily work for all concepts of gods, and there are plenty of god conceptions (such as the one I was beginning to elucidate) that would entail him being omnibenevolent, yet not being able to intervene in spacetime (for one reason or another). Non-interventionist gods (that still have minds, with wills, who have teleological aims for the universe, and judge us in the afterlife- which for all intents and purposes would fall under the definition \"god\") do not fall to such an argument. \n\n&gt;Again, if the context is the Abrahamic God then this isn't an issue. \n\nBut we already know that that god doesn't exist. Wasting our time with such inane conceptions of god is a pointless, masturbatory exercise. If someone is engaging you and telling you that their god can intervene in spacetime as said in the bible, the PoE is such an incredibly strong argument that there is literally nothing that should change your mind on such a conception.\n\nDoes that mean you should say god in general doesn't exist? Absolutely not. It just means that it is rather easily known (provisionally speaking, of course) that no religion's myths (this is not a pejorative use of myth, myths are helpful in different senses than science, but we're not going to get into that here) actually reflect the reality of god, if he exists.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426070261", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "yeah tell me about it\n\nsorry for the rant, but I had this one weird encounter when I was in 11th grade. I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\n\nOne day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\n\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\"  I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies?  I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\n\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy.  The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free.  So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.  \n\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence.  I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\n\nNope.\n\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"  \n\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too.  He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.  \n\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\n\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars.  Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\n\nFast forward one year.  I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.  \n\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\n\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\n\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.  \n\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.  He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"  Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again!  I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\n**TL;DR: Kid wants drugs, I give him some, sort of[.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wawni/whats_the_biggest_dick_move_youve_ever_done_to_a/c5bsqgv)**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426079806", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 62, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I created a card game back in my senior year of high school for an English project with a couple of friends doing the art.  It was based on the duels of Hamlet, and let you choose from a bunch of Hamlet characters.  After getting an A on the project, my friends and I made it less Hamlet-focused.  We added characters from our favorite comics, movies, and books, and some originals as well.  We played it during lunch time, after school, and when we hung out.  \nWe continued to play it for a few years, until I left it in my apartment in Boston when I moved back to upstate NY.  I had none of it, but I wanted to play.  So I began making cards on my computer using paper drawings and a scanner, which I later replaced with a drawing tablet.  We were able to remember about 30 cards from the original game, which was probably about 2/3 of the original deck.  We also added a bunch of new cards, tightened up the rules, and spent a lot more time on the art.  The artwork is primarily my friend Evan's, though some is my own, and some of it is public domain work.  Characters now include Hamlet, Ali Baba, Judith (from the Bible), Lilith (from Jewish mythology), Nikola Tesla, Rosie the Riveter, the Tin Woodman (from Wizard of Oz), Rapunzel, and Sherloch Nessy (a hybrid of the Loch Ness Monster and Sherlock Holmes), in addition to a few extra originals!\n\nPlease check out this game if you like games like Munchkin, if you like Shakespeare, or if you just enjoy a good game with some humor.  You can purchase it at this address:\nhttps://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/hamlet:-the-unofficial-and-mostly-unrelated-card-game\n\nRead below if you'd like a basic rundown of how the game works:\n\nYou would choose a character, and draw your hand.  There are two card types: weapons, and \"action\" cards, that add rules or cause an immediate (or long-lasting) effect.  You basically take turns attacking (and blocking), trying to widdle down your opponent's health to zero.  Weapons each have their own attack and blocking power, and the success of an attack is determined by combining the rolling numbers on the weapon with those on your character card and rolling a die, so certain weapons are more beneficial to certain characters.  There's a combination of luck and strategy that is very satisfying, and the action cards can do things like dealing damage, improving the odds of a successful roll, skipping a turn, forcing your opponent to fashion a nun's habit out of nearby materials and wear it for the rest of the game, or demand that characters say \"hey nonny nonny hey\" before attacking or it is unsuccessful.  The game is good for two people or a larger group, and definitely has a sense of humor with it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426101723", "subreddit": "nerdist", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If you're over 6 feet tall or weigh more than 180 this deck is the board of your dreams. \n\nSet up: \n\nI used a quarter inch riser, with Randal 180s, red divine city slashers, eximius bearings, and the standard grip it comes with... I want to say Flypaper grip?\n\nIf you want to pop ollies, this board is for you! \nIf you want to do trick flips this board is for you!\nIf you want to bomb parking garages &amp; hills this board is for you!\n\nI've never spoken so highly about a board, but the Havoc 1 is hands down my favorite board. \n\nHavoc version 2\n\nSpecs:\n\nL: 37.5” \nW: 9.875”\nWB: 23.625”, 24.625”, 25.375”, 26.375”\n8-PLY MAPLE LAYUP(w/ optional Formica top sheet), ROCKER, W-CONCAVE, FLARED &amp; CNC WHEEL WELLS, KICKTAIL\n\nThe havoc 2 has some upgrades in comparison to the 1. For starters the wheel flares were cut more precise. They went from 4 layers to 8. This further increases the clearance &amp; looks cool as fuck. \n\nThe nose is more aerodynamic. Did I stutter? They redid the shape of the nose\n\nThere's more concave to the deck in comparison to the first version. Grant also added a W concave to the board, which as a flat footed fuck I HATE! \n\nThe board has a lil bit of rocker to it when compared to the first version. All in all if you like that w concave, and liked everything about the first havoc you can't go wrong with the second havoc.

We planned to hoist ourselves around Cape Bermuda, since we were hired to hunt down a rumored massive beast that lurked around this here Cape. \n\nIt was the second week at sea. The men were getting restless. Not a sight of the beast. Some were beginning to wonder if the rumors were even true, but they had already been paid half, they couldnt back out now. \n\nAnother 3 weeks go by. The biggest fish they had seen was a tuna fish. The rations were getting low. The Captain was getting ready to turn the ship and sail for land when we heard it. \n\n\"BHEEEEEEEEELLWWWWW\" \n\nWe turned and saw the biggest shark ive ever had the pleasure of seeing. It was headed straight for us, ignoring the fact we were a 100Foot whaling ship. The dumb ass poo deck boy shouted \"Ive never heard a shark make a noise before!\". Poor Jonny. The shark hit the side of the boat and he flew off the side.  We never saw him again, poor lad. \n\nThe Captain shouted \"GOD DAMMIT LADS DONT JUST STAND THERE! GRAB THE SPEARS AND HARPOONS!\"\n\nWe all snapped out of our shock and grabbed whatever we could, hoping we would live this encounter. Bilbo was the first to attack. \n\n\"DIE YOU BEAST\" He shouted and threw the spear. \n\n\"GOD DAMMIT YOU HIT DICKINSON.\" \n\nSo we threw Bilbo overboard. That manged to give us a few second break from the onslaught the shark was giving us. \n\nBAM. The ship suddenly shook and three men went overboard, the First Mate one of em. \n\nThe Captain, being old hunting buddies with the first mate since they were lads, screamed \"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US MONSTER!?\" \n\nThe shark then stopped, swam to the side of the Captain and stuck its nose out of the water. \n\n\"I need about tree fitty\" \n\nIt was about this time we noticed that this \"shark\" was actually a Loch Ness Monster, a giant crustacean  from the Paleolithic Era.  \n\n\"I AINT GIVING YOU NO TREE FITTY YOU GOD DAM LOCH NESS MONSTER!\" My captain shouted. \n\nThe Loch Ness Monster got so mad he grabbed me and bit off my leg! And then my hand! \n\nHe said \"Well how bout two fitty now?\" \n\nMy brave brave Captain said \"I AINT GIVING YOU NO TWO FITTY.

I started walking the other way, holding back tears, hoping he wouldn't be following me.\n\nI somehow made it back to work and told my boss what happened. My boss thought I was fucking crazy, but told me he would drive me once they closed in 50 minutes, so I decided to wait. \n\nI was almost back at my apartment when I fucking see this guy waiting at the front door.

You were clearly playing your character's stupidity up for laughs, but the dumb mistakes were too dumb, revealing this as a false story and prompting readers to check the end for a punchline. The average Redditor demands to be entertained immediately, and will not put effort into reading superfluous details, like how long you have worked at the bakery. Overall I'd rate this 3/50.

{"body": "Charizard is one of the older pokemon. It's been around since the first generation of games released in the mid-90's on GameBoy. Being the fully evolved form of one of the three starter pokemon from that generation, which only had 3 true Dragon-type pokemon, it does not bear the dragon type itself. The Pokemon on the left is from the more recent generation of games (6th gen?) where the tropes of Pokemon had been more well established. Pokemon in an evolutionary group tend to share the same type, and Sliggoo (?) is the larval stage of a pokemon with the Dragon type who is more or less dragon-shaped. In Pokemon, Dragon is a type that means it generally does not behave like a Grass-type, a Water-Type, or a Fire-Type, but more like a mythical critter like the Loch Ness monster. It comes with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some moves are only usable and useful to pokemon of certain types. As a Fire-type, Charizard receives a bonus for using Fire-type moves. As a Flying-type, Charizard can learn Fly, a strong Flying-type move that has transportation applications. Since a pokemon can only be two types at a time, the developers at GameFreak wanted a pokemon's types to make sense from a strategy perspective more so than a flavor perspective. However, when breeding was introduced in the second generation (Gold/Silver/Crystal, GameBoy Color), pokemon also gained Egg-types that only pertained to which pokemon with whom they could produce offspring. Pokemon like Charizard, a Fire/Flying-Type, and Gyarados, a Water/Flying-type belong to the Dragon- Egg-group.\n\ntl;dr He's Fire because they wanted him to be less OP in first gen", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426197982", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Just because ancient societies practiced infanticide doesnt automatically make them evil. These people didnt have access to birth control. Infanticide was necessary during times of food shortage, drought and famine. Keeping the population down was necessary in order to guarantee survival.\n\n'Many Neolithic groups routinely resorted to infanticide in order to control their numbers so that their lands could support them. Joseph Birdsell believed that infanticide rates in prehistoric times were between 15% and 50% of the total number of births, while Laila Williamson estimated a lower rate ranging from 15% to 20%. Both anthropologists believed that these high rates of infanticide persisted until the development of agriculture during the Neolithic Revolution. Comparative anthropologists have calculated that 50% of female newborn babies were killed by their parents during the Paleolithic era. Decapitated skeletons of hominid children have been found with evidence of cannibalism. The children were not necessarily actively killed, but neglect and intentional malnourishment may also have occurred, as proposed by Vicente Lull as an explanation for an apparent surplus of men and the below average height of women in prehistoric Menorca.'\n\n'The pre-Islamic Arabian society practiced infanticide as a form of \"post-partum birth control\". Regarding the prevalence of this practice, we know it was \"common enough among the pre-Islamic Arabs to be assigned a specific term, waʾd\". Infanticide was practiced either out of destitution (thus practiced on males and females alike), or as sacrifices to gods, or as \"disappointment and fear of social disgrace felt by a father upon the birth of a daughter\" (sounds like a familiar ideology?)\n\nSome authors believe that there is little evidence that infanticide was prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia or early Muslim history, except for the case of the Tamim tribe, who practiced it during severe famine. Others state that \"female infanticide was common all over Arabia during this period of time\" (pre-Islamic Arabia), especially by burying alive a female newborn.'\n\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide#History_and_pre-history", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426222058", "subreddit": "exmuslim", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "'Last Chance', reminds me of your 'I meant it' post.  You have a strange tone in your writing - somewhat teenage.  But let's continue nonetheless.\n\nI keep giving you responses explaining that context is very important.  If you burn a group of effigies of 'black people', then it looks/is racist.  But burning an effigy of barack obama is hardly racist.  Neither would it be if it were Robert Mugabe, or even Carwyn Jones.\n\nBurning Salmond is not racist, because an Alex Salmond is not a race (thank god).\n\nAlex Salmond was the effigy being burnt.  He doesn't represent the scottish 'race' any more than Cameron represents 'the english race'..  You say 'Symbols' of scotland, I only saw one 'symbol of scotland' -  nessie, somewhat smaller and obviously part of the main piece which was a charicature of Alex Salmond.\n\ni'd whole heartedly agree with you that if there were saltires being burned in isolation, or a Robert Burns display being torched then it'd be quite obvious as a racist/hateful display.  But we're talking about a controversial politician here, so no, burning alex slamond is not an expression of racism.\n\nGiven your overly aggressive tone I have no doubt you'll disagree but I'm happy to continue the discussion.

{"body": "Alright folks, this discussion has pretty obviously devolved and we're not getting anywhere. The blame for that definitely lies with us. We're trying to explain some of what has been going on here, but the simultaneous banning of that set of subreddits entangled in this situation has hurt our ability to have that conversation with you, the community. A lot of people are saying what we're doing here reeks of bullshit, and I don't blame them.\n\nI'm not going to ask that you agree with me, but I hope that reading this will give you a better understanding of the decisions we've been poring over constantly over the past week, and perhaps give the community some deeper insight and understanding of what is happening here. I would ask, but obviously not require, that you read this fully and carefully before responding or voting on it. I'm going to give you the very raw breakdown of what has been going on at reddit, and it is likely to be coloured by my own personal opinions. All of us working on this over the past week are fucking exhausted, including myself, so you'll have to forgive me if this seems overly dour.\n\nAlso, as an aside, my main job at reddit is systems administration. I take care of the servers that run the site. It isn't my job to interact with the community, but I try to do what I can. I'm certainly not the best communicator, so please feel free to ask for clarification on anything that might be unclear.\n\nWith that said, here is what has been happening at reddit, inc over the past week.\n\nA very shitty thing happened this past Sunday. A number of very private and personal photos were stolen and spread across the internet. The fact that these photos belonged to celebrities increased the interest in them by orders of magnitude, but that in no way means they were any less harmful or deplorable. If the same thing had happened to anyone you hold dear, it'd make you sick to your stomach with grief and anger.\n\nWhen the photos went out, they inevitably got linked to on reddit. As more people became aware of them, we started getting a huge amount of traffic, which broke the site in several ways.\n\nThat same afternoon, we held an internal emergency meeting to figure out what we were going to do about this situation. Things were going pretty crazy in the moment, with many folks out for the weekend, and the site struggling to stay afloat. We had some immediate issues we had to address. First, the amount of traffic hitting this content was breaking the site in various ways. Second, we were already getting DMCA and takedown notices by the owners of these photos. Third, if we were to remove anything on the site, whether it be for technical, legal, or ethical obligations, it would likely result in a backlash where things kept getting posted over and over again, thwarting our efforts and possibly making the situation worse.\n\nThe decisions which we made amidst the chaos on Sunday afternoon were the following: I would do what I could, including disabling functionality on the site, to keep things running (this was a pretty obvious one). We would handle the DMCA requests as they came in, and recommend that the rights holders contact the company hosting these images so that they could be removed. We would also continue to monitor the site to see where the activity was unfolding, especially in regards to /r/all (we didn't want /r/all to be primarily covered with links to stolen nudes, deal with it). I'm not saying all of these decisions were correct, or morally defensible, but it's what we did based on our best judgement in the moment, and our experience with similar incidents in the past.\n\nIn the following hours, a lot happened. I had to break /r/thefappening a few times to keep the site from completely falling over, which as expected resulted in an immediate creation of a new slew of subreddits. Articles in the press were flying out and we were getting comment requests left and right. Many community members were understandably angered at our lack of action or response, and made that known in various ways. \n\nLater that day we were alerted that some of these photos depicted minors, which is where we have drawn a clear line in the sand. In response we immediately started removing things on reddit which we found to be linking to those pictures, and also recommended that the image hosts be contacted so they could be removed more permanently. We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.\n\nThis nightmare of the weekend made myself and many of my coworkers feel pretty awful. I had an obvious responsibility to keep the site up and running, but seeing that all of my efforts were due to a huge number of people scrambling to look at stolen private photos didn't sit well with me personally, to say the least. We hit new traffic milestones, ones which I'd be ashamed to share publicly. Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform, and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things. We take down things we're legally required to take down, and do our best to keep the site getting from spammed or manipulated, and beyond that we try to keep our hands off. Still, in the moment, seeing what we were seeing happen, it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint.\n\nAs the week went on, press stories went out and debate flared everywhere. A lot of focus was obviously put on us, since reddit was clearly one of the major places people were using to find these photos. We continued to receive DMCA takedowns as these images were constantly rehosted and linked to on reddit, and in response we continued to remove what we were legally obligated to, and beyond that instructed the rights holders on how to contact image hosts. \n\nMeanwhile, we were having a huge amount of debate internally at reddit, inc. A lot of members on our team could not understand what we were doing here, why we were continuing to allow ourselves to be party to this flagrant violation of privacy, why we hadn't made a statement regarding what was going on, and how on earth we got to this point. It was messy, and continues to be. The pseudo-result of all of this debate and argument has been that we should continue to be as open as a platform as we can be, and that while we in no way condone or agree with this activity, we should not intervene beyond what the law requires. The arguments for and against are numerous, and this is not a comfortable stance to take in this situation, but it is what we have decided on.\n\nThat brings us to today. After painfully arriving at a stance internally, we felt it necessary to make a statement on the reddit blog. We could have let this die down in silence, as it was already tending to do, but we felt it was critical that we have this conversation with our community. If you haven't read it yet, please do so.\n\nSo, we posted the message in the blog, and then we obliviously did something which heavily confused that message: We banned /r/thefappening and related subreddits. The confusion which was generated in the community was obvious, immediate, and massive, and we even had internal team members surprised by the combination. Why are we sending out a message about how we're being open as a platform, and not changing our stance, and then immediately banning the subreddits involved in this mess?\n\nThe answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following: These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occurring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the site rules, but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.\n\n────────\n\nNow, after all of the context from above, I'd like to respond to some of the common questions and concerns which folks are raising. To be extremely frank, I find some of the lines of reasoning that have generated these questions to be batshit insane. Still, in the vacuum of information which we have created, I recognize that we have given rise to much of this strife. As such I'll try to answer even the things which I find to be the most off-the-wall.\n\nQ: You're only doing this in response to pressure from the public/press/celebrities/Conde/Advance/other!\n\nA: The press and nature of this incident obviously made this issue extremely public, but it was not the reason why we did what we did. If you read all of the above, hopefully you can be recognize that the actions we have taken were our own, for our own internal reasons. I can't force anyone to believe this of course, you'll simply have to decide what you believe to be the truth based on the information available to you.\n\nQ: Why aren't you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content?!\n\nA: We remove what we're required to remove by law, and what violates any rules which we have set forth.

My godfather (white but spoke Zulu and Xhosa) was a nightwatchman in those days and one night he was just patrolling around a warehouse or something close to the Townships and a mob caught him . They were pissed off about something (something the security forces or police did) . He wasn't armed, all he had was a torch (flash light) and a walkie, so they tied him up and beat the shit out of him. While he's lying there in dust and the blood he hears some one shout \"go fetch a tire\" . He said it that was the moment he knew he was going to die. They took long to find a tire and they whole time he's just lying there thinking about his wife and kids and praying for god to spare him. When they came back with the tire and the petrol they propped him up put the tire round his neck and drenched him in petrol. As a last resort he starts begging them in Zulu to let him go, saying he's just a poor nightwatchman and a christian and he doesn't deserve to die, he told them that he would do anything. The leader dude hushed the mob to be silent and asked if he really \"would do anything?\". My godfather said \"yes\". So the dude said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\".\nSorry I couldn't resist, but the real ending was that as they were about to torch him his armed supervisor arrived to check up on him and ended up saving him from the mob. When he got into the back of his bosses bakkie (pickup) he realized he had pissed himself.

It doesn't matter if they're good, bad, rich, poor, race, gender, or religion, disease is disease. If a traveler in downtown infects a farmer, when the farmer goes home, his community will be affected.\n\nYou'd have a lot more credibility with Christianity (or any religion) if nobody from that religion got sick due to some divine protection but nope, no protection.\n\n&gt; It still is.\n\nListen. It's not. I didn't say that the river is as worthless as a rock near your house, I said it's globally trivial.\n\n&gt; Yes, in Leviticus only two fabrics \n\nNot relevant. Why are you changing God's word to fit your non-divine, faulty, human, contemporary interpretation?\n\n&gt; The geographical location matters\n\nNo it doesn't and Euphrates is only Turkey, Iraq, and Syria. All worthless countries globally speaking. Brazil has twice as much GDP as all those three combined and I'm giving you a massive break here by saying all three countries are 100% dependant on this river when that's not actually the case - the GDP of all three countries depends on other things so assuming the river magically disappeared overnight, their GDP wouldn't go down to 0.\n\nYou're really making a case for a worthless river here. You have to look at the Nile, Mississippi, Amazon, Volga, Ganges, Danube, and Yangtze and let me know how they rate because I'm telling you right now that the Euphrates is worthless in comparison.\n\n&gt; I am quite fascinated with the origins of language\n\nAh but that's not what you said. You said the Tower of Babel of which there is no evidence. You can talk about language all you want but the actual story - everyone spoke the same language, they built a large tower - we're talking about 1.6 miles high here, from these primitive people who could really hold their breath - God destroyed it and split languages - this never happened.\n\n&gt; The tower might have been this one.\n\n\"Originally 91 meters in height\"? Egyptian pyramids were built over a thousand years before this and they were 50% higher. Today, Burj Khalifa is almost ten times the height. God's wrath seems to be missing both before and after. \n\n&gt; The text was edited. Nobody could deny that. \n\nAsk religious people, they'll tell you it wasn't, it's pure, and it's the word of God.\n\n&gt; The command - \"love them as yourself\" - on it's own, still stands.\n\nSo if I'm being killed, I should love my killer? This is awful advice, useful only as a default position on how to treat strangers. In addition, it's common sense advice. We wouldn't survive as a species if we always robbed, raped, or killed every stranger we saw. We've done this before we even had language.\n\n&gt; Why not? Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\n\nBecause there is no proof of it. I don't typically believe things that have no proof. In your Clarke quote, does this mean everything is real because everything is possible? Leprechauns are real, they're just in the fourth dimension. Loch Ness monster is real because it teleports from an invisible ship to take a bath, etc, etc.\n\n&gt; Like Mars?

{"body": "I actually have reason to believe you're right and his story is partly faked. Within the past year he has claimed to be 30 and claimed to have frosted the tips of his hair in 1998 but got asked to prom when he cut his hair. Now that means 17 years ago when he was 13 or 14 he got that hairstyle and since guys typically get their hair cut more than once a year and it's unlikely he kept the style for multiple years he's saying he was asked to prom at the age of 14 to maximum of 16 and changing his hairstyle immediately got someone to ask him to prom. Now the problem here is a young student being asked to prom by an older girl in 1998. The traditional ideas of the guy asking the girl out were much more prevalent 17 years ago and it makes it much less likely that the above scenario would occur so he most likely rounded down his age meaning he's a few years over 30 but  apparently he was also in a relationship from the age of 17 until graduation meaning he was asked to prom when he was in grade 11 for the most realistic scenario. The girl he mentioned being in a relationship with however was described as basically the sexiest girl he ever met and apparently he had sex with her a lot.  now these stories aren't anything really crazy but they're clearly exaggerated. Now the tree fiddy pound man that happens to be the girl's ex happens to be there at the same time and gets back together with her or the dating a 10/10 girl who gave him oral in a movie theater or the grade 11 kid being asked to prom by a grade 12 girl in 1998 because he got rid of his fad hairstyle or the girl whose SO called him angrily because he was saved in the girl's contacts as \"best sex ever\", That's a load of bull shit if you ask me\n\nBased on the consistency of his other stories I'd say it's mostly true but the best way to hide a lie is to cover it with truths so it's pretty difficult to call someone out on a lie.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426396909", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The pistol slid across the floor several feet between me and the robber. He took a quick glance at me and realized I had been ducking behind a Doritos display.

My head felt dizzy and I knew I had to get something to drink. I looked over at the vending machines on the opposite wall, one snack machine with a flickering interior light, a long thin crack in the glass, and a dozen items left on the reels; and a decrepit Pepsi machine with the last three buttons missing.\n\nI walked over to the Pepsi machine and saw a note underneath the bill changer- \"Takes your cash and doesn't even take notice of you. Just like my girlfriend.\" I chuckled a little and rummaged in my pocket for some change, hoping that the note didn't apply to the change slot. As I pulled a pile of coins out of my pocket my vision grew hazier around the edges and I knew I had to get something quick. I had about 2 dollars in change but I still needed to know how much it would cost me.\n\nI pressed the button for a water bottle and the machine seemed to grow dimmer. \"NO STOCK\" flashed on the display. Frustrated I pressed the button for Sierra Mist and again, it seemed to grow dimmer. Again, \"NO STOCK\" flashed at me and I could swear the machine laughed at me as it flashed. Finally I pressed the button for a Pepsi and the machine grew dimmer still. A message dimly flashed on the screen but I could tell it wasn't \"NO STOCK\" like the others. \n\nI leaned in close to read the screen, but all it said was \"bout tree fiddy\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426572140", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

For one Patricks earliest hagiographer Muirchú Moccu Macthéni explicitly talks about Patrick killing Druids, so no need for metaphor\n\n&gt;Holy patrick, as formerly peter about simon with certain power and a great clamor confidently said to the lord \"Lord, who are all powerful in all things and in your consist and who have sent me hither let this impious man who blasphemes your name be raised up now outside and quickly die\"\n\n&gt;and at these words the magician was raised up into the aether and again sent down from above with a head turned down crushed together on a stone and died before them and the gentiles (pagans) feared greatly\n\nBut this is a 7th century hagiography and was written as a piece of propaganda due to a row between Armagh (seat of patrick) and Kildare (seat of Brigit) over who gets to be the main ecclesiastical center of Ireland. So it cant be taken as history.\n\n Secondly, to think that the snakes are metaphor is to not understand Irish legend. Irish legend is built on the 'great feat'. Mountains and lakes appear because a giant put them there, a river is there because an old god threw up there, The isle of mann is there because Fionn Mac Cumhaill dug out the earth and threw it into the sea, St Columba fought the loch ness monster, St Brigid performed miraculous abortions and St patrick is the reason why theres no snakes. It doesnt deal in metaphor, just massive exageration", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426607398", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "   I am surprised this exhibit was reopened considering the outcry over the last incident. A local tourist intentionally crushed an otter's hand, breaking multiple bones in its hand and arm. The incident was not immediately noticed and the suspect wasn't found for quite some time. It was a compelling story for the media since the injured otter suffered complications from the surgery and passed away. \n\n  By the time the suspect was finally captured, public resentment had been building for weeks. Pets are quite revered in Japan, but with real estate at a premium, small residences and/or homeowner associations keep many Japanese from being able to keep pets of their own. Thus, public spaces, especially zoos are a very treasured part of Japanese communities. \n\n   There was a minor scandal when it was revealed that the suspect had been severely beaten after his arrest. The rumor was that local authorities placed the suspect in a general holding cell despite the notoriety and resentment that followed him. Whether it was the police or others that beat him within an inch of his life was never determined. Bear in mind that Japan has an unusually high conviction rate because authorities tend to wait until cases are slam dunks. Once a suspect is officially named and arrested, it pretty much becomes a case of \"guilty until convicted, told you so.\" Don't feel bad for the otter attacker. He later confessed that he did it because he owed a large gambling debt to the owner of the zoo.\n\n  Yup. A deal had been arranged to drum up publicity for the zoo, though neither man expected the cruel stunt to turn into such a fevered situation. Word eventually got back to the local Yakuza outfit, who killed the otter attacker while he was in custody, then burned the zoo owner alive. Supposedly the zoo owner's final word's were, \"Can i get abouta tree fiddy?\" To which he received no response before perishing in the flames. This ran a bit longer than I planned. Sorry.\n\n\nTLDR; It's lunch break and most of my co-workers are out of town. ", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1426621422", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 311, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Is that your evidence? that a lawyer only take up a case if it is correct and the plaintiff is telling the truth? How would any court case have to opposing lawyers then? This is garbage, even convicted murderers have lawyers who defend them with a no-guilty plea. There's desperation in this argument.\n\nare you dumb or just disingenuous?  my point was lawyers don't take cases as plaintiffs with zero indication they can win the case. not only is it bad for their reputation *but it costs them money*. i have personal experience with lawyers not taking a case for me because, while i had a legitimate grievance, there wasn't any hope they could win the case. it's not proof, but it's evidence suggesting there is more to her claim than someone who is just looking for a quick buck. \n\n&gt;If you are suggesting these are the only two reasons a case is dismissed, you are grossly incorrect. Stating I know prior to the statement does not change that.\n\nguy, i live in new york state. i have personally dealt with the NYC court system. four months to have a case decided means you met the magistrate MAYBE twice. once to hear the charges and set the first date of court, and then that court date. the charges against her were bogus and the court knew it otherwise there is no way this case would have been over with so quickly.\n\n&gt;It's very easy to get bruised, i would argue it is reasonable. No where does it state she was sent to the hospital, but rather she went there. There's a big difference in the two. I can go to the hospital right now and ask for a sick not to get the week off work, that proves nothing.\n\nis this your way of defending police brutality? because it's pretty hard to get bruised unless excessive force is being used on you. \n\n&gt;Same argument. \"Well, she has a lawyer so she is telling the truth!\". Doesn't prove nor demonstrate anything of value to this discussion, and i never stated she didn't go to the hospital. If the lawyer sees an opportunity to make money, they will take the case. Period.\n\nthat's not how lawyering works. that's not how any lawyering works. black single mother in the bronx? she doesn't have the money for a lawyer to leech legal fees off of. he HAS to make money from the verdict, otherwise he loses money. he's not going to risk tens of thousands of dollars worth of billable hours on a case he has no idea if he even has a chance of winning. \n\n&gt; What percentage of arrests are unfair or unjust for you to say the police are generally (ie: the majority) abusive?\n\nabout tree fiddy percent. \n\nthe militarization of police, the prison industrial complex, the systemic racism in the criminal justice system, the sharp increase in police murdering unarmed individuals, the rampant police brutality in the last 20-30 years. this is all well documented and is only getting worse. it's not based on a normative, quantifiable percentage. that's simply idiotic. the fact is it shouldn't happen at all. but not only should it not happen, it shouldn't be increasing, and when it does happen, it shouldn't be swept under the rug like it is now. \n\n&gt;Essentially your entire argument is if a lawyer took her case, then shes telling the truth.

{"body": "It just isnt. Theres no evidence that Irish Druids had anything to do with snakes. The story of Patrick driving snakes away does not appear in his own writtings or any of his hagiographies. In fact the The 11th century book of leinster attributes the lack of snakes to Goidel Glas, not Patrick.\nThe idea that snakes are a metaphor for paganism makes no sense. For one Patricks earliest hagiographer Muirchú Moccu Macthéni explicitly talks about Patrick killing Druids, so no need for metaphor\n\n&gt;Holy patrick, as formerly peter about simon with certain power and a great clamor confidently said to the lord \"Lord, who are all powerful in all things and in your consist and who have sent me hither let this impious man who blasphemes your name be raised up now outside and quickly die\"\n\n&gt;and at these words the magician was raised up into the aether and again sent down from above with a head turned down crushed together on a stone and died before them and the gentiles (pagans) feared greatly\n\nBut this is a 7th century hagiography and was written as a piece of propaganda due to a row between Armagh (seat of patrick) and Kildare (seat of Brigit) over who gets to be the main ecclesiastical center of Ireland. So it cant be taken as history.\n\nSecondly, to think that the snakes are metaphor is to not understand Irish legend. Irish legend is built on the 'great feat'. Mountains and lakes appear because a giant put them there, a river is there because an old god threw up there, The isle of mann is there because Fionn Mac Cumhaill dug out the earth and threw it into the sea, St Columba fought the loch ness monster, St Brigid performed miraculous abortions and St patrick is the reason why theres no snakes.

And we can point to at least 700 years after patrick's death where the legend didn't exist or was attributed to some other act.\n\nThe concept of allegory and metaphor just don't exist in Irish legend and mythology, they are all about the the 'great feat'. Irish myth makes out heros pagan and christian to have performed super human feats. Fionn MacCumhall dug out Lough Nea with one scoop of his hand, Cu Chulainn killed an army with one swing, St Colmuba fought the loch ness monster, St Brigit gave nuns abortions. Its all about making your guy seem the biggest and best. So when the legends say St Patrick got rid of the snakes, they are saying he literally did that.\n\nTheres reference to Moses and the snakes in Irish mythology but it is in a story about Goidel Glas who created the Irish language. In the story he has assembled the Irish language from the original tower of Babel and is in egypt where he's bitten by a snake. Moses comes along and cures his snakebite and says that no descendant of him will be affected by snakes and since all of the Gaels are descended from him, thats the reason for no snakes. \n\nThat story is recorded in The book of invasions, compiled in the 11th century from older books going back to the 8th. The same book tells the stories of the old Irish pagan gods, the Tuath Dé Dannan, and descibes them as wise and good and as heros.

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\n\nOne day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\n\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\"  I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies?  I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\n\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy.  The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free.  So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.  \n\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence.  I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\n\nNope.\n\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"  \n\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too.  He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.  \n\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\n\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars.  Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\n\nFast forward one year.  I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.  \n\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\n\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\n\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.  \n\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.  He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"  Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again!  I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\nSo yeah, that's the most illegal thing I've ever done, hopefully I'm not the worst here.  But I haven't eaten smarties since then, that's for sure.\n\n**TL;DR: Kid wants drugs, I give him some, sort of.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426695943", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 781, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, you asked for it.\n\nI had an awful employee about 5 years ago, in my opinion anyway. I was the manager of a local retail store by the beach in Majorca. We sold your basic beach attire and accessories.\n\nThis woman, Jess, applied for a job at the beginning of summer. It doesn't take much to get hired near the summer in Majorca and the islands surrounding as it gets so busy. All I knew about her was she was 24 and from the UK. She was a great speaker and was fairly pretty. I hired her anyway. I kept a copy of her passport for security reasons. Apparently, that was normal to do on these holiday islands.\n\nThe first 2 weeks of summer, business was going great. Jess was doing fine. Nothing special, just doing her job. Soon after this, when the tourists really began filling up the island and the business was soaring, Jess began to get on my nerves. She would turn up late some days, too many days for my liking, looking kind of scruffy and hungover. The smell of alcohol from her was disgusting. I sensed she was indulging in the late night activities with the tourists. I had no problems with this, once it didn't interfere with her work, which it did. Customers were complaining about the stink coming from her. She was in a bad mood and wasn't treating the customers properly.\n\nI could have easily fired her for this but I chose not to because, honestly, I'm a softie and I liked her when she was being herself. She got warnings etc. which I don't think she took serious. She would have 3-4 day stretches of coming in with no problems but then the next day it would be the same thing.\n\nOne of the days, I had left her on her own for a couple of hours while I spent a few hours with my son. It was morning hours so the store wouldn't be too busy. I figured she could handle it on her own for a while. Oh how I was wrong.\n\nAfter spending time with my son, I dropped him home and headed back to the store. There was a handwritten note on the front door saying \"Closed until 12pm\". The door was locked from the inside so I went around the back which leads to the storage room. As I approached the door, I heard screams and moans. Screams from a man that sounded like he was in pain. I quickly unlocked the door and went inside. There was a man on the floor, butt naked with Jess lying on top of him, pinning him down. I didn't know what was going on or what would have gone on if I didn't enter. I shouted at Jess to get off him and fired her immediately. That was the final straw. I didn't want any excuses from her. i just wanted to get rid of her. She said \"Wait, I want one thing\". I asked her what she wanted. \"My paycheck for this week\" she said. \"How much are you owed?\" I asked. \"About tree fiddy\" she said. It was around this time I realised that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Jess Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\ntl;dr Employee got worse as the weeks went on and I possibly interrupted a rape/kinky fetish sex.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426700493", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.\n\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\n\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars. Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\n\nFast forward one year. I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\n\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\n\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.\n\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\n\"What?\" I asked. He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again! I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\nSo yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst here.

{"body": "I find most credible: anyone with some kind of professional training in something with scientific foundations, or the scientific method. \n\nAcademics who understand critical thinking score higher than an everyday Joe with little education, but academic credentials don't guarantee a mind free of bias or crank ideas. Sometime a down-to-earth guy from the country will have a much more pragmatic view of an experience than someone with a very extensive academic background. One has to be very careful in judging these witnesses. \n\nVery high credibility comes from people who are trained to observe, in other words some branches of the military, police, and pilots. But, again, these people are not free of the potential to misperceive something or make mistakes, none of us are. \n\nImportantly, credible witnesses are people with no history of schizotypal personality or mental illness, drug use, or a strong motive to hoax or monetise their stories, for personal attention or other gain. You have to watch their behaviour to gauge this.\n\nI know several people with mental illness, it doesn't make them *bad* people at all, quite the opposite. People with mental illness are quite able to have genuine experiences that they report honestly and accurately, but in the case of *extreme* experience, the very weird, you cannot use their material at all. \n\nThe best witnesses are those with no cultural pollution, in other words, they haven't read the folklore or literature, they aren't influenced by trends or belief. Of course these are rare, but they exist. \n\nSome years ago I interviewed an absolutely perfect witness to a UFO, so not necessarily relevant to Paranormal, but relevant to the topic at hand. This person was a total skeptic, not just to the subject in detail, but in toto. In other words, they didn't even give it a second thought, they regarded UFOs and ET in the same category as Leprechauns and the Loch Ness Monster; they were self evidently rubbish and deserved no serious thought. \n\nThis person had not ever read UFO material, was not exposed to it, and had not even seen Star Wars or Star Trek. They had absolutely no cultural exposure to this imagery beyond the most rudimentary. They were not a drinker or drug user and had no mental illness. \n\nNevertheless, they had a close encounter with a UFO which in all major details agreed with craft seen all over the world for over 30 years. The details this witness described could not possibly be imagined or hallucinated, because they fit with the reports of others from all these different sightings of which they were totally unaware. The witness could not have known this. They were flabbergasted to find that the object they witnessed has also been seen by others. To this day, the witness finds it very difficult to make sense of what they saw, and still has difficulty in entertaining the idea of ETs - even life on other planets. They have never sought publicity for their sighting. \n\nSo this sort of unimpeachable source is very valuable, but today, with our culture impinging on every aspect of our lives, it is very difficult to escape the influence of folklore and popular entertainment. These sources really do affect our perceptions, and there is an enormous amount of scientific material to support this; our perceptions are extremely malleable and our memories very subject to distortion. \n\nThere is in fact a fairly robust body of evidence for \"paranormal\" events from academics and people with a scientific background, but it's not something you'll generally come across in blogs and YouTube videos, because most of what you're exposed to is entertainment and exists purely for that reason.

{"body": "Good question—one I've struggled with, and you've motivated me to look for a solution. This is a question whether the noun is used attributively or as a possessive. Bryan Garner has addressed this on his [blog](http://www.lawprose.org/blog/?p=2285). Incidentally, this subreddit discussed a related question [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/2z2e6q/is_it_kids_meal_or_kids_meal/), but Garner's not a bunch of yahoos on the Internet. I would ordinarily counsel you to just read Garner and skip the yahoos, but for once in my life, I'm not totally confident in Garner's guidance.\n\nTL;DR: With a proper noun, use the possessive only to show possession (i.e., ownership). If the proper noun describes, it's probably attributive.\n\nGarner provides a couple heuristics. The attributive noun often answers the question *what kind?* and begins with the indefinite article *a* or *an*. The possessive often answers *which one?* or *whose?* The definite article *the* is usually possessive, but it can go either way. These are guides, not ironclad rules. And if you read his post carefully, Garner says that either the attributive or possessive can be descriptive. This becomes confusing when he later seems to conflate *attributive* with *descriptive*. \n\nLet's start with *an Imagine Dragons concert*. The indefinite article strongly suggests attribution. Let's try Garner's questions. If I said, \"I had a great time at the concert.\" I could imagine an inquisitive friend asking *whose?* or *which one?* But *what kind?* doesn't cut it (my answer there would be \"a rock concert\"). So the heuristics split: article says attributive, questions say possessive.\n\nIn *the Loch Ness monster*, the definite article suggests possessive. Moving on to the questions, if I said, \"I saw a monster in the moonlight,\" the question probably is *what kind?*, though *which one?* doesn't sound so wrong. (*Whose?* doesn't work at all.) Again, the heuristics split.\n\nGarner doesn't limit the possessive to possession alone—he also notes its use to show origin, description, duration, and agency. But his examples of these alternative uses all rely on nonproper nouns (*witness's account*, *summer's day*, *two weeks' notice*, *asylum-seeker's relief*). Garner's heuristics might work for nonproper nouns (a question for another day), but I'm not confident that they help with proper nouns. \n\nFor proper nouns, I would limit the use of possessive only to showing possession (i.e., ownership); attributive can handle description (which might be why Garner conflates them). Following this \"rule,\" attribution in your examples makes sense: the monster doesn't belong to Loch Ness, and the concert doesn't belong to Imagine Dragons.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426762915", "subreddit": "grammar", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "While I was in college I had a blast. I entered a quid pro quo arrangement with the music director. I could borrow the school drums for a punk band I started, for practice and gigs, if we would play basketball games. So I was the drummer and lead screamer/cheerleader for a punk rock pep band in college. Attendance to the games tripled or more with people getting drunk and showing up to watch us perform and noisily cheer on the team. We had a lousy season but a great time.\n\nI graduated with an Associates in Music and no career path in Music. I took a job with a research firm. I met a girl there, we got married, moved to Portland and had a kid.\n\nThen she knocked me around, belittled me, fucked my friends and told me she wanted a divorce, on Christmas fucking day. Lol. On Christmas. She calmly walks me out back, on Christmas, and says \"I want a divorce\"\n\nSo I said no because for fuck sake it was Christmas. Which threw her off, lol.\n    \"I want a divorce.\"\n    \"No.\"\n\nI was working as a Y2K engineer because somehow I'd stumbled into computer work. She demanded the divorce on New Years Eve day so I said fuck it, fine, left, amd went to work. I rang in 2000 fixing broken computer systems with a fresh divorce hanging over my head while everyone else was drinking.\n\nI met a bunch of ravers and went to my first Burningman that summer. I volunteered as a greeter and killed it. I was really good at it. Friendly but small and efficient. I got plenty of laughs and howdy dos but caught the creeps and kept the line of cars moving fast. I assumed kind of a leadership role, directing traffic and stepping into the tense situations others were wary of.\n\nWhile at Burningman I intended to throw our wedding rings into the Man on the day of the Burn. That afternoon .. the day of the Burn .. I was getting ice at Center Camp when I overheard people talking about needing rings for a wedding they were having that night. You've gotta be fucking kidding me.\n\nI had my rings in my backpack because even though the Burn was hours away you never know what happens out there so I wanted to be sure I'd have the rings with me to burn.\n\nI rudely interrupted to ask about the wedding and the rings. The couple were funny and happy and clearly in love. Fuck. You've gotta be kidding me. So I bust out the shitty little wooden box the rings were in. The mens was a tasteful gold ring with a white gold center. The woman's was a white gold with two rubies on the outside, two emeralds second row in and a diamond in the center. Small gemstones, red white and blue.\n\nThe girls facial expression was hilarious. She clearly liked the rings and was clearly not in a position to buy something like this.\n\nShe stammers \"we .. we don't have any money. I can't .. I mean .. we can't .. we can't pay you for those\"\n\nI just laughed and said \"of course not we're in the fucking desert! We're supposed to barter out here right?\" I explained that I was recently divorced and plan to burn these as a sort of healing exercise. Then I said \"look we don't even know if these fit\"\n\nSo they both tried them on. And they fit perfectly. You have GOT to be fucking kidding me. The rings fit perfect. Both of them. My ex wife's ring looked so beautiful on her finger and the look of happiness on her face .. I can't even describe it. Her partner was still apprehensive, almost panicking. What kind of scam was I running? They took the rings back off and gave them to me.\n\nSo I said \"ok well so ... what do you got? I'll never get what these are worth out here but these were doomed today anyway so their value has depreciated to me.\"\n\nTheir friends step in at this point. A bit of a crowd had gathered. I ended up trading my wedding rings for an eighth of weed, a bottle of this really delicious vegan tea stuff, some random shitty bead trinkets this hippie girl gave me who was crying and talking about destiny, and a red t-shirt from a nearby theme camp with their logo on it.\n\nMostly I just made them promise to love each other and not fuck things up like my wife and I did. I told them that if they were going to deprive me of some silly closure exercise then they'd have to put the rings to better use and live happily ever after.\n\nWho knows if they did. But they were happy that day.\n\nMaybe I should have asked for tree fiddy. But nobody carries money out there.\n\nTwo days after the Burn I was packing up for home when some bigshot guy who worked for burningman named Rooster approaches me and takes me for a walk. He talked about how impressed he was with my work ethic and asked if I was coming back next year. I said of course. \n\nHe said the LLC would be taking care of the ticket.\n\nSo after my first year at Burningman I got my next year's ticket for free.\n\nToday I'm a boring 41 year old with a desk job, a new wife, and a beautiful three year old. I have a strained relationship with my oldest but he's 18 and 18 year olds can be that way. I still love him and always have an open door for him.\n\nIn spite of getting a 2.3 GPA in college with an SAT score of \"fuck that\", and an Associates degree in music, I have a lucrative career as a data analyst. \n\nAny one of these stories are unbelievable enough but all of them together are kind of crazy. I'm blessed to have had so many awesome experiences and look forward to more.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426772425", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "NSFW\n\nMe and my girlfriend decided to get a bit experimental in the bedroom department and went to our local Victoria Secret to see what they had to offer.\n\nAfter looking around and picking up a few bits and pieces, we decided to also get some Anal beads because they were cheap and we had never experimented in that area before.\n\nLater on that night we started with some foreplay and it ended up hot and heavy, before we knew it I was inside of her and I suggested we try some of our new toys. She keenly agreed as one generally does to new things when they are horny. I start off by lubing my finger and gently start pushing it in and out. To her delight she REALLY enjoyed it. I never heard her moan like that before this.\n\nI then started putting in the anal beads one by one and occasionally she would tense so hard that one would pop out. After a while I gradually started rubbing her clit from behind and popping the beads in and out.\n\nAs she came she squirted a little bit and during her orgasm I wanted to intensify her pleasure but this is where I made a huge mistake. I decided to rip them motherfucking anal beads out, like you would a beyblade, thinking that it would make her climb the walls. It didn't, she prolapsed and violently shit herself all over me and the bed.\n\nShe waddled to the bathroom in tears and I was left mortified, I followed her into the bathroom and cleaned myself up, as did she. I said that I would drive her to the local emergency room to get her some treatment and she said yes. That was all she said, I knew she was upset with me but I didn't expect what was to come.\n\nI pulled up outside the emergency room and she asked me to leave, fair enough that it was my ignorance that got us into this situation. I should of thought about it and maybe done some research but obviously hindsight wasn't going to help the awful situation I was now in. The way she looked at me broke my heart, I wanted to make this better but I wasn't sure how.\n\nShe didn't have any insurance so I sent her a text saying that I would pay whatever it cost for all her treatment, and I got no reply. A couple months later I got a call from her, trying to take me up on my offer. I tried to fit more into the conversation but all she wanted to say was meet me outside T &amp; G's, which is a bar near where she lives.\n\nWe sat down and had a chat, talked about what happened and I started to feel more at ease as she started giggling at my ridiculous jokes and thought that we might actually be able to move on from this. It felt like a spark had made my heart start pumping again. After a few months of feeling heart broke it somehow instantly felt so much better.\n\nAnyway, after we had a few drinks we started to talk about the medical costs. She said that she knew it wasn't my fault and she had tried to pay as much as she could but there was some extra that she was hoping I could put towards. I didn't need to think about this because I had got us into this situation into the first place.\n\nI pulled out my check book and asked her how much she needed. She responded with about tree fiddy, I said 'excuse me' and she repeated ' I need about tree fiddy'. This is when I noticed she was a 20 story tall giant crustacean from the palaeolithic era. I said 'God dammit loch ness monster, I aint gunna give you no tree fiddy'. She then swam away and I never saw her again.\n\nTL;DR : Pulled anal beads out girlfriends ass, prolapsed, tried to pay medical bills.\n\nEdit : Thanks for the gold!!\n\nEdit 2 : Wait a minute no-one gave me gol\n\nEdit 3 : Now I have been guilded .

{"body": "So, my DARE program started when I was in the second grade. We had the same officer all the way through middle school. He was a young guy, like probably 25 or so when he started coming to our class his name was Officer Zimmerman. Officer Zimm always seemed nice at first, I think he liked the kids asking if he ever shot anyone. As we all got older, since of the kids started to smoke weed. By the 7th grade, most of us thought the program was stupid and just say no turned to just say yes.  I don't remember when the program ended for us, but I remember the last time I saw Officer Zimmerman. I was 17, a senior in high school and got pulled over for speeding. It was Officer Zimm that pulled me, and let me off with a warning. He had no idea I had a joint in my center console. I moved back to my home town after college, and found out via the grapevine that good ol' Zimmerman left the force sleeping with another officer wife. Apparently his life was going down hill and then he got busted for DUI. During this time he started to sell a little weed every now and then for a few extra bucks. So one day a friend G brings me  over to an apartment to  buy a quarter and guess who he answers the door? Yup, Officer Zimmerman.  I'm a little freaked out at first, but he told me the story, how he got fired and his life turned, literally, into pot. Zimm ends up smoking us out and being totally cool. So my buddy ends up buying the weed, and I ask Zimmerman if I can buy a joint, since I'm short on cash. He says sure. I ask him how much. Zimmerman turns and  says \"tree fity\".

{"body": "I remember one stupid thing I did with a friend. Okay, so I live in a mountainous are. I mean rural, talking about bears and some hiking trails. One day my friend I were going for a walk. I was calming her down because her parents beat her up again. Her parents were always very violent and abusive. I've tried to call cops on them, but they act fake, and tell them a sob story about their uncontrollable daughter. While we were on the trail she stepped on a beer can someone threw on the ground and it squirted beer on her. She reeked of alcohol after that and didn't want her parents to beat her up when she doesn't even drink. I said we could try to sneak in, change outfits, and I'd wash the clothes at my place. I even told her that if she gets caught I'd explain what happened to them. Unfortunately we got busted, and they wouldn't listen to what I had to say. They father then smacked her, putting a gash on her cheek. I felt the rage boil inside me. I wouldn't sit back anymore. So I took the lamp next to me and bashed him on the back of the head. He fell over and he was bleeding. Realizing what I had just done, I grabbed my friend and ran. His wife stooped over him crying and screaming. I didn't know if that just knocked him out or if it killed him, and I didn't want to stay to find. I had to run. Panicking, my friend and I ran to my room and I locked the door. What if he died. I was hyperventilating and pacing, all while trying to come up with a plan when someone started banging on my door. It was the police. \"Open up!\" they demanded. Terrified I yelled \"Go away! What do you want from me!\" Then the  banging stopped and the officer replied after a momentary pause \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" That's when I realized the police officer was actually 500 feet and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426817202", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt; Wait, do you think it's problematic to argue for the position that neither the Loch Ness monster, nor Russell's teapot exists?\n\nI've had this conversation a half dozen times or so.  Based on the times I've seen it come up, the typical view in online apologetics seems to be that Russell's point is that one has no reason to say the teapot isn't there.  It's monstrously absurd, but it's at least in the same ballpark of absurdity as the rest of the mythology about epistemology one encounters here, so one has to at least appreciate the consistency.\n\nI've actually gone through Russell a couple times with people.  They'll quote, *look:* \"If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, *nobody would be able to disprove my assertion*...\"!  You'll say, *yes, keep reading:* \"But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense.\"  At which point you'll be told that he doesn't say he *does* doubt it, or that just because he doubts it's there doesn't mean he believes it isn't there, or some such.\n\nI actually get kind of curious about to how this sort of view gets started.  Obviously now it has enough momentum among people who hang out in the likes of /r/atheism that they pick it up from one another and repeat it.  But one wonders how it ever got widespread in the first place.  It's an interesting question in the sociology of knowledge, but it seems that there can be one random blogpost from someone from who knows where, but if it gets read and linked around at the right time, everyone starts to take it as gospel because they see everyone else repeating it.

If you look at the evidence for religion, it's just about as likely to be true as Leprechauns or the Loch Ness monster. \n\nThe fact that a lot of people believe in something doesn't make it true. There isn't one shred of evidence for religion, and, as we keep growing our understanding of the world we live in, the more we realize that the answers in the religious books were fabricated by earlier people trying to explain what they didn't understand.\n\nIn the middle ages, miracles were everywhere. Miraculous recoveries from sickness, miraculous events. Then we discovered medicine and science and suddenly the \"miracles\" started to make sense.\n\nLook at another example, closer in time , with UFOs. Just 30 years ago, there were thousands of reports per year of flying saucers and alien sightings. Strangely enough, now that everyone carries a portable camera in their pockets, they have disappeared. The rational explanation is that, just like miracles, there were never flying saucers in the first place. \n\nLike it or not, there is only one truth, and only one reality.

And of course, right away were several people trying to sell us cheap necklaces &amp; souvenirs, so we walked past without saying anything. Once we got into town, it seemed most of the scammers were gone, so we started to let our guard down. We did some shopping, chatted with a few locals, drank beer; just enjoying our vacation. So after a couple drinks, we decided to go down to the beach.\n\nWe made our way down to the beach (which was pretty much covered in glass), found a spot and set up a place to sit. A few moments later, a young child came up to us asking if we'd be interested in buying some necklaces she made. She told us that the proceeds were going toward a local shelter she was a part of, so we decided to help her out since she was such a sweet little girl. So I asked her how much she was wanting for the necklaces, and she said \"I need about Tree Fity..\"\n\nTHREE FIFTY!\n\nNow, it was about this time that I realized this little girl wasn't a little girl at all, but rather an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. So I yelled \"DAMN IT, LOCH NESS MONSTER! LEAVE ME AND MY FAMILY ALONE!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426884513", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

I remember my leg filling warm and I didn't know why. I decided to continued my journey to get water because fuck it I'm high and don't know what is happening. I got there and bought my water and headed back home. I got home and my mom was furious she started yelling at me and asking me what happened and why did I piss my pants I was confused so I told her I got robbed.

{"body": "I had a pretty hard life growing up, but you never realize how much of a kid you are untill you can't help the people you love. Growing up I lived with my auntie, we never had much, but we had 4 walls, a ceiling, and just enough money to keep food on the table. When my auntie was growing up she had a really tough life. There's poverty and then there's fucked up shit and she was definitely over the line. I won't go into any details, but all you need to know is she immigrated from the UK when she was very young and was abused all here life by various people in NYC. But she's a strong woman, I remember one time I walked into the room where she slept (it was far from what you could call a bedroom, the only bedroom, she put me and my sister in) and she was sitting there, bawling her eyes out. When in the split second between me walking in and her looking up she was able to completely compose herself. I remember thinking, \"why is it that she can stop crying like that but I can't even talk when I cry\" it's funny how kids think.. \n\nAnyway, with the hard life she lived, my auntie would take in girls off the street every now and then and help them get work, off drugs, or stop hooking. I never really understood what was wrong as a kid, I just thought she was helping people who were poorer than we were. Being around addicts, you realize that they aren't bad people, they aren't inherintly flawed, they are nice, normal, and they want so, so badly to be recognized. But there was this one girl. Jennifer. That fucking bitch came into our home and robbed us blind. I watched my auntie bring this girl off the street and she turned around and hocked all of our worldly possessions for drug money, even my rock em sock em robot game that my auntie saved up for and bought me for my 9th birthday. All together we probably only had a little over 300 dollars worth of stuff, but my aunt was devistated.  She didn't house another girl for 3 years.\n\nI remember it being the first time I ever hated someone. I was angry for my aunt, i was angry at the world and I couldn't do shit about it. It was then that I realized I wanted to be a good person, live a good life and never get screwed over like that.\n\nAs a bonus note to the story we saw Jennifer about a year later. My aunt had gotten over being hurt and was able to get angry. She confronted her with big red eyes and said \"Bitch! You owe me about Tree Fiddy!!\" I was stunned. Absolutely shocked. It was the first time I had heard her curse, she was a god fearing woman. But more importantly it was also the first time I realized my auntie was a 500 foot monster from the paleolithic Era. \n\nJennifer asked \"what's tree fiddy?\" My auntie said \"$350\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426978832", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Okay.. Not proud of this one. \n\nMy family was.. unfortunate. We were pretty poor when I was growing up and went without a lot of things. We weren't starving or anything, but we knew the definition of a luxury, and they came around very rarely. \n\nFast forward to me being 18, I'm out on my own for the first time, with no help from my parents, and only my shitty part time job to hold me up. I was not very good with the money I had and long story short, quickly found myself unable to afford my part of the apartment I was sharing with a friend. My life was falling apart financially just because I bit off more than I could chew.\n\nMy mother has a bank account which she has put my name on as well, in case of emergency. If for whatever reason she's incapacitated, I can still access the money. Well.. In my irresponsibility, I overdrafted my own personal account to the tune of about $400. I didn't have enough to pay this back and so just kind of.. ignored it. Bad move. They saw that my name was also on another account, and so decided to take my debt out of it.... \n\nThe reason this was a problem was that this was in December.. A week before Christmas. That money was for presents for my siblings. Christmas has always been kind of a depressing time of little to no gifts or special anything, and the one year my mom saved up all year to get nice things, I ruined it by being irresponsible. My siblings were expecting presents that they now weren't going to get. \n\nI was driving when mom called me and told me. I had to pull over and bawl my eyes out on my steering wheel for about half an hour. I felt so bad. It was completely my fault, and worst of all, it wasn't something I could fix immediately. I had to abandon my friends in the apartment (they still don't speak to me), move back home, pick up a second job and work for months to make up for all the damage I'd done. Then I definitely had to grow the fuck up. \n\nNow, several years later, I've been holding myself up on my own in an apartment by myself, and I can't remember the last time I asked my parents for money. Feels good, bro. Nowadays my mom calls *me* up for money.. And she says, \"I need about tree fiddy\". \n\nOkay, okay, I'm just kidding about the last part.

{"body": "Apparently as a kid I told my parents stuff that was very detailed and they do not know where I would have picked it up. I'm a little skeptical if it was actually a 'past life' or if as a kid I just had some weird imagination because I haven't experienced any 'past life' stuff since I was a kid. But anyways this is the story I've heard the most from my parents.\n\nI was about 3 years old at the time and we lived way out in upstate New York but we went into the city for the day because my Aunt, Uncle, and two cousins (who were 6 and 8 at the time) were visiting from Texas. I had supposedly never been into New York City before ever. My Dad went to college in the city and did business there quite often so he knew his way around very well (usually). We were going around doing some touristy things and at one point we stop in at a restaurant to get lunch. We all go in and sit down and there was a man and a woman sitting at a 2 person table across the room and apparently I just sat there and stared at the man for a very long time. I told my parents that I knew that man very well, that he was a nice man that had helped me out and that I owed him. My parents looked at the man and decided that neither of them recognized him and had no idea how I would have known him, it wasn't anyone that they thought was affiliated with my pre-school back home and there wouldn't be anyone that helped me and that I owed that they wouldn't know. They asked me how I thought I knew him but all I could remember was that this person's face was very familiar to me, he helped me, and I owed him, nothing more. My family just sort of shrugged it off as me playing some dumb game they didn't understand or whatever. I continue staring at the man. Waitress comes, we order food, blah blah blah. Now the man and the woman were already starting to eat before we sat down so they are getting up and are about to leave. There table was up against the wall on the far side from the door, so as they leave they have to walk past us. They start walking out and I'm still just dead-staring the man the entire time and as he approaches he sees that I'm watching him and gives a slight smile and wave and says \"Hi there!\" and I respond \"Hi Derrick\". The guy never said his name, and his table was on the other side of the room, so I wouldn't have been able to overhear their conversation if the woman had said his name. He obviously was very surprised and asked how I knew his name. Now as I said before, I told my parents that I didn't remember anything else about the man but when I started talking to him that all changed. I told him that we used to work together and we would talk all the time. Now he probably did not think that I was some reincarnate but he was still curious as to how I knew his name so possibly humoring me he asked where we worked together. I told him we worked at Goldman Sachs and that we were on the 23rd floor and would talk over coffee every morning. He wasn't exactly scared yet, he probably thought that I was a co-workers kid and had come in recently and seen him or something. He confirmed that he did indeed work for Goldman Sachs on the 23rd floor of a building and asked me what my name was. I told him my name was Jeff. My parents chimed in and seeming concerned reminded me that my name was Mike and that I shouldn't lie to strangers. However now he and the woman both became quite visibly shaken and they told us that he had a coworker named Jeff that he was good friends with die about 4 years ago. He asked me what else I knew about him and I told him that I remembered I was working underneath him at the time and that he had helped me get a promotion when once became available and that as a thank you I was going to bring him to see a Knicks game, but I died before I could do so. The man's face was completely drained of color and the woman was tearing up. I told him that I needed to pay him back in some way because he helped me and a true friend would help him back so I asked him what I could do for him. The man was so still it was impossible to tell if he had actually heard me or not, but eventually he looks up and meets my eyes and says, \"Jeff....I need about tree fiddy\". Well it was about damn time that I realized Derrick wasn't a past life co-worker of mine at all, but a 20 story high creature from the paleolithic era! And I stood up and yelled god dammit loch ness monster you aint getting my tree fiddy so stop coming by asking for it!!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427003764", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If a greedy capitalist would replace me with a machine, it would be because the machine is more efficient. If that's the case, then other capitalists would also replace people with machines, and the capitalists would then lower their prices to compete with each other, and so whatever goods used to be produced by people and were now produced by machines would be cheaper. Because the goods are cheaper, that means people have more money left over to spend on other things, and then for the people who were laid off in the one area, more will be hired in the other.\n\nIf you think, if we were to get rid of trucks and have people pull all goods around on foot, that would create a lot of jobs, but then the great cost of doing this would mean that more jobs would be lost than were created. It is because of our technology that the world is able to support 7bn people; in the paleolithic era it could only support 10k or so.\n\nThe cause of involuntary unemployment is regulations like the minimum wage, which prevent market clearing prices being reached. The minimum wage was actually originally intended to rid the nation of degenerates, but instead they just ended up being subsidised on welfare: http://fee.org/freeman/detail/the-eugenics-plot-of-the-minimum-wage\n\nI recommend reading this free e-book to better understand the things I'm talking about here: http://mises.org/library/economics-one-lesson\n\nEdit note: This assumes a free-market. In the present reality, greedy capitalists will also lobby the government for regulations to reduce competition, so that they can keep their prices artificially high. Libertarian capitalists advocate against such government intervention. So long as the state exists, someone is going to be lobbying it, and the people who don't lobby it will get competed out of the market; so naturally over time, it ends up that all successful companies are lobbying the government. \n\nBy the way, generally when a company lobbies the government for favourable regulations, it will have the regulations be presented as though they are for the benefit of the general public, meaning that often when the public think they are supporting a bill which will limit the power of corporations, they're actually just reducing the ability for startups to compete with the existing corporations, making the established corporations more powerful. This is often because regulations will increase the costs of doing business, and only the large corporations can afford to cover these costs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427036579", "subreddit": "CoonTown", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "People have moments of weakness. \n\nI dated a girl for a while. Her name was Eva. We had a great relationship but several months in I transferred universities and so we had to start a long distance relationship.\n\nWe would skype every evening. She was amazing. But she stopped talking to me every night after a while. She always seemed to have something going on. So we would talk maybe once or twice a week.\n\nI decided I was tired of not seeing her. I didnt have a car, so I decided to hitchhike to her university (500 miles). I got there at about 8:30 in the morning, but she wasnt in her dorm. I figured she was just eating breakfast so I decided to take a nap on her bed. Her backpack was there and I knew she had class at 10:00am so I figured she would be back to pick it up.\n\nWell, after having hitchhiked for 18 hours I was pretty tired. So I woke up at about noon. Her backpack was still there. I got worried so I texted her, \"hey, what are you up to?\"\n\nShe texted back a minute later, \"oh just hanging out with my friend jack.\"\n\nRed flags and alarm bells started going off. I didnt know who jack was. I figured her best friend miranda would know where jack lived. Miranda lived in the dorm next to hers, so I headed that way. It was just my luck but when I came out of the dorms, Miranda was about to walk into the other building, as she had just got out of her class. So I asked her, she told me, and we talked for a few minutes about her boyfriend Trevor who was actually Eva's half-brother. He had been neglecting her for a while and she was thinking about dumping him.\n\nAnyways, I headed towards where she said Jacks dorm was. It was a few buildings down, on the third floor. I went up the stairs, and the good thing about the dorms was it had everyones names on the doors to their room. Full transparency I suppose. So I looked, and on the last door it said in big black marker, \"Jack =)\" Ah, this must be it. I knocked....\n\nNo answer.\n\nI knocked again.\n\nNo answer.\n\nMaybe they're not hanging out at his dorm? I pulled my phone out and started to text her to find out where she was. I headed back towards the stairs when I paused to finish typing at the top of the steps.\n\nThats when I heard it. Heard *her*. My heart sank. I dropped my phone. I ran to the window, stuck my head out for fresh air and calmed myself down. I walked back, slowly. I could still hear them. They were being obnoxious.\n\nSo I knocked. Loud. And I shouted \"get the fuck out here!\" I heard jacks voice. \"Room service? Did you bring girlscout cookies?\"\n\nAh, right, they dont know its me. I knocked again, \"get the fuck out here Eva.\"\n\nI needed a cigarette. I walked downstairs and outside right by the door and lit one up. I sent her a text \"Eva, I need you to come outside right now.\" She just said \"[my real name] ..............\"\n\nI walked back up after the cigarette and knocked again. Just a regular knock. She opened the door a couple seconds later, looking straight at the ground like a puppy with its tail between its legs. I didnt yell. I just asked her \"I need you to explain yourself.\"\n\nAnd so, she told me \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was then that I noticed that eva was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427066528", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 6, "controversiality": 1}
{"body": "So don't judge me, but this story is something I am not proud of. I have a daughter that is very close to me, but she made me do something I have only shared with my wife. You see we were always close and would cuddle on the couch and watch movies and it didn't seem weird because she was my daughter. Well when she was about 12 I had to use her new computer to google something because the desktop we had in the living room was down for some serious software updates at the time, took like two days with our internet. Anyway, I clicked on google and saw her search history. It wasn't terrible, but it had things like \"mens penis\" and rudimentary stuff like that. I wasn't too alarmed because I would search for things about girls when I was that age because I was simply curious. So I let it go and didn't say anything about it. Well a year later after her 13th birthday party a life changing event happened. Her mother got her a new bra because my daughter didn't have that many. Well my daughter called me into the room and asked me if I could help her take it off. At first I thought it was weird because I guess I haven't done that to my daughter before. So I go and unstrap it from the back and she asks for a shoulder massage... This is when it got weird, but I didn't say anything and just went along with it. She starts moaning just under her breath and then all of a sudden she grabs my hands and put them on her breasts. I was shocked and didn't know what to do, but I will admit they felt amazing. She made my hands squeeze them and rub them and she reach one of her hands back to grab my penis. I was even more shocked that I had an erection. She turns around without looking me in the eyes and starts to undo my pants and drops them to my ankles. Don't ask me why I didn't stop her because I honestly don't know why. Furthermore, she started sucking my dick and while it felt good, you could tell it was her first one. I think the reason she was doing all of this is cause she wanted some sexual experience and chose to do it with me cause of how close we are. Then after she sucks it for maybe 3 or 4 minutes and it is covered in spit. She stands up and bends over and I just slowly stick my dick inside of her. It was honestly the best feeling I have ever had. It was a new, untoched vagina that was just so tight. I loved that feeling and no longer even thought about what I was doing. Then out of absolutely fucking no where she turns around and says \"Dad after this can you give me some money and take me to the mall?\" I was shocked she said anything and about to cum I stammered out \"Sure honey how much do you need?\" and she stated something I will never forget...\"I need about tree-fitty.\" Then I realized that she was the Loch Ness monster! I said \"Goddamit Loch Nest monster I ain't givin you no damn tree-fitty!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Fucked my daughter and didn't give her any damn money.

She was her happy-peppy self the whole trip, fixing up her little Animal Crossing town and comically annotating her actions, but I noticed that her neck was looking a little flushed. Whatever, probably nothing.\n\nFast forward to Vegas - we plop our stuff in the hotel room and hit the Casino. I grab her arm and say \"Let's hit the slots a couple times before our friends show up,\" but she violently snaps her arm away from me. I had pulled up her sleeve, revealing a disgusting patch of moist, discolored skin that looked badly infected. She quickly ran off to the restroom, and told me not to follow her. I was concerned though, that looked like it was really serious. I waited at the door for half an hour, texting and calling her frantically. \"It's not a big deal, we can figure this out tomorrow if you want to. Just please talk to me.\" \n\n\"It's nothing, I'll tell you about it later, just go meet our friends and I'll be out.\"\n\nI wasn't sure what to do at this point, so I just grabbed a drink from the bar and waited on our friends to show up. We had gotten started with the game before she made it back - I was so spaced out from thinking about that infection that I hadn't even noticed her seat in. As the dealer was shuffling, she clasped my arm forcefully with her large, scaly grip - quickly gaining my attention. She slides a note over to my side of the table. Tree fiddy, I need about tree fiddy to cover the medical costs, it says. And of course she expects me to cover her for the entire round, and the hotel fare, and won't even buy her own food after leaving such a huge mess for me to deal with.

{"body": "A lot of people didn't really get along with me in my old town. It was a small town so everybody knew everybody. It was hard making new friends so I decided to move to another state. Went directly from an rural town of 20k people to the city. My best friend, lets call him Sam, helped me get an entry level job at the office he worked at. I was excited to start a new job and a new life style. A few weeks went by and eventually a couple months went by. I had met a few people at this point but I really wanted to \"put myself out there\". So on a Monday, Sam invited me to a club he occasionally goes to. It was called \"ClubSilver\" or something along those lines. It was like 7 years ago. Anyways we plan to go the club that Friday night. The week goes by and I spend the week making sure my face is cut-free from shaving, and that my appearance was at the max. Being a male, it wasn't much. Friday finally rolls around and I drive over the Sam's house. We eat a few pizzas to let time go by after work. at about 10 o'clock, we head over to the club. We go in, sit down and start drinking, checking out the girls, yada yada yada. After doing a lot of scoping, I made eye contact with a women who was standing at the corner of the bar. She winked at me, and I winked back. As soon as I saw the wink, my heart dropped and instant nervousness fell into my stomach. I could tell she mouthed to her friend \"watch over for me\", and she started walking my way. She asked what I was doing their that night and I gave her a quick run down. New city, trying to meet new people, etc. At this point i'm at the extreme buzz/tipsy level so my confidence is pretty high. After long talks about life and future plans, she says to me that she's getting tired and that her roommate was supposed to pick her up later but ended up falling asleep. I quickly recommend she could crash at my apartment. She quickly agrees. Sam gives me the \"Good job man, wear protection\" bro speech. So we get to my apartment via taxi and I quickly lay on my bed face first. You know that feeling when your kinda drunk and you first lay in your own bed? Yeah, that. Except this time, I had a female with me. She jokingly lays on top of me and we start a tickle fight. It then went to a teasing fight. Clothes start to come off. I never expected a one night stand like this to be this dirty. I did things to her that I have never done on any women, ever. After a good, long night of fighting Whisky dick, we finish and fall asleep naked. I ended up waking up at 3 in the morning to use the bathroom. I put on a pair of boxers and laid back down in bed. I fell asleep. They say you never dream when your drunk sleeping but this time I did dream. It was a dream about the paleolithic era. The next morning she left without a word and I just laid there happy with the results and happy with the new city lake I was living by.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427088256", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't own a peacock, but there was a peacock farm next to the high school I went to. Anytime you were by the track you could hear those fucking little shits squawking away. It sounds kind of cool the first time you hear it, but after 4 years of it I'd rather listen to razor blades.\n\nSo this one time a few friends and I decide to skip a few classes and go smoke weed and cigarettes. None of us had cars, so we decided to just go through a hole in a fence out back by the portables and smoke in the woods. There was a camera fixed at the point of exit for this very reason. I'll never understand why they elected to buy a fucking camera to spot the hole rather than just fixing the damn fence.\n\nSo anyways, we do our best to ninja our way through it while covering our faces (just in case they did review the footage). As we pass through the other side, we celebrate by packing a fat bowl. After a few more bowls, we hiked through the woods for a couple minutes until we hit this dried riverbed that had jagged rocks poking out like teeth, with forest on either side. Pretty trippy to look at when you're a stoned 16 year old with little tolerance. And that's when we heard it.. the ear-piercing screech of one of those little fuckers.  \n\nAll of us simultaneously jump, lock eyes, and start laughing hysterically. We had never heard one so close, or even seen one in person, so we opted to follow the sound closer. We arrive at the fence keeping them inside what looked to be a hundred acres, couldn't even see the house of whatever weird ass person thought it was a good idea to own a peacock farm. A few of the close by  peacocks haul ass at the sight of us emerging from the woods, and a few braver ones slowly edge towards us. \n\nNow, these fuckers looked nothing like I thought a peacock looked like. They were mostly shit colored, with some boring ass grey tail feathers. For fucks sake, their TAILS weren't even up. They looked like oversized roadrunners. \n\nTwo of the peacocks that seemed curious about us lost interest and walked away. Only one was left, and he would NOT SHUT THE FUCK UP. Anytime we tried to pet him through the fence he would just peck at our hands and start squawking even louder. So, we decided to get him high. We each took turns blowing smoke in his face in an attempt to chill him out. This seemed to have the opposite effect, because his bird bitching grew audibly louder and more aggressive. In a fit of rage, I match its volume and yell \"OH MY GOD, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT!\" Right then it turned its stupid little bird head to me and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about this time that I realized this peacock was 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era. I said \"God dammit Loch Ness Monster I ain't givin' you no goddamn tree fiddy!\", and with a wave of our hands and a shooing motion, it stumbled away, very visibly intoxicated, and went to go join the scattered group of peacocks in the field.\n\nA few weeks later, one of the guys got a car, and we never had to sneak off campus on foot again. We never returned to the farm, but the distant shrieking was a daily reminder that God was an asshole for putting such shitty creatures on this planet.\n\nTL;DR got a peacock high, find out peacocks have no chill", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427095456", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

And then show your mother this is what you're worried about.\n\nThe thing is, people of your mother's generation really don't have much experience of people who are assholes for kicks. In the days before internet, there was less instant gratification, unless you did it on your own turf - in which case you had to live with the consequences. In practice, known assholes-for-kicks tended to get sidelined out of polite society, and they almost always were known to their own communities. You couldn't really be an asshole-for-kicks in secret very easily.\n\nSo this particular brand of asshole behaviour - the ones without any clear opportunity for gain other than LOLs - was really pretty rare once you turned maybe twenty. If people were going to be full-blown assholes, there had to be a payoff - money, sex, a promotion, etc. Otherwise it wasn't worth the risk.\n\nSo for your mom, the asshole catfisher is like the Loch Ness Monster.

True story:\n\nIt's 3 AM. I'm in MIA (Miami International Airport) waiting for my flight. My wife is with me, constantly feeding me Whiskey so I don't freak out on the plane. My flight before I connect to Japan? Lufthansa A380 from Miami to Berlin. I'm tipsy when I'm ready to board. I get up, stretch and I realize I'm tipsy. Shit, I don't know if it's a good idea now, I feel sick and about to throw up from paranoia. We board this monster of a plane and head to the back, Coach/Economy. I'm sitting middle seat next to window, my wife has window seat and on my right (aisle seat) is a Norwegian dude who's trashed. His name was Björn. The primary language is now German so I'm struggling to understand 85% of what is said.  6 AM, we take off... This plane is so huge, it doesn't feel like it goes up like most airplanes, it kinda just feels like it glides upwards in a slow momentum. Björn starts ordering Vodka, repeatedly. Once we're somewhere between America and Europe, Björn starts singing in Norwegian. I pass out. The flight attendants start passing out food and my wife wakes me up... Not to eat, but because Björn is doing airplane imitations with his spoon towards my mouth. He was completely trashed and I just pushed him off and leaned towards my wife. Björn then got bored and started walking down the aisles, closing every laptop that is open. Not because it bothered anyone, just because Björn is an asshole. He's asked to sit down and he does. 2 hours later, we're flying over France approaching our destination and the plane starts to descend. A baby starts crying profusely from the pressure. Björn gets up and starts screaming at the baby and telling the mother to shut her stupid baby up (yes, in English, the mother of the baby was British). Bjorn gets restrained by the Air Marshall that was in the plane, he's now away from me and near the exits. We land safely in Berlin. As I exit the plane, I look at Björn one last time. Björn glances back at me in sorrow and asks me to come closer to him to share a secret with me. I lean in close and he whispers: \"You were a friend to me... I have one request for me, it's all I ask...\" I respond in hesitation, \"What's up?\" Björn responds: \" I need about tree fiddy...\" It was around this time that I realized Björn was about 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Dammit Monstah, I won't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he flew away. I then took my connecting flight to Munich and I never saw Björn again. But I have a feeling he's still an asshole and will always be one.\n\nTL;DR: I met some guy in a flight to Germany and he was an asshole to me and everyone on board.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427112103", "subreddit": "amiibo", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There was this time, back in high school, where I was a loner, quite unsure of myself, adrift with no thoughts of what the future could hold. Even in my small group of loser friends, I was the black sheep. I spent a lot of time in the woods behind my house, so much that I knew the layout by heart. I knew where the leaf-covered ruts were, I knew where the slippery moss-covered stones were. I knew how many steps it took to get from my back porch, to the lake. Eight hundred twenty.\n\nI remember being bullied a lot in tenth grade, and the forest became a refuge of sorts, I was able to get away from everything and just breathe. It was spring of that year, when I noticed a rock moved out of place, not far from my normal route through the trees. It revealed a small brown box. Inside were a compass and a small map, on a material I can't quite describe, it's not as thick as leather but it had the same feel, and the map itself looked burned into the material, and in another language.\n\nNow remember this was a long time ago, we didn't have Google back then. And even though my dad was the inventor and managing director of AltaVista, I was unable to find any information about what the words meant, or even what language it was. But I wasn't going to give it up. It was enough of a distraction from the occasionally bullying I suffered at school.\n\nIt was almost at random, that I found what the map described. It was an entrance to a cave, and it had been hidden well. There was a steep dropoff just inside, with a pulley system and a bit of frayed rope. I tied myself on but it wasn't going to let me down. I went for it anyway, and the rope snapped on me halfway down.\n\nI fell hard on my side, and the wind was knocked out of me. It was dimly lit with a light in the distance, and there was a deep pool of still water stretching as far as I could see. I stumbled back until I felt the cave wall, and as I moved to the right I caught fleeting glimpses of something at my feet, just under the sand. It shined and glistened in the dim light of the cave, I reached down and picked up a dusty old coin. I put one in my pocket, because I knew I'd have to do an internet search for what it might be.\n\nAnd that whole time, I hadn't noticed the ripples in the water, until she stepped right out of the depths. She was stunning, the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and I had trouble looking away. She said don't be shy, that it was okay, everyone acted like that the first time they saw her, and she told me that all of my dreams would come true, she only needed one thing.\n\nI looked up at her with a mix of lust, fear and trepidation and asked what she needed. And she said about tree fiddy. Up until that moment I didn't realize I was talking to a twenty-story crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "I was excited. I had never been invited to Tess' house before. She'd been my friend since we were in the third grade, and not once had she ever had me over to her house. In fact, I had never even met her parents! \n\nTess was a beautiful girl, and I often was jealous of her good looks. She had gorgeous brown hair that flowed down to her waist, and bright green eyes that shimmered whenever she laughed. She was always popular with the boys, and on more than one occasion had caught the interest of boys I had been interested in, much to my dismay.\n\nWe met during a class project, where the teacher had set us up to be partners for a short math assignment. We had to present the problem and solution on the board. It was all fairly simple, considering we were in elementary school, but the two of us hit it off and became fast friends.\n\nOver the years, I often found it odd that Tess never talked about her family. I kind of figured that she had reasons, but I never pried, because I knew that if something really wrong was going on, she would tell me. I think that she always knew that I was a little worried, so she tried to make sure that I knew that, whatever her home situation was, that it was not a huge problem. She just didn't want to talk about her family, and that was okay.\n\nTess would stay over at my house a couple of times a month during our high school years, and we had a great time together. We talked about cloths, and boys, and even practiced kissing with each other. There was actually a time that I thought I may have been bisexual, but quickly realized that I wasn't sexually attracted to females, I just loved Tess. I loved Tess like she was a sister, and she loved me. We were family, and that was all I needed.\n\nCollege started, and the two of us managed to get into the same state college. We were so excited. We both had been so worried that we wouldn't be able to be together, and, even though we could have Skyped, it would not have been the same. The fact that we weren't separated was like a sign that the two of us would be best friends forever, and neither of us could have been happier.\n\nFlash forward to now, and I was finally getting to stay over at Tess' house. She lived near a forest, and her house sat near a large pond on the outskirts of town. Most people never came around here, and when they did, never stuck around long. The house was old and creepy, and the pond constantly had fog around it, for seemingly no reason.\n\nAs I arrived, I noticed Tess standing around the pond, throwing bread crumbs into the water for the ducks to eat. Her hair glowed, radiant in the sun. I stood and admired her beauty before I walked over to her and greeted her with a hearty hello.\n\nTess turned to me, and I immediately realized that something was wrong. You don't get to be such close friends with someone and not be able to know when something is bothering them. Tess' face was grave, and my heart skipped a beat. I had never seen Tess this bothered by anything.\n\n\"Oh my God, Tess, what's wrong?\" I asked, and looked into her eyes.\n\n\"I need your help,\" Tess whispered, avoiding my gaze.\n\n\"Anything, anything,\" I said, trying to be as comforting as possible.\n\n\"I... Never mind, I couldn't ask that of you. It's too much to ask of anyone,\" Tess cried, tears leaking from her eyes.\n\nI ran my fingers through Tess' hair. \"Sweetie, you know I'd do anything for you. What do you need? We can work through it together.\"\n\nTess took a deep breath, and finally locked eyes with me. \"I'ma need about tree fitty.\"\n\nIt was about this time that I noticed that Tess' hair had come off in my hands, and that it was actually a wig! I looked back at Tess and realized for the first time that she was actually 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era!

{"body": "When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms.  She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet.  His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name.  Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.  \n\nJoe didn't give a shit.  He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either.  Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom.  His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\".  His name was now legally Adam Adams.  Why?  All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\n\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe,  my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it.  He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember.  But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage.  The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me.  Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son.  This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\n\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.  \n\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on.  She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does.  My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\n\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.  \n\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story.  She does.  Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words).  While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out. \n\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved.  After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad.  I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story.  When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her.  She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again.  But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one. ^^^^[sauce](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xu7ju/just_saw_a_mother_walk_into_a_classroom_with_a/c5pniko)\n\ntl;dr: Friend's mom is an overprotective bitch, I get mad at her for being an overprotective bitch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427143549", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Then at about 3pm I got a phone call from him asking to meet at the beach later in the evening. I was nervous, but excited. I arrived at the beach around 7pm, he was waiting for me under a lovely pohutukawa tree. We walked down the beach while the sun set, he tenderly grabbed my hand and held me close as we walked barefoot in the warm sand. We were quite far from the other beach goers at this point. He stopped suddenly, turned to face me and said \"I need to ask you something\". \n\nI could feel my heart in my throat, butterflies in my stomach. My entire being was inexplicably drawn towards him.

Then I fell brough the ice, and a great white shark the size of he Empire State buildin tried to eat me. so I strangled it, and strangled it, for about 5 hours. Then I realized that great white sharks don't breathe air so you can't strangle it. I then remembered all the documentaries I saw about sharks, and remembered that if I turn the shark upside down, it becomes paralyzed (this is true, it's called tonic immobility). so I turned the shark upside down, then I grabbed my knife, cut it open, took out its guts and tied it's fins behind its back. I then stabbed both its eyes, and swan to the surface. By now the hole I fell through had frozen over, so I spashed through 30 feet of solid ice piece by piece with my face. All while strangling the Loch Ness monster with my right hand, and a giant crocodile with my left. I then finally reached the surface, took a deep breath. I then walked, no particular direction, I just walked. It was -65 degrees, so I put my hood up and kept walking. I hen came across some sort of fortress, and was all like \"what the hell is that nazi flag doing there? Turns out, at the end of WWII hitler faked his death and really went to live in a secret Antarctic base for the rest of his life. I approach the gate, and someone starts shooting at me. So I caught on of the bullets with my teeth, took it out, and through it at him. When the bullet hit him, he exploded. Just like that, now you see him, now you don't. Anyways, nore nazis started shooting, and some of them actually hit me, but I didn't care, I just kept throwing the bullets bacj at them, and I didn't miss once. Then a giant tank moved out toward me, and it fired a single shot, which I caught in my teeth and spat out onto the ground. I then picked up the tank by its barrel, and threw it at a plane that just took off. Then and other plane flew nearby, shooting .50 cal bullets all over the place. I grabbed its wing, and held on. The pilot saw me and tried to shake me off, but I just grabbed him, strangled him with my left hand, beat he crap out of him with my left hand, and flew the plane with my knee. While doing this, I shot down 7 enemy planes before the guy i was stangling get finally got hit by a stray bullet and died. I then threw his body at a nazi V2 rocket, making it explode, killing lots of nazis. Then my plane ran out of fuel, so I jumped at another plane, landed on its wing. Then a evil gremlin attacked my, and I punched it in the face and it died. Then 3 more gremlins jumped me, with their sharp teeth and long claws. I barely managed to beat them up on the wing of this plane. Then 26 more crawled out of the engines, and I grabbed a gun and I shot them all. Next thing I know, the bullet hits the fuel tank of the plane and the whole aircraft is on fire. So I jump into he cockpit, murder the nazi pilots, and ignored the painful Fire and focused on shooting down more planes. I kept doing this untill every part of the plane that could burn had burnt, including me. So I jumped onto yet another plane, beat up the crew, and started flying the plane and shooting down yet more enemies. Then an enemy plane shot the engine of my plane, so I walked out onto the wing with some bubble gum and tin foil and fixed it right up. I managed to repair it and get it running again, but by that point, we were just about to crash. And it was too late for me to get into the cockpit and do anything about it. So now I grabbed a rock, ran toward the base, and murdered the rest of the nazis. Next thing I know, my only ride home is on the back of a narwhal. So I jump onto its back, and ride my noble steed home, and beat up 19 sea monsters in the process.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427162254", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**[Lost in Translation, or “Oh, the Mormanity!”](https://theicidalmaniac.wordpress.com/tag/bullshit-in-the-book-of-mormon/)** (Part 1 of 3)\n\nUtah has no shortage of mythology and folklore, a great deal of which is tied to the LDS church organization and its, er, interesting tales.  A recent discussion on Postmormon.org , in which I participated, reveals the ubiquity of these dubious stories.  Among them are claims that a Mormon official encountered bigfoot while on horseback, and discovered the beast to be none other than Cain, the son of Adam.  And of course no suite of tall tales would be complete without a lake monster story.  Utah’s Bear Lake is said to be the home of one such monster, and local folklore has it that Bear Lake is connected to Loch Ness in Scotland by a long tunnel which serves as a a thoroughfare for Nessie as he travels, apparently through magma, between the two locations.  It has even been reported that Brigham Young himself went to great expense to catch the monster using 300 feet of rope and a large custom-crafted hook baited with a sheep.\n\nMyths abound here in the wild country, but I wanted to focus on something that came up recently in my family.  My mother handed me an email recently, which was given to her by her mother, forwarded by her sister-in-law (that’s how these things apparently propagate in the digital age, even among octogenarians).  It was a four page “transcript” of a “speech” given by former apostle Russel M. Nelson.  She handed it to me saying “you’re a linguist,” (I’m not, although I am studying linguistics) “I think you might find this interesting.”  She then qualified this by saying that she was in no way attempting to “re-convert me,” although I think that this was precisely her intent.  Fortunately, I had come across this story some time before and was prepared to handle it.  I’ll only provide a link to the “talk” called “Reflections of Sami Hanna,” rather than post the entire contents here.  In the text, it is claimed that one Dr. Sami Hanna, an expert in Semitic languges, was converted to Mormonism after determining that it was a true Semitic text.  Here is a link which, in its preface disclaimer, alludes to the biggest problem in establishing the truth of the claims that lie within.  The author of the page states:\n\n“Elder Nelson has mentioned Sami Hanna in several talks. All the information mentioned in this talk regarding what Mr. Hanna learned during his translation of the Book of Mormon into Arabic is accurate and verifiable. Why I have a disclaimer is because I have not been able to find where THIS PARTICULAR talk originated. I am not nor have I ever intimated that Elder Nelson or anyone else made up Sami Hanna or his story. I just don’t know if Elder Nelson gave this specific talk as it is written, or if it is just a compilation of other talks given by Elder Nelson on this subject. It could just be a copy of a sacrament meeting talk he gave in 1976 that was never published. The origin of this talk itself is not what’s important. What is important is that everything mentioned in it is true.“\n\nElder Nelson did, indeed, mention Dr. Hanna in several talks, however Elder Nelson’s office released an official statement denying that he wrote “Reflections of Sami Hanna.”  One might wonder then, is Elder Nelson lying about having written it, or did the author lie about being Elder Nelson?  Either way, the entire story is therefore discredited as a hoax.\n\nDo I stop there?  Oh no.  Not on your life.  Because people still believe this!  To be fair, this has been rejected by most of the online Mormon apologetic community, but it is still circulating, so I feel I must treat it.  I’m going to look at the specific claims, and deconstruct them.\n\n*This may not be of interest to all readers.  I have provided this information for anyone who has been duped by this fraud of a story, or for non-Mormons who have heard the tale and lack the inside info to tackle the technical aspects.  For those who are uninterested, rest assured that I will return soon with other, more tantalizing tidbits!\n\n(cracks knuckles)\n\nThe story claims that Dr. Hanna was converted when he translated the Book of Mormon into Arabic.\n\nSami Hanna is an expert in Semitic languages, and legend has it that, upon being presented with a Book of Mormon, he began to translate it into Arabic.  He was stunned by the ease with which the book flowed back into a Semitic language, so much so that he became immediately convinced of its authenticity and converted to Mormonism.  This claim has been supported by Nelson elsewhere, and a certain Mark Hanna, who claims to be Sami’s son, affirms that this is true, but says that it was a momentary lapse of reason, and that now Dr. Hanna has reverted to some more ancient form of Christ worship.  So this checks out, but it is hardly helpful in supporting the major claim being made.\n\nThe story further claims that “this was to be a translation back to the original language of the book.”\n\nAs far as I can tell this would, indeed, have been the first Arabic translation, however to claim that this would convert it back into the “original language” is problematic, to say the least.  The book of Mormon is said by Mormons to have been started around 600 BCE.  But the earliest evidence of Arabic, the ABSOLUTE earliest thing that linguists can call Arabic, dates from 328 CE, over 900 years AFTER Nephi supposedly started writing in America after traveling from Jerusalem.  What’s more, the Book of Mormon directly states in Mormon 9:32-33 that the native tongue of the authors was Hebrew, but that they had to write in “Reformed Egyptian” characters, a writing system unknown to linguists, and not optimized for Hebrew.  The same verse goes on to state that due to their inability to write in Hebrew script, there were imperfections in the record, complicating any “easy translation.”\n\nIf Nephi’s people (Nephi being the supposed first author of the canonized Mormon text) were linguistically isolated from their original language community for nearly 1,000 years, and during that time another language popped up from the same source in a different location, it is HIGHLY unlikely that those two languages would have much in common, except for some word roots, the way English and Persian share some roots.  A language COMPLETELY replaces approximately 10% of its vocabulary every 1,000 years or so.  This may not sound impressive at first glance, so allow me to illustrate:\n\nBritain is invaded by waves of Germanic and Roman groups for centuries, until around 500 CE a language, Old English (Anglo-Saxon), forms as a composite of Germanic and Latin, and the local Britton languages.  500 years later, the Normans invade England and English takes on a Norman twist, then is later influenced heavily by French as France became the great world power.  Thus English is related to German, and also to French, and to Spanish through Latin.  All of these languages share a common ancestor, Indo-European, as does Greek and Persian (Farsi).  Let’s look at the word for HEART in each of these languages:\n\nENGLISH: Heart\n\nOLD ENGLISH: Heorte\n\nGERMAN: Herz\n\nLATIN: Cor\n\nFRENCH: Cœur\n\nSPANISH: Corazón\n\nGREEK: Kardia\n\nProto-INDO-EUROPEAN: Kerd\n\nSome of these may seem unrelated.  You might say that over the years – the thousand and a half years since English split from Latin, the several thousand years since each of these split from Indo-European, that the vocabulary for heart has changed.  But it hasn’t, as such.  These are merely morphologically different incarnations of the same original Indo-European root word.  Indo-European “Kerd” morphed into “khertan” in Proto-Germanic, into “kardia” in Greek, and “cor” in Latin.  Latin is responsible for both “cœur” in French and “corazón” in Spanish, as is plain to see.  “Kardia” is responsible for our term “cardio,” and “khertan” became “heorte” and by 1500 CE, the present-day English “HEART“.  So the vocab of this word is considered the same, and would not be part of that 10% new vocab I mentioned above, despite the very different look between the Greek, German, and French.  The kinds of changes that represent a shift in vocabulary are even stronger than that.  What is meant when it is said that 10% of the vocabulary changes is that COMPLETELY NOVEL words are invented out of whole cloth, or are replaced by loan words from unrelated languages.  For instance, if an Englishman moved to Utah, he might see mountainous rock formations that were completely alien to his English mountains, and would have to either invent a new word to describe them, or borrow an Indian word, thus changing the vocabulary of the language.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427220933", "subreddit": "exmormon", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;...and the reason that the AGs were stated to be let go was because they did not pursue voter fraud cases because it was official DOJ policy to NOT prosecute voter fraud cases around elections.\n\nThere is ample time to prosecute those cases outside of the election timetable - were there cases to prosecute, which, again there were **not**.  The reason for the existing policy was to prevent politicized prosecutions and a large part of the scandal was that the various United States Attorneys were told specifically to make cases against Democrats for voter fraud at election time - no matter how flimsy those cases might be.  The point was to smear the other party by any means necessary - that those cases wouldn't hold up in court didn't matter.\n\nThat kind of selective political prosecution amounted to clear abuse of power and was not, as you seem to want to imply, some bold new aggresssive policy re. voter fraud.  If there was voter fraud going on by the Democrats, on any significant scale, during the George W. Bush administration, it would have been uncovered.  But there was no such thing, so it wasn't.\n\nThe only kind of voter fraud you can establish exists is the kind that voter ID laws wpuld have **no** impact on.  Yet you still claim significant in person fraud is a major problem **even as you provide exactly ZERO evidence to back your claim**.  It's all rather like arguing with someone who claims the Loch Ness monster exists, or Bigfoot exists.  Sure, Bigfoot \"could\" exist.  The Loch Ness monster \"could\" exist as well.  Significant in-person voter fraud \"could\" exist.  But all the hard evidence says, unequivocally, that these things don't exist.  A trillion \"coulds\" equals exactly how many cold hard facts?  **ZERO**.  They all add up to **ZERO** and always have.  It's very simple math but something the Voter ID crowd just doesn't seem to get.\n\nCome back with some actual facts and we'll talk.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427224845", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt; T9 is also a much bigger roadblock\n\nSo many people just buy it and sell groups are cheaper by the day for T9. I join occasionally more to help friends that need a tank to secure a sale than to make a livelihood out of it. Usually I'll see 200K for a T9, so that's what 1.4M they're charging them, AND they get the loot? To be fair, neither figure is much to me, I'm a crafter, I fart more than 200K and hell, the whole 1.4M is a pittance too. But I don't ALWAYS craft. I also raid and other junk. Imagine the scrubby no-name player who ONLY crafts and wants a T9 clear. 1.4M isn't a lot.\n\n\nNow let's get really real and talk about the other 99% of win buyers out there. Fucking gil buyers, failures in life both real and virtual. Judging by the shouts and tells, 10M is ~$30 or so, so T9 win for about 3 or 4 bucks. That's what those months and months of dodging meteors, practicing golem phases, doing Heavensfall absolutely perfectly, popping just the right cooldowns and pushing that DPS hard is worth. About tree fitty. Then these failures cycle in and out of the DF and join up PF since they no longer have that stigma of the soldiery bonus on a fight they should, and bleed their terrible all over the floor as they end up hugging it for 75% of the fight, doing 200 DPS the other 25% they happen to be alive.\n\n\nYes, I'll help sell a T9. Friends ask, I like the fight. Little bit of pocket change doesn't hurt. It's not a usual thing for me to do. But every fucking second I have to endure on a sell run, I'm thinking what a fucking scrub this guy is to buy a sell for last year's content they could just practice at, otherwise have no business doing in the first place. Oh I'm silently judging, believe me I am.

{"body": "I'm familiar with Jung and there's no real evidence to suggest shared memories. Most cultures encounter trees, humans are pattern seeking animals that use language, it's unsurprising that trees develop as symbols in isolation. \n\nIt would be wrong for me to suggest that the human mind is entirely material but it's equally incorrect there is any evidence with any weight at all that suggests otherwise. There's a great deal of evidence that suggests the human mind is material when we are alive. Different kinds of brain damage affect the brain in different ways, so we know the mind and 'self' can be changed in a material way while alive. Now, when the whole material brain ceases to function does my consciousness continue? Possibly, but only in the same way it's possible the loch ness monster is just REALLY good at hiding. It can't be disproved but it seems staggeringly unlikely when you take the evidence at face value. \n\nThat last example isn't meant to ridicule or put down anyone's beliefs. However it would be disingenuous of me to not lay my cards on the table. There are some great mysteries in the universe but to me \"what happens to me after I die\" isn't one of them. Maybe something does happen, but it seems incredibly unlikely considering the evidence available at this time. There is still A LOT to learn about the nature of consciousness and the brain, but not so much that it's unreasonable to view consciousness as a material phenomenon.

{"body": "It's getting late over here and  I'm only repeating myself so you might read it for yourself. \n\n&gt;The diet is based on several premises. Proponents of the diet posit that during the Paleolithic era — a period lasting around 2.5 million years that ended about 10,000 years ago with the advent of agriculture and domestication of animals — humans evolved nutritional needs specific to the foods available at that time, and that the nutritional needs of modern humans remain best adapted to the diet of their Paleolithic ancestors. Proponents claim that human metabolism has been unable to adapt fast enough to handle many of the foods that have become available since the advent of agriculture. Thus, modern humans are said to be maladapted to eating foods such as grain, legumes, and dairy, and in particular the high-calorie processed foods that are a staple of most modern diets. Proponents claim that modern humans' inability to properly metabolize these comparatively new types of food has led to modern-day problems such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427233434", "subreddit": "nutrition", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Adam had spent the night wearing long weary tracks in the ancient moldy carpet of his apartment.  The building had been put up in the late sixties, and hadn't been remodeled since.  In fact, if it were possible to have retrofitted the place with furnishings from the paleolithic era in order to save costs, he was fairly certain the owners had done so.  Unfortunately, rocks that nice are hard to come by these days, and so they'd settled for cheap nylon carpet and thrillingly flimsy wooden chairs.  You never were *quite* certain if today would be the day one would give out under you, rendering you with a sprained ankle and a rather annoyed downstairs neighbor (from the noise of the collapse or the loud profanity, take your pick).  \n\nBack and forth, back and forth.  He hit himself in the forehead softly but with increasing force, with a rhythm that would have been soothing if it weren't so violent.  It came to a crux as he slammed both hands down on a battered walnut coffee table, ice-blue eyes staring at a blank television screen in a manner that would have suggested to an ordinary man that he should run.  There was a distinct reek of madness behind that gaze.  It probably wasn't helped by the disheveled clothing and hair that could have been better combed by a wind tunnel.  But, ahhh, he knew that he had to be right.\n\nThe signs had all been leading up to it.  And the sleepless hours he'd just spent had confirmed it.  Yes, yes.  It was all coming together now.  For a moment, he looked at the wall and frowned.  Maybe he should have gotten one of those big cork boards, with the yarn and the pins and the newspaper clippings, just so he could feel hip for once in his life.  No, he decided.  Most people with those were conspiracy theorists or government agents, and he was neither.  He very much did not want to be a government agent, if the message they'd sent was correct.  Or... perhaps... perhaps he'd got it backwards.  He sat down and began to work furiously with a pen and an already-well-scribbled over sheet of last week's news.\n\nHe'd started piecing it together that night, when he got home and put on the news.  The headlines had changed somewhat since that morning's paper, but something was very odd about the way the interviewee on the newscast was phrasing things.  His long-thought-dead sense of hope at finding a secret clue, a puzzle that only he could solve, began crawling out of its coffin, pushing the dirt aside, glancing momentarily at the headstone of where it had been buried, then like a bloodhound on a scent, snaked up to the part of his brain where the rational sense lived and unceremoniously strangled it.\n\nYes.  It was a puzzle.  It was all a great big wonderful puzzle.  The words, the words.  They had to mean something.  He'd transcribed the interview word-for-word, replaying the clip over and over.  Not that he'd needed it, of course.  Those words were burned into his mind from the fifteen seconds of the interview that had been publicized.  *That had been carefully planned to be publicized.*\n\nAnd he, Adam Douglas, he had been the one to figure it out.  With a mounting sense of exhilaration, he picked up the piece of paper he'd cracked the code on, and practically danced to his kitchen with a giddy sensation rising in his chest.\n\nHe blinked twice when he read the message, re-reading it as the weight of a thousand smug political lies settled onto his chest.  His expression shifted to blank confusion.  So... this was it, then.  On the piece of paper were eight solitary words.\n\n\"So long, and thanks for all the fish.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427240531", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yeah, I know about this problem.\n\nI was talking to a Cast Member in a bar on I Drive the other day. He was pretty laid back, really about joking around. He told me a few crazy guest stories, and for some reason, I decided to ask him why this happens.\n\nAt first he just gave me the old, \"It's magic! You'd have to ask Mickey why he decides to change it around.\" Ha ha, right, fuck me for trying.\n\nBut when I bought him another round, he decided to actually open up about this. Turns out, he actually works attractions in Tomorrowland, and I guess I opened him up to sharing something he wasn't really supposed to.\n\nBasically, it *is* a feature. But a really weird one. It used to just be that the stars and all were always kept on, but about 4 years ago, they started to flicker. Like, all of them flickering on and off at once. Not really something that fits the whole \"good show\" thing, so after it happened a few times, they had to shut the ride down for maintenance.\n\nI guess there was something more complicated causing the problem, and they didn't want to keep such a heavy volume attraction down for however long they expected it to take, so they decided to test out running it without the lights. After they decided it didn't really pose any problems, they opened the attraction back up and continued to work on the problem backstage.\n\nHere's the funny part: Most guests didn't notice the difference, but frequent guests (like OP) caught it right away. Of course CMs weren't allowed to explain the change, but they gauged reactions, and they determined there was about a 50/50 split—some guests *loved* the change, and some were disappointed to see the old lights go. So they asked Imagineering if while they were working on the fix for the problem they could wire the star lights separate from the rest of the lighting.\n\nBut how to decide when to turn them on and when not? They didn't find it \"magical\" enough to just alternate days, and they would need to shut down the ride to turn them on or off, so they couldn't do it in the middle of the day. Crazy, but they decided to base it on the \"family of the day.\" If the family has an even number of members, they turn the lights off, and if it's an odd number, they turn them on.\n\nI didn't believe this guy, but he swore it was true. Seemed like a cool dude. He even offered to buy the next round, but when he went to pay for it, he was a little short. I asked him how much he needed, and he told me, \"About tree fiddy.\" Tree fiddy. It was around that time I realized this CM was eight stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. I said, \"Damn it, Nessie, I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!\" Then he swam off into the distance.\n\nSo in the end, I'm not totally sure whether to believe the story, but it's a cool enough story anyway.\n\n**TL;DR** - Electrical problem led to them deciding when to turn the lights on based on an interesting system.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1427262951", "subreddit": "WaltDisneyWorld", "score": 48, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The paleo definition \n\n&gt; A: To put it simply: the Paleolithic Era is what formed our species. Evolution is a slow process. Our species had a leisurely 2-3 million years to adapt to our environmental niche. The invention of agriculture, only 10-15,000 years ago, was a very sudden and dramatic shift in diet and environment for many human cultures. **Foods like** cereal grains (wheat, rice, barley), legumes (beans, peanuts) and **dairy not only appeared, but became dietary staples, when earlier they would have been rare-to-nonexistent**. The primary idea behind the paleo diet is that humans, as a species, have not yet evolved to be able to handle these foods well.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/wiki/faq\n\nAs always, there's a specturm of what people should do.  Some people don't do well with nuts, despite being paleo.\n\n&gt; modern dairy products, especially conventional pasteurized milk. Raw milk contains lactase which helps digest the milk sugar (lactose). Pasteurization deactivates this enzyme, leaving the body with undigestible lactose that can cause irritation. Casein (milk protein) is another known gut irritant. However butter and fermented dairy products such as yogurt cause much less problems due to their content of lactose and proteins.\n\nIt's about minimizing the milk proteins and milk sugars.  If you completely eliminated them (99.99% anyways), you'd be left with ghee/clarified butter.  It's just fat at that point, so who cares?

We are left wondering, where are they?\n\nThis is what is known as the Fermi Paradox.\n\nWe had no idea why we have not seen or heard from our interstellar neighbors. They skies remained silent has they have always been. \n\nThen a whisper. An simple numeric sequence made out of dots and dashes coming from a previously unknown planetoid between earth and mars orbits that was perfectly synced with Earth's own orbit with the sun.\n\nSETI finally popped open that bottle of champagne. However, that excitement turned into concern as that numeric sequence was revealed to be a count down. \n\nThe pentagon militarized the whole project and deemed it classified even though anyone with an AM/FM radio could pick up the signal on a clear night. Men in military uniforms locked everything down and threatened us with charges of treason if we, like the General Swartz put it, make like Snowden.\n\nThe next week the office was tense and oppressive. The count down made the situation all too real, and the military types felt it too and some of them blamed us for this. \n\nNASA and NORAD watched this new planetoid that some how appeared in the night sky. It was close enough for our telescopes to see that it was a rock about the size of Alaska, it did however have structures built on the surface on the planet and had scars of a mining operation on its face. The orbit was stable and it was not decaying in one way or the other. It was close enough to mars and our own plantet that it should have messed its orbit but it seemed to ignore the gravitational influence of both its neighboring planets.\n\nOur own attempts to contact the object were only met with silence. The silence here, however, did not last for long. The planetoid was too close and its radio signal was strong enough for a car radio to pick it up. We didn't need to leak it, amateur astronomers did that for us. It was all what the 24 hour news networks were talking about, only to break away for about a day to cover a mass suicide by a doomsday cult.\n\nRiots were starting to break out, a lot of states in the US declaring a state of emergency with national guard units supplementing police forces. Supermarkets wiped clean by the populace preparing for the worst as the countdown nears its end. \n\nThen a Bang. A massive data stream overloaded everything on every wavelength. The planetoid did not change its orbit or seem to change. It took us about day to figure out what happening. Everything using a radio frequency was knocked out due to the over whelming strength of the signal.\n\nWe were surprised to see what was in the data stream, it was not only in our languages but it was using our codecs and file types! I personally opened a zip containing schematics for a consumer grade quantum CPU. \n\nThen among all the data we found protocols for linking to an alien network. We quickly kluged together a text messenger using those protocols and sent a message in our own language.\n\n[SETI, USA, EARTH]: To it may concern, the massive data stream your are sending is currently disrupting our own networks and technology on a global scale. We cannot handle this load, please respond.\n\nThe whole room was tense, uniforms and SETI nerds huddled around a projector as they waited for a response. Radios in the room cleared up from the static, and Internet service returned soon after.\n\nThen a response.\n\n[Quarantine Office, LNM Empire, SOL STATION] Apologies, we have over estimated your planet's infrastructure. It was not our intention.\n\nWe all gasped not quite expecting it. We quickly confirmed it was from the planetoid. I cracked my knuckles not quite knowing what to write next.\n\n[SETI, USA, EARTH]: My name is John, who are you?\n\n[Quarantine Office, LNM Empire, SOL STATION]: I am Professor Loc'nex of the Quarantine Office for the LNM Empire. I writing to you through a translator program to speak to you in your specific human dialect. \n\n[SETI, USA, EARTH]: Why are you here and why now?\n\n[Quarantine Office, LNM Empire, SOL STATION]: Your planet has been quarantined for [585.83 years]. It was deemed no longer necessary and this was our attempt to initiate to contact through the WANet.\n\n[SETI, USA, EARTH]: Why were we quarantined?\n\n[Quarantine Office, LNM Empire, SOL STATION]: I'll tell you, but first, I need about treefiddy.\n\nThen I realized the Professor Loc'nex, was a 500 foot tall monster form the paleolithic area.\n\n[SETI, USA, EARTH]: God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain’t gonna give you no tree fiddy!!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427310085", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

Often times i'm able to figure stuff out for myself, but for the more serious stuff, its a little frustrating knowing the general stuff of what's going on, but not the specifics.\n\nFor example, I got an MRI a couple of weeks ago to try to figure out what was wrong with my knee. I thought it was a form meniscus, but I work primarily with children, so I'm not as knowledgeable in that area. The doctor, not knowing I was a fellow doctor, began to explain how a meniscus gets torn and how to fix it. I had to interrupt him, saying that I was a pediatrician and knew the basic stuff.\n\n\nAs I'm in the machine, the doctor (let's call him John just to make it easier), kept fumbling with the equipment. Pretty unprofessional if you ask me.\n\nOnce I got the results back, he began to explain what was wrong. Turns out I was right, I had a torn meniscus. As I was sitting there, I asked how much I owed him.\n\nJohn said \"about treefiddy\".\n\nThat's when I noticed he was 500 foot tall and from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "The Klosterman 15...\n\n1.Let us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn anymore; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence. **Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?**\n\n2.Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots. **Would you attempt to do this?**\n\n3.Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical. **Which option do you select?**\n\n4.You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Credence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it’s being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it’s being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a Capella (but it will only sound this way to you). **Would you swallow the pill?**\n\n5.At long last, someone invents \"the dream VCR.\" This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR. **Would you still do this?**\n\n6.Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week. **You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?**\n\n7.You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson's gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film's \"deeper philosophy.\" **Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?**\n\n8.A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commercial success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man). **Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likelihood of you reading this book?**\n\n9.You are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that--somewhere--your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill. **Would you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie?**\n\n10.You meet a wizard. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, \"I will now make them a dollar more attractive.\" He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But--somehow--this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can't deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though--you can only pay him once. You can't keep giving him money until you're satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front. **How much cash do you give the wizard?**\n\n11.For reasons that cannot be explained, cats can suddenly read at a twelfth-grade level. They can't talk and they can't write, but they can read silently and understand the text. Many cats love this new skill, because they now have something to do all day while they lay around the house; however, a few cats become depressed, because reading forces them to realize the limitations of their existence (not to mention the utter frustration of being unable to express themselves). **This being the case, do you think the average cat would enjoy Garfield, or would cats find this cartoon to be an insulting caricature?**\n\n12.You have a brain tumor. Though there is no discomfort at the moment, this tumor would unquestionably kill you in six months. However, your life can (and will) be saved by an operation; the only downside is that there will be a brutal incision to your frontal lobe. After the surgery, you will be significantly less intelligent. You will still be a fully functioning adult, but you will be less logical, you will have a terrible memory, and you will have little ability to understand complex concepts or difficult ideas. **The surgery is in two weeks. How do you spend the next fourteen days?**\n\n13.You have won a prize. The prize has two options, and you can choose either (but not both). The first option is a year in Europe with a monthly stipend of $2,000. The second option is ten minutes on the moon. **Which option do you select?**\n\n14.Your best friend is taking a nap on the floor of your living room. Suddenly, you are faced with a bizarre existential problem: This friend is going to die unless you kick them (as hard as you can) in the rib cage. If you don’t kick them while they slumber, they will never wake up. However, you can never explain this to your friend; if you later inform them that you did this to save their life, they will also die from that. So you have to kick a sleeping friend in the ribs, and you can’t tell them why. **Since you cannot tell your friend the truth, what excuse will you fabricate to explain this (seemingly inexplicable) attack?**\n\n15.For whatever the reason, two unauthorized movies are made about your life. The first is an independently released documentary, primarily comprised of interviews with people who know you and bootleg footage from your actual life. Critics are describing the documentary as “brutally honest and relentlessly fair.” Meanwhile, Columbia Tri-Star has produced a big-budget biopic of your life, casting major Hollywood stars as you and all your acquaintances; though the movie is based on actual events, screenwriters have taken some liberties with the facts. Critics are split on the artistic merits of this fictionalized account, but audiences love it. **Which film would you be most interested in seeing?**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427388718", "subreddit": "casualiama", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Back in highschool I was that stereotypical, unpopular nerd. There was this girl. She was from Scotland, a stereotype herself with red hair. Her family had moved down to England, something about her father's work. She wasn't considered the most attractive girls in the school but she was one of them and we hit it off because I had family in Scotland. We ended up talking. She would laugh at my jokes, touch my arm and do generally flirty things. The problem was this had happened before, and the girl who'd done it to me turned out to be pulling my leg and doing it for a joke. The first girl I mentioned hung around in the same circles as her so I thought it was happening again. I remember one day, her and I were sitting next to each other and a flew off on one, started laying into her about how I thought she was full of crap and how I was being played, how a girl as attractive as her could possibly be into me and we never really talked again.\n\nMany years later I went to a reunion. I was reluctant about the whole thing but a friend (also from school) encouraged me to go. Not long after I arrived I see this gorgeous red head. It's her! She sees me, smiles and remarks on how much I had changed, how good I looked. I lost a lot of weight since school. We got talking over the night and she said that all that flirting was real, that she had know idea about what that other girl had done and how it had left me feeling insecure. We ended up outside the venue the reunion was being held at while everyone else was outside. She said she understood why I reacted so badly now. She said it was upset about it for a long time because she really liked me.\n\nI thought she was too good to be true but it turned out she *was* legit. There was a problem though. With no one else around I went in for the kiss and she let me. We stood together, me holding her as we kissed while the music played inside. She was such a good kisser too. We kissed all the way back to my car, lust filled kisses, kisses to make up for all the lost years. I was holding her against my car door when she pulled away. She said that if what she thought was going to happen *was* going to happen we'd need protection. She went inside the venue to get some from a machine in the toilets and came back to the car. \n\n\"I don't have any money\" she said. No, no, no!! It's alright. I'll have some in my pocket so I scrambled to find some. Pulling out a handful of change I poked through the coins to see what I had. \"How much do you need?\" I said, to which she replied, \"I need about tree fiddy\".Well it was about that time that I noticed the hot red head about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era!!!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427390405", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Without warning an animal races past him, sending him back on his elbows.\n\n\"What was that!\" he cried, knowing he'd get no response. It was a large bird, bigger than he'd ever seen around here. It looked out of place.\n\nThe bird looked back at him from a safe distance, \"clear the road, asshole!\"\n\nThe man sat in stunned silence as his brain tried to process what had just happened.

{"body": "Couple comments first: it's actually equally likely that 2 moons would mean more variation but less total height in the tides.  Either way, general craziness in tides is quite likely.  \n\nPlanet a bit larger than Earth doesn't necessarily need the same density as Earth, so you could have a bigger overall planet with the same gravity.  In fact, a slightly larger planet with the exact same gravity would result in slightly *less* gravity on the surface (we're talkin' a few pounds here at best) because you're farther from the center, so if you're in the 'slightly' range you can basically get away with anything you want in terms of more / less / same and have a valid scientific reason for it.\n\nLots of questions just to poke you and see what comes out:\n\nDo Leviathans come up to the coast of the atolls?  Or do they stick to the waters outside the continental shelf?\n\nRelated to the above - food.  If you can't fish the waters around an atoll without fear of being eaten by the Loch Ness monster's big brother, where does the food come from?  Can't be land-based if that's all overgrown.  Do people fish from the airships?  Ooooo, I like that.  That's fun.\n\nMinerals / hard stuff: where do people get iron for weapons and ships?  Usually that's a mine, and mines have notorious problems when they're below the water table.  Could have extensive diggings beneath the atolls with complex setups of steam engines for keeping the mines cleared out.  Or they could harvest them from sea flora / fauna.\n\nWhy attack?  I mean, there are the normal reasons like stealing someone's wife, but what're the strategic resources that people fight over?  \n\nFuel sources - can those be harvested from the water, or is land the only place to find fuel for all this stuff?\n\nProbably the biggest question - if land was so scarce, where did land fauna and the human / sentient race come from in the first place?

Random pieces of wire, headphones lost in the sand, the occasional broken piece of beach chair.

Within an hour I knew I found something big.  My headphones were going crazy with the sound of a large piece of metal.  So I pulled out my tri-fold micro shovel (which I brought on all my excursions), and soon I found my prize.  As I dug it out I couldn't discern what it was... The object was about 11' long at the longest part and sort of shaped like a cylinder.  The entire thing was not made of metal but the outside had a thick metal band.  I live near where there used to be lots of Native Americans but I didn't think they would make something like this (maybe brought by Europeans and gifted to a tribe?).\n\n\nI needed to know, so I took the object down to an antique store that in my area.  I put the object on the counter and a look of shock came across the nice old man's face.  He lowered his glasses and said; \"son... do you have any idea what this is?\"  The object started to rumble and move on it's own.   It was around this time I realized that the object was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again.

{"body": "Bob looked up from his book and surveyed the livingroom, unsure if he had really heard that noise just now. \n\n\"The fuck was that?\" Bob asked, not expecting an answer. The noise resumed from his left. It sounded like sound clips from corny 80's porn. \n\n*ahn! Uhn! Ohhh yeah! Mmmmhhh!* \n\n\"Did my room-mate change my ringtone again?\" Bob wondered aloud, pulling his phone from his pocket. It was silent, much like his Girlfriend every time he asked her what was wrong. Without warning, the phone seemingly leaps out of Bob's hand.\n\n\"What! What the?!\" Bob yelps, nearly pissing himself as he stared at his floating phone. More 80's porno moans rang forth, receding away from Bob. The phone moved away with the moans.\n\n\"Okay, wise ass. Give my phone back!\" Bob yelled at the poltergeist, wishing he had a proton pack about now. Or a portal gun. He'd always wanted a portal gun. \n\n\"Heehehehe.\" A voice chortled, from roughly the same spot as the phone. Bob squinted his eyes suspiciously. He was pretty sure that poltergeists never spoke. And who the hell laughs like that? It sounded like a cross between Stitch from Lilo&amp;Stitch and Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nThe phone suddenly dropped to the floor, thudding loudly and making Bob cringe. \n\n\"Dammit! Careful you prick! Do you have any idea how much iPhones cost?\" Bob demanded indignantly. Sensual moans were all he received in response. Bob rolled his eyes, having become annoyed with this bullshit. He grabbed a nearby blanket and threw it at where he assumed the mysterious invisible thing was, but only succeeded in startling his cat Tammy. \"Sorry, Tam.\" \n\nStaccato moaning raced across the living room, going from one side to the other. Bob stood up from the couch and took a swipe at the air as the moans passed in front of him. He actually managed to hit something, albeit lightly. It was warm and solid.\n\n\"Ooh yeah baby, rub my nipples.\" The invisiprick moaned, making slurping noises. Bob frowned, less than amused.\n\n\"Who the fuck are you, anyways?\" Bob demanded, totally done with this shit.\n\n\"I am whoever you want me to be, baby. I could be your lover.\" The voice crooned, breathlessly.\n\n\"Yeah, no thanks. I have Samantha.\" Plus, Bob wasn't into guys.\n\n\"That's a cute name to give your hand.\" The Voice sneered.\n\n\"What? No, my hand's name is Jeramine-- wait, I mean, Samantha is a real person!\" Bob cringed, remembering that he had promised Samantha he would never call his hand by that name again. It was weird, she said. Much like how Bob said her third nipple was weird. She did not appreciate that.\n\n\"Mmhmm, sure she is sweetheart. Bless your heart.\" The Voice drawled, suddenly adopting a Southern accent. A very bad one at that.  \n\n\"Oh whatever, screw you.\" Bob muttered, wanting this day to end already. The moans resumed once more, this time moving to the left and just behind him. What felt like a hand caresses Bob's shoulder, and he really hoped it was in fact a hand.\n\n\"I want to make love to you all night.\" The Voice whispered in his ear, causing him to reflexively cringe. Bob jerked his shoulder hard, dislodging the hand, and spun quickly while throwing a left hook. His fist connected with something warm, hard, and... Scaly? The air began to shimmer, and a figure began to appear. It was... **It was...** An 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozaic era!\n\n\"Give me tree fiddy, bitch!\" Nessy roared, shaking the apartment and shattering the windows.\n\n\"God damnit Loch Ness Monstah! I ain't gon give you no tree fiddy! Get a god damn job!\" Bob roared back, furious. \"God damn Loch Ness Monstah, ain't no bitch gon give you tree fiddy!\"\n\nNessy took a lumbering step foward, thunderous moans resounding throughout the complex. Bob grabbed the lamp, and swung it with all his might. It shattered into pieces against Nessy's leg, and Bob realized at this time that it was hopeless. He looked into Nessy's rape face, and despaired.\n\nEDIT: Changed rale to rape.

While tragic, there is something poetic about the idea of it, in that it captured to me the image of just being driven insane by motherhood. Anyway, while pregnant, my brain got all weird. I was dead inside. Not sad. Not happy. Just no interest in anything. I was also having weird anxiety, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts. The doctor wanted me to go talk to a psychiatrist, but I told her it was fine. It's not like I'm going to drive into the sea with my baby. That became a joke with my husband and I. When the baby was being particularly fussy and difficult, I would tell him I was this close to driving us both into the sea. \n\nAlso, we do this thing when the baby won't stop fussing where we start telling a random story, about work, or something we did as children, or where we bought a particular lamp, and the story always ends with \"and then Baby was born, and she cried all the time for no reason.\" It's like our version of the loch ness monster tree fussy joke.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427512980", "subreddit": "BabyBumps", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So in my highschool growing up there was this girl, lets call her Val. Now Val wasnt no ordinary girl see, Val did these weird things after school. Nobody ever knew exactly what because we only caught glimpses of her run out the door and off into the woods near our school.  So im the curious one of the grade so one day i follow her (yes its creepy but i decided why the fuck not). So finally i get into the woods and i see val standing there, in the middle of the woods. She kinda tilts her head i swear this bitch starts hissing at me. So i at this point im out of there, i fucking book if from the woods. That night i called my friend to tell him and of course he didnt believe my ass. Next day in school Val walks into study hall with this giant satchel looking bag and starts rifling through it at her table, alone of course. Now in her unneccesary hurry she drops her things to in an attempt to talk to her i pick her stuff up. As my hands reach ouch to grab her items she swats my hands with a comb from her bag and fucking HISSES at me. So im like, \"bitch da fuq you doing. \". Finally, I had enough. That day i followed her again into the woods. I found her same way as before just standing and hissing at me. In an attempt to talk to Val i yelled \"Val, what is going on with you? What do you want?\". Val whipped around and something was off, her voice sounded rugged and suddenly her backpack dropped to the floor. It was at this moment that i realized Val was a Crustacean and she started to scream at me asking for tree fiddy.\n\nTLDR: i got bored", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427518299", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was around the age of seven years old, me and my family went out to a for a camping trip in a forest about 30 - 40 minutes away from us. It was a Saturday night if I remember correctly. The wind was warm, the stars shined brighter than diamonds against a flashlight. Everything was perfect. That was until dusk began to fall.\n\nMy parents were inside of our tent, situating and arranging things to lead to a comfortable night's sleep. I told them that I'll be sitting by the river (which was maybe a 30 second walk away), watching the water rush by. As I sat there, innocently admiring the beautiful features that nature had to offer, I noticed a gentle glow off in the distance. I called for my mom, but she didn't respond. Nor did my dad, I just assumed they were busy and in a rut trying to get things together. But of course, curiosity took over and I got up to see what that glow was.\n\nIt was a lime green-ish color, with a turquoise like aura surrounding it (think of it as looking at a light bulb, the center was lime but the \"glow\" was turquoise). The shit was beautiful man, it was like looking at a living ball of Fun Dip. I wanted to touch it. I wanted to see exactly what it was, to see if it'd take me to the Digi-World from my favorite cartoon or to see if it'd grant me some kinda super powers. I of course, was wrong. This glow became something majorly unsettling. As I inched closer to it, a slight humming noise began becoming more and more apparent. And at that moment, I felt it. PISS, was traveling down my leg, as straight fear was struck into me...but the temptation of finding out what that glow was was just too strong to ignore. I was only a few steps away from this mysterious, beautiful glow...and then it stopped. The glow began to shift from a green/blue to orange/red, to pure, unadulterated red. My eyes grew wider and wider as the red glow began to levitate higher and higher from the ground. From a few feet to a few stories, the glow kept rising until I was forced to step backward to bask in it's glory. Well it was about that time I realized this glow was about eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Proterozoic era. I said dammit monster, get out these woods!

I always asked him. \"Is there anything I can do to help you?\". I felt so bad for him. He would always say he didn't need my help or anything from anyone. He felt it was a mockery if anyone gave him hand outs. The cringe thing he  did, was always tell people to fight him. All the time. He would challenge atleast 3 people a day to a fight. It was so awkward/cringe watching people just facepalme and walk away, knowing John had no chance in any fight at all. But, there's one day I'll never forget. It was an average June school day. Hot as hell, but a nice breeze. Anyway, I get in the school to find everyone in a circle in the center of the hall. I ran up to see what was going on. As it would turn out, John got tired of being picked on. He challenged the school bully to a fight, and he actually accepted. I wish I could tell you John fought the good fight. *I wish I could tell you that*. He got beat horrifically. First, it was an upper cut to his jaw, then a kick to the chest. He fell immediately, but the bully kept on kicking. After 15 minutes, he finnaly quit kicking. I ran to John, who was lying in a pool of his own blood. Someone yelled \"Call 911!\" But the nearest hospital was 40 miles out. No way they'd be there in time. I cradled him, and one last time I asked \"God... John... What do you need. What can I do... John please, stay with me...\" And he finally decided to accept my offer. Coughing on his on blood, he murmured \"I... Do need... One thing...\" Fighting back tears I said \"what John, what is it?\" What he said was... Shocking. \"About tree fiddy\" that's when I realized, John was no middle school student at all. He was a 250 ft tall crustacean. \"God damn it, you Loch Ness monster!

{"body": "My wealthy New England family used to have a summer home near a then-secluded part of the Loch when I was a kid. Nearly every morning from the day school let out until the last Friday before it started again, we would wake up and head down to the loch and do whatever kids do in water for fun, like swimming, kayaking, sometimes boating, as my father had a little motor boat that he would take us out in. Anyway, we had all heard about the Loch Ness monster. Every one had, especially those who lived around the loch. To us, it was always just a joke, we never believed in it. Sometimes we'd be out fishing and somebody would get a huge bite and then lose the fish before we could see it, and we'd say \"That's Nessie stealing our bait again,\" and just stuff like that. We thought of it like a unicorn or a leprechaun or whatever; it didn't exist. For years, spending most summer days playing in the water and on the shore, none of us had ever seen anything to indicate that there was a giant dinosaur in the loch. None of us even knew anyone who claimed to have seen it. However, one day, when I was 13 or 14, I was down at the loch by myself, which was unusual, since I was the oldest of 4 siblings who got along pretty well and usually hung out together. My parents had just been in a fight, not a physical one, but with screaming and all. I don't even remember what it was about, but my little sister starting crying because of all the screaming, and the others were upset and bickering, and I was tired of it, so I took off. I was just kind of sitting on the shore playing with rocks and sticks and stuff. It was a foggy day, pretty humid, and the sun was behind the clouds. Like I said, our little vacation home was on a secluded part of the loch at the time, so it was quiet outside and I couldn't see anyone else around. Then, all of a sudden, this giant gray-black thing just rises out of the water probably about 150 meters off the shore. At first it was just a gray hump, and I absolutely could not believe what I was seeing. Then a long, thin neck came up out of the water in front of it. It looked exactly like what you would imagine the Loch Ness monster to look like. It came up and looked around for probably 10 seconds, then disappeared as fast as it had risen. I distinctly remember just standing up quietly, staring out at where it had come up, and trying to think of some explanation. I thought about that for who knows how long, and then eventually decided that there was no \"rational\" explanation. I realized that I had just seen the fucking Loch Ness monster. And, being, a stupid kid, I went back to the house and told everyone. No one believed me, of course. I remember being pretty frustrated after they made fun of me for a little while, and they even made me doubt myself, but the memory is still as clear as day in my head. What I saw was not a sturgeon. It was not an eel. It was not a whale. It was the Loch Ness monster. If you think you can give me an explanation of how it was just seaweed or a \"submarine,\" I'm glad to hear it. I wish there was an explanation, so then I wouldn't feel so crazy about it. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427588258", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "An interesting theory i saw on television was about fermenting logs\n\ntaken from the Nessie wikipedia page: \n&gt;In a 1982 series of articles for New Scientist, Dr Maurice Burton proposed that sightings of Nessie and similar creatures could actually be fermenting logs of Scots Pine rising to the surface of the loch's cold waters. Initially, a rotting log could not release gases caused by decay, because of high levels of resin sealing in the gas. Eventually, the gas pressure would rupture a resin seal at one end of the log, propelling it through the water—and sometimes to the surface. Burton claimed that the shape of tree logs with their attendant branch stumps closely resemble various descriptions of the monster.\n\n&gt;Four Scottish lochs are very deep, including Loch Morar, Loch Ness and Loch Lomond. Only the lochs with pinewoods on their shores have monster legends; Loch Lomond—with no pinewoods—does not. Gaseous emissions and surfactants resulting from the decay of the logs can cause the foamy wake reported in some sightings. Indeed, beached pine logs showing evidence of deep-water fermentation have been found. On the other hand, there are believers who assert that some lakes do have reports of monsters, despite an absence of pinewoods; a notable example would be the Irish lough monsters.\n\nim trying to find videos, but it's hard to find anything with \"tree\" and \"loch ness\" without coming up on south park videos.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427591537", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I came back to my hometown between the end of boot and the start of A School because the Navy gave me an extra week of leave if I would help my old recruiter down at the local high schools. My days consisted of hanging around high schools in my johnny cash's and enjoying all the attention from the girls who were just a year below me and enjoyed seeing a man in uniform....anyway, I went to a local tavern one afternoon after school ended, because the food was good there, and I wanted to get some food and ruin my appetite before I headed home to my mom's cooking. \n\nI walked, still in uniform, and I saw two off-duty cops sitting at the bar. \"Oh ~~sh~~crap\" I thought, because technically, you weren't supposed to even *be* in the bar alone unless you were 21. \n\n\"Come on in, son\" one of the officers said and waved me to an empty stool at the bar.

Click now!\" I was pretty bored so I thought \"why not\" and clicked it. To my surprise it connected me with someone, and of course I figured \"yeah okay, bot.\" Still being bored I decided to try to mess with the bot, surprisingly she responded in a normal human fashion! So I actually tried talking to her, she was really cool. We talked quite a bit, she told me about herself and sent me a picture, she was only a few years older than me and only a few miles away. So, still thinking this might be a scam, I asked her what she wanted, figuring it would be credit card info she was after, but nope! She wanted to meet up! So I agreed cause why the fuck not, what do I have to lose? I was bored and single. I wanted a public place so we agreed on a Starbucks that was near the halfway point for both our locations. I get there and there she was, and to boot she looked exactly like her picture, the photo wasn't fake, shopped, or a 20 year old picture like I thought it might be. So I go up to her and she was instantly happy to see me! We hit it off right away and it was great, we had very interesting and provocative talks, it was like we knew each other forever! About 20-30 minutes into our conversation, (I wasn't exactly keeping track of time) she decided she wanted a coffee and excused herself to go get one. I was okay so I politely declined and waited for her. I glanced over and noticed she was arguing with the cashier over something so I decided to walk over and see what was up, the cashier said she was short some money. Me being nice and wanting our date to go well I asked my date how much she needed, she said \"bout three fity\" it was then that I noticed that she was the godang loch ness monster!

Rummaging through the sack beneath my desk, I surmised a plan; a sure-fire way to grab some extra cash out of this fellow.\n\n\"That'll be tree fiddy,\" I said to him as I held out a fist full of memes.\n\n\"Uh, what?\"\n\n\"Tree fiddy!

You've got 8, by the way.\"\n\nVisibly flustered, my client began to walk away. Of course, I was one step ahead of him.\nI always wore a custom-fit fedora in case a situation like this would arise. Raising my arm, I tipped the hat ever so slightly, saying: \"Give my regards to *m'lady*.\"\n\nThe nervous client turned back to me, his face filled with rage.\n\n\"DAMMIT man, why won't you just give me my memes? I don't care if they're nice, dank, or goddamn reposts, I just want my fix.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we want our memes!\" a tall, menacing man said from down the line.\n\n\"Memes!\"\n\n\"Give us memes!\"\n\nPractically everyone in the line joined the chant. Things were getting rough, and loud. The Meme Guards could probably hear us by now, wherever they were.\n\n\"HEY!\" I shouted at the top of my lungs. \"My volume level was probably over 9,000, but at least I got your attention, eh?\"\n\nI could hear dozens of sighs as clients were finally getting their memes.\n\n\"Now, Has ANYONE really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like? Probably not.

It was coming from the door...\n\n\"FREEZE!\" The Meme Guards stormed through the door. I had done an admittedly terrible job of blockading it. \"GET ON THE GROUND! HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!\"\n\nWell, this would surely be the end of my career. I crouched down, obeying them.\nThe biggest, meanest-looking guard ran over to me. I had been wanted for quite some time now, so I was pretty recognizable. I was completely powerless, though...\n\n\"Sir, you are under arrest for illegal ownership and distribution of memes of the dankest degree. The universal punishment for this heinous crime is a life of solitary confinement, no parole. You have been stripped of your right to a fair trial as we will take you straight to prison.

{"body": "Everyone else has great advice, here's what I would add from my experience: \n\nYour vet will probably give you antibiotics and probiotics for Bambi to take after the surgery.  While some buns will eat this stuff happily and some are easily burritoed into submission, not all are.  So if your Bambi is anything like my Nessie you will want applesauce (plain unsweetened, the ingredients should be apples and water), rolled oats (also plain, the only ingredient should be oats.  Instant and old-fashioned are both fine as long as they are the regular kind and not the kind with the sugar and crap) and dehydrated banana chips (or some other flat treat your rabbit can't resist).\n\nFor liquid meds - mix with a spoonful of applesauce.  If she will not eat this on her own, sprinkle a thin layer of oats on top.  She will probably eat the top layer and you will have to shape it into a ball and put more oats on top, repeating until finished.\n\nFor paste/gel meds - Take the dehydrated banana or other flat treat and \"frost\" it with the medication like a little cookie.  If she won't eat this plain you can make a little sandwich with another treat or add some oats on top like sprinkles.\n\nThis of course means you're giving her a pretty heavy dose of sugar so don't do any other treats until you're finished with meds.  I know in a perfect world you're supposed to be able to hold the rabbit down and squirt the meds in their mouth but I have only been able to succeed at this when the rabbit is too sick to fight back.  I'd rather get the meds in with some treats than have it wind up all over me and the rabbit with none actually being ingested.\n\nAnyway just my quick advice, perhaps your rabbit is more cooperative, but it doesn't hurt to grab those things anyway since they're pretty cheap, shelf stable, and humans can eat all of them too.\n\nOh, also, her poop will probably be weird the first day.  Be sure to clean her litter box out while she's at her spay so that you can easily monitor whether or not she's peed and pooed when she gets home.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427684927", "subreddit": "Rabbits", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The dirty secret of the diet industry is that every fad diet has the same net benefit: you consume fewer calories. Whether you tell people to be vegan, paleo, low-carb, whatever, they all work the same way: restrict your access to easily-acquired, calorically dense foods - it's worth noting that you can't eat a mars bar or chocolate ice cream regardless of which fad you follow. Following any of these regimens means you can't eat the bulk of what's ready to go in stores, have to work around restrictions, and ultimately be much more focused on and aware of what you're eating. This helps you avoid weak moments when you would buy a chocolate milk, or a muffin, makes it really difficult to smash a burger, etc. \n\nThe paleo diet on a philosophical level is bankrupt - there's no one diet humans ate at that time, no reason that we should pick the paleolithic era rather than going further back, or forward to the 1200s, and some have argued that it's actually pretty regressive as a movement in that it attaches some romantic concept of humans living as they should back when men hunted, women gathered, and nobody fucked with the natural order.

{"body": "I certainly admit that I see the appeal in a plush of one of your favorites. \n\nI personally got into the franchise back when I was still in grade school (more than a decade ago ....) when the show and games where first released. I enjoyed the games quite a bit and had a lot of fun fighting and trading with my friends. My favorite pokemon at the time was Raichu (and I hated Ash for not evolving Pikachu when he had the chance) as I found it's design to be far superior to Pikachu and he could really put in work against my friends. I eventually got a small Raichu plush who I will always pick up from my \"box with childhood things\" when I start a new pokemon game.\n\nOne of the greatest moments was trading some of my old pokemon from Gen1 to Gen2 and finding out they were shiny. My shiny Snorlax quickly became another one of my favorites. Trading and entrusting pokemon to your friends over vacations to come back and see how much  they were trained and have grown was a lot of fun.\n\nI definitely recommend anyone starting out to find someone who will join in with them and share the experience. Thanks to the online features this is now possible to do world-wide.\n\nOn the topic of nicknames I can't say much, I always disliked the idea of naming my pokemon and certainly regretted it whenever I did name a pokemon. The exception is my team of 6 support pokemon, that I bred to fulfill specific roles and save me the struggle of finding the right pokemon to learn certain HMs and help me during end-game stuff. \n\nThey are Tropius(Banana) and Lapras(Nessie) who can learn any HM in any Generation, Smeargle (Michelangelo) who knows the perfect moveset to catch any pokemon (Soak, Spore, False Swipe and Mean Look if anyone needs to know) and my two Ditto (Dotti [both have the same name]) that I caught in Gen5 after grinding for weeks, one has 6 perfect IV and the other 5 perfect IV and 0 Spd, lastly Fletchinder (Ember) cause he is cooler than Talonflame and helps so much with Fly and Flame Body.\n\nAnother recommendation I have is to try out competitive breeding and battling. It's a lot of fun and with Gen6 much easier then it has ever been. Just fighting the Battle Maison or some random battle on BattleSpot is a great experience for aspiring pokemon trainers. Also turning your ragtag team of random pokemon from a play through into competitive battle-ready pokemon is an awesome experience to see just how much more your powerful can become.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427709264", "subreddit": "TruePokemon", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[http://www.rampantscotland.com/recipes/blrecipe_haggis.htm](http://www.rampantscotland.com/recipes/blrecipe_haggis.htm)\n\nLooks like spiced meat and organs, with onions and oats. Mutton has a strong flavor, so probably the beef variant is more appealing to the modern palate, being less gamey. (BTW: if you double up on the nutmeg, or leave it at 1tsp but add some allspice, and either clove or cinnamon, that effectively takes the gamey flavor out of the sheep fat and meat, but modern recipes are spice-shy compared to historical versions. Even in full-on medieval mode, haggis would have tasted better to modern consumers than the stuff you get in the grocery store today!). \n\nWikipedia says the first *recorded* recipe is from the [Liber Cure Cocorum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber_Cure_Cocorum) circa 1430. Note that proportions and measurements were not common in early cookbooks, so we don't really know how much black pepper or fresh herbs were going into it. Was it just a bit, or a lot? Was it green with parsley, or just a few sprigs here and there? \n\nI always assume the use of a lot of herbs and spice in historical recipes, which suits my own palate (that's the important part!) so I'd guess that modern cooks are comparative shy with the nutmeg, and black pepper, and that the end result might be blander and more pasty than the historical version. Modern recipes also don't seem to include the parsley, hyssop, savory, eggs, and/or mint, thyme, sage, etc. -- all of which would have contributed to a different flavor and texture. And there's no mention of oats in the 1430 version, which probably add a pasty texture to the modern dish. Variants might call for wine, broth, or vegetable stock (turbilen), changing the flavor dramatically depending on which you used. \n\nA soft sausage with strong spices and herbs is maybe what it originally resembled. \n\n[See the 1430 version alongside some modern recipies, here](http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/haggis.htm)\n\n[First recorded Haggis in the Liber Cure Cocorum here](http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/lcc/parallel.html#q120) \n\nRemember that this isn't the first invention of Haggis, this is the first time someone has decided to record it. It's not very instructional, and not intended to teach someone how to make Haggis if they don't already know how. Probably everyone assumed you already knew how, and knew what you liked to put into it. \n\nAlso, all those spices and the pre-made broths are indicative that the author was describing a high-class courtly kitchen. This is a very, very late version of what is probably a truly ancient recipe. \n\nChances are, there were hunters stuffing the washed stomach of their catch and boiling/roasting the dish out in the field -- since the Paleolithic era. If you've ever killed and field-dressed an animal, you'd probably invent it too. \"Hey, I wonder what I can use this part for!\" Especially if you don't have a bunch of culinary leaves handy to roast things in.

Capitol *S*.    \n\n*Hah*, you may be thinking, *surely he won't write, read, edit, re-read, and then submit a piece of shit!*  \n\nThat, my foolish Tulip, telepathic though you may be, is where you are wrong.  \n\nAllow me to tell you the story of a man. Let's call him by a name, for the sake of the story, let's call him Abe. Why Abe? Because that's his name, you idiot.  \n\nNow Abe here, he's a curious fellow. He once killed a turtle and ate the shell, left the meat on a rock somewhere. Why'd he do that? Well, Abe isn't too bright. Not the sharpest bulb in the toolbox, yeah? Not the freshest *meat on the rock*, as it were. Yeah.  \n\nSo Abe, he gets this idea. \"I'm gonna rob a bank.\"  \n\nWhat an idea, Tulip. What an idea.  \n\nHe goes down to the bank, he says, \"gimme all your money.\"  \n\nThe woman says, \"Abe, you aren't at the bank yet, you haven't even left home.\"  \n\n\"Oh,\" he says and kisses his wife. Then he heads down to the bank. No mask, a mask would limit his field of vision and god damn does a bank robber need field of vision.  \n\nSo he gets in, he says, \"gimme all your money.\"  \n\nThe bank teller, a short guy, ducks behind the stand.  \n\nWell Abe didn't see him duck, on account of his poor field of fucking vision.  \n\n\"Where'd he go?\" Abe asks a fellow customer.  \n\n\"Ill tell you,\" the fellow customer replied. \"For about... $3.50.\"  \n\nAbe reaches into his pocket, but notices about that time that this fellow customer is eight stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  \n\nWhy did this story end with no meaning? Because the prompt had no meaning, Tulip. The blame is your own. I told you it'd be Shit (Capitol fucking *S*), so don't get angry at me.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427764214", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am surprised this exhibit was reopened considering the outcry over the last incident. A local tourist intentionally crushed an otter's hand, breaking multiple bones in its hand and arm. The incident was not immediately noticed and the suspect wasn't found for quite some time. It was a compelling story for the media since the injured otter suffered complications from the surgery and passed away.\n\nBy the time the suspect was finally captured, public resentment had been building for weeks. Pets are quite revered in Japan, but with real estate at a premium, small residences and/or homeowner associations keep many Japanese from being able to keep pets of their own. Thus, public spaces, especially zoos are a very treasured part of Japanese communities.\n\nThere was a minor scandal when it was revealed that the suspect had been severely beaten after his arrest. The rumor was that local authorities placed the suspect in a general holding cell despite the notoriety and resentment that followed him. Whether it was the police or others that beat him within an inch of his life was never determined. Bear in mind that Japan has an unusually high conviction rate because authorities tend to wait until cases are slam dunks. Once a suspect is officially named and arrested, it pretty much becomes a case of \"guilty until convicted, told you so.\" Don't feel bad for the otter attacker. He later confessed that he did it because he owed a large gambling debt to the owner of the zoo.\n\nYup. A deal had been arranged to drum up publicity for the zoo, though neither man expected the cruel stunt to turn into such a fevered situation. Word eventually got back to the local Yakuza outfit, who killed the otter attacker while he was in custody, then burned the zoo owner alive. Supposedly the zoo owner's final word's were, \"Can i get abouta tree fiddy?\" To which he received no response before perishing in the flames.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427781229", "subreddit": "aww", "score": 51, "controversiality": 0}
