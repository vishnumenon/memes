{"body": "The last picture looks like larvae for the mugwumps. I can just imagine in a few years when they mature addicts from around the world will be queuing up for their chance to suck mugwump jism directly from the creatures pituitary gruzslops.\n\nThe greatest high the world has ever known and the politicians and the billionaires who control them keep mugwump jism for themselves.\n\nI'll never forget my uncle and his son, both quite high up and active members of the Real IRA (this is back in the late 80's early 90's) getting back from a mission in London and how excited they seemed. I assumed they had arranged a weapons shipment or had got really good intel as the was a ceasefire in affect.\n\nTwo nights after they were home, my cousin called me (we were the same age, only 3 days between us) and asked me to meet him at the old castle near ******** beach, and to tell absolutely no one we were meeting, especially his father.\n\nWell when we met my cousin could barely stand still, pacing up and down, mumbling under his breath. After about 30 seconds of this he turned to me and said\n\n   ''Noble you're not gonna believe what I have to tell you so I'm just going to let you experience it for yourself. I'll explain after what it is.''\n\nNow normally my cuz is rational, levelheaded and very sure of himself so to see him acting this way was extremely unusual but I went along with him because our training teaches that out on deployment it's nearly always two men teams and you have to trust your partner with your life.\n\nFrom out of his backpack cuz pulls out a plastic bag which had a small tobacco tin inside. As he's taking these out my cuz is getting visibly excited again. He gets me to sit down facing him with the tobacco tin between us.\n\nI'm wondering should I have told my uncle that I was meeting his son here because it seems like he might of lost it and was behaving really strange. Plus the tin was freaking me out. I knew my cuz was one of their best bombmakers and I start thinking to myself 'this is it, cus has lost it and he's gonna kill us both'.\n\nAs I'm thinking this cuz leans over and opens the case facing him. I had rolled onto my side when I realised I wasn't dead. I look up at my cuz who's just sitting there transfixed by whats in the case. I sit up now, more angry at myself for thinking that my cuz would ever harm me (as for the RUC and British soldiers in the north well thats different. I know he would never do a carbomb either. His targets were military only, he wouldn't even target the PSNI).\n\nWell inside the case was two smallish vials of what looked like, well, cum.  ''What the fuck is that?'' I asked, ''Did that come from you ye dirty fucker ya. What the fuck are you carrying around spunk fir ye perve''. I start laughing more at relief I didn't die than at the cum he was carrying around.\n\n''Listen Noble, this ain't cum, it's the best fuckin drug yis are ever gonna get your hands on'', he seemed back to his normal serious self.\n                                ''Fuck off ya cunt you just wanna see me snort or drink your rancid fuckin jizz thats what you're tryin to do. I'm no fuckin muppet''.\n\n''Listen, this is the best fuckin thing you'll ever take in your life. I'm not gonna tell ye where it comes from or what it is until after you take it coz you'd never believe me. I'll drink mine first then you but you have to do it as soon as I do. Now my cuz is never one for practical jokes so I told him fuck it lets do it.\n\nHe hands me my vial and while the liquid inside had the colour of cum, its consistency was more like vegtable oil. We both take the lids off and I watch him tilt his head back and open his jaw wide. ''Don't swallow it just pour'' he said then just poured it down his neck. As I watch he slowly brings his head back down and I could see his eyes were already dilated, the biggest I've ever seen on anybody (and this is after 10 years of clubbing and seeing people on every drug under the sun). I wait for him to say something, anything but it looked like he was completely tranced out. Well fuck it, my turn. I open the vial and take a wiff. Slightly like honey and other things I cant identify but associate with my childhood. I tilt my head back and open my mouth as wide as I can. As I hold the vial over my mouth my hearts pounds in my chest and butterflies in my stomach. My god it has been years since I had tried a drug new to me. Well bottoms up.\n\nAs I pour I can see the liquid going into my mouth but what is going down my throat is thousands of tiny stars, somehow cool. I can feel the Universes life force flow to every molecule in my being and beyond. Within about two seconds I feel the centre of my being being unzipped and some this unzipping continued throughout the universe. The noise of the unzipping got so load I had to close my eyes.\n\nAs soon as I closed my eyes I shoot out through the top of my skull and out of our reality altogether. Flashes of colours every nano second. Pastels, green pink babyblues mauve. Complex fractals lay over this colours. Sacred Geometries evrywhere. Now there is singing, hoards of angelic voices, hundreds then thousand and then hundreds of thousands. While the angels are singing the pastels colours come back, with a million more never seen on this earth.\n\nSuddenly a ****BOOMING**** voice says  ''THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE. THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE''. A feeling of absolute acceptance overcomes. ABSOLUTE PURE LOVE fills my essence. The choir is still singing. **DON'T FORGET** the voice says and then I'm back in my body, aware of my surroundings but tripping to bits, fractals overlay everything. Everything is breathing. I become aware of skinny elf like 'people' about 3-4 tall dancing around on the edge of my vision. There seems to be 5 or s\n6 of them but when I try look directly at them they dance out of my field of view. Somehow I know they were happy I 'visited'. I now notice smaller creatures, troll like, hiding around the castle wall, peeking up to look at me but when I go to look at them they duck out of sight.   The fractals have almost gone now and the 'elves and trolls' have left. I'm totally down now.\n\nI realise that I had experienced ego death for the first time. Who were those angels singing? Who told me 'THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE'? Did elves and trolls really follow me out?\n\nI look back at my cuz. He's grinning ear to ear. ''Well?'' he asks, ''did you experience anything?.\n\n''What is that stuff, where does it come from, can you get more, how much is it?'', I had a hundred questions I wanted answering. ''Well, I can't tell you everything, but I can tell you it costs about  tree fiddy.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427854515", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

He made some changes and cut it down a bit but here is the approved statement (TL;DR at end for the impatient):\n&gt; \n&gt; [Original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2ooy1x/update_my_neighbors_caused_themselves_to_be/)\n&gt; \n&gt; So when we left off last, my neighbors had resorted to actually parking on my land in order to block me in and were using the police to try to strong arm me into giving into their demands.  Thanks to the suggestions here, I set up a meeting with a highly recommended real estate lawyer in the area.  We discussed the entire situation and he suggested a few options for trying to resolve this whole mess.  He warned that lawsuits, especially about land rights, can take years and years to work through the courts and of course, that means they cost a fortune.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead, as a cheaper and faster alternative, he suggested that the neighbors and we go to what's called \"non-binding mediation\".  As he described it, it's a process where both sides meet and a neutral mediator tries to find a \"middle ground\" that everyone can agree on.  If they do, some sort of contract is written up and everyone signs it.  This way you can avoid the time and expense of a lawsuit.  So we figured, why not give it a shot since there was really nothing to lose at this point.\n&gt; \n&gt; So my lawyer makes the arrangements with the neighbors directly and although it was not an easy or quick process, they eventually agreed.  Then there were more weeks spent trying to agree on a mediator.  Once that was finally done, we set up a date last week at some other lawyer's conference room for everyone to meet.\n&gt; \n&gt; My lawyer spent a lot of time preparing and discussing the various possibilities and outcomes and going in, I was super nervous and second guessing the decision not to just file a lawsuit.  But my lawyer was really great and assured that this was the best decision for this kind of situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; So on the way into the meeting, we get stuck in the elevator together on the way up.  No one says a word and they just looked like they wanted to kill me right there in the office.  We get out and are eventually split into two separate rooms, and are told to meet in the conference room when we were ready. \n&gt; \n&gt; So after calming me down again, we head into the main room and the mediator, another lawyer, introduces himself to everyone and explains the process.  Immediately, the neighbors start giving him a hard time and asking him questions that basically accused him of working for us.  But he stayed calm and kept repeating that he was neutral and that while he hoped to broker a resolution, he did not work for either side and it was entirely up to the parties how this would end.\n&gt; \n&gt; And so began World War III, right there in the conference room.  My neighbors, true to form, proved to everyone in the entire building that they were plum crazy with all their red-faced ranting and raving and yelling, most of which was directed at our lawyer and the mediator.\n&gt; \n&gt; So we get split up into separate rooms again I guess to try to calm things down.  It's now been a half hour in the separate room and I am just about to tell my lawyer to pull the plug on the whole thing when the mediator comes to our room by himself and says he has a proposal.\n&gt; \n&gt; He explains that he was able to calm the neighbors down and got the feeling that this wasn't just about them landlocking themselves, but rather them feeling that somehow, I had taken advantage of them! \n&gt; \n&gt;  He quickly explained that he did not agree with their \"assessment\" but it was his job to find some middle ground anyway.  So my lawyer asked him what their proposal was.  The mediator says that the neighbors were willing to go after their seller for an \"easement by necessity\" and not use my land (or block my gate), but that they could not currently afford to pay for a lawyer to file the lawsuit they needed.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Worried, I asked what they wanted to get from me out of this whole deal, since this seemed almost too good to be true.  Even my lawyer was surprised.  So the mediator takes a deep breath and warns us that we're probably not going to like the offer, but that it was just the first offer and that everything was still potentially negotiable.  Really worried now, we ask again what the neighbors wanted.  The mediator says \"As I explained, [the neighbors] can't afford to pay for a lawsuit right now, so they would like you to pay for it in exchange for them abandoning their claim to use your land.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; I was too dumbfounded to even say anything, but my lawyer had the presence of mind to ask just exactly how much these lunatics expected me to pay them to go away.  That's when the mediator pulled his chair up real close to us, leaned in, and said \"about three fiddy\".  And that's right about when I realized that our neighbors were a three hundred foot tall monster from the paleolithic era.  Let this be a lesson to you all - be careful who you ask for updates!\n&gt; \n&gt; **TL;DR**  Hired lawyer.  Tried to avoid lawsuit via mediation.  Crazy neighbors finally agreed but, as expected, showed their true colors.

{"body": "Story time!\n\nI was first introduced to Cardistry back when I was a dancer. I had been specializing in the street styles of Popping and Locking for a couple of years, and had a bunch of friends with whom I'd jam at the dance studio and have dinner together afterwards. \n\nOn one of those evenings (that was around November 2008), my friend received a call from his best friend, saying that he was in the area, and asked if he could join in for dinner. That friend had been filming a Cardistry video nearby. I had never heard of Cardistry before that, and was really eager to see what it was like.\n\nI remember drinking a peanut butter milkshake at the cafe where we were having dinner, when he walked in. He was dressed in a white shirt and jeans, and wore blue-tinted frameless glasses which made him look really smart. I know it sounds cheesy as hell, but it was love at first sight. \n\nHe was incredibly fun and friendly, too. He did some magic that charmed the pants off all the girls at the table, me included. Then he showed us some Cardistry. It was bedazzling. \"It's just like dancing,\" he explained, \"but with cards.\"\n\nThen he leaned in close to me and whispered, \"Also, can you give me tree-fiddy?\"\n\nIt was then that I realized he was a 500-foot tall monster from the paleolithic era. \n\n\"Damn you, monster! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\" I screamed.

{"body": "No no no! You, the individual remaining twin convinces both wives that you are their husband, and that your brother died (obviously this will be easy for your own wife). \n\nSo essentially, you're in one real marriage, and you're acting in another marriage. It will be tough. \n\nSo finally, you get to the point where you need to convince both women to not only not talk to each other (especially about the death), but to not bring it up because it makes you upset, and it makes the widow upset. \n\nEventually, when you have this gambit going strong enough, you invite everyone to go out to a fancy bar in a hotel. Each woman thinks she has a living husband, and each woman feels terrible for you, as well as the other woman. \n\nDrinks happen. You let it slip to one woman how the other one \"most of all misses the intimacy of [your brother]\" and then you do the same to the other woman. \n\nSo now that it's clear what's going on, and sympathy has been established, everyone agrees to indulge - both wives think that they're providing charity to a grieving man and a grieving woman. With the alcoholic social lubricant in place, all goes according to plan. \n\n***\n\nDays later, you come clean. You destroy the life of one woman (it was coming anyway, but you're just adding insult to injury with the threesome) and your wife, intrigued by your boldness, wants to keep having threesomes. Unfortunately, you miscalculated things, and she discovers that she was hiding her true love for women, and she leaves you. \n\n***\n\nYou wake up one day. And you find a dead clone of yourself in your living room. Depressed because of your idiocy and still missing your brother, you break down, but this feeling is fleeting. You figure out exactly what to do. \n\n***\n\nYou leave the body on the front stoop of your brother's widow's house. On the note you write that you couldn't take it anymore, and you killed yourself. You also reveal in the note that your brother is still alive, and faked his death - the reason being that a drug cartel threatened to murder his family unless he worked for them. Also mention that you know that if they ever detect something fishy, they're going to bury him alive in his own grave (that we know already exists!) \n\n***\n\nAt this point, you'd have already exhumed his body, disposed of it, and now you lower yourself in his grave. Hire a hobo to bury you, and bring an oxygen tank. The fresh dirt over the grave coupled with the note will have investigators think to dig you up. \n\nYou get dug up, and you find your wife. You act like you haven't seen her in months. Tell her that they threatened to kill her, and you would rather die than see harm done to you. She'll tell you that your twin is dead, so you'll have to revisit losing him all over again - show the emotions. \n\nYou're put into witness protection. With a new identity, you're free to live your life anew, with your brother's wife. \n\n***\n\nYears later, you get a knock at your door. You open it. It's your brother, seeking revenge. It turns out you are the one that tried to kill him and you thought you were successful. The body buried WAS fake, and you exhumed some hobo. \n\nYou fall to your knees. You tell him that you missed him, and you were just fulfilling the pact. He's still angry, and looks ready to kill you. \n\n\"What do you want from me?\" You ask. \n\n\"I need about tree fiddy...\" \n\nThat's when you look up and you don't see your twin brother, but a 100-foot crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \"GOD DAMMIT LOCHNESS MONSTAH, I AIN'T GIVING YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\"", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1427901586", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 556, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ahh... a tree fiddy virgin. Let me explain.\n\nA while ago, actually quite a few years ago, when Reddit was young, a group of users decided that they would create elaborate stories which were completely made up. At the time it seemed like some harmless fun to waste time. However as the site grew more popular, people clocked on to this craze and suddenly subreddits were appearing everywhere full of these stories, all complete lies.\n\nAt first it was just stupid fun and subreddits like /r/tifu were created. However it soon got a bit intense. Some user name Unidan (banned now obviously) took it too far. He had made up a story about a girl who was being stalked from across the street by an unknown man. He posted up photos as though they were taken from the bedroom of the girl of a blurry picture of some guy wearing a hat. Reddit lost it's shit! A full scale man hunt went on to find this guy, people were posting consistent updates and trying to work out the address and details of this guy.\n\nIt seemed impossible but within only four hours they had not only found out his address, but had hacked his social media accounts and gained some pretty sensitive data. There was a full on argument about what to do next, as this guy had not really done anything, and it was clear the whole thing could be a lie.\n\nUnfortunately some didnt reason with this and decided to take it into their own hands. The plan was to visit the guy that night and \"rough him up a bit\". Obviously a lot of people didn't want this to happen and the police started getting bombarded with calls as Redditors tried to warn them of this plot.\n\nBefore you knew it the story hit the front pages, all over the news. People were literally loosing their shit. The guy who was going to rough him up was streaming the whole thing live. It started in some car and he was with three other people all wearing masks.\n\nAt the same time users on Reddit were trying to use the information to update police, but it being night, it was pretty difficult to work out where they were. Suddenly the guys stopped, jumped out of the car and started to make there way through some grass verge round the back of the house. They were carrying baseball bats and what we think was a crowbar. Just as they crept up to the window there was a loud bang and a huge flash. \n\nFrom out of nowhere a flashbang had been chucked. The guy filming dropped the camera and it was left pointing to what was looked like the figure of a police officer holding a gun. But as the lens pulled into focus we quickly realized it was a 6 stories tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had foiled their plans again! He lowered his gun and said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\". the young men refused and the monster swam away.\n\nTo this day we don't know what happened to the stalker.", "gilded": 2, "created_utc": "1427907599", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2234, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "~~I will always love surprises. The best surprise I ever received was when my grandparents made the long trip across country to see me on my 10th birthday. We weren't the wealthiest family by any means. The price for flights to go over and see them would have been more than what my parents could afford. So anyway, my grandparents showed up and my dad made sure it was me that answered the door when the doorbell rang.~~\n\n~~There I was, eyes wide in shock, I let out a cry of delight as I embraced them. They had huge smiles plastered across their faces, it was a great moment. Later on, after we were all caught up it was time for present. The box that my granddad brought to me must have taken up half the space in his suitcase. This thing was massive to my 10 year old eyes. I read the card that accompanied it as is the polite thing to do of course. I tear into the packaging, like piranha into a struggling victim. After the carnage had subsided what was left was a box. Not just any kind of box mind you. It was a black box with a big green circle and an X on it. The original xbox. I couldn't believe it. My parents couldn't believe it. My grandparents were laughing.

{"body": "Well, I didn't tell this anyone but here it is. \n\nI'm currently 45 years old, been married since I am 22. My daughter is currently 23, she moved out when she was 19 to study arts. I know, it's not an awfully helpful degree but she's been painting for 7 years now so I didn't want to stop her. She moved to another state and lived in a dorm. \n\nHer first year went well but slowly we seemed to have less and less contact with her. As we, my wife and I called her, she always sounded like she was in a hurry, like she didn't want to talk to us anymore. Well at first we thought this was normal because she has got a different life now, it is normal for a student to concentrate more on her friends than on her family that lives a thousand miles away. \n\n\nAs a consequence, as you migth imagine, with our daughter out of the house we had much more space for us. We went on to have more sex, we shared our ideas more openly and tried them.  So more often than not we would watch some porn, to get some ideas on what to do next. We wanted to try more hardcore stuff, my wife went on to get some toys and we kicked it off by watching some BDSM videos to get into the mood.\n\nThat's when we stumbled upon this video. It was an insertion/anal scene. There was a big dude with a mask and a girl, bent over. At first you only saw her ass. The dude hogtied her and began rubbing her asshole. My wife and I thought this might be interesting, she always wanted to try this degradation kind of sex. Sequently the insertions got bigger and bigger. A finger became two, three and suddenly it was a fist and a dildo besides it, which surprised my wife as she never saw it before. The dude made the usual creepy commets whilst the girl didn't seem to take pleasure in it at all. Sometimes you even heard a weep or a faint cry. Ok this might be normal but some thing definitly left me with an itchy feel. Nevertheless, I started to make out with my wife.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes, the dude pulled down his pants and shoved his dick right in her ass. Not gently but with full motion. Suddenly the girls screams became more audible, she tried to pull back and you could clearly see that she had pain.\n\nThen a different camera angle appeared. We saw a familiar face. Our daughter, bound to a table, was fucked by some dude around my age. She was in agony. Immediatly my wife and I stopped and watched in disbelief. All passion has left the room and was filled by a mix of shame, helplessnes and anger. The dude started to pull at her mouth, he kept it open, thrusting against her tensed up body. She sobbed, asking him when it'll end He pulled her head to his body, dropped his head and whispered bearly hearable:\"It will end once OP learns to put a serious tag on his stories.\" This was around the time I noticed that the guy banging his dick into my daughter was a four hundred feet tall monster from the paleolithic era. \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427909431", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 61, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok. there's a bit going on here. Stories that get people hooked then give an anticlimactic ending are a form of \"bait and switch\". One of the most common is known as \"tree fiddy\", a reference to an occurance in southpark where a story about an encounter with the Loch Ness monster ends anticlimactically with it asking for $3.50.\n\nThe previous post WAS a bait and switch, but instead of ending with the tree fiddy story it ends with a reference to the fact that the OP forgot to use a [serious] tag, thus lamenting that all the replies will be jokes or nonsense. \n\nNow, for the reason my comment got so many upvotes. Redditors have grown wary of these \"bait and switch\" stories, and often skim to the last paragraph and check the top replies. Because my comment implies it wasn't the tree fiddy story, many will go back and read the whole story. Those that did, get caught by it and want to keep the joke going by helping to catch others. Also, some simply upvote because they too were expecting tree fiddy.\n\nHope this clears it up. For more info re: tree fiddy, here's an [example](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/363/379/458.jpg).\n\n&gt;TL:DR: Redditors skip forward, thinking the story is a ruse.

This was the most hardcore, first time type video. I thought I'd lose my lunch as I watched that large membered fellow on the screen who wouldn't even show his face as he deflowered by baby girl. She looked so nervous, my heart broke. I threw the laptop on the floor. I broke down. I couldn't tell her mom. But I had to know why.\n\n\nI waited until she got home. She still came home from college on the weekends. This was Friday, so she would be coming home that evening. Her mom was out with a friend. I sat at the table, waiting to hear her car in the driveway. She opened the door. Her shadow approached the hall and she asked where everyone was. I called out for her to come into the dinning room as I gazed at her graduation picture hanging on the wall. She ran to give me a hug. She saw my face, and she knew then, that I knew. She broke down crying. The guilt that had built up inside her that she tried to hide was apparent. I asked her why. She turned her tear stained face up at me and paused. Just looked at me for a moment and then said \"I needed about tree-fiddy.\" That was the moment I realized my sweet little girl was the God-Damned Loch Ness Monster. How would I tell my wife?

She was raised in a conservative christina household, she grew up with two caring parents and a sister and a brother.\n\nShe was a regular child growing up, although she did above average in school.

We thought she was still studying, but apparently she dropped out and started doing porn. I found out when she called me. She said she needed money and that her job wasn't paying her enough. It was then when we got to talk about her job. At first she said she was an actress. After asking her more specifically about what she was filming, she actually admitted it. I heard in her voice that it wasn't easy for her to say to me. When she did, I was shocked at first, but I was still trying to support her in her decisions, so I didn't judge her too much. If that's what she wants to do, then so be it. I said it was fine, and she thanked me for it and we got back on her original question about some money.

{"body": "TL;DR I've known Mike for a long time and GDQ_insider is basically right.\n\nWe went to high school together, and we were both kind of outcasts which made us quick friends.  There was a little group of us who would get together every week to hang out, talk about life, play video games, play D&amp;D, etc.  We always had the most fun playing oldschool NES games and Mike would always kick our asses.  He was a really interesting guy, very charismatic and a natural leader but he had some deep insecurities that he only shared with a few people, such as me.  I won't expound on these for the sake of his privacy.  Anyway, those nights we spent in Mike's parents' basement will always be some of my best memories from when I was growing up.\n\nWe drifted apart after graduation, but I every once in a while I'd think about Mike and wonder how he was doing.  I always had a feeling he'd do well for himself if he could get past his personal issues.\n\nLast winter, I was talking to an old friend and I mentioned Mike and asked if my friend had heard from him. He started telling me about AGDQ and the work Mike was doing for the Prevent Cancer Foundation and I was blown away.  I checked out AGDQ on twitch and I was so impressed with how huge it was.  I knew Mike could pull something like this off if he wanted, and I was overjoyed to see it happen.\n\nAfter AGDQ I tracked Mike down through a mutual friend and texted him to see how he was doing.  He responded immediately and we had a nice little chat.  I said we should hang out sometime and he agreed.  I figured it would be one of those things you say to an old friend - make tentative plans that never happen, but a week later he called me saying he was in town and wanted to meet up.\n\nWe met for dinner at this greasy chinese buffet - it was one of our old hangout spots from when we were growing up.  We talked a lot about our lives and I told him how proud I was of what he was doing with AGDQ and PCF.  But at the mention of AGDQ he suddenly got all quiet and was acting weird.  I could tell I had touched on a sore subject so I tried talking about something else, but he jumped back in and unloaded a bunch of stuff on me.  Essentially, he was saying that the stress from running AGDQ was ruining his life.  It grew way beyond his control and PCF was throwing down some serious money.  He was in so far over his head and the pressure was killing him.  He talked a lot about how he felt like he sold out, how the speedrunning community was a pure thing and his influence was corrupting it.  I could tell he was really passionate about speedrunning and the money he was making from it was causing some major cognitive dissonance.\n\nEventually the waiter came and brought us the bill, and I took the opportunity to try to lighten the mood.  Our old group of friends had this inside joke about not knowing what to leave as a tip.  It doesn't seem so funny but it probably came from our many viewings of Reservoir Dogs back in the day.  So I looked Mike in the eye and said,\n\n\"So, Mike, how much should I leave as a tip?\"\n\nAnd he said, \"About tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that's when I realized that Mike Uyama was actually a 500 foot tall amphibious reptile from the mesozoic era.\n\nGod damn loch ness monster.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427925828", "subreddit": "speedrun", "score": 95, "controversiality": 0}

The empire was formed much like the mongols in that a man rose up to power to eventually unite all of the warring tribes across North America. He managed to create a civilization that was unlike any other, and regarded as such around the world. \n\nThe British and French were allowed to settle along the east coast, the economic adviser to the King thought it would be wise to allow the unused lands in the east to be settled by foreigners, to further grow their trading enterprises. \n\nA costly mistake.\n\nThe foreigners at first were pleased with the arrangement they were given, but then they started to grow restless and yearn for expansion of their \"countries\". They started to push at the empire Michigan had built, the foreigners soon started pushing westward. The empire fighting back every step of the way. It was no use however, once the Spanish invaded from the south. Fighting a front on the south and east forced the empire to use an enormous amount of resources, economically collapsing a large portion of the Country.\n\nAt this point many Tribes began to break apart from the empire, attempting to secure their own survival. What was once a massive, booming empire now was scaled back to a fraction of the original territory. The only area to be kept was an area that would be more defend-able, the king's military adviser suggested the two peninsulas on the inner continent, with Three sides open to the coast, there was only one side of each peninsula to heavily guard.\n\nThe, now small, empire would eventually be incorporated(forced) into the U.S.A. Although at heart many remained true to the empire, the ways of the foreigners had permeated into our society so deeply it could not be resisted, and our once great civilization was reduced to nothing but one state in a nation of Fifty.\n\nYou won't find this kind of information in any books or movies, hell most people would probably call you crazy. Don't believe them though, fight the powers that be so our mighty empire may one day be reborn!\n\nIt is said that when the empire is ready to be reunited the Leader of Michigania (LM) will reveal themselves. You'll know that the LM has been revealed because a great storm will ravage the Great Lakes for days, until finally, our leader rises up out of the waves of the lakes and appears to us as a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. On this day he will make a speech detailing how the new order of the world will be. Governments all around the world will tremble and kneel, begging for mercy and forgiveness from the Great Michigania. Mercy and forgiveness won't be found on that day, however. Only death and despair to the deniers and rebels.

{"body": "**CONTINUED**\n\n&gt;Quite the opposite is true, actually; religion is statistically on the decline.\n\nDepends on where you look. Some places yes, some places no. [According to here]( http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1386689?sid=21106321008783&amp;uid=3739936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256) for example, just in 1994 in Russia \"a third of the Russian people who once said they do not believe in God now do believe in God\".\n\nThe place that used to be biggest advocate for atheism just a few decades ago is now firmly Christian – and trying to advocate for that now. \n\nAtheism crops up in plenty of places throughout history but it never lasts long. Ancient Greco-Roman society and ancient India had organized atheistic movements, but they flared up and died out. Easy come easy go, as they say. \n\nJust from demographics, atheism is unsustainable. Atheists have few children compared to theists. For a large and dramatic example, look at China and India. China’s government is officially atheistic and they have more atheists than any nation in the world, while virtually all of India’s population follows a religion.\n\nChina has and has had far more people than India, and has been the most populous country. But this century India will overtake China in population [according to here]( http://recomparison.com/comparisons/101001/india-population-vs-china-population-staggering-statistics/). China’s current growth isn’t even at replacement level – [according to here]( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html) China has a birth rate of about 1.6 children per woman.\n\nThe other majority atheist nations – Estonia and the Czech Republic – are in the same boat. [According to here]( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ez.html) the Czech Republic has a birth rate of about 1.4 children per woman, and [Estonia]( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/en.html) is only slightly better at about 1.5. \n\nNow some religious people do forgo having children, but many of them such as priests or monks are doing it specifically so they can serve and further the religion. A priest that converts six people over his lifetime grows Christianity more than if he had had four children.\n\nAlso, frankly, what I think happened isn’t that Christianity saw a huge loss of members recently. Its that people who in the past would have said they were Christian for cultural reasons don’t feel a pressure to do so anymore, so they’re honest with themselves and say what they really feel. \n\nSo given how rapidly these things can change (if you told someone in the 70’s that in 2015 Russia would be denouncing the West for how unchristian they were they would have thought you were insane), and how uncertain the demographic future is, its very hard to say what direction things are really taking. \n\n&gt;The rapid development and enlightenment of the masses (through the propagation of information and scientific truth) is having a noticeable effect.\n\nInformation propagation doesn’t really seem to have much of an effect. When Russia became open it became Christian, China’s development coincided with a rise in atheism, and development and spread of information in the Middle East didn’t coincide with any change in the fact the region is unanimously Islamic (a lot of the most extremely Islamic people there are highly educated and technically adept, in fact – look at ISIS’ sleek media and their highly effective use of the internet for example). \n\nThere’s barely correlation here so we don’t even have the illusion of a basis to say there’s causation. \n\n&gt;The fact that you claim its 'easily disproven'\n\nThe fact something’s easily disproven doesn’t mean that most people are aware of that proof, or that the people who believe it will accept the disproof. Refuting the existence of the Loch Ness monster is simple for example, yet [according to here]( http://savannahnow.com/2006-10-27/more-people-may-believe-ghosts-you-might-think) nearly a fifth of Americans believe in it.\n\n&gt;the theory of evolution is similarly as well-defined as the theory of gravity\n\nSo you can give mathematical proof that evolution is correct? \n\n&gt;it is as offensive as someone dismissing your strongly held convictions (or faith as some people call it).\n\nNothing offends me. People who get offended are being too sensitive :P\n\n&gt;but many evolutionists are also Christians or of other religious denominations.\n\nSyncretism is hardly new. \n\n&gt;Do you literally believe the Bible\n\nThis is a loaded question. That’s like saying “Do you literally believe your mother?”. Everyone makes both literal and non-literal statements.  Especially a collection of 66 books in varying genres, and which themselves report words spoken in different genres. \n\n&gt;Literally believing in Genesis and rejecting evolution suggests a severe contempt for evidence\n\nI notice you haven’t presented any of this yet. What do you think is the strongest evidence for evolution, the rejection of which shows the severest contempt for evidence?\n\n&gt;knowing your denonmination might help in my discussion with you.\n\nI’m a Protestant", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427938422", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Ok so this happened about a year ago. It was between my cousin and my wife. My cousins were over my house with their kids. Generally me and my cousins get along fine, not much yelling etc. However this year their kids were horrible. All they were doing is running around the house, yelling, screaming, you name it. I talked to the kids first asking them nicely to keep their voices down and to not run inside, especially since I had some valuable objects on display. Now the kids didn't listen at all and kept on doing what they were doing. \n\nSo I then wen't to their parents to complain. Their parents started talking about how they were kids, to let them do what they wanted, and that the kids would fix any mess they made before they left. As soon as they said those last words, I heard one of their kids run into something. Shortly after, it was followed by a smash. Low and behold they were wresting and somehow managed to break the table in my living room. Thankfully their parents, my cousins, agreed to go out and get a replacement. \n\nHowever, as soon as they returned they asked that I give them, and I quote you, \"Tree Fiddy\" for the table. It was at this time that I noticed the table was in fact a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. Well, I said \" \"I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!\" Now, my wife turn to him and gives him a dollar! Can you believe it! She thought he would go away if she gave him a dollar. I told her Well, of course he's not gonna go away, Mary! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!.

I was excited at first but after a few hours of driving around looking at mostly vacant streets and running out of basic chit chat topics with the officer it got really boring. I was debating whether or not it would be rude of me to ask to go back to the station so I could go home and sleep, I had to work the next morning, when the radio came alive.\n\n\nWe got the call, it was a 10-96. A crazy person was raising hell in an alley on the other side of town. He lit up the lights and sped up. He told me that when we got there I was to stay in the car. We made great time across town and were there in what seemed like no time at all. Even though I had to stay in the car, my adrenaline was at the max.\n\n\nWe were the first to arrive on the scene. The officer parked at the street, car facing into the alley for light. He grabbed his flash light and drew his gun, proceeding slowly, cautiously. I couldn't see anyone else there, but I heard a sound like someone was banging on steel. It was accompanied by low growls. Further and further he ventured down that alley. All of a sudden a large man popped out from behind the dumpster and cold cocked the officer with what looked to be a giant pipe wrench.\n\n\nThe officer stumbled backward. I grabbed the shotgun from the police car, pointed it at the large man and yelled for him to drop the wrench. That's when I realized he wasn't a man, he was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

{"body": "No.  It's because of a secret.  Because of a terrible secret.\n\nNintendo has been working on a new game system for a few years now.  It's known as the Nintendo NX, but they're being really sneaky about.  Nintendo have very quietly applied for several patents related to a new gaming architecture that looks like most application architectures, only performed in hardware.  The gist is this: there's dedicated data architecture hardware to shuttle data to/from the central processing architecture, the visual display architecture, and the physics architecture.  Nintendo is not even claiming, to the Patent Office, that they own this.  The only reason I know is because of a few of the inventors who are working on it are names that are synonymous with Nintendo patents.  The most I've heard about it is a huge project related to the Nintendo NX that it's called \"操作弁3\", or \"Operation Stopcock 3\".\n\nSo what, you ask?  Well, it's not the Nintendo inventors that are most interesting about this.  It's the fact that there are **Valve** inventors listed too.  Several of them, actually.  The same Valve inventors that have been attached to the Steam Box consoles.  And there's a site where they are collaborating.  It's a secure site I'm not going to link (I think it has a tracking cookie so posting it here could get back to this account) but it's basically something like https boxfor3 dot org.  \n\nI think this means one thing: *Nintendo and Valve are working on HL3 together.*\n\nI think Nintendo is pouring resources into this because the WiiU has been a flop.  Have you seen them retrench to mobile gaming lately?  Wondered why no successor to the WiiU has been announced?  Wondered why Nintendo has suddenly gone silent about their plans at E3 this year?  I'm betting it's because they are waiting for the big drop in Aug/Sept.  Then they are going to undercut their competitors with **the most anticipated game** of the decade on a powerful new console with compatibility to the Steam archives.  Then they're going to go for the kill: pricepoint of $350.  So you can go to Nintendo/Steam, ask for the new console.  All they'll ask for is $350, an unheard of amount for a new console!  And that's the point when you'll realize that you're talking to a five-hundred foot tall monster from the paleolithic era.  And, damn it all, he's fooled you again.\n\nTL;DR: It's possible that Nintendo and Valve are collaborating on the Nintendo NX to sell a particular game.\n\nEDIT: Words.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427977975", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

In desperation, to drive the point home, she asked for the first time ever to borrow money from my savings, which I had accumulated over the years doing odds and ends for neighbors and family friends. I asked her how much just to see how far she was willing to go to keep me from enlisting and she said, \"I need about Tree-Fiddy.\" It was around then that I realized my mother was a 500-foot-tall amphibious reptile from the paleolithic era and I said, \"God damn it, Loch Ness Monstah!

Even if you don't think environmentalists are prone to it, it's still worth thinking about because it's used by deniers as an argument for BAU.\n\nYou pick on outright deniers who do not believe at all but what about all those other categories I mentioned? Again, I'm not any of those people. I think these are just other types of denial. More excuses to keep on consuming. And (yet again) it's not me saying this but the line of thinking goes, \"Well CCS will save us down the road so no need to panic.\"\n\n&gt;It doesn't matter how they view those who view climate change as a serious threat to humanity because they do not accept the basis of the science to start with. \n\nIt matters to some extent since we have to change hearts and minds in order to make policy changes. I think it's always best to consider human psychology in the mix especially when you want to debate someone or change policy. Fortunately there has been encouraging signs on this front recently.\n\nUnfortunately there are tons of folks who defend Obama's all-of-the-above energy policy complete with fracking and Arctic drilling as some how compatible with stopping the worst effects of GW. In some ways they are as anti-science as outright deniers\n\n&gt;Companies are companies are companies. If they can profit off of something they will use it. I'm not sure why that matters...\n\nIt matters because the profit motive and the model of infinite growth are killing us. Feel good products and green washing are still more ways people justify their consumption patterns. As long as you recycle your water bottles, it's okay to fly around the world or if I donate to tree fiddy dot org then it's okay for me to eat meat three times a day (and for the umpteenth time that's not me, that's the logic of people in another sort of denial).\n\nI keep emphasizing that I'm trying to explain others logic because you apparently totally misunderstood what I was saying in my last post. And this gets to the heart of why we do not want to come across as doomsday prophets. Deniers use predictions that do not come true as evidence that GW isn't that important. (Once again, that's not me but it is something to consider when making predictions about the future.) \n\nI've argued in the recent past that a peak of 420 ppm CO2 would be reasonable so no need to convince me.

As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risk click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro.\n\nCTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed.\n\nWait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"?

In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it’s a peach of cake.\n\ntl;dr just fucking read it, you asshole.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428062970", "subreddit": "mildlyinfuriating", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

Long nights filled with cash registering, cleaning, stocking and prepping the store for the next morning.  The night took on rhythm: 10-12 was normal people, normal traffic; 12-2 was the drunks; 2-4 was what I called scary time, when it was quiet and you were all alone in the night (and also when all the weird shit would go down); and 4-6 was the start of the morning, suppliers start arriving with food for the day, people coming in to get coffee on the way to their job, etc.  Anyway, one night it was a full moon and around 3am — smack dab in the middle of scary time — this big, bearded dude walks in and wanders around, acting really sketchy.  My spidey sense was tingling, and I was pretty sure this dude was going to rob me.  After about 10 minutes of wandering around the store, he grabs a soda from the cooler and makes a bee line to the register, and I'm thinking, \"Oh shit, this is it.\"  I'm looking him up and down as he comes at me, and I see that the dude had huge hairy eyebrows, a scraggly thick beard, thick hair growing out his ears and what I can only call fur growing up and down his arms.  His eyes were bloodshot and almost yellow.  His teeth were thick and stained.  And he practically growled at me, \"Pack of Marlboros.\"  I reached up above my head to grab the smokes and handed them to him.  As he stuck out his hand I had to keep myself from recoiling in fear because he had the most hideous fucked up hands I've ever seen.  His fingers were thick and freakishly long.

Oh god, his fingernails were two or three inches long, a quarter inch thick and had these deep, dark vertical grooves.  His nails clicked together as he snatched the pack from my hands, and he snarled, \"How much?\" with thick saliva dropping from his canines.  That's when I realized I was dealing with an honest-to-god werewolf in my store.  So I said, \"That'll be about treefiddy wolf man,\" and revealed my true form: an 8-story-tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.  \"God damnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no treefiddy!\" the wolf man growled, as he bounded out of the store.

Christopher exclaimed, \"Oh shit!\" He touched his backside and was relieved to find that it didn't get through his jeans, so he clinched his butt hole tight. Sweat was dripping from his red tight face as he squeezed tighter and tighter. He was still on the highway and close to Waylan E HQ, but needed and exit fast.

{"body": "&gt; Okay, I'm glad we're clear where we disagree.\n\nGood, because I haven't the foggiest. I'm not too quick on these kinds of things though.\n\n&gt; It is true that just because a person rejects a belief does not mean they assert the opposite.\n\nSo far so good.\n\n&gt; This is not true in this case though because of the binary nature of the belief. \n\nI agree the belief is binary, I don't know why you think it's untrue.\n\n&gt; One cannot reject the existence of God without asserting that God does not exist. The other side of the coin is also true, One cannot accept the existence of God without asserting that God exists.\n\nHere is where our divide is. You're trying to solve two prongs of a dilemma at once, and that's now how we do things. We address one prong at a time. \n\nThe belief in god is binary, if you actively believe it (And by 'belief' I mean you hold the claim to be true or likely true), then you are a theist. Anything else, you're an atheist. How confident you are in your belief is where we go into gnosticism or agnosticism, or strong atheist and soft atheism, or positive atheism and negative atheism. Whatever your favorite lingo is.\n\nJust because I don't think theists have met their burden of proof, does not mean I believe there are no gods. Some atheists do, but it's not a requirement to be an atheist.\n\n&gt; There is no room for a spectrum of belief here.\n\nI agree completely.\n\n&gt; Lets say I have a coin that on one side is heads and the other side is tails. If I flip the coin and it is heads, I can not believe that it is heads without also asserting that it is not tails.\n\nIf you flip the coin, and hold it inside your hand so you don't know the result yet. Theism would be me tell you it's heads (or tails, but lets go with heads for the analogy) while atheism would be you telling me you don't believe me. Just because you don't believe me when I am claiming it's heads, does not mean you think it's tails. You are, mostly due to my lack of evidence in this analogy, just not convinced that I have met my burden of proof in proving that it's heads.\n\nWe don't address existence and non-existence with the same binary belief preposition. We don't do two prongs of a dilemma at once.\n\n&gt; Does this make sense to you? In order for me to understand where your coming from I need to see how there is room to reject God while not asserting that God does not exist. \n\nI understand what you're saying now, but I don't know how to be clearer then I have been. That's probably my fault.\n\nYou can reject a belief and not believe the opposite is true. I can reject the belief the Loch Ness monster exists without saying the Loch Ness monster does not exists, because we are only address the one prong at a time.

{"body": "I was encouraged to see this:\n\n&gt;The temptation I’ve wrestled with is to simply dismiss this silly thing, New Yorker or no, as the sad ravings of a man trying to escape his guilt-ridden Protestant Puritan heritage and justify his consumerist lifestyle. \n\nThe problem I've found with big green organizations like Audubon is that they would rather make money than try to encourage real solutions to environmental problems. And indeed the two may not be compatible. \n\nAfter all a lot of people's livelihoods at big green orgs depend on a steady influx of donations. If the real answer to global warming is, as I assert, living simply and in particular **making and spending less money,** then how can an organization encourage both donations and an ascetic lifestyle without seeming hypocritical?\n\nSure enough I went to the Audubon website, and it's mostly hot air (sic). Plan your estate, donate stocks and bonds, etc. [Their single page on the climate](https://www.audubon.org/conservation/climate) says nothing about what really needs to be done in terms of conservation other than that we need legislation. I did not even find the bit Franzen mentions about changing the light bulbs!\n\nIt's the same with all the big green orgs even including tree fiddy. We have to start cutting out 5 to 10 percent of our fossil use per year starting right away no matter how that inconveniences folks. The discussion should center first and foremost on how that can be accomplished.\n\nYes, build out renewables to replace some of what we're giving up, but at least in the short run that's ancillary to the real answer, which is conservation. \n\nWould it be cynical to suggest that Obama announced his solar jobs initiative one news cycle day after the Shell drilling in the Arctic story on purpose?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428147845", "subreddit": "environment", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "   The horns sounded there low, bellowing cries. Hundreds that had gathered, dressed in the finest clothing of that they possessed. Collectively, the crowd diverged straight through the center to clear a path. \n\n   A path for me. \n\n   The gathered people bowed their solemn heads and sank down to one knee in reverence. From my carriage I looked out upon these people. All these diverse and wonderful lives, now all depended on me. Needless to say, I was a bit nervous. My thoughts were shaken by a hand on my shoulder. I turned and saw it was my father, lovingly gazing at me with a wide smile. A proud smile. Not everyone's child gets selected to be the Pusher. \n\n  Meekly I offered a smile of my own in return, before turning back to the path before me. I straightened out my garments, took a deep breath, and then stepped down from the carriage. I began walking, slowly, elegantly, just as I was trained. My eyes from my feet to the Button.\n\n  The large red circle gleamed in the evening sunlight, set inside a strange, smooth, alien looking metal chassis. Above, in bright green lights, the Counter slowly ticked down. Ten minutes. I keep walking, quicker now. No one knows exactly when and why the Button first appeared. No one knows what happens when it reaches zero. All my people know is that for centuries we have done our utmost to prevent it from reaching zero. And for that we trained the Pushers. \n\n   Eight minutes. I'm halfway there. I hoped no one noticed that my hands had begun to tremble. Pushers are chosen at birth as the previous one approaches their elder years. We have instilled in us an incredible sense of discipline, honor and duty. The fate of our whole civilization rests upon our shoulders. \n\n   Six minutes. I'm there now. The Button seemed smaller than I remember, no larger than a dinner plate. Something so small and insignificant, yet so much power. I gazed to the right and see a cot laid out for me. One where I will spend the rest of my days, pushing this button over and over again like dozens before me. But, perhaps not anymore. \n\nFive minutes. The horns sounded again. This was the moment. I reached out my hand. I was to push the Button. Reset it for another 12 hours so these people can carry on, drowning in debauchery and wealth, while the poor beg for scraps. The rich were to stingy to give up any of there accumulated wealth.  No I would not do it. I withdrew my hand. No more. I would not let this cycle continue. I heard quiet murmurs as the people gossiped amongst l themselves. \n\nFour minutes. I turnrd to the people. With a deep breath I outstretched my arms and said, \"I will not press it.\" Gasps ran through the crowd. No one in the history had ever refused before. This was unheard of. \n\nThree minutes. A man stood up, his gold chains clacking together. \"But you must! It is for the survival of our people.\" Many others nodded their agreement several cane forward and started to approach me, and I quick pulled a lever next to me, causing a wrought iron gate to slam between us. I was safe, for now. \n\nTwo minutes. I turned a way from the gate to recline on my cot. It was hard and uncomfortable, not something I would want to spend the rest of my life on. I closed my eyes as more people gathered, slamming and shaking the gate in futility. \n\nOne minute. This was it. The final moments. A clean start. Maybe the people after us would do it right this time. Then again perhaps not. But I had to try. The world could not go on like it was. A woman came to the front of the crowd, tears staining her jewelry. \"Please why are you doing this?\" she pleaded. I opened my eyes, shrugged at her and said. \"No one ever gave my people tree fiddy\" and reclined once again. \n\nThree, two, one, zero. Darkness.

{"body": "As I hear the machine power down, my vision returns to normal. Gradually, I sense it... Something's not right. My heart begins to race, my blood is pumping, hands are shaking, and I'm suddenly breathing hard, as if I had just run for my life. I have no idea where we are, but it sure as hell isn't 10 minutes in the past. There isn't anything at all. Hell, there hasn't been anything here in a while, if there ever was.\n\nThen I see it, not the desolate wilderness around us. Not the unfamiliar setting which we now inhabit, but the eyes. Nine pairs of eyes staring at me, helpless, afraid, and looking for an answer. I've been a leader my whole life. Captain, manager, mentor, you name it. But what have I done that could prepare me for this?\n\nSearching deep within, I amass all the courage I can muster and make my best attempt at calm confidence. \n\n\"Well... there seems to be some sort of a problem.\"\n\nBefore my last syllable escapes, the resident science volunteer, McClaskie cries out: \"Problem? PROBLEM?! This is a catastrophe! We aren't 10 minutes back! There's nothing here but, but, nothing!\"\n\n\"We must remain calm\" I reply. \"As calm as we can. It is a lot to take in, but we must assess the situation soberly, and try our best to form a solution.\"\n\nAntonia, the psych volunteer chimes in \"We are all likely to be in some shock, but we must focus, and remain as calm and as sober as possible. We were all warned this could happen. We have supplies to last us for weeks. I agree with John. We need to assess the situation calmly, so in order to do that, everyone, take a few minutes to compose yourself.\"\n\nWe all exit the vessel, and enter the open air. I give Antonia a look of relief. Not that I *am* relieved, but it is at least some relief to have her there. I realize there's not a man or woman alive who wouldn't be relieved by Antonia's warm brown eyes and knowing smile. There's something about her that could put the world at ease. Today, in this moment, I need all the respite I can find.\n\nNow that the shakes have gone, I start to form a plan in my head as I pace slowly. \n\nRich, the tech student begins working with the machine's input terminal. \n\nMcClaskie, and Lewis, the history adviser, begin examining the surroundings. \n\nAntonia talks to five other volunteers: Medical, survival, engineering, nutrition, and culture.\n\nAs the faint sounds of coherent conversation return and the reality begins to set in, Rich drowns all of us out as he shrieks, \"How in the, what in... This can't be right. Dammit! Who entered this?! This isn't 10 minutes back. Unless I'm a complete idiot, we've gone back 10,000 YEARS! They completely miscalculated! Damn fools, how do they not know decimals! It'll take days to reprogram this, if I can at all!\"\n\nMcClaskie responds \"That is in line with the flora we are observing in the area. Much wilder and more ancient than anything we would see in our lifetimes. 10,000 years. Incredible.\"\n\n\"If that's correct, we would be in the paleolithic era.\" interjects Sarah Lewis. \"Cavemen and mastodons. At this point in North America, we would encounter people hunting with the Atlatl, painting on cave walls, and probably not taking too kindly to strange travelers.\"\n\n\"Good point\" I say. \"We need to assess the situation, but we need to get to safety first. Gather the gear. We're going to track the terrain. We need to find a place to setup camp. Who knows what creatures or people there might be.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't we like, split up, uh er something? Cover more ground?\" questions Jerome, the medical expert.\n\nLehigh, the survival expert scoffs loudly. \"You've been watching too many bad movies son. Unfamiliar terrain, totally unknown wilderness, and no idea who or what is out there, and you want to split up? No. Hell no. We have to survive the way any humans out here would survive. Strength in numbers, and collective intelligence. We're a tribe now. No one is splitting anywhere.\"\n\nJust then I feel all nine sets of eyes on me again. It's easier to stay calm now, but I am far from confident. If they only knew how much doubt was in my heart, there's no way they'd follow me. So they can't know. I have to hide it all. Leaders aren't always fearless, but they have to keep their people brave.\n\n\"Well, we're a tribe. So chief, where to? To find tatanka?\" says Dea, the nutritionist.\n\n\"Ha, that's the last thing we want to find. Some big ass Paleo Bison staring us down. We need water, high ground, and shelter. We need to get our basics in order and form a plan from there. Assuming we're in the same geography as we were when we got in the time machine, we need to head north towards the river nearby\" I say.\n\n\"Only thing is... I doubt we'll be alone when we get there.\" It's only then we start to notice the sounds around us. Things are unfamiliar, things are dangerous, but we start on our way.\n\n**************************\n\n**Okay** so I haven't written any non-fiction in a long time, but this seemed like fun so I gave it a try.

{"body": "I won $2500 a week for life on a scratcher. It was actually a coincidence that I even got the scratcher as I don't typically get lottery tickets. But one day, I'm at a gas station and the lady in front of me was taking a while looking for money to pay for her massive amount of lottery tickets. She pulls the money out and she's $5 short (the exact amount for the ticket in question). In order to get to the register faster, I lay $10 on the counter and say that five covers her ticket and the other five covers one of the same for me. The employee pulls out another ticket and the lady whose ticket I just paid for seemed thankful and instead gave the ticket I bought back to me. I said it's okay, I don't normally play the lottery anyway,and gave it back. But, in our banter I gave her the other ticket, not the one she handed me. I pay for my gas, get in my car and scratch the ticket off. Turns out, it was a winner! I go back in the store, and the cashier says I have to go to the nearest lottery office since he cannot give me $2500 out of the drawer. A bit bummed out, I ask where the nearest lottery office is, and he says it's about an hour away. No problem I think, I can make the drive out. At this moment, the other lady comes back in with her ticket (she apparently won $20). The clerk tells her how I just won the grand prize for the ticket and she's happy (I suspect only on the outside). She did however notice that the ticket number she had was not sequential with the rest of hers, and realized that the tickets got switched earlier. She said it's fine though, and as I turn around to leave and drive to the lottery office, she says to me, 'you don't need to split the prize with me, but can you give me just tree fiddy?' That's when I look up at the lady and realize she's actually an 8 story tall Loch Ness monster! I tell this monster NO! You aint gonna get my tree fiddy! I'm not about to start giving you handouts just because I won $2500 a week for life! \n\nTL;DR: won $2500 a week for life by accidentally switching tickets with the lady in front, even though I technically bought both tickets.

{"body": "This actually happened a couple of weeks ago, but I was walking down the sidewalk on a mildly breezy day, when out of nowhere a crumpled up piece of paper blew against my shoe. \n\nI bent over to pick it up and throw it away In a nearby trash receptacle, when to my utter shock and amazement, I realized it was a wadded up $20 bill. \n\nAs it happens, I was beginning to get a little hungry, and there was a small gas station that had just opened about a block down the road. \n\nI strolled into the establishment, new found wealth in my front shirt pocket, and began perusing the fine array of delectable gas station vittles. I select 2 frozen beef and bean burritos, a bag of some obscurely branded potato chip, and a \"duper quencher\" (8 oz less than a super duper if you're wondering) from the soda fountain. \n\nAfter using the microwave to heat my burritos, I took my wares to the counter and the attendant rang me up. \"That'll be $6.50 please\", she stated, as I pulled my crumpled and slightly soiled $20 from my pocket. \n\nAs I lay it down on the countertop, I notice a small dispensary of scratch offs just below the glass.  \"Give me a couple of $5 scratch and wins too\", I requested. Why not? I think, as this money was a bit of a windfall to begin with (pun). \nShe tears off two lotto tickets and hands them to me, along with my change. \nI push the change back towards her, along with one of the two tickets, and tell her to keep the change. \nI then take my remaining ticket, my 2 burritos, chips and drink, and exit the store. \nOutside the front entrance, I sat down on a small wooden bench and began consuming my bounty. \nI'm just tearing into my second burrito, when I hear a woman scream from inside the store. \n\"I won! I won! I can't believe it! Ahhhhhh!!!!!!\"\nI jump up, knocking my partially consumed duper quencher over in the the process, and run back into the store to see what was happening. \nThe cashier jumps over the counter, sprints over to where I'm standing, and gives me a giant bear hug, smashing what's left of my $1.99 beef and bean burrito all over the front of my shirt and hers. \n\"Thank you so much for that ticket!\" she screamed, the last remaining bits of my deceased burrito sliding down her red polo shirt. \n\"Uh... sure thing I guess\", I stammered. \n\"Uh.... How.... how much did you win?\" I reluctantly ask...\n\n\"Oh... About tree fiddy.....\" She hissed. \nThat's when it hit me. She wasn't a gas station cashier at all, but 100ft tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. \nI screamed \"Damn you monster!! I should have never given you that ticket!!!\"\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428204742", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 1}

In today's standards, incest is bad.  I understand incest was an extreme example, but looking at the 10 commandments (only the ones that bear moral guidance), it lays out sort of a rule book for people to become civilized.\n\n-Honor your father and your mother.\n\n-You shall not murder.\n\n-You shall not commit adultery.\n\n-You shall not steal.\n\n-You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.\n\n-You shall not covet.\n\nThese values are embedded in us now even if we don't believe in God. But they came into existence in our society due to the fear of God. Similar rules popped up in different parts of the world with this basic ideology at core. \n\nI am just pointing this out because there is this constant bashing of all religions and a thinking that religious people are idiots and doesn't believe in global warming.

I had a vague inkling that paying for sex was illegal, but didn't think much about the fact that I was underage, in my mind i rationalized it by saying, if the act is already illegal how much more illegal could it be with a 15 year old? Boy did I find out. So for a couple weeks before hand i grew as much facial hair as ai could to pass for older than a teen and one weekend I bought some weed and proceeded down to the scuzzy part of town and started cruising the street looking for someone who wasn't similar in age to my mother and hotboxing my car.

I invite her in, and the next thing I know she's telling me where to park that's private and things are moving much faster than I thought.

{"body": "So there I was at my annual tri-county triathlon when I noticed a fire at the local elementary school. I broke away from my race to assist with the rescue team. The majority of the firetrucks hadn't gotten there yet, so I knew I had to act quickly if those poor kids had any chance at survival. I went to this school when I was much younger and my photographic memory allowed me to remember the exact layout of the building. I ran through each and every room, dodging fallen debris and the roaring flames, and started pulling kids out left and right. I started to look like one of those Poison Headcrab Zombies from Half Life once I had half a dozen kindergarteners on my back and shoulders. After 4 trips, I had every single student accounted for. A herd of MILFs and hot school teachers started to crowd around me, thanking me for saving their children. That's when things got even weirder. \n\nA the fucking grizzly bear comes out of the nearby woods to investigate all of the commotion. The lights and the noise from the firetrucks must've agitated the poor thing and it went straight for Mrs. Hildritch's 2nd grade class! I vaulted over the cars in the parking lot and tackled the son of a bitch before it could reach the kids. Things weren't looking too good at first. That bear was a lot bigger than I thought when I first gave it the old ocular pat down. Fortunately, my survival instincts kicked in and I remembered that the most important way to fight a bear is to stick your thumb up its butthole. I jam my left fist into its mouth to prevent it from biting down on my face and I reached around to jam my right thumb right up its ass. The bear was startled and immediately gave up its attack.\n\nThe aforementioned herd of MILFs and hot, horny school teachers merged with a crowd of sexy, female police officers. They couldn't control their frothing loins any longer and starting sucking and fucking me like it was going out of style. Imagine a huge mass of sweaty, mostly naked bodies wriggling and writhing around. After I pleasured each and everyone of them, I remembered my triathlon!\n\nI bolted back to catch up the racers, butt-ass naked and dick flopping in the wind. Slowly but surely, I managed to catch up to and pass everyone of my competition. I catch up to first place and we're running neck and neck to the finish. We reach finish line at the same time! It's a photofinish! Judges review footage and notice that my flopping meat and two veg crossed the finish line before my opponent. I literally won by the hair on my nuts. The head judge arrives and puts the gold medal around my neck when I realize he looks familiar! It wasn't a man, it was the grizzly bear back for revenge! Except I now realize the bear was 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era!

{"body": "I grew up with Ginger, but she wasn't my dog. That's what I thought when I was 11, of course. She was my parents'. They had her before they had any of us kids. It doesn't mean we didn't love her, but I think we took her for granted. She was a beautiful golden retriever with a luscious, dark coat of fur. She was stunning. My parents wanted to breed her, and put her in shows, because she was the ideal dog both physically and mentally. She was obedient, but had free will. She rarely ever barked. However, dare I say, I always wanted another dog. A dog I could call my own. Someone I can name, and walk, and all that. Looking back on her now, I wish I had taken more time to be with her, or just appreciate her. At least I had that one, last, moment with her.\n\nGinger was getting old. She soon went deaf, and then got cancer. She used to have a giant cyst in her foot that would pop and gross everyone out. She was suffering... We knew that she was nearing her end. However, I never truly felt bad. Again, I didn't see her as my dog. I loved her, but I didn't have the memories like my mother and father. It killed my dad to see her like this. Thus, it makes me wonder why she we went to me with her list in the first place.\n\nMaybe she saw that I was a curious eleven year old kid, or at least once was. Maybe she always loved me, and I never took the time to realize it. One of my oldest memories is of one of my old cats scratching me, and Ginger chasing her off, and then sitting with me while I cried. We grew up together. Instead of being jealous like other dogs, she embraced me. When I put it in retrospect, I appreciate Ginger all the more.\n\nNearing her last days, I went into the kitchen to find Ginger sitting in her usual spot, right in front of the door to my back deck. She used to love going into the forrest behind our house and exploring. I never went with her, and always wanted to, but my parents insisted to let her be. She would explore for hours and then come back. She was insanely smart. Thus, it doesn't surprise me that I found her clutching a piece of paper.\n\nI quickly went and grabbed it. \"Don't eat that!\" I yelled. I quickly snatched it, and turned it over.\n\n'Ginger's Bucket List' it said. There was only one bullet point. 'Walk with my best friend.' I didn't understand. Did my Mom do this on purpose to get me to walk the dog? She kept telling me to get outside, and that I was playing too many video games. Doesn't she know that Ginger's foot makes it hard for her to move from one spot to another, let alone go for a walk?\n\nI almost crumpled it up... But I was a curious guy back then. I believed things others didn't. I believed in Bigfoot. I believed in the Loch Ness Monster. Hell, I still do. So, I did what many wouldn't... I gave Ginger the benefit of a doubt. I looked up from the paper and saw her face. Her ears stood up and alert. She looked excited, full of life. It was a look that I hadn't seen for a long time. She must have known I had read it. I knew she couldn't hear me, but I talked to her anyway.\n\n\"Walk? Wanna go for a walk?\" \n\nI went to the back door and unlocked it. She ran onto the porch, but then stopped, and begun to whimper. I stepped out, locked the door behind me, and went to console her. I was right... her foot was in rough shape. However, my early roots of creative began to sprout. I found an old wagon, and I helped her get in it. It was a perfect fit. I made sure my parents weren't pulling in. If they saw me taking Ginger for a ride, they'd had flipped.\n\nI wish I could get into detail on our walk... But it's difficult for me now. All of the colors, from the leaves on that autumn day, to the rotting trees that blocked a path or two, seem to foreshadow my dog's fate. Maybe that was her intent. She didn't need to tell me where she wanted to walk. I pushed her wagon through her favorite woods. Once in a blue moon she would hop out of the wagon and simply stare at something, almost reminiscing. It was an experience for me... My first time in this environment that was my dog's true domain. We finally came upon a giant ledge that looked out on the town below us. We stopped, and sat on the rock. I pet her as she basked in her world for one last time. It felt like hours out there. But as I pushed her back to my yard and lifted her into my house, placing her back in her favorite spot, I saw only 60 minutes went by. As soon as I locked the door, I heard the front one unlock, and my parents walked in. Nice timing, Ginger. That night, I gave her a treat and pet her head one last time (unbeknownst to me at that time) before going to bed.\n\nI awoke the next day to my mom crying. My father had taken her to be put down. I, however, couldn't cry. Instead, I was just numb. The events that occurred just the day before seemed unreal. I had wanted to ask my mom about the note, but I couldn't bring myself to. So I kept it to myself. I still have it. My parents weren't happy with me that I didn't cry... They thought it meant I didn't care. Everyone has their own way of grieving, though.\n\nI look back on pictures with her now and I shake my head. Her eyes were filled with love as they stared at my pudgy baby face. Her face was filled with delight in pictures where I was hugging her, or laying on top of her. She truly loved me. I wish I realized it then. How could I have been so oblivious? However, it doesn't mean I can't appreciate her now. Though I've moved from that house, I still go through walks in the forrest to reminisce. I made a lot more memories in that forrest, but that one takes the cake. I always sit on the ledge and look out. It's really an incredible view. I gotta thank my best friend for showing it to me.\n\n^/r/NardwaurrWrites", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428339667", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 35, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*Bang* Went the first rock of many hitting the armored bus-like vehicle.\n\nJohnny sat at the wheel staring past the pitch black night, onto the gravel road cautiously, flinching at every shoe-sized rock hitting the windshield. He hoped the boys at the headquarters had extra-reinforced it like they had said, unlike last time.\n\nLuckily, the specimens that Johnny was working with the time before were much shorter than the brutes he's dealing with now and he got away with minor scratches.\n\nA half mile later, Johnny slowed the truck to a stop and slowly the flying rocks came to a halt. He stood up and walked to the midsection of the bus and looked out the night vision altered windows. There he saw large shadows with eyes shining like small candles.\n\n\"Don't mess up on this one John\" He said to himself. \"These guys will hurt you\".\n\nHe walked back to the front, and looked upon his veterinarian degree. He often wondered why he was picked to do these sort of tasks. They being so bizarre, no one outside of work would believe him, more likely admit him to a hospital for the mentally ill.\n\nYou see, Johnny is indeed a veterinarian, but not for the common animal. No, he doesn't work on Lassie the Collie, more like Nessie the Loch Ness Monster.\n\nWell not actually Nessie, that's the UK Divisions problem.\n\nThe US division itself is actually split into 5 smaller divisions: Southwest, Midwest, West, Southeast, and Northeast.\n\nJohnny was never told which division he was actually assigned to, seeing that he has been to every corner of the States, he thinks he's on a special solo team.\n\nBut back to this special animal. \n\nThe most noticeable feature of this animal is their feet. Very large feet, maybe you could say big. Yes they are, of course, the Bigfoot.\n\nNow these Sasquatch are a special breed. Not the usual 6-7 feet tall, these guys are around 8-10 feet. And of course the behavior. The common 'squatch is usually skittish and would normally avoid mankind unless thoroughly provoked. But these fellows are quite different, but mainly territorial. If you get into the heart of their colony, they will make themselves known, and they will hurt you. That's why Johnny calls them 'BruteFoot'.\n\nJohnny turned the headlights off and walked to the back of the bus. He pressed several buttons and then the corn that was in the back of a large container was released to the ground.\n\nThis corn is not only one of the favorite Brutes' snacks but also laced with a large amount of sedatives, so Johnny can perform the rest of his mission.\n\nNow see, Johnny was approaching his most hated part, the examination. This process includes measuring height, feet, and hands, taking around twenty samples of hair and if fresh, stool, and very carefully tagging a GPS tracking microchip.\n\nWith the corn laid out, Johnny rode a few more meters, to give the Feet more room to munch. Johnny finally walked to the back of the bus and climbed up onto his hammock and slowly fell asleep.\n\nIn the morning, Johnny loaded up. His main material was chain mail. The vet put layers of it over every article of clothing he had on. He was never really sure why it worked, but it deterred them from biting, so he didn't ask questions. On his left side he had fully loaded syringe gun, with enough tranquilizers to make a man sleep for a week. On his right, a taser that was loaded with\nenough volts to make an elephant cry.\n\nJohnny walked to the back and looked out the window.\n\n\"Yup they're asleep\", He said and walked to the door.\n\nReluctantly he unlocked the door and opened it. One foot came out and then, cautiously, the other. On any other species, he'd close the door, but since the danger is so high, he left it open for a quick escape. He slowly walked around the bus, avoiding any leaves or twigs. At the end, there laid around thirty BruteFoots.\n\n\"This better had been all of them from last night\", He whispered to himself.\n\nJohnny pulled out his tools and began measuring. After 5 of them, he heard a loud groan and his heart climbed to his throat. He turned around expecting to see one waking, but it was just turning over.\n\nSeveral more later, another groan and rollover. Around a half hour later every few minutes there was a groan. Suddenly, as Johnny turned around, the largest Brute he had measured yet, sat up and rubbed his eyes. As quick as a flash, Johnny jumped around the bus where he wouldn't be seen.\n\nAs his mind raced what to do, he heard a beep from the bus. Now HQ can automatically send Johnny a message and it will speak from the console of the bus. And Johnny, had his volume for the messages loud, so he can always hear it. Loud enough even, to reach around to the back of the bus and beyond.\n\n**Johnny this is Kate, do NOT use the corn. We used the wrong sedative, one used for the shorter species. Ronny has reported that the sedative he used on a colony of the Skunk Apes in the Everglades, have not woken up yet, even though he had put out the corn two days ago. Once again do NOT use the laced corn. If you will, report back so we can give you the right sedatives for them**\n\nRight on cue began a chorus of growls from behind the bus. Johnny didn't even dare a peak, he ran back around and jumped through the already opened door like he left it. He locked it back up, and as soon as he did, the bus began to rock back and forth. He jumped onto the seat, turned the key, and gunned the engine. \n\nEven though he had the speed advantage, the Brutes continued to run after.\n\n\"Go away!\". He yelled as if they understood.\n\nA few minutes later,  it appeared that all of them stopped running. All but two. Johnny looked closely and noticed that it was an adult male and female.\n\n\"Why aren't they stopping!?\"\n\nRight as the words left his mouth, he felt something on his leg. He looked down and saw a small furry hand on his shin. He screamed and started swerving. As he started slowing down he looked behind him. There a small baby Brute sat, a smile on it's face.\n\nSuddenly Johnny put two and two together as the bus stopped.\n\n\"Those are your parents aren't they?\". He asked the baby.\n\nHe looked back at two running towards and gingerly picked up the baby. He unlocked the door and stepped out.\n\nThe baby, seeing them, made a few happy sounds as the parents neared.\n\nGingerly Johnny put the baby down. The two Brutes slowed and they stopped. They both stared at Johnny for a few seconds. Suddenly the male of the pair gave a loud growl and Johnny took a step back. The female kneeled down and looked at Johnny in the eyes. She slowly took her hand, and placed it upon Johnny's head as he stood in fear. She left it there for a few seconds then stood back up, picked up the baby, and turned around with the male.\n\nJohnny was astonished. The gesture she did is a great sign of respect in the culture of the sasquatchs.\n\nAs they two with the baby began to walk away, Johnny slowly turned back around and entered the bus.\n\n\"Ho-ly crap...\". He said as he sat down.\n\nHe turned the key and started down the road. Just for an extra measure, he peaked into the back of the bus so he could make sure there were no more stowaways. At last as he realized he was safe, he turned on the radio and went on his way home.\n\n(Just to be sure if any format or other writing stuff is a bit messed up, this is my first prompt response, thanks for reading)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428349481", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So there I was being a vice principal doing my daily  things such as jacking off under my desk to the hot teachers that I made sure we employed and pretending to do work. If it was a really slow day I would load up porn on the computer. But then some asshat decide to disturb me from my lair. Their I was in my office feet on the desk watching breaking bad on Netflix. When some non hot teacher comes flying through the door. I quickly switch the show off and pretend I'm polishing my shoes. \n\nI had to look like I'm working. She then blabbers on about some fight going to happen at lunch. To be honest I didn't really pay attention. I just nodded my head and waited for her to leave. This woman was taking for ever and she was only a 5. Eventually her mad ramblings stop and I blurt out some rubbish like. \"Don't you worry miss evergreen (no wonder she's a miss if she always goes on like this) I will sort the issue out personally.\" Finally she left\n\nI put my feet back on the table and continued to watch Breaking bad. Then I realised what I had done. I'm sitting here sock less in a suit and just pretended to polish my shoes. I'm such an asshat. How do I still have a job I think to myself. I take a quick break and decide to get the catering staff to take time out of there day to make me some popcorn. Like who watches Netflix without popcorn? On my way back with a tub of popcorn from the 3.5 dinner lady. I bump into a 9/10 English teacher. Blonde hair perfect face, body and recently divorced. She looks distressed today. \n\nI ask her what is up? Thinking to myself how smooth am I. She then begins to rant on like the other woman about some fight. I would have gone back to watching breaking bad. But she said \"you will sort it out for me Derek. I would be so upset if any students get hurt\" now she said this. I had to stop this fight. \n\nI run back to my office minimise Netflix and load up some bullshit spreadsheet. I have to at least look like I am working. I then run down to the cafeteria area where all of the students are now eating lunch. As I pass the dinner lady she shouts at me \"no no Derek no more popcorn we all out.\" I run past her I must complete my quest and get the princess. I mean the English teacher. \n\nI walk into the dinning hall and call everyone to my attention. Ah fuck what do I say. Erm. \"Children!\" Ugh now I sound like a perv. \"I have heard some rumours going around school today. I should just remind everyone of our policy on fighting. Which is that all those involved will be punished.\" Oh wow look. I feel like a god right now. They are hanging off my every word. Look at that little shit Danny. He looks horrified. I bet him and his little shit head friends organised the fight. Oh they want be to say more. More? I shall give them more! \"I will personally deal with those involved in any fights. That will be all\" \n\nAll the students turn back around and start discussing what I just said. I feel so powerful. Then I catch her eye. The cute English teacher she was staring at me throughout the whole talk. I walk past her. \n\"Oh Derek that was such an inspirational talk. The students they really look up to you.\" She said. \n\"I like.... Children\" I reply. Ah shit I just fucked up my chances. The look of disgust on her face actually hurts. \n\"I mean I like helping Children to learn and develop\" I saved that one. But she still frowns at me. \n\nI quickly walked away and headed back to my lair. I needed to watch some breaking bad. Would Walt die? Nothing more mattered to me. My whole life pivoted on this moment.  And then I was interrupted again.  The annoying ugly lady. \"There was a food fight. I've caught the student that did it\" she says\n\"ah thank you...\" shit I forgot her name. \"Bring them in\" I declare. Damn I feel powerful now. Like some super judge bringing justice. I attempt to look busy whilst the student walks in head looking down ashamed. But In all honesty I'm adding judge dred to the list of films I need to see. \n\n\"Ah Daniel... Daniel what have we done now\" I say. The look of fear on his face is hilarious I have to hold in my laughter. \n\"Please don't tell me mom. She will urt me. She will. I don't want er to be angry.\" I stumbled out. \n\" I don't see any need for punishment\" I say. \nThen the ugly annoying lady who was obviously listening to our conversation bursts in. \n\"What do you mean no punishment\" she shouts. But that's when I realised and so did Daniel. She was no teacher. she didn't work at the school at all. She was a huge monster from the paleolithic era. I got out of there. But Daniel didn't. I guess it taught him for being such a shit. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428355897", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I am a current New York uber driver and have been driving customers around the city for almost a year as my second source of income because New York is so damn expensive. I'm actually thinking about doing it full time because it really is a great source of income. A lot of people don't realize how lucrative this business actually is. If you have a clean and relatively new and big vehicle, you can make upwards of $70,000 per year. Which is *okay* for living in the big apple. \n\nAnyway, my strangest story was St. Patrick's day 2014. This gentleman and his wife stepped into my car and asked me to take them about 35 blocks to the Grand Central Terminal. I could tell from their accent that they were Scotland or another similar region from that country. And as you could imagine, they were both plastered. Not 10 minutes into the drive, I smell liquor. The wife had a silver flask and actually asked me if I wanted a swig. I politely told them no and proceeded to tell them to not drink in the car because I would lose my licence. Bad idea. She laughed and poured the entire flask down my back.\n\nI immediately stopped the car and told them to get out. This was after 15 blocks, so they had another 20 to go. They stumbled out of my car and demanded that I pay for their cab to Grand Central. They wanted ***me*** to pay ***them*** after they had ruined my ability to drive and make money for the rest of the night?? On one of the busiest days of the year!! Fuck. That. \n\nI walked around my car to close the other door and the husband stood not three inches away from my face and demanded I give him all of my money. I looked down at my wallet and took about 350 bucks out of my wallet. I looked up and was about to hand it to him.... but it was at that point I realized he wasn't a man at all.... It was a giant crustacean from Paleolithic era. I told him I ain't givin you no tree fiddy you got damn Loch Ness monster. Get your own damn money.

{"body": "I used to have this friend named Sheridan in high school. In 10th grade we met but we didn't really talk that much, 11th was about the same but senior year we became really, really good friends.\n\nWe hung out everyday and used to tell each other all about our girlfriends and such. He was my most trusted friend at the time, which was kind of weird for me since I had some weird trust issues from always getting other friends using me and not really wanting to be my friends.. if that makes sense\n\nBut that's not important.\n\nAnyways, there's an amusement park called Lagoon a few miles from where we live, it's a pretty fun place and it's a good hang out spot in the summer for teens. We spent the entire year being friends and when the amusement park opened for the year in early June, we decided we'd both ask out a girl if they wanted to go to the amusement park with us and just hang out for the day.\n\nI ask out two girls before one says yes, he only needs to ask out one.\n\nThe day there was pretty fun, we went on rides, played the side games, at lunch and dinner there, and overall had a really fun time.\n\nTowards the end of the evening we decided to switch into our swimming suits (which we had brought with us) and go to the waterpark section of the amusement park.\n\nSo, we get our stuff and go into the water park. We haven't changed into our swim suits yet so the girls go into the girl locker room and me and Sheridan go into the boys locker room.\n\nFor some reason, Sheridan got really self conscious about his body all of the sudden. I asked him jokingly what was wrong and he got very offended, saying things like, \"Fuck off, dude.\" and \"Leave me the fuck alone.\"\nI'd be joking with him, but he sounded very serious, so I decided to lay off and get dressed. Instead of getting dressed with me he runs with his swimming suit into a bathroom stall. I get dressed and go out of the locker rooms to wait for him.\n\nAfter 5 minutes the girls come out but Sheridan still hasn't come out. Another 5 minutes goes by and me and the girls are starting to get worried. I tell them I'll go check on him.\nI walk into the locker room and can see his feet and clothes everywhere under one of the stalls. (The locker room and bathrooms were in the same room, by the way, this might be confusing)\nI thought he was masturbating so I get a genius plan to pop out under the stall and say \"boo\" or something.\nI creep up to the side and slide under the stall and shout \"STOP MASTURBATING\"\nHe was masturbating. But that's not the bad part, I expected that. The scary part was I discovered he was a hermaphrodite. I would have never known. I have nothing against hermaphrodites but I was absolutely shocked at finding this out. It explained why Sheridan was self conscious about taking his clothes off in front of me and everything.\n\nHe started freaking the fuck out when he saw my facial expression change so quickly.\n\"DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK? OH, GOD\" he kept saying over and over. I kept saying \"sorry\" as much as I could but he was absolutely furious.\n\nI felt absolutely awful, still do in a way. I get him to calm down and he starts yelling at me, \"I need you to never tell anyone.\"\n\nI say something like, \"Ok dude, I will never tell anyone, I promise. Is there anything else I can do?\" , he responds, \"No.\" but I keep insisting that I do something else for him. He keeps telling me no, so I suggest we go swimming now. As we're walking out he says, \"Wait, I need something else.\" \"What do you need?\" I ask. \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Sheridan was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit Nessie, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam off into the distance.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428373648", "subreddit": "BitTippers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This story takes place when I was on my vacation in Thailand a few years ago, and it was one of the few times when I was actually away from my wife.\n\nI had heard of the infamous redlight district in Bangkok and wanted to get a closer view of it for myself, at no point in time on my way to the redlight district in bangkok did I expect myself to pick up a prostitute, there was no way I would have wanted to and that just wasn't me, I had originally just planned just to look around and maybe go to a few shops there (just so I could brag to my friends that I had been to the infamous redlight district of Bangkok)\n\nAnyways... when I was walking around I kept seeing numerous prostitutes and initially I thought to myself, \"Damn, this is just weird...\" but some of them were kind of pretty. Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\n\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far, I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.\n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact. I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\" I almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal. Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\n\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\" She replied \"Oh, not much...\"\n\n\n\"I just need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

I thought, \"For me to have a power like that, I'd need a muscle sticking out in a dimension other than the 3 I exist in.\" Then I thought, \"I'd need to be impossibly precise with that muscle to realign myself with along this other dimension.\" There'd probably need to be a perfect vacuum surrounding the perceivable universe in every dimension beyond the three in which we exist, or laws of physics prohibiting matter of differing dimensional counts from interacting. Otherwise, we'd get knocked out of our 3D \"plane\" all the time. Things would just disappear forever. Some 4D guy sneezes and pushes the earth out from under our feet. Earth would just be... gone from our experience. It seems like it'd be improbably difficult to perfectly re-align along a 4th axis with something that has no thickness along that axis.\n\nAnother shitty theory I've had is that if there *is* 4-dimensional shit out there that could interact with us in the 3rd, the matter we perceive (and are made up of) would have to be REALLY long strings in the 4th dimension. The theory falls apart well before shit gets rotated to have strings running in parallel along one of the three axis we perceive.\n\nThen there's a more recent theory I've arrived at when thinking more about the one above. This theory is that the matter in the 4th dimension in simply static strings following the paths of what we perceive at 3-dimensional matter. At any given moment in \"time-as-perceived-from-the-fourth-dimension\", we, and everything around us is in every position it's ever been in and every position it ever will be in. Thus, every \"moment\" that we perceive is just a static cross section of these layered 4D strings. So, a key that you will press in a moment's time is actually already pressed.\n\ntaking it further, the 5th dimension could be every possible starting point and trajectory of the strands from the 4th dimension.\n\nI need to go to bed.

{"body": "It’s not the CIA or NSA or anything but I think I may have been interviewed for the mossad a few months ago... I'm still not entirely sure.\n\n\nI recently moved to Israel to do my masters degree in science, after picking which university I wanted to attend and settling in I started applying for various scholarships to help pay for uni and living expenses. One of the scholarships required that I take a one of those logic/reasoning/IQ tests. So I went to the place and took the test, there were about 50 other people in the room also taking the same test (I assume).\n\n\nAbout a week after I took the test the scholarship people called me to set up an interview, they gave me a time and an address and they told me the whole interview process will take about 3 hours. The day of the interview I took a bus to the approximate location that they gave me and there was about a 10 minute walk from the bus stop to the address, when I got there I looked around and I couldn’t find the building, it was like it wasn’t there. The street went straight from number 10 to number 14 right next to it without a number 12. \n\n\nI have this problem where I’m always super early for things and so I still had like 20 minutes until my interview so I wasn’t too worried at this point, I just started looking around to see if I could find number 12. I spent about 15 minutes wondering around looking like an idiot before finally asking someone where #12 was. He pointed to a small alleyway around the back of one of the buildings and said #12 was over there, luckily I made it in time but in hindsight they probably had hidden cameras around this whole area to see how I dealt with this and I failed miserably haha.\n\n\nWhen I got in the lady at the reception gave me a questionnaire to answer, it had all the usual “job interview questionnaire” style questions that repeat with different phrasing and a 1-5 rate yourself scale. “Do you consider yourself a risk taker?” “How well do you work in a team?” “Do you usually take the lead in group situations?” “Do you feel energized or drained by social situations?” etc. So I filled that in and gave it back to the receptionist who then asked me to wait in the other room, I waited for about 45 minutes (Without my phone! They took it and my bag when I went through security, which is actually pretty standard in israel) then someone else called me into another room that had a small cubicle with a chair/desk and pen and some papers. He closed the door without giving me any instructions.\n\n\nAt this point I was starting to get a bit suspicious, this all seemed a bit intense for a scholarship but I sat at the desk anyway and looked over the papers. They were a bunch more weird tests, one of which asked me to close my eyes and then draw on a piece of paper 5 big circles and then 5 little circles inside the big circles. Super weird, there was no one there to even check if my eyes were closed. I’m assuming there were hidden cameras to see if you cheated or not or how much you cheated. There was also a page with a chess board drawn on it and an incomplete game on it with no instructions about what they even want. The whole cubicle thing was pretty strange and I think they were trying to see how I think.\n\n\nAfter this there was finally the actual interview with people, I walked into the room and there were 2 women and a man. They were friendly, they introduced themselves and asked me if I would prefer to do the interview in English (which is my native language). The questions were pretty standard job/uni interview style questions about me, my future, my research, various experiences. Only the man spoke, the women both took notes. At the end of the interview the man asked me if I had any questions, I asked about how much the scholarship pays and he replied \"About tree fiddy\" that's when I realized the interviewer was actually a giant lake monster from the paleolithic era.\n\nHahaha no I'm kidding, after the interview I left and I haven’t heard anything from them since. I didn’t get the scholarship, but I wasn’t notified that I didn’t receive it or anything. I mean there was no way of knowing if this was a mossad thing or just a really weird scholarship interview, maybe they’ve still yet to get back to me :P\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428420309", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 261, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The baby chick house (also known as the \"brooder\")\nBaby chicks need to be protected from drafts but still have adequate ventilation. This can be in the form of a cardboard box with holes for ventilation, a single-faced corrugated cardboard roll, 12\" or higher, a large plastic storage bin, or even a kiddie pool! All of the above have been used with success.\n\nWhatever housing solution you go with, make sure it provides 2 square feet per chick. It sounds like an awful lot, but as they get older (and bigger) you'll realize why this is necessary.\n\nA heat source\nBaby chicks need to be kept pretty hot. Think sauna! The first week of their lives they require an air temperature of 95 degrees, the second week 90 degrees, and so on - going down by 5 degrees per week until they're ready to transition to \"outside\". A 250-watt infrared heat lamp is the best way to achieve this, placed right in the middle of their living area and suspended off the ground. The height of the light will depend on what it takes to achieve your target temperature.\n\nWe recommend a red heat bulb for a few reasons: one, with a bright white light constantly glaring it can be hard for them to sleep. The red light is darker and provides them some respite. Two, red lights help prevent them from pecking one another. We sell both red and white heat bulbs plus the brooder lamps.\n\nPay close attention to how your chicks behave. If they're all crowded together directly under the heat source, they're cold. Lower the heat lamp or add another one. If they're around the edges of the brooder, avoiding the heat and each other like the plague, they're too hot! Raise the heat lamp. A happy flock will happily be exploring all around the brooder.\n\nAnd please do not listen to anyone that tells you a regular old 60 watt bulb will suffice! We've seen chicks die from this bad advice. They really need a lamp intended to produce heat, and as we've mentioned, we recommend the 250-watt variety.\n\nAbsorbent bedding\nBaby chicks are big poopers, so make sure to line the floor of their housing unit with an absorbent material. The best, we think, is to spread pine shavings about 1\" thick. Resist the urge to use newspaper! It's not nearly as absorbent and the slippery surface can lead to a permanent deformity called \"splayed leg\" which can ultimate result in the other chickens picking on the affected bird to death. Many people also swear by paper towels, changed often. (DON'T use cedar shavings, no matter what friends or your local feed store tell you: the aromatic oils will irritate your chicks' lungs, and make them more susceptible to respiratory problems later in life.)\n\nA drinker/waterer\nWe recommend you don't try to use a dish, a rabbit drinker, or anything you have just \"laying around\". Baby chicks have special needs when it comes to water. Dishes can make it easy for chicks to drown, and they'll certainly do naughty things likwe walk in it, spill it, kick their bedding materials into it, and poop in it -- meaning you'll have to change it constatly. Rabbit drinkers aren't preferable, either, becuase not enough chicks can access it at once. For the best results, we recommend you use a chick waterer. They come in a number of different sizes and shapes, all basically sufficient.\n\nKeep in mind that even with the best drinker, they'll still kick bedding materials into it and find ways to poop in it from time to time. Raising the waterer off the ground somewhat will help (starting their second week of life), but no matter what they're going to get that water messy, so plan on changing it a few times a day.\n\nA feeder\nOnce again, we recommend you resist the temptation to use a dish or bowl for feeding your chicks. They're messy, and they'll jump in and kick the feed all over the place, poop in it, and worse case scenario: they'll tip it over and trap a baby underneath. (This has happened!) Spend those few extra dollars and buy a \"real\" baby chick feeder, or borrow one from a friend. They come in many shapes and sizes, and we offer the very baby chick feeder we use for our chicks.\n\nBonus: Roosting Poles\nChickens love to roost on poles or branches when they're resting. You don't HAVE to provide your brood roosting poles, but they'll be even happier if you do. We like half inch diameter wooden dowels. Try them about 5 inches off the ground. (They may like it so much they won't roost on top of your feeder and waterer!)\n\nFeed\nFortunately this one doesn't require much thought! Suppliers have formulated special feed complete with everything baby chicks need. It's called \"starter feed\" and comes in either \"crumbles\" or \"mash\" (referring to how ground down it is). Either is fine. The only thing to know is that if you've had your chicks vaccinated against Coccidiosis, they'll need an un-medicated feed. If not, or if you've only had them vaccinated for Marek's Disease, medicated feed is a great way to keep them healthy those first few months. We also offer a terrific organic chick starter feed.\n\nA question we commonly get is how long to feed baby chicks \"starter feed\" for before switching to a feed called \"grower\" or \"chick grower\". The answer is: it all depends! Each manufacturer formulates their feed differently, so read the label and follow their instructions. Some only recommend the starter for 4 weeks before moving onto grower; some combine both together in a \"starter/grower\" feed that can last up to 16 weeks, etc.\n\nCustomers also will ask us whether they can feed their chicks scraps, or worms and other bugs from the garden... Small amounts of vegetable/dairy should be fine for the chicks (and they'll love it!), and the same goes with bugs and worms. But consider those like dessert, not the main course. Starter feeds contain everything chicks need to survive and thrive, and filling them up with too much of the \"other stuff\" can throw off their nutritional balance.\n\nFinally, people want to know how much food they should give their birds. The answer is: as much as they want! Don't ration it. Give your birds 24/7 access to all the food they can eat. They're not like dogs. They'll self-regulate.\nEdit: Tree fiddy, or something like that.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428448490", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

I know from experience, I'm a mod too, some users are just idiots and everyone be it a mod or not knows this. \n\nSome times you as a mod have unfortunately had some idiot spam you 100 PMs because you banned his ass for trying to brigade (as an example). So there you are pissed off after having to argue with some muppet and then some poor soul comes along and is at the wrong place at the wrong time and they get a bit of an unjust treatment. The treatment was unjust and unfair, but it was a mistake that happened in the heat of the moment.\n\nIf the sub has good moderators, the other mods will make it right and ask the other one to calm down. This happens more than you know behind the scenes. We all make mistakes and as long as we admit that we made a mistake and try to make it right we should be fine. After all it's all done for free.\n\nA mixed bag of nuts:  \n\nThis subreddit for obvious reasons attracts people from the most screwed up corners of society. It also attracts completely normal people who question the stories we're told. Finally it also attracts people that are extremely naive and hate everyone in here. As if that wasn't enough there are tons of different interests that fall under the umbrella \"conspiracy\". There's NWO, 911, Free Masons, UFOs a fucking Loch Ness monster and everything in between. But these are just \"interest groups\", then we have people like me who like to read the news from the other perspective and don't give a shit about free masons and UFOs.\n\nGo ahead and try to find one solution to please them all. It's impossible. Someone will always feel like they got the short end of the stick.\n\nSo for the love of all things holy, can we stop fighting each other over stupid shit like this? There really isn't a problem here. If you want to see real problems go and have a look at most default subs. To make it even more easy for you. Go and spend time in a sub moderated by DavidReiss and you'll see what problems really are.\n\nFinally. I don't know much about /u/Flytape. The few encounters I've had with him, he's always been nice, friendly and to the point. That is in 99.9 % of all cases the sign of a good mod. I've never experienced horrific censorship done in his name.\n\nGive the guy a fucking break. If you're not whining about him wearing a mask or saying official /r/conspiracy podcast you find something else to piss and moan about. Another inherent problem of this subreddit is that extremely many here are so paranoid that they see an conspiracy in everything.\n\nTo me it seems like some people in here really don't realise how good they have it. If that says more about the general standard on moderation on reddit or something else I'll let you decide.\n\nPs. It's 3 AM where I'm at so my apologies if I spell like a drunk chicken.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428449781", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "And I'm not even telling you the unholy things we did to the dead dude they assigned to us or how I got there in the first place... but here it goes, quick story before I go to bed... [edit... turned out to be a wall of text, this is 100% true and not a loch ness monster story, I promise, scroll down if you like; I wrote this just for you as I know nobody but you will read it]\n\nI was 17 at the time and in Guatemala you get to go straight into med school upon highschool graduation. In fact, I had JUST turned 17, so I was a young buck. I moved to the city from a small village and rented a room in the first floor of an old house. \n\nI went to a \"premed\" class organized by the unofficial student association which I later found out was a bunch of drop outs and deadbeats who would only show up for the first half of the year only to scam the students out of money. I paid for this absolutely lousy premed course, and one of the events was to go to the morgue to perform a necropsy.\n\nIn the parking lot there were families crying, funeral homes picking them up, etc. \n\nI see the main guy talk with the coroner secretly and he hands him an envelope, later I figured out that this was a bribe to let us in.\n\nWe go in and there's blood everywhere and bodies on the ground, the place was overflowing with dead people. This was Guatemala city's crime morgue, so anyone who died a gruesome death, got killed, or anything that warranted a police investigation would come through here. \n\nThere were about 10 slabs of concrete all full of bodies. The smell was indescribable. It was absolutely disgusting and we were told we'd be there for 4 hours at least.\n\nThey assign us to a dude whose head had been chopped off with a machete but part of the back of the neck skin was still holding his head together.\n\nThe guy brings a friggin saw, like something you would buy from home depot for $5. No electric saw. It took us about 30 minutes to saw through his skull and pulled out his brains. They kept going and sawed off his entire chest and pulled all the guts out in one go, I had no idea you could do that, everything just comes right out if you grab all the organs. While all of this was going on I was playing with the dude's mouth like pretending he was talking, and twisted his head around until the skin flap got all twisted up.\n\nThen one guy says \"hey, try the testicle trick!\". He somehow dug around inside his chest cavity and pulled his testicles from the inside.\n\nWe were all grossed out with masks and everything. Suddenly the coroner comes back the room. He was awol for 3 hours, essentially it was just us in there. He is eating a friggin muffin off his bare hands and touching all the dead bodies. I don't know if he was showing off or if he was an absolutely disgusting human being that had become immune to the filth.\n\nAnyway, I saw the dead baby and other dead bodies, we put all the guts and the brain in the guys chest cavity and sewed everything back together and left.\n\nThat night I couldn't sleep. I kept imagining dead bodies everywhere in that lonely house, but somehow I pulled through.\n\nA couple of days passed and I got on a bus, and a few minutes later, I swear, I saw a guy that looked exactly like the guy we had hacked off. He had a little girl and he sat right in front of my seat with the girl in his arms. The girl stared me down the entire ride with soulless eyes. It was freaking freaky.\n\nAnyway, this is not a loch ness monster story, this actually happened to me.

{"body": "3:47 AM Lake Loch Ness, Scotland.\n\nA boat sits still on the water, calm as glass and black as night. From the bow of the ship a wisp of smoke rises from a freshly lit cigarette. The glowing ember pierces the dark like a dagger. A man, a tall and dark silhouette in the early morning, pulls the cigarette from his lips and surveys the water. His eyes darting rapidly across the lake, trying to take it all in at once. It wouldn't happen again, he thought. There was simply too much at stake. He took a long thoughtful drag, flicked the butt in to the black water and walked briskly to the helm, carefully securing the door behind him. He fired up the engines, a low grumble of exhaust bubbling up from the black water. The grumble had stirred something in the cabin, and from the sleeping quarters came a meek \"Dad?\", \"Yes, William its only the engine, go back to sleep, you need to rest.\", \"I can't go back to sleep now\" Willy complained, \"I had the dream again.\" The mans eyes darted up. Looking right at his son. He rushed to his bedside and grabbed the boy. \"William, what did you see?\" He asked firmly, \"Tell me exactly what you saw in your dream\". Will was startled at first, but began to recall what he could remember to his father. \"It was dark. I could see mama, and Jane on the shore, but they were dark.\" \"Aye, yes just like last time\", the man said, \"yeah like last time, I was stuck like last time too! My legs wouldn't move.\", \"Okay what happened after you saw mama and Jane\", \"Well you started driving the boat away from them, we just kept going and going until I couldn't see them anymore\" Will continued with fear in his voice \"We were going to see Nessy. You said she was calling us home. That we had to go meet her so we could be clean, clean like the black water\" He jerked back from his son, grabbing his hat with both hands from his head and clinched it tightly in his fists. \"No, no, no, no!\" he cursed. \"She will not have me again\", \"Not after what she done to us Willy\", \"I won't lose you too, I swear to you willy, I won't lose you too...\" he began to cry, Will reached from the bed and hugged him tightly. \"I know you won't daddy\" reassuring him, \"This ends tonight.\" the man said wiping the tears from his eyes. He fixed his hat firmly on his head, and looked to willy, \"find her for me boy\". Willy's eyes rolled back into his head and his body began to tremble (a terrifying sight to the uninitiated but a common one on this ship). Willy raised his hand and pointed west. They headed full-steam westward. \n\nThey arrived at a cove sometime after 4. Willy ceased to shake and his eyes met his fathers. \"You did it boy\" he said with pride. \"We're right at her front door\". The man rushed to a storage compartment underneath willy's bed retrieving a black dagger tipped with crimson red.\n\"OK Willy, what do we do if we see Nessy?\"\n\"Hide under our blankets!\" Willy shouted as the mimed the maneuver they had practiced time and time again. \"That's right\", the Man said. \n\"Now what do we do even if she promises to be really nice?\", \n\"Stay under no matter what! Not until papa comes back!\", \n\"That's right, not until papa comes back\", \n\" I love you Willy\", \n\"How much?\" Willy asked.\n\"To the moon and back me boy, to the moon and back... Now get under your covers, I'll be back in no time\" Willy covered himself with the blanket and his father tucked him in tightly. He kissed Willy's forehead through the blanket and walked out of the cabin.\n\nThe man dropped from the side of the boat plunged into the cold dark blackness, dagger clenched between his teeth. He swam slowly, with purpose in his stroke and revenge in his heart. He approached the cave and he could smell the beast. A stench so foul and dank it could only be described as darkness. He crawled on his stomach into the cave. His breathing was slower now, he had to concentrate, this was his last chance. He slid into an open area of the cave with a large pool in the center. The smell was almost unbearable now, held his hat over his face in a desperate attempt to mask the stench. Suddenly from the pool arose the beast, in all of her magnificence. Dark, dank, slick and cold the beast flew up from the water and landed on the shore mere feet from the Man. Petrified at the sheer power of the creature the Man dropped his dagger and stood in disbelief. Nessy approached him slowly sniffing around his body, getting his scent. The Monster opened its mouth bent down and said, \"I need about tree-fiddy\" The man began to inch his hand toward his pocket to retrieve the monster's tree-fiddy, but for some reason he stopped. All he could think of was Willy, this gave him strength. The man rolled to the right and grabbed his dagger from the cold wet floor. He charged at the Monster with a roar, \"I got yer fokin tree-fiddy right here you sea-monster cunt!\" He stabbed upward through the beast's skull. It writhed in pain as the dagger seared the inside of her brain. Nessy fell to the ground with a massive thud and let out a final sigh, \"I just.. needed.. about... tree.. fid--\" The beast was dead. The Man fell to his knees. Absolution, he had done it. He was free from that wretched beast. He and Willy could finally live their lives in peace. The man crawled out of the cave and splashed back into the cool water, the stench was still with him, smelling even worse now. He pulled himself up into the boat, rolling over the edge falling onto the deck and lying there trying to process what had just happened. It had been so long since the Man had hope in his life. This was a new beginning, a new day out of the black water. He sat himself up on the deck, stood up and walked into the cabin to give Willy the good news. He walked in the door and smiled at the sight of Willy still frightened underneath his blanket. He smiled because it was something he knew he would never have to see again. He walked over to his bedside and said,“Papa’s back, we did it buddy.” as he lifted the blanket from the bed only to find the GODDAMN LOCH NESS MONSTER who looked up at him and said, \"I need about tree-fiddy.\"\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428468591", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It ends tonight.\n\nI regret ever taking Martha to the loch. It was supposed to be just the two of us, two old timers taking a lazy paid-for-by-their-kids vacation seein' the sights and everything. We went out to the famed Loch Ness, hired a rowboat and I rowed her around, taking in the beautiful scenic view. I joked with her about finding the Loch Ness monster.\n\nI found it.\n\nAll of a sudden, Martha pointed at a spot right behind me, the surface of the loch bubbling and foaming where she pointed. Our hearts leapt into our throats as a gigantic, scaly head appeared, protruding from the surface. Its long slender neck rose towering from the depths, its red bloodshot eyes staring down at us from above a row of yellow jagged fangs. It lowered its head and Martha began to scream, but just as its head came about level to our boat, it opened its mouth...and spoke.\n\nThat was the second most incredulous thing to happen that day. The third was its actual appearance. The first was what it actually said.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nDumbstruck, slack jawed, eyes wide and my mind reeling swiftly into the abyss of madness, I reached into my pocket and gave it three pounds and fifty pence, so happened to be the exact change I had. A long slimy tentacle extended from the dark waters, wrapped around my hand and took the money down into the depths. The horrible monster spoke again, saying, \"Thanks, man, you a'ite.\"\n\nI rowed us back to shore as soon as it was gone. I was just complaining to Martha about how my arms were sore from the rowing before the monster showed up. On the way back, I'd have rowed us thirteen times around the world if it meant I'd never have to see the robbing monster again.\n\nBack upon the shore I asked the boatman if he'd seen the Loch Ness monster (half-jokingly, in case he thought I was insane). He snorted and said, \"Aye, always comes up asking for money. Three fifty, always the same amount.\"\n\nA lump formed in my throat. \"Did you...did you give him the money?\"\n\nHe looked me dead in the eye as if I said I had murdered the Queen. \"Ye daft bastard. Ye gave him the money, didn't you?\"\n\nI nodded. He shook his head and wished me well, but said nothing else. Little did I know, my troubles were only just beginning.\n\nA few days later, back at the hotel, me and Martha had put the whole Loch Ness Monster thing behind us. We had just come back after exploring the English countryside, which by the way was beautiful and full of nice wonderful people to talk to and things to see. Martha said she wanted to take a nice long nap, while I decided to go back out and buy some sandwiches.\n\nI had barely got my boots on before I heard a knocking at the door. \"Housekeepin'\" a voice called out, and I finished putting my shoes and jacket on first before opening the door.\n\nImagine my shock when what I saw wasn't a cleaning lady, but rather an ancient, scaly evil from the depths of Loch Ness. Unbelievably, the Loch Ness Monster had returned. I wondered how it could have fit its gigantic body into the tiny hallway in front of us, but before I could do anything else, it extended a tentacle and said in its loud, booming voice, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nI screamed this time, and slammed the door in its face. I stumbled backward and landed flat on my ass, nearly breaking my pelvic bones. Martha came rushing out of the bathroom in her towel, but I was rambling, ranting and raving, with nothing coming out of my mouth except 'monster' and 'tree fiddy'.\n\nMartha decided I had had enough excitement and arranged for us to fly back to the States. For all the good it would do.\n\nA few months later I saw it again, but I didn't know it was him at first. I was walking back from doing the groceries for Martha, when I saw a young man in a hoodie standing on the sidewalk ahead of me. I ignored him; pay any of these thugs any attention and they invariably pay you too much in return. But as I passed by the man, he turned and tapped me on the shoulder.\n\n\"Hey man, can you help me?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" I said, trying to avoid eye contact. \"I'm in a hurry. Maybe next time.\"\n\n\"C'mon, please?\"\n\nI sighed, and turned around, staring the youth in the face. They were remarkably unremarkable, and could belong in any city in any country on the world. \"What do you want?\"\n\nHe smiled, walked uncomfortably closer to me, and whispered, \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell it was about that time that I realised something was off about the man. In horror I watched as his features changed from human to reptilian, his eyes turning blood red and his smile widening and widening, refusing to be contained by his human face, the yellow fangs bursting from crimson gums like pus from a boil. It was the Loch Ness Monster, following me from Loch Ness all the way back home.\n\nIn my shock, I somehow managed to yell at it, \"I'm not giving you any money! Go away! Leave me alone, Loch Ness Monster!\"\n\nIts smile stayed in place. \"Aw, c'mon, man. Don' be a  busta.\"\n\nI ran all the way back home, looking behind me to see if it was following. It hadn't, but I had the feeling I'd never be rid of it.\n\nAnd so I was not. From that day forward, I couldn't spend a week without getting harassed by the Loch Ness Monster. Fear turned to anger as girl scouts priced their oatmeal and raisin cookies at 'tree-fiddy'. Anger turned to hate as the total receipt for my groceries turned up to 'about tree-fiddy', according to the cashier. And finally, after I screamed and got arrested for trying to beat up a vending machine for pricing my coffee at $3.50, I realised that I had suffered long enough.\n\nThe first thing I did was call my son. Ignoring the various texts asking for 'tree-fiddy', I called him up and said I was going to join a gym.\n\n\"Uh, Dad? You're *fifty four*,\" he had said.\n\n\"Not too late, is it?\" I didn't need to be Arnold Schwarzenegger. I just needed to be fit enough to do what I had planned. In the end, Joe caved and signed me up for a gym membership.\n\nThat was a year ago. One whole year I waited, bided my time, tolerating the abuse of the Loch Ness monster. I was careful to keep the motions going, yelling \"I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE MONEY! LEAVE ME ALONE!\" at it sometimes, throwing the money at its face in other times, just to make sure it suspected nothing. I even assaulted the vending machine a second time when it seemed too long since it had asked me for money.\n\nI had a plan. A plan to get rid of the Loch Ness monster for good. Admittedly it's not a very good plan, but the alternative is going mad in a padded cell whispering 'tree-fiddy' into a puddle of drool.\n\nWell, fuck that. Tonight's the night it ends.\n\nI had gotten reservations for the two of us at a restaurant downtown. It's our anniversary, see. Me and Martha got dressed up like we were going to meet the President, and walked all the way there, talking and telling jokes like we did when we were young. The food was good but not great, though to be fair, after growing old on Martha's cooking nothing's ever good enough. We chatted, wondered how our kids were doing, decided we should call them tomorrow, and walked home.\n\nAbout halfway there, it struck.\n\n*continued*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428470498", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

He walked up from the shadows in front of us, stopped us and as expected, said, \"I need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nMartha threw her hands up to her face, whispering \"Oh Lord, oh lord,\" to herself. I merely smiled. I turned to her and said, \"Martha, go on back home, dear.\"\n\n\"But that's that scary Loch Ness Monster that's been bothering you!\"\n\n\"I'll handle this, Martha. Walk, don't run now. Go on.\"\n\nMartha paused, looking at me and then at the monster, then back at me, then hurried home, whispering to herself. I kept my eyes on the scaly mesozoic era reject. After I could no longer hear Martha's footsteps on the sidewalk, I put my hand in my pocket, gripping what I had in it tightly.\n\n\"So, Loch Ness monster.\"\n\n\"I need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\n\"Of course you do,\" I pulled the knife out. \"I've got it right here.\" I leapt at it with a speed only a years' worth of constant training could have allowed a fifty five year old man, bellowing a guttural cry of all the anguish and pain it had caused me over the years.\n\n\"RRRRAAAAARRRRGGGHHH!!!\"\n\nBefore he could even register what was going on, I had my knife buried to the hilt in its eye. It thrashed around, yelling at me that I was 'not cool man' and that I was a 'busta'. I ignored it and pulled the knife out from its eye socket, the injured organ spouting hot maroon satisfaction. I stabbed it again, and this time a jet of foul black ichor rewarded my rage. Again and again I stabbed it, its howls of pain and torture like sweet music to my ears. Long dark tentacles reached up and tried to pry me off of him but those too I hacked away, stabbing like a man possessed by the devil himself. As its howls stopped and its giant crustacean corpse lay motionless on the sidewalk, the centerpiece to a work of obscene art, drowing in a pool of bubbling black blood, I kept stabbing, keeping count under my breath.\n\n\"Three forty eight...three forty nine...*three fifty*.\"\n\nI stopped, the entirety of my being drenched physically by its blood, spiritually by relief and satisfaction. I stared at my manxome foe, at its long saurian neck cut to ribbons, its scales ripped out and scattered on the sidewalk like autumn leaves in the fall, its heart exposed in the middle of its body, no longer beating at two forty three. I stood, and pocketed the knife. I spat on its lifeless corpse and said to it, \"There's your 'tree-fiddy', monster.\"\n\nI walked back to take a shower, and for the first time since our vacation to the United Kingdom, I sang. I went to see Martha in our bedroom after, and I kissed her and hugged her and told her I loved her, and that the scary Loch Ness monster would never ask us for money again. We went to bed finally able to sleep in peace.\n\nThe next day I was sitting on the porch, staring out into the beautiful blue sky, wondering how the mere absence of the hated creature could make the sky so clear again. Martha set down a cup of coffee in front of me, and I thanked her by giving her a big sloppy kiss. She reminded me that I needed to go get some more sugar from the store if I wanted my coffee like that ever again. I nodded and continued to enjoy my perfect day.\n\nSuddenly I heard the squealing of bicycle tires, and looked down at my mailbox to see the paperboy standing in front of it. I called out to him.\n\n\"Hello! You want me to renew my subscription?\"\n\nThe young boy nodded, and called back. \"Yes, please!\"\n\nI chuckled to myself. I was glad the young people of today knew the value of hard work. Whoever this boy's parents were, they raised him right. I got up and walked down to the mailbox where the boy stood.\n\n\"So how much is it?\"\n\n\"About tree-fiddy.\"\n\nMy heart stopped and I stared at the boy, his features morphing from human to a horridly familiar face. The same red eyes I had stabbed, the same yellow teeth I had fought off, and the same scaly skin I had cut to pieces. My mouth fell open, and I staggered backward away from the monstrosity.\n\n\"H...how?\" was all I could say.\n\n\"Can't get rid o' me that easy, busta man,\" it said, extending a tentacle towards me, uttering again those hateful words I thought I had forever extinguished;\n\n\"I need about tree-fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428470506", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If OP just appeared with a PS3 instead of what they asked for, then it's slightly dickish.\n\nNot so dickish that I wouldn't have pulled it myself as a kid though ;)\n\n\nTo OP: doing well on games so far (I hope you can still get Borderlands parties online). Two of my favorite games on the console to recommend are actually remade PS2 games. \n\nThe first is the *ICO* and *Shadow of the Colossus* bundle. *Shadow* is the stronger of the two, but both are top-tier adventure/puzzle/platformer games that you will never forget, beautifully reworked for HD, all for about $10. \n\nThe other is *Okami*. Again this is an HD makeover of a PS2 game. Unfortunately, they never released an NA version on disc so you will have to go through the Playstation Store and pay whatever they are asking. If you are a fan of the *Zelda* games, you must not miss *Okami*. Same mix of adventure with light-RPG elements and all the attendant puzzles, dungeons and bosses. The art style is based on traditional Japanese watercolor and woodblock. Strong contender for the coolest looking game ever with fun combat and very creative puzzle elements.\n\n*Fallout 3* was one of my favorites of the whole generation. Don't forget *Skyrim* and *Oblivion*!\n\n*Street Fighter IV* is a must for fighting game fans and is probably sitting in the nearest bargain bin to you for about tree fiddy.\n\n*Red Dead Redemption* wasn't worth full price when I bought it, but it's worth whatever it's selling for now.\n\n*Far Cry 3*, *Demon's Souls*, *Dark Souls*, *MGS4*, *GRID*.\n\nAnother insane bang for your buck, the *God of War* collection which includes all 3 main titles plus the two mobile games, all playable on the PS3 itself, all for ten bucks.\n\nNote on the Playstation Store: use a different password than you use elsewhere and never forget your login credentials.

One time I had enough so when I saw him getting out of the pool looking at me, I went over and asked him what the hell his problem was. Right away I could tell he wasn't from around here, probably a foreign exchange student cause he had some sort of thick British accent. He said he just thought I was cute and he liked the way I swam. I had to give it to him, the accent was sexy and I liked his honesty. For the next couple weeks I didn't see or hear from him, but then one day as I got out of the pool he seemed to be waiting by the locker room for me and when I got there he asked if I wanted his snake. I was so confused I just stared at him.

{"body": "This is a little bit of neither, but is the best cheating-related story I have.\n\nThe configuration of our classroom is pretty stupid, with three giant tables that all the students sit at--so you can easily see 5 other tests from the average seat.  So when I give a test, I have them open their laptops with the screens facing me, which makes it a bit harder to see neighboring tests.  I also give them four separate tests--same questions, just mixed around.  \n\nSo we recently took a test on causal web diagrams.  On one of the sections, you're given four bubbles that say A, B, C, and D.  You just have to draw the arrows between the bubbles according to the instructions.  It's pretty simple in theory but the vocab trips most people up-- they have to figure out how to draw things like correlation, mediation, feedback loops, etc.  Overall, my curve on the test is good (not great), in case you were wondering. \n\nAnyway, just with the four bubbles, there are at least a hundred different ways to draw arrows for four bubbles given all permutations.  I tell them this, making a point of the fact that there's only one or two correct answers, so if they happen to give the same WRONG answer as someone else nearby, it will be obvious that they copied.  \n\nI tell you, it's ridiculous.  I've got arrows going every which way-- some of them don't even land on a bubble.  I'm not talking about a wrong answer, I'm talking about an IMPOSSIBLE answer.  The kind of answer that barks \"I have no idea what I'm doing\".  I breath a sigh of lamentation and keep grading.  Looky here, I see the exact same gibberish.  What are the odds?  Oh, and wow, they sit right across from each other.  I write \"See me.\"\n\nThe worst part is having to confront students about cheating.  I tell them what the consequences are, and that both students will receive the consequences if neither admit the fault.  I realize it's not entirely fair (with a mention of how it's not fair to me either, wasting my time and putting me in an impossible position), but it's the best we can do.  The lesson for the person who didn't cheat will have to be to guard your answers more carefully.  Then I hope that someone speaks up, and point out that the punishment for them will be the same regardless--it's just a question of whether they take an innocent person down, too.  \n\nUnfortunately, most have more pride than integrity.  They twist in the wind to come up with a plausible explanation, or sometimes they try to save face by saying, \"I didn't do it, but I'll take the blame.\"  Oh, that one is just my favorite.  So you didn't do it, but you want to take the punishment, let the other person off, and not have anyone actually believe that it wasn't you.  Nash's equilibrium will be thrilled about this new discovery in social dynamics.  This discovery is sure to get me tenured someday.\n\nSo I've seen some students overreact about accusations of cheating, but one day this girl comes in WITH A GUN.  And she starts telling me about how the other girl must have cheated off of her, and how her 4.0 is ruined and if she doesn't get into the program she wants she may as well die.  I'm just completely floored and no idea what to do because A) gun in my room, and B) how can I possibly talk this girl down when she will surely be expelled or put in a psych ward?  There is nowhere to go from here but down, down, down.  So I tell her to relax, we'll figure this out, put the gun away and let me just get your test from the other room... and I am OUT of there.  \n\nI call security and explain the situation and they're asking me if I feel like I'm in danger.  I... don't know?  They say to try to get her to put the gun away if I don't feel like I'm in danger.  I'm kind of taken aback because I wasn't expecting to be part of the solution here (this doesn't seem like the protocol), and also feeling kind of guilty for wanting to have nothing to do with this.  For the next three minutes I am just paralyzed by uncertainty.  Do I take off, clearing the building in case this girl becomes homicidal, or do I just casually stroll back in and talk to her?  I could say it was a mistake, or that the other girl already confessed, or just try to talk her down and convince her that it's really not the end of the world.  Now I'M the one twisting in the wind and in the moment cheating on a test feels like the most innocent thing in the world.\n\n  Finally, after what felt like the longest three minutes of my life, the security guard arrives.  Finally someone who will know what to do, I want to believe, but I know that this person is probably as caught off guard here as I am.  He's got that feral, high alert look in his eyes, which gives me no comfort.  He comes up to me and asks if I'm the one who called it in.  Yes, I say, and I have no idea what to do.  I explain this whole situation to him.  He's still wide-eyed through the whole explanation, but nodding his head, and then he says, \"Okay, sir, just relax.  We've already called in a specialist who should be here soon.  Right now we just need to ensure everyone's safety.  First, I'm going to need about tree fiddy.\"  I'm not very good at ending stories, so this is what I'm reduced to.

I had been pounding Yeager-bombs all night and I was *seriously* pumped about my new haircut. I knew this was going to be a good night. Hell I was even wearing my work khakis still. Anyway I lock eyes with this girl... She's mesmerizing. She looks completely sober even though I see all of her empties. I have no idea how she is keeping up with the rest of this bar.     \n\nSo she decided to make the first move. I guess she tried to figure out what I was drinking and come over with one to start a conversation. She guesses fucking wrong. I'm drinking Yeager-bombs and she brings me a fucking Long Island Iced Tea. She starts FREAKING OUT. She's jumping up and down angry and immediately grabs the drink back, gives me a sloppy hug with a sorry and spills half of it on my shirt. I'm kind of shocked and kind of glad she didn't get it on my fresh gelled hair or it would totally have been ruined, guy. But I say, \"Nah girl it's alright I'll drink it\", because I'm a broke ass college kid you know? Now this is where it gets good, stay with me here. I'm not trying to be a douche or anything but I am not being subtle that I'm really into this girl. I might have had a half chub at this point. Seriously considering my options at this point, I take a break in the bathroom. Leaned up against the sink staring into my blue eyes unblocked by my new haircut I start thinking about the Yeager-bombs I pounded earlier. *\"Am I gonna puke?\"* No... **Not now chief, I'm in the fucking zone.** Back to the bar I go. She's still there. Sitting with a female friend of hers. She waves me over and looks like she wants to introduce us.    \n\nShe then looks at her friend... Who is... fucking hot. She whispers something behind a hand to her and then they both smile at me seductively. I'm sweating fucking bullets here now Batman. They are both walking towards me now and that's when I notice... the girl I was chasing all night was not a girl at all. She was a 6 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era! I always knew that damned Loch Ness monster wanted my ass.

{"body": "Have you ever heard of Kwajalein? It's a little atoll in the middle of the Pacific. It's most well known for being the site of a [battle in WWII.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kwajalein)\n\n\nIt's an 8 hour flight from Hawaii, which is the closest sizable land mass. This place is in the middle of nowhere like nothing you know. You think your little hick town is backwater? Nothing compared to Kwaj. I think they have like 15 cars on the whole island. It's beautiful though.\n\n\nEverything on the island has to be imported. Pretty expensively too I might add. So when there was a call to do a quality assurance check on the vending machines there, I was all over it. I mean they're not gonna send someone from the mainland to restock a vending machine *really*. That's what the rest of these stories have wrong. They'll just contract someone local to do it, as it's way cheaper. But every once in awhile they need to send someone out to make sure everything is on the up-and-up. That's where I come in. \n\nIt was a 20-hour flight. It was so far away, it was actually faster to fly to *Japan* first over the arctic circle, then fly from Japan to Kwaj. Which was fine for the first leg, because ANA is the tits. On a side note, if you're ever flying in Asia and get a chance to go ANA, do that shit. It's quality goods. But the second leg was on some bullshit puddle-jumper because nobody goes to Kwaj.\n\n\nAnyway, I get there and everything seems to be fine. The machines work, even if they're a bit dated. Except they've got this pool, and apparently the vending machine by the pool was being stocked with some knockoff brand from Papua New Guinea. And instead of putting in the money yourself, you had to go to some pool attendant and pay *him* to get your soda. So, to see how this worked, I decided to give it a go. I went up to the pool attendant and asked him for a pop (I call it pop, if you don't like it you can fuck right off) and asked him how much he was. He told me it'd be \"about tree-fiddy.\" It was about that time that I realized the pool attendant was a 500ft tall Crustacean from the Mesozoic era! Godammit Loch Ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy. \n\n\nI realized at that point it wasn't worth my time to make waves. The locals were happy, the pool was making money, and the company I was doing QA for didn't care that much about one soda machine. So I played around for another day or two (after a couple of days on Kwajalein you run out of things to do) and went home. Like I figured, nobody cared about one soda machine that was selling pop from Papua New Guinea.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428533832", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 15, "controversiality": 1}

He closed the trunk with a sigh and strolled out of the room, looking over his shoulder to make sure I was following him. I took the hint because I didn't want to get in trouble. He unlocked a door at the other end of the hallway. He turned on the lights to reveal it want downstairs to a basement. Nervous, I followed him down. \n\nThe basement terrified me. There were instruments on the wall that I had only seen in dentist's and the doctors offices. There was an operating table and a screen, which I assumed was for an X-Ray, although I didn't see an X-Ray machine.\n\nWhile I was taking a better look at my surroundings, he snuck up behind me and shoved me down into a chair. He ran to the wall and grabbed one of the instruments and shambled towards me. I started to shriek in the way that young kids do. I screamed, \"What do you want from me?!\"\n\nHe looked me dead in the eye, and I swear I will never forget these words.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time that I realized this man was eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic Era. I ran out of there so fast the Flash would be jealous. I threw open that sliding glass door and sprinted over that dog. I thank my lucky stars he was sleeping. I jumped halfway up that fence and climbed even faster when I heard that goliath bark at me. \n\nAs I regained my breath, I saw that my friends were playing a game of tag over by the picnic table. One of them noticed and shouted. Everyone looked over to me and started running toward me \n\nI heard the shouts of \"Where were you?\" and \"You were gone so long!\" I only wish I had a ball to return with. I told everyone the story. My parents embraced me and gave me a lecture on never to go somewhere without their permission.

She wasn't sweating she was MELTING!\n\nIn a panic she ripped the covering away and jumped from the bed.  Slipping partly due to the spilt water and also because she was MELTING.\n\nShe gasped and began struggling for air.  Her organs were attacking...'the dream..it was real'...The thought was quickly squashed by her logical side. 'No Laura its still a dream...you hit the bottle pretty hard tonight...we said no more Tequila...'\n\nShe closed her eyes and tried to reign in her breath.  For a moment she began to relax. Her heart beat slowed and breaths came easier.\n\nThen her eyes shot open as if on there own. 'I'M POSSED!' she screamed, as her body rose clumsily. Knowing Mrs.Cattermole next door was sound asleep on her stock pile of 'ludes, and would never hear her.  \n\n'I've done it..this is the end..' Laura realized.  Standing fully erect now, arms spread eagle in her bedroom.  \n\nTo her amazement her heart beat remained calm her breathing steady.  She was in shambles mentally and yet would seem almost serene to any onlooker. Albeit in a strange stance.\n\nWithout warning her skin dropped to the floor.  Laura caught her reflection in the mirror.  Had her organs not been in control she would have gone into shock.  \n\nShe watched against her will as her skin rose taking shape.  Michelangleo spoke 'Laura...as I said...I made YOUR decision.'\n\nWith that her organs seeped from her and melded into the skin.  The skin crawled and rippled as it set into its chosen form.  Then began to change colors and textures.  Rain began hitting the window pane..thunder rolled in the distance.  The lights flickered then went out.\n\nAfter a moment lightning flashed, and light streamed through the open curtains. Before her eyes left her they bore her witness to a huge creature, this giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era.\n\nShe was so scared. 'Lord have mercy' she thought..'What on Earth is this creature?'\n\nIt stood above her with these big red eyes...'Oh this is so scary'..she thought.

{"body": "I stock vending machines for a living and have done since I was fifteen, some fifty five years ago now.\n\nI was out in the outback, a way out from Queensland in the 80s filling up, cleaning, taking the cash, and changing the prices for a vending machine for Coke. It was a really long drive out, probably around 4 hours (3:50 - 4.20 if my memory serves me correctly). It was getting late but it was my last site of the day and fortunately it was on the way back for my route.\n\nI'll tell you now, this site was really odd. Always had struck me as strange but I could never quite work out what. It was in the middle of a huge sandstone rock, elevated away from anything else and kind of a nightmare to get to. Couldn't for the life of me think who would use it, especially considering how far out it was, but it was always emptied from products on a daily basis and usually had around AUD$350 in cash.\n\nI turned up at the site and took a look at it, it was slightly vandalised but nothing awful. Cleaned the graffiti off and filled it up, took out all the cash, then changed the prices to be in line with inflation at the time, I think a Coke was around AUD$3.50 and a Mountain Dew around $4.20.\n\nI packed up my gear and hopped back in the truck, drove down to the base of the site, and suddenly remembered I'd not locked the machine up. I did the 25 minute drive back up, got out my truck, and saw something. Something to this day I'm not entirely sure what it was, but I never want to see it again. I moved out of that area after this incident, but I digress.\n\nIt was dark brown with what looked like *fur* all over, turned around and looked at me, snarling. Suddenly, it dropped the can of Dr Pepper it was feeding on and let the joint fall out of its mouth and started sprinting towards me. I didn't have time to react, and it managed to snag my leg. I fell over, and all I remember between that point and waking up at the hospital was hearing the beast snarl at me \"tree... [indecipherable]... serious tag...\".\n\ntl;dr took somewhere between tree fiddy and 420 to get to a vending machine, changed the price to tree fiddy and 420, got chased by a monster blazing it up who then proceeded to mumble \"tree fiddy\" at me and OP should have used a serious tag", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428586846", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have told this story once before and was hesitant to do so. For those of you that have read my story before I'll ask that you refrain from replying to this comment so that others can give their opinion of me and my actions. Let my tale of lust serve as a cautionary tale to anyone who has ever thought about giving in to their primal urges...\n\nSo, around some time last year there was a thread somewhere in/r/Askreddit where a few people showed their faces to other redditors. I can't remember why they were doing it but they were posting photos of themselves and one girl was getting some attention. This girl was hot and everyone was saying how hot and/or pretty she looked and she seemed to enjoy the attention that she was getting from everyone. I have a habit of tagging a lot of redditors whenever I feel like it and I tagged this girl as \"hot girl\", left that thread, and went on my way to rack up some karma or do whatever it is that I do around here. I didn't remember that this girl existed until recently and couldn't have remembered her user name if I didn't come across her by complete chance in a thread somewhere else not too long ago. Just to be clear, I don't think that what I'm about to tell you could have happened to anyone else on reddit but me unless other redditors tag people as extensively and frequently as I do.\n\nAlmost a year later, I'm looking through an /r/AskReddit thread for a good time to comment and I come across a user that I have tagged as \"hot girl\" so naturally - being a young man who was a little drunk and a little bored - I decided to investigate further to see why I tagged this person as \"hot girl\" by looking at her links and comments. So I'm looking through the first couple pages of her comments and I still don't know or remember why I tagged her until I come across a photo of her that she posted to some subreddit. It's clear now why I tagged her as hot because she looks great and is easily a 9/10 on any given day of the week. I decide to scroll down a little farther and see that she has posted another photo of herself and for some reason, this is when it hit me: I have seen this girl's face in /r/gonewild. Now, I have never had something like this happen to me before where I stumble across something like this but I immediately felt this adrenaline rush because the account that I was looking at was not the account that this girl used to post to /r/gonewild. How do I know that this wasn't the same account that she used to post to/r/gonewild? I'll tell you how...\n\nAny man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants when it comes to girls that have gotten its attention and so we never forget any hotties that we have laid eyes on and the circumstances in which we laid eyes on them for the first time. You see, this girl wasn't just some run-of-the-mill /r/gonewild girl - she was one of the hottest gonewilders that I have ever seen post to reddit. This girl's posts hit the front page every single time that she posted and I still remember thinking to myself \"Whoa...this girl is insanely attractive\" when I saw her photos on the front page. For those wondering how I could match up this girl's selfie pics with her tits and ass I'll tell you why: she posted photos of her face on both accounts. Yes, she posted her face to /r/gonewild on her GW account and she posted photos of her face to the account that I was perusing when I came across her photographs after investigating why I had her tagged as hot. I remembered what her/r/gonewild user name was and so I quickly went to her acccount only to find that it had been deleted. I wasn't to be thwarted in my quest to be sure about the link between the 2 accounts so I googled her now defunct user name and looked around for links to the photos before I found the links that I was looking for. I was able to backtrace these deleted reddit links to her nude /r/gonewild photos and after searching frantically for the photo that she took of her face, I finally came across a comment that she left in one of her posts where she posted a verification photo of her with her face right next to the piece of paper verifying that she was indeed the account owner. I had her linked to both accounts but I decided that this was too interesting to let go right there and so I combed through her account to see if there was any information that could tell me who she was.\n\nIt turned out that this girl commented about what state she was from, gave some information about the high school that she graduated from, where she wanted to go to college, what her boyfriend's parents were like, and, most critically, what her first name is. I took her first name, what part of her state that she was from, and entered it into Google but nothing came up. I realized that I had to figure out what high school she went to so I searched for all of the high schools in the part of her state that she was from and used the information that she made on reddit to figure out which high school that she went to. I then entered in her first name, the name of the high school that I thought that she went to, and found her with her first and last name on a high school honor roll article. Her name isn't that popular and there were only a few other girls with it so I decided to google each one of them. After typing in the third girl's name, I knew that I had a match because her LinkedIn page that came up on google showed that she goes to one of the colleges that she said that she wanted to go to in one of her reddit comments. I got total confirmation when I came across her YouTube account and in the photo that she used for her account I saw the same face staring back at me that I saw in both the still existant and defunct reddit accounts. I now knew exactly who this girl was and decided to read more about her. I found out that she was incredibly intelligent, came from a well-to-do family, seemed destined for a successful and happy life, and that she seemed to be the very last type of girl that I would expect to post to /r/gonewild. I mean it when I say that it blew my mind that this girl of all people would have been so careless to show her face on /r/gonewild and think that no one might recognize her. What she can't really be faulted for is not thinking that someone would make the connection against all odds between her two reddit accounts but she made this more possible for me by being one of the most upvoted /r/gonewild posters that I had ever seen while also continuing to share photographs of her face in other parts of reddit long after she had deleted her/r/gonewild account. The thing about her is that she didn't post to/r/gonewild very long but when she did, the few photos that she posted always hit the front page and the guys in the comments section were going out of their minds asking her to post more.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you realize what would happen to a girl like this if anyone in her life from family, friends, school class mates, professors, work colleagues, etc. found out about her photos, saw them, and even came to possess them. I was able to find her Facebook page and was then able to find out who her family is, what street she lives on, who her friends are, how to contact all of them, where many of them live, and realized that if I wanted to, I could show these photos of her to just about everyone in her life and could bring her world crashing down at any time that I wanted to. After much deliberation and many drinks, I decided to contact this girl to see what she thought about me knowing about her identity and her/r/gonewild photos. I shouldn't need to mention to anyone that this girl was insanely open to being extorted by me for whatever I wanted and money and more naked photographs of her was something that I couldn't stop thinking about.\n\nI managed to find her college e-mail account and sent her an anonymous e-mail telling her that she doesn't know me but she needs to talk to me. Within one hour, she sent me back an e-mail asking who I am and what am I talking about and I responded by listing her two reddit accounts and her full name. I also attached the photos that she took of herself on her one account with the verification photo from her/r/gonewild account where she showed her face. I didn't receive an e-mail back from her until nearly 24 hours later. In this e-mail, she asked me who I was again, how I found out who she was and found her photos, and why I contacted her. I told her how I found the photos, that I was just an unknown redditor, and that I contacted her because I needed more photos from her or else I was going to bring her life crashing down if she didn't give me what I wanted within 1 week. She replied back asking me \"What do you want? Please, I don't want any trouble to come from this just please tell me what you need me to do so that no one ever sees those photos.\" I told her \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nWell, it was about that time that she realized that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Protoerozoic era. She sent a reply back saying, \"Dammit monstah! I ain't giving you no tree-fiddy!\"\n\nCredits to /u/red321red321\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428596191", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

He was essentially thrown on the street as a small child, and the only protection and education he received was from gang members and drug dealers.

Because that is the default position in science. The null hypothesis. Nothing exists until someone makes a claim to it's existence and brings some evidence for proof of it. Each claim is judged by it's evidence.\n\nSee Russell's teapot. There certainly COULD be a teapot orbiting Mars right now but unless and until someone presents some damn good evidence for it's existence, it is pretty safe for us all to accept it as a fact that there isn't one there. The same can be said for supernatural claims of the Yeti, Bigfoot, the Loch ness monster, reincarnation, the Force, Odin and Thor, Shiva and Vishnu, Allah or Yahweh. Does there exist evidence that 100% proof-positive that these things don't exist? No. But the burden of proof is on the person making the claim, not on the person holding the null hypothesis as fact. \n\nRight now, you could invent any crazy un-falsifiable thing with mystic properties and ascribe it some non-zero probability of it existing but that doesn't grant any credence at all to the proposition of it actually existing in the real world and you shouldn't lose respect for someone who considers it a known fact of the universe that your non-falsifiable thing-you-just-made-up, factually, does not exist.\n\nPS: I hope that didn't come off as stern or crazy was trying to educate, not lecture. :) ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428609561", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was in fact an accident! Not a literal accident, but more of a metaphorical one. Buckle up, this may take a moment. \n\nThere I am, back in high school going about my normal day. I'm a fairly attentive person, so believe me, I had my suspicions as to who dealt and who used various drugs. In a small town, there was no reason for the 'cool' kids to interact with the 'dark, shadowy' kids unless of course, the latter provided the former with something that rhymes with rugs. So of course, I had an idea. Now, I had just started at a gas station in town, and saw many locals come and go, and interact (I'm still not sure if the bathroom was a drop-off for larger transactions or not). Anyway, this guy comes in who I recognized from school, and I said 'Hey, you go to [redacted], right?' He says yeah, and carries on, asking for some ZigZags. Since I'm pretty new, and because it's the law, I ask for ID, and he's 18, so that was good. But he didn't quite have the $2.17 in change for the papers (almost had $2). Being the nice guy I am, I said, go ahead, I'll cover the rest, but you owe me. He replies rather enthusiastically and says if I ever need something, just let him know, and he writes his number down. \n\nNow this is huge in my innocent-ish brain. Do I text? Do I say what's up? Or do I get straight to the point? What are fair market prices? What if I die? What if two marijuanas is too much? Crazy thoughts in hindsight, but something made me text him and say whats up? He said if I'm looking for something, come over, and gives his address. Now, this is a small town, so I say, sure, I'll stop by after I'm off of work! I go over, and he thanks me for the papers earlier, and invites me in. I tell him I've actually never tried anything before, and he says well, he just sells weed. He then proceeds to roll a joint, and lights up. He passes it over saying inhale then just smoke it out. I do that and fall into a coughing fit as anyone who remembers their first time smoking will recall. After that, things seemed fairly normal actually, I was a bit more at ease and things were going pretty well! As I had just come from work, I hadn't any money to actually buy something, but he said, \"It's fine man, you helped me out earlier. Just give me tree fiddy.\" Startled, I said \"What?!\" He said again, \"Can you just give me tree fiddy?\" It's at this moment I realize that this isn't a drug dealer! It's in fact a giant 8 story tall Loch Ness monster! I say dammit monster! You ain't gettin no tree fiddy from me! Leave me alone! Just because I spot you some cash for papers doesn't mean you have the right to ask me for more! \n\nTL;DR: High school was small, knew everyone (including drug dealers). Never had a dealer though.

{"body": "Nah, Tsar is too stupid for either side. Rasputin has a Piece of Eden, only the plot twist is that he actually is one himself. Anastasia realized something was strange and started piecing things together and eventually befriends both an Assassin and a Templar, not knowing the background of either one.\n\nBy the time Anastasia makes sense of it all and the two friends realize that they're both on opposing sides the Revolution reaches full swing. Both the Assassins and Templars are behind the scenes in the revolution, working to control it. The Templar turns in the royal family to his masters on the promise that they, and Anastasia, will be kept safe. The Templars turn out to be lying, and when he realizes this the Templar friend flees to the Assassin Friend so they can unite to save Anastasia and the royal family.\n\nThe Assassins are too late for the Tsar, but manage to save Anastasia, who the Templars had kept alive to torture for information on the secretly still alive Rasputin. Unluckily the Assassin's don't free Anastasia. They simply continue to try and use her, just like the Templar did.\n\nBut it gets worse. Assassin Friend is ordered to kill Templar Friend despite his part in saving Anastasia from the Templars, simply because he's a loose end. In reality it's also a test of loyalty. In an (outright stated) reference to Les Miserables Assassin Friend lets Templar Friend go while pretending to kill him, telling Templar Friend to rescue Anastasia and get as far away as possible.\n\n\nThe Assassins, now convinced of Assassin Friend's loyalty, allow him into the inner circle. It is now that he realizes that the Assassins have become too radical, violently advocating actual anarchism and the end of all governments by any means necessary. He discovers they killed Franz Ferdinand to purposefully start the Great War as a way to topple Europe's governments. He also discovers that they plan to use Rasputin's powers to deal the final blow to the world's nations, and that Anastasia has some mysterious connection to Rasputin, which is the only reason she remains alive, for now.\n\nHorrified, Assassin Friend helps Templar Friend in freeing Anastasia. In doing so his betrayal of the Assassin Order becomes obvious, leaving our three protagonists aligned against both Assassin and Templar.\n\nFinally they encounter Rasputin, who reveals that he is much older than thought and has used his power to possess a new body each time an old one dies for hundreds of years. The new bodies? Each time his own child, their own soul snuffed out and replaced with his own.\n\nIt is at this point it all comes together. Anastasia is secretly, and unknown to herself, Rasputin's bastard daughter.\n\nOur three heroes manage to stop Rasputin's ritual in the nick of time. As Anastasia drives a blade into the man he laughs, saying that you can't contain power like his and it's too late to stop the transfer once he dies. Anastasia, however, manages to use another Piece of Eden to two the dying Rasputin's soul while the power ends up hers. The game ends on cliffhanger, with our three heroes standing on the edge of an uncertain future and Anastasia finally accepting that she can't run from her destiny, and that it's time for her to take charge.\n\n\nAs it fades out, however, she turns to her friends and says she needs only one more thing from them. About three-fiddy. Only now does the player realize that Anastasia has been a 300 foot tall reptile from the Paleolithic era the whole time.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1428704236", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am an atheist because I have never been convinced to be a theist.\n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nIf you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n\n*Additional links*  \n\nOn the claims Christianity;\n\nAside from the complete lack of evidence, a problem Christianity shares with other religions, I'd have to say a problem is the core belief of Christianity itself.\n\nThe completely unsubstantiated, second party blood 'sacrifice' atonement, by and to the same party, to make up for an alleged crime(original sin) committed by someone else before I was born, on penalty of eternal torture and damnation, amounts to little more than a spiritual mafia-style shake down that's a whole lot less appealing to an outsider than you might imagine.\n\nAn excellent analogy, [Kissing Hank's Ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaFZQBb2srM)\n\nThe Immorality of Christianity;\n\n[Evil Bible](http://www.evilbible.com/) has many references to the  immorality contained within the bible, including; [ritual human sacrifice](http://www.evilbible.com/Ritual_Human_Sacrifice.htm), [rape](http://www.evilbible.com/Rape.htm), [murder](http://www.evilbible.com/Murder.htm), [intolerance](http://www.evilbible.com/BiblicalIntolerance.htm), and [slavery](http://www.evilbible.com/Slavery.htm). \n\n[Christopher Hitchens: The Bible is Immoral](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyBS84i7KXs)\n\n[Matt Dillahunty: Christianity is an Immoral System](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz_ryHYc_Pc)\n\nOn the Inerrancy of the Bible;\n\n[Skeptic’s Annotated Bible’s list of biblical contradictions](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/contra/by_name.html).\n\n[Infidels.org's list of biblical contradictions](http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html).\n\n[NonStampCollector's video on biblical contradictions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3g6mXLEKk).\n\n[On the validity of the OT versus the NT](http://www.evilbible.com/do_not_ignore_ot.htm)\n\n[Scientific Errors in the Bible](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scientific_errors_in_the_Bible )\n\n[Wikipedia entries criticism, scientific &amp; historical issues of the Bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy#Scientific_and_historical_criticism )\n\nOn the historicity of Jesus;\n\nDid Jesus exist?

{"body": "Nessism is a polytheistic religion. It is the world's 357th largest religion, with exactly 210 adherents, collectively known as Nessists. Most Nessists believe that the Loch Ness Monster, from which their religion's name is derived, not only exists, but is one of saviors of humanity. They believe that Nessie is one of four God-like Dragon-Beasts, the others being the Hydra, the Basilisk, and the Cockatrice, who defeated the demonic monster Cthulhu and imprisoned him within the earth. They believe that all mythological and/or cryptozoological beasts exist and that most are minions of Cthulhu. They believe that 510 humans were chosen by the Dragon Beasts to help defeat Cthulhu. This is why they allow no more than 510 people in the two highest ranks of their church. They also believe that Cthulhu entrusted his work to the seven demonic princes who embody the seven deadly sins: the Square one (lust), Cancer the giant crab (greed), Sheldon the Cyclops (envy), the Slug of death (gluttony), the Octosquidapus (wrath), the Squirrel (pride, controls all squirrels), and Doom's Eye (sloth). \n\nAccording to the book of Nessism, the Mighty Tome of Doom (dun dun dun), the universe was created 100,000,000,000 years ago out of the remains of the previous universe, random objects floating around in limbo, and cocaine. These objects combined to form Tim, the good God of Nessism. Tim was a giant Chinese dragon. Tim sat alone in limbo for forty billion years. He became bored, and observed other universes. Eventually, he used his mighty powers to create a universe. Unfortunately, in doing this, he was infected by extradimensional bacteria and got a cold. He started sneezing, and the planets formed. He got hungry and ate some cosmic clouds, then farted, creating the stars. He then decided to create life because he was lonely. His first creation was a purple taco named Jim. He then took a dump on the cosmic toilet, Uranus. Then he created galaxies because he was losing track of the planets. He created multiple planets with intelligent species, such as Canada, Mars, Boxland, Octagon, Blorkon, and Krypton. One day, approximately 500,000,000 years ago, Tim passed a kidney stone. The kidney stone was Earth. It was a cube. On the Earth, he created goats as the dominant species, but goats are stupid, so he created more species until he finally created dinosaurs. The dinosaurs were very intelligent, and according to the Tome of Doom (dun dun dun), were actually called Dragons. Tim gave them the Fourteen Rules:\n\n1) You shall not eat each other\n\n2) Worship Me.\n\n3) You shall not drink of what is not lemons, water, or alcohol.\n\n4) You shall not reproduce with your own family\n\n5) You shall not dig holes\n\n6) You must get tattoos.\n\n7) You must eat coconuts ever Tuesday\n\n8) You shall not eat pigs. Pigs are cool.\n\n9) Or Goats, they're too dumb.\n\n10) Do not touch Shrimp. Shrimp are EVIL. So are tuna.\n\n11) Skeletons are Sacred. Do not misuse corpses.\n\n12) Ladies are in charge of marriage n stuff, not males.\n\n13) Males can only lead in army and worship.\n\n14) You shall avoid triangles, hexagons, and trapezoids. \n\nFour very powerful dragons named Nessie, Hydra, Basilisk, and Cockatrice followed the Fourteen rules very well. Tim gave them special powers and made them the Dragon Beasts. Unfortunately, the other dragons were wiped out by a giant killer trapezoid sent by Cthulhu, the evil God of Nessism. In retaliation, Nessie created the monkeys. Monkeys were very stupid. One day, a monkey named Albert fell out of a tree into a volcano. His tail melted off and his fur burned off. As he lay dying, the Dragon beasts revived him as a person. Jeff then went back to his tribe and he and his girlfriend, Emma, made more humans. In 10,000 B.C., Cthulhu emerged from an interdimensional portal and sent the Canadians from the planet Canada to attack Mars, killing the Martians and freezing the water. They blew up Krypton and sent the Seven Demonic Princes to attack Earth. The Dragon Beasts combined their mystical attacks into a giant rainbow blast that injured the Demonic Princes, but were themselves grievously injured. The Dragon Beasts gathered an army of 510 humans and told them to defeat the Demonic Princes. They grabbed the Demonic princes and held them down while the Dragon Beasts drowned them. Then a surviving piece of the planet Canada, which was destroyed in the skirmish, landed above what is now the U.S., becoming the country Canada. The Tome of Doom states that it is easy to tell if someone is actually an extraterrestrial aggressor sent by Cthulhu if he/she has the verbal tic of saying \"eh\" at any time. Oddly for a religion, Nessism has no doomsday prophecy. Nessists believe that whatever happens, happens,though some of it may be Cthulhu's fault. \n\nNessists can be easily identified through their strange behavior. There are five ranks in the Nessist community. Prospects are the lowest rank. They are required to shave their heads and wear domino masks and beer hats. Once they recruit fifteen prospects, they become students. Students are forced to get a tattoo of a stylized dragon directly above their rectums and wear pans on their heads. To advance to the next rank, they must cover the house of a politician with toilet paper. Then they are eligible for The Test, which involves fighting an elder member by slapping him/her with a fish and wandering through a huge maze. Then they become Members. Members can advance to the rank of Elite if an Elite dies, leaves Nessism, or is promoted to the highest rank, Knight, of which there are only ten of at a time, one of whom being the High Priest. There is one exception to this process, which is being the child of a Member. Full-fledged Nessist Members wear metallic masks at all times. All Elites and Knights wear similar masks, but made from copper and lined with gold and tin foil, except for High Priest Barnabus Stevens, who wears a golden robe and carries a staff. Each mask is adorned in symbols that represent a person's accomplishments in life. Knights can be distinguished from Elites because they have a Roman numeral on their mask representing which number of the Ten Knights they are and because they wear armor and carry swords. Nessists gather every Tuesday at the High Priest's \"palace\" in an alley in the small town of Brightrock, Wyoming, where they worship the Loch Ness monster and share stories of monster sightings. Nessists worship services consist of the High Priest reading aloud from the Nessist religious text, the Tome of Doom, followed by thirty minutes of prayer to Tim and the Dragon Beasts, and then a meal of lobster and steak. Nessists are only permitted to drink whiskey, water, beer, lemonade, Apple cider, and soup. Nessists often camp out in woods near a monster sighting, attempting to catch and slay the monsters by throwing Molotov cocktails and then attacking with scythes. Nessists have the polygamous belief that a female is allowed to choose three spouses, of no particular gender, as long as at least one is male. Nessists are often seen protesting the use of fossil fuels, which they claim are made from the bodies of dragons, and as such only drive purely electric vehicles. In addition to that, they protest Canada's continued existence. Nessists also must walk four miles each day for no particular reason. They are trained in martial arts since age 5. The only time they are allowed to remove their masks is when they are eating, drinking, at a worship service, at an airport, or at Loch Ness. Nessists are required to go commando. \n\nNessism started in 1989 when conspiracy theorist Jerry Voyage had his face severely scarred by a car crash and was arrested for driving under the influence. His cell mate was Barnabus Stevens, a college crackhead who had been arrested for brutally attacking a fellow student who claimed that Cthulhu wasn't real. The two were upset about people insisting that monsters weren't real and, in a drug addled state, put together their own religion overnight. They claimed that Nessie appeared to them and told them to gather the 510. Jerry put on the first Nessist mask the following morning. Once released from jail, they immediately began spreading the Word of Nessie. Most people didn't listen, but then Barnabus set up Nessism.monstersarereal.org, and forty two people joined the Nessist religion within a few months of the first post. For a few years, things went well. Jerry and Barnabus were the two heads of organized Nessism. Unfortunately, Barnabus received far more attention than Jerry, who began to get jealous. On November 26, 2004, Jerry challenged Barnabus to a duel to the death. The two met at the edge of the Grand Canyon, the fabled spot where the Dragon Beasts imprisoned Cthulhu inside the Earth. They attacked each other with swords. After two hours of fighting, Jerry was arrested for attempted murder, drug use, and criminal negligence. He is still in prison to this day.\n\nThere is little known about the public's opinion of Nessists, as few people are familiar with them. Only on three occasions have people become aware of their existence. One time was when Jerry was arrested and was put on trial for his crimes. The second time was when the Nessists protested the opening of an oil pipeline. The third time was when a Nessist named Howard Fredrickson was arrested for aggravated assault after he reacted violently to being asked to remove his mask at an airport, after which the \"take off your mask at airports\" rule was implemented.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428773145", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

As you probably already know, I just broke up with so and so, and I know that you already have an interest in me, which truly does flatter me considering that you are an awesome guy.  But I just wanted to let you know that I currently don't have mutual feelings, or feelings for anybody for that matter.   I've been in your shoes and I've sometimes seen these situations as opportunities and I've had some pretty awkward moments trying to make them so.  So, I wanted to just give you a heads up in case that was in your heart, because I wouldn't want to see a good friend hurt from making an attempt and ending up hurt, and potentially degrading such a good friendship. \n\nAlso, I know that this may seem a bit unfair for me to ask, considering what I just wrote, but I'm wondering, since I just broke up and in some areas, well... I'm now lacking what I was accustomed to getting in a relationship, and now I'm forced to fulfill this need in other ways which,well, are quite awkward, but I feel that,  considering you care about me so much, you would probably want me to come to you with this need before I came to any other man.  So here it goes...  Can I borrow tree fiddy?  I would really appreciate it and it would help me get over the loss of my previous relationship that much faster.

{"body": "A fight? Are you kidding me? Good lord, you are sensitive.\n\nNo, not anything of the sort. Let's go ahead and do this, friend.\n\nFirst off you come at me way out of left field with some nonsense about hostility to women. I have no part of that, don't really know what you're talking about.\n\n&gt; I live with someone who gets triggered. You know what? It's fucking awful, and not a joke. I get that you and everyone else thinks that Tumblr bloggers overuse the word \"trigger,\" but guess what: it's a real thing.\n\nI have also lived with someone who gets triggered. I'm unsure where you picked up that I was somehow unaware of PTSD or something in the 21st century, but hey what can you do. \n\nI'm also unsure where in the hell you got the impression that just because something, while very serious and very real, is somehow immune, in any way shape or form, to criticism, parody, satire, and any other brand of mockery, critique, or comment.\n\nI mean look, you even admit that you're full of shit when you go on to say point blank:\n\n&gt; I'm in the \"even rape is funny if the joke is good\" camp. Louis CK's jokes about rape are funny.\n\nThat statement is *absolutely incompatible* with your earlier sentiments. It just does not fucking compute.\n\n&gt; But you are not a stand-up comedian, and this is not a stage.\n\nBut here's where you go off the rails. For one thing... hey, yeah. I am a comic. You goofed and picked the one guy who actually has studied comedy on this subreddit or something. Good thing you didn't hang your entire argument on it, eh?\n\nAnd on the bit about this not being a stage? Get real, this is the biggest entertainment platform in history. Hell, the [Internet of Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) has the ability to put my comment on *billions* of devices that aren't even PCs or smart phones. There flat out is no greater stage than the interconnected world.\n\n&gt; \"I am so triggered right now\" isn't a funny joke.\n\nYou're right. \"I am so triggered right now\" is not a joke (I have no idea why you're adding the qualifier \"funny\" to it). It lacks all sense of comedy, there is no set-up/knockdown, no expectation to flip, there's no story at all. Why you're even getting all up in arms about a comment that isn't a joke is beyond me.\n\nOh, no wait here we go:\n\n&gt; You're not even making an actual joke, you're mocking something you don't understand.\n\nRight, you caught that bit about it not being an actual joke. But you did kind of miss the mark on your other interpretation. Mocking something I don't understand? I mean I feel I've reasonably established I understand it okay (you may disagree but it's not like I can cite a source).\n\nNo, no sir. Not mocking anything I don't understand, not making a joke.\n\nBut it was the setup to a pretty good joke! A joke you repeatedly ignored to continue on this tired tirade about how I don't know the first thing about comedy and how I'm just some hurtful guy being mean all over the place out of ignorance. Au contraire, I'm being mean all over the place out of entertainment!\n\nBut hey, I've only stood on stage and made real people laugh with comedic timing, proper set-ups, good knockdowns, call backs, act outs. I thought I knew how to spot a good joke and that I had a pretty decent sense of humor... but you... man. Let me tell you what, if I had known today that I would get to see a *master* of high comedy put on a *clinic* for me and just *break down just how unfunny of a joke the fucking setup of a joke is*... well shit, I might have worn something special for the occasion!\n\nLemme go ahead and do you this favor, I'll read you my joke again right in this comment.\n\n&gt; /u/TheDragonzord We have to draw the line somewhere, so I'd like to agree with Bill O'Reilly on that line being humans marrying turtles.\n\n&gt; /u/Boukish I am so triggered right now. I cannot believe you.\n\n&gt; /u/Cyanide_Storm See, that's hostile, though.\n\n&gt; /u/Boukish I... I...\n\n&gt; You're right. I'm sorry. I just can't get over people sometimes.\n\n&gt; I mean, I love my turtle. Love... my... turtle. There is nothing greater nor more majestic than watching that beautiful little girl munch on a piece of lettuce, or watching her nuzzle my hand pretending like she has feelings and isn't just testing to see if I'm food too.\n\n&gt; I won't stand idly by and watch the love of my life have her feelings hurt by some insensitive jerk insinuating that she can't consent to a legally binding contract just because she... she what? Can't talk? Can't express herself at all? Bullshit. She expressed herself all over my carpet last night. Turtles are very fucking expressive.\n\n&gt; I should have the right to marry my woman, in a church, in front of my family. But not hers. They... don't really keep in touch anymore. I don't think they approve, but she's pretty shelled up on the matter. I keep trying to break through but I think it's doing some lasting damage.\n\n&gt; Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, that guy's a jerk. I'm gonna go try and stick my dick in her shell before she bites me. Again.\n\nAlright so now I know a joke is terribly unfunny when it's explained, but I feel it would do the world a disservice if I let you continue walking around not really understanding how comedy works and going around half-cocked at people claiming they're making jokes when really some things are just flying right over your head.\n\nSo we begin with an absurd notion that the cut-off line for what is acceptable for humans to marry ends at \"turtle\". What comes between \"turtle\" and \"human\" is unknown but left up to the imagination; this lends comic effect. It's actually a pretty funny one-liner all on its own rights, props to TheDragonzord for the witty response.\n\nAfter this, I come in with a bait. I know full and well someone's going to respond to it and I'll get to do my funny bit, and sure enough someone does come along and respond to it. If you aren't following, this is the whole \"setup\" part that I was talking about before. Just so we're clear, again, \"I am so triggered right now. I cannot believe you\" is not a joke. It's not an \"unfunny joke\" either, because that implies you \"got the joke, it just wasn't funny\". You've pretty obviously shown you didn't get the joke.\n\nSo Cyanide_Storm comes along and drops the \"yo but that's hostile\" thing, pandering to the whole Tumblr schtick that you got all up in arms about presumably. Maybe that's what all that nonsense was that you were talking at me about hostility erroneously for? Now I get it. Anyway.\n\nSo then my joke starts. It's nothing great, I've done better, but it's pretty solid, a few good jokes and works well given the context of discussion and seemed pretty well received, so I'm content enough with it.\n\n&gt; I... I...\n\n&gt; You're right. I'm sorry. I just can't get over people sometimes.\n\n&gt; I mean, I love my turtle. Love... my... turtle. There is nothing greater nor more majestic than watching that beautiful little girl munch on a piece of lettuce, or watching her nuzzle my hand pretending like she has feelings and isn't just testing to see if I'm food too.\n\nWhat this bit does is it sets up the rest of the joke by establishing some frame of reference to lead you to believe that I am speaking truthfully. Comedy doesn't work without this basic set-up; if you know I'm pulling your leg from the get-go you're never going to laugh. This is basically the only comedic mechanic behind the entire tree fiddy meme.\n\n&gt; she what? Can't talk? Can't express herself at all? Bullshit. She expressed herself all over my carpet last night. Turtles are very fucking expressive.\n\nIf you didn't catch that, to \"express\" something is to purge liquid/air from something. The paragraph leads you to believe that I would make a case for my turtle being able to consent to a marriage contract, when in actuality I'm referring to my turtle urinating on my carpet. It's a pun, and it's ironic.\n\n&gt; I should have the right to marry my woman, in a church, in front of my family. But not hers. They... don't really keep in touch anymore. I don't think they approve, but she's pretty shelled up on the matter. I keep trying to break through but I think it's doing some lasting damage.\n\nThe bit here is that turtles don't tend to stay with their family later in life, and that I am mistaking the turtle's inability to communicate with simply being quiet on the matter. And then there is the reversal of expectations when I imply that I'm literally trying to break the turtle's shell, which is another example of comic irony.\n\n&gt; Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, that guy's a jerk.\n\nThis is a callback, designed to bring your frame of reference back to the setup (and out of absurdity)\n\n&gt;I'm gonna go try and stick my dick in her shell before she bites me. Again.\n\nOnly to then knock it down with an instance of comic irony by implicating that I'm trying to put my dick in a turtle's shell despite having previously been bitten by said turtle for attempting it before. This absurdity is funny.\n\nHopefully I've done a bit to help you understand what you missed the first pass through. We'll go back to addressing what you said, now that I feel I've comfortably addressed what I said.\n\n&gt; And mocking things that you don't understand is what children do, not adults.\n\nI'll forgive you for making this laughably hypocritical comment, because honestly it's just too perfect. I mean really, you get on your soap box and lambast me for my lack of understanding and my ignorance, an argument built *completely* upon your own lack of understanding and ignorance.\n\n&gt; So, can we stop using the word \"triggered\" as a joke?\n\nI'm sorry, no. You don't get to tell me how \"unfunny\" my jokes are and how \"funny\" Louis CK's rape jokes are just because one of them happens to pick at your personal sensitivities. \n\nYou want to talk disrespectful?

{"body": "&gt; it is \"stored\" while the passengers ascend\n\nunless they use the stairs to get back down, of course. then that potential energy won't be delivered back to the elevator's counterweight.\n\nIf you do this is enough , not only will the elevator's counterweight slowly lose mass over time (f=ma, e=mc^2), but the balanced system will eventually lose more mass than the elevator's motor can compensate for.\n\nIn the few rare cases where the accumulated energy/mass loss of an elevator's counterweight as a result of taking the elevator up and the stairs down resulted in the injury/death(s), 92% had fewer than four passengers\n\nThis should not really be a problem, as none of the incidents' weight capacity was broken.\n\nElevator engineers are well aware of this problem, but the elevator industry has colluded to prevent this message from being displayed to the public. The initial idea was to just put a sign in the elevator casually mention that passengers should go up and down an equal number of times. They concluded however, that in a significant percentage of passengers, the signs would induce anxiety. It is also assumed the passengers would be more likely to break the rule if it was posted, just to see what would happen. Also, if people knew they were riding potentially faulty elevators, they might worry and demand that elevators be banned until an acceptable solution is found.\n\nUnfortunately, the problem is rooted in the second law of thermodynamics. Suffice to say that the relative velocity of even a slow moving elevator induces time dilation effects which are directly proportionate to the amount of mass lost, and the mass of the passenger that took the stairs as another coefficient.\n\n\"So please, for the love of dog,\" I said. \"Please take elevators down every time you take one up.\"\n\nThe shady man next to me on the subway eyes me with contemplation on his face.

You can get fantastic insight into various aspects of peoples lives/the world without reading transcripts from movies, old jokes and tree fiddy bait and switches that occurs when the tag is not used. They are by far my favorite thing about this sub.\n\nThe problem is that it often filters out discussion that is on topic and interesting but doesn't fit exactly into the question.\n\nEg [Serious] Paramedics of reddit what Good Samaritan acts have you witnessed?\n\nThe person is obviously looking for stories and situations where people have done something amazing to help others in the face of adversity. The problem is stories that match what they are looking for but are second hand or from slightly different occupations eg:\n\n * LEO here and we are often first responders.....\n * My father worked as an ambulance driver and told me....\n * We had a horrible fire at work once and &lt;insert coworker act of bravery&gt;\n\nAnd would be fascinating to read are likely to get nuked.\n\nCan we have a tag that isn't as serious as [Serious] that redditors might recommend?\n\nNormally I would have considered the above behaviour as [Strict] and allow similar posts minus the jokes under [Serious] but I imagine the serious tag is ingrained into people now.\n\nMy suggestion would then be to perhaps have a tag like [ON TOPIC] that would filter out the jokes/trolls/stories from movies etc but still allow interesting discussion including short answers that would fall afoul of [Stories].", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428922445", "subreddit": "IdeasForAskreddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The fundamentalist christians have this thing where they believe that if you do not accept Jesus as your personal lord and savior, get born again into his love and get saved, then you are going to burn in hell. That's right, there is a special place full of fire and lava and brimstone where your soul will be sent to suffer and be tortured for all eternity by Satan himself, the evilist monster anyone can imagine.\n\nIf they truly believe this, then, from their point of view, it is imperative that they get every damn body saved. It's their ultimate bro thing to do, making sure to keep others from burning for all eternity. In fact, anybody who claims to be a christian and isn't trying to convert you to keep you out of hell, you should doubt the conviction of their beliefs. You believe in your heart that I'm going to suffer for eternity and you aren't trying to save me? What kind of asshole are you? \n\nAtheists, on the other hand, do not believe in gods or the devil or hell. From their point of view, believing in any of that stuff is like being an adult who still believes in Santa Claus. If your grown friend believed in the tooth fairy, for example, the bro thing to do would be to tell them that it's not real, you could maybe let them down gently, but the right thing to do would not be to play along. In that same vein, conversation among atheists about the tooth-fairyists might range from making fun, to full-on mocking. And this would be reasonable. Some among them who feel that many of the worlds problems are caused by religious fighting and tribalism, reserve a special hatred for religion as an oppressive and repressive tool of the powerful over the poor and the weak. Indeed, many people who have been deeply hurt in various ways by their former religions prior to becoming atheists and shunned after coming out. Yeah, they harbor resentment and possibly hatred. They, reasonably, would take a certain pleasure in communing with like-minded individuals to blow off steam and talk about their disbelief. That's /r/atheism in a nutshell. It might sound brutal at times but that's a reaction to the enormous shitstorm of religiosity and false piety that is out in the world. The rest of the world tells them they are going to hell, they just say they don't believe in hell. \n\nTo confuse the lack of belief expressed in that community with a religion would be a drastic misunderstanding of the \"belief\" of unbelieving. I put that in quotes to illustrate that the word is a misnomer. There is no believing happening by not believing in a bearded man in the sky watching your every move in the same way there is no believing happening by not believing in the tooth fairy. Nobody has made a church of not-believing-in-the-tooth fairy, or a temple for not-believing-in-bigfoot followers. There is no sacrament of there-is-no-loch-ness-monster which involves a complicated ritual of cleansing prior to bathing in water taken from the loch and nobody makes pilgrimages to the loch to declare their disbelief in nessie. There ARE books about atheism, but nobody holds them toward the sky to chant about their disbelief and nobody kisses those books before lovingly returning them to the bookshelf. Nobody has threatened holy war over burning those books. Nobody has been burned at the stake because they used Dawkin's name in vain and nobody has blown up a church in the name of atheism, to please their non-existing gods. Non-belief is just that, non-belief. Confusing that with a belief is erroneous.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428934147", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was first out of high school, I was hanging out around a bar near the local college campus a lot because they never checked ID's. This place was loaded with college aged girls and even a backwards loser like me was bound to get some action. So, after spending several nights trying to build up the courage to talk to some of the girls, the bartender (we'll call her Betty) started trying to get my courage built up. Betty was in her early 50s and looked really good for her age. I was pretty comfortable with her because I didn't see her in a sexual way. Betty started doing things like giving girls drinks and telling them that it was from me, and telling the girls about the cute single guy shooting darts alone. Betty and I really got a good friendship going and we started to hang out a lot more. One thing led to another and I ended up losing my virginity to Betty in her car in the alley behind the bar. I kind of avoided her for a few days, but finally went in to see her one night. I told her I was sorry and she said that it was no big deal, just sex, and we ended up doing it again that night. Betty and I continued to see each other, both at the bar and dates. After a month or so I started to get worried about being 18 and having a 53 year old girlfriend and that I would end up never meeting someone my own age, so I told Betty that we would have to end it. She was really cool about it and said that we were just friends with benefits, nothing serious. And she had a surprise for me, a girl from the bar named \"Suzie\" that had an awesome body had been asking about me. So the next night I show up to the bar and Betty brings Suzie over to talk to me. This is awesome, with the confidence I got from \"Mrs. Robinson\" I am finally able to talk to a hot young girl without tripping over my tongue. Betty mentioned that Suzie wanted to try a threesome, so I asked her if she really wanted to. (here goes....my stomach is full of butterflies) she slip her hand up my cargo shorts and whispered \"Imma need 'bout tree fiddy\", it was at that point that I realized she was a 6 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "From personal experience with the paranormal, I can tell you that Neshi is something very powerful and not ready to leave this world yet.  The Ouija board was probably let him in.  There are thousands of ways to \"close\" a Ouija board, but none of the are necessarily right, so it's an open portal.  \nIn my line of work, I end up bringing a lot of spirits home and I usually have to cleanse myself and my house every night.  For something this strong that isn't attached to you, you need to get your sister's permission to let Neshi go.  \nNeshi is feeding off of you sister's energy and using her to communicate, and though she may not consciously know it, she's allowing him to use her.  So first step is to get her permission to get rid of him.  You may not want to phrase it that way, what you could do is say to your sister \"hey, can I talk to you alone?\"  And if she says yes, ask her \"I really miss you and having tea parties and I wish it could go back to that, don't you?\"  If she says yes, you have her permission.  \nThe next step is already done for you.  Finding out the entities' name.  So, when you're feeling brave, it's up to you to get rid of him.  Tell yourself that he can NOT physically hurt you.  Surround yourself in a bubble of protection.  (The mind is your biggest protector!  If you believe you are safe and he can't come near you, he can't.) If it settles you any more, light some white unscented candles and burn some sage.\nCall out Nessie BY HIS NAME once you are protected and COMMAND ( the work command is very important) and send him away.  Things may get weird, but if you stay strong and keep yourself protected, he will have no choice but to leave.  Tell him that he is not welcome in your house, around your family, friends and your sister.  Tell him that your sister is refusing him her energy anymore and that she wants him gone (His energy source is now cut off!)  Since he especially doesn't like you, make it known that he is not allowed anywhere near you.  Send him off to the light.  He will leave, and you will know when he is gone. \n I had a similar thing happen with an old boyfriend of mine who's eyes would literally change when an entity named \"Adam\" would use him.  He hated me and Adam would actually threaten me, not just by my boyfriend, but by physically attacking me when I was in our apartment alone and sending me nightmares.\nBEST OF LUCK!!!", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1428963468", "subreddit": "nosleep", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

They are some of the worst people that I've ever worked with in my 10+ years of experience in the workplace.\n\nThe day started off well. I got up, and by 6:00, I was on my way to my job. As I get there, I notice that there are only about 20 cars there. I was a bit worried, because there were usually about a minimum of 50+ at this time, so I went inside to investigate.\n\nThe minute I step in, I know that there was something wrong. Only about 10 people showed up today, the rest never even called in to announce their absence. I asked one of my co-workers where the other ones, but he didn't know either. I was absolutely appalled.\n\nNow, here's where things started going downhill.\n\nA customer approached me, and told me that about 5 of my employees were burning things, and just generally fucking around.\n\nI was searching the store, looking for them, and I just couldn't find any of them.

The psychic was this sort of hot gypsy woman calling herself Madame Xanadu or whatever and when I got to her place, I had to wait in this small waiting room.

The previous client, this pregnant woman, left smiling, so I'm guessing this Madame only tells us what we want to hear. So I get into the \"divination\" room and she seats me down. Madame asks for my name and birth date and I tell her. She then asks what I want to know. The obvious thing I would want to know is, \"What's my future?\"\n\nMadame tells me that my question is too broad and that I have to be more specific, so I ask her, \"What stocks should I invest in?\" She then informs me that she can't tell clientele about anything that could greatly affect the future. At this point I knew she had to be bullshitting, but I played along and asked, \"Who will I marry?\" This question she was okay with. She held my hands and began chanting something Romaine and there was this orb in the center of the table and it illuminated. Fog started to fill the room and there was this creepy whispering. At first I thought the orb just had an electrical light in it, that the fog came from a fog generator, and that the whispering came from a speaker, but then something unnatural happen. The Madame wore blue robes with golden ornaments chained on to it, but I saw the robes slip off her person and she began to grow! Before I knew it, the Madame had gone from this banging gypsy girl to a 20-foot tall reptile from the prehistoric age.

I usually don't drink too much, but, since it was a special occasion, I decided to get really shitfaced wasted. We pregramed a lot before the bar, since it's difficult to obtain alcohol in a bar when none of us are 21, plus it's really expensive so I wasn't trying too hard to get my friends with fake IDs to buy me some. I still ended up drinking a lot there though, because my friends were buying me drinks. So needless to say I was drunk out of my fucking mind. \n\nSo anyway, at the bar I saw this chick dancing by herself. Being drunk as fuck, I walked right up to her and said \"Damn girl, you dance? Think you could show me some of your moves?\" She must have been really drunk too because that line actually worked and we ended up dancing a lot for the next hour or so. Soon enough, I was ready to go back and asked her if she'd like to come with me. To my surprise, she actually said yes. \n\nBack at my apartment, things started to get really heated and things were really escalating. I could tell she was really into it. She asked \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\". Me being pretty drunk I eagerly responded with \"Yes, anything!\". \n\nThen the question came: \"I need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time that I noticed this \"girl\" was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I then replied, \"I aint givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!

I was only 19, but was in a dry spell of 6 months after my girlfriend of a year broke up with me.\n\nI generally kept myself busy over those months working at a factory for most of the day, but I finally couldn't handle it anymore. I needed that sweet release. My buddy John who I had known since childhood had the best *ahem* magazine collection in town.\n\nI traded him 2 packs of cigs, which at the time were about $1.75 per pack, for my mag of choice. Unfortunately that same weekend my family was hosting the family reunion at our house. I left work a little early to see if I could get back before any of them arrived, but I was two late.\n\nMy second cousin, lets call her Tiffany, had the best ass I have ever seen. I stand by that statement even today. But god did it get my my blood pumping. I couldn't take it anymore. I ran out to my truck, grabbed the bag with the magazine, and ran out to the woods. \n\nI wasn't thinking clearing. Before I  knew it I was sitting on a log beating the fuck out of my dick like it killed my dog. Next I heard \"*Kent?*\". *fuck*. She watched me run into the woods and followed me. Quick as a flash I threw my dick into the waste of my pants, magazine into the bag, and bag under the log.\n\nShe didn't expect a thing. Unfortunately I was never able to find that log again. Thankfully I only payed about tree fiddy getting it.\n\n**TL:DR Young, no sex in months, crazy porn collection, hot cousin.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429032038", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was first out of high school, I was hanging out around a bar near the local college campus a lot because they never checked ID's. This place was loaded with college aged girls and even a backwards loser like me was bound to get some action. So, after spending several nights trying to build up the courage to talk to some of the girls, the bartender (we'll call her Betty) started trying to get my courage built up. Betty was in her early 50s and looked really good for her age. I was pretty comfortable with her because I didn't see her in a sexual way. Betty started doing things like giving girls drinks and telling them that it was from me, and telling the girls about the cute single guy shooting darts alone. Betty and I really got a good friendship going and we started to hang out a lot more. One thing led to another and I ended up losing my virginity to Betty in her car in the alley behind the bar. I kind of avoided her for a few days, but finally went in to see her one night. I told her I was sorry and she said that it was no big deal, just sex, and we ended up doing it again that night. Betty and I continued to see each other, both at the bar and dates. After a month or so I started to get worried about being 18 and having a 53 year old girlfriend and that I would end up never meeting someone my own age, so I told Betty that we would have to end it. She was really cool about it and said that we were just friends with benefits, nothing serious. And she had a surprise for me, a girl from the bar named \"Suzie\" that had an awesome body had been asking about me. So the next night I show up to the bar and Betty brings Suzie over to talk to me. This is awesome, with the confidence I got from \"Mrs. Robinson\" I am finally able to talk to a hot young girl without tripping over my tongue. Betty mentioned that Suzie wanted to try a threesome, so I asked her if she really wanted to. (here goes....my stomach is full of butterflies) she slipped her hand up my cargo shorts and whispered \"Imma need 'bout tree fiddy\", it was at that point that I realized she was a 6 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! I slapped her claw away and said \"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy you god damn loch ness monstah!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429041882", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Halfway through this, I was expecting it to be a Loch Ness Monster post.  I'm really wishing it was, now.\n\nEDIT: Fuck it, I'll make it one.\n\n&gt; No dick-sticking, but still relevant.\n\n&gt; When I was a kid I had a cat named Sugaree (Grateful Dead, anyone?) that I got as a kitten when I was much younger. I was an only child from divorced parents, and I spent a lot of time alone. Didn't have many friends. So I loved that cat more than anything--it was like a sibling to me. Slept on my bed, shared my successes and defeats, etc. That cat was always there for me.\n\n&gt; When I was in maybe sixth grade, I had a crush on this girl named Emily. Everyone had a crush on Emily because she had boobs when nobody else did. She was one of those girls who dated everyone, you know, not really \"dated\" but was like a diva that was always flitting around between boys, twirling her blonde hair, fluttering her eyelashes, etc. Her mom was really into the beauty pageant circuit too, so she knew more about manipulating men than any girl that age should. She made the boys cry a lot. She seemed to revel in shattering innocence.\n\n&gt; Well one day she starts fluttering her eyelashes in my direction. I'm confused as fuck because I'm just some socially awkward only-child who's never, ever been part of the popular circle of kids who're always swapping boyfriends and girlfriends. Why's she looking at me all of a sudden? I kind of just sit there and take it, stunned. She giggles. Seems to like it. Holds my hand at recess. Sits with me at lunch. This goes on for a week or so. The entire time I'm in a daze. What is happening to me?\n\n&gt; Childhood romance is a warzone more brutal than any other. The other girls start to notice that Emily's sunk her claws into me and now they start moving in, too, thinking I'm the hot new thing, thinking that maybe they can steal me away and score some popular points. So now the socially-awkward weirdo is constantly surrounded by popular girls, which is really strange for me, since all I want to do is go off alone and hide under the football bleachers and play Pokemon Red on the Game Boy Color I got for Christmas, but now I can't anymore because I've got this pack of wolves following me around, pulling my hair, fighting over who gets to hold my hand, etc, with Emily being the most aggressive, like a lion trying to chase 12 hyenas away from a zebra carcass, and me being the carcass, just sitting there, doing nothing, stiff and ambivalent.\n\n&gt; Eventually Emily decides it's time to go nuclear. She finds out that my mom works late at night (no dad, remember, divorced parents) and tells me that she's going to come home with me tomorrow and we're going to sleep together. I don't even know what this means: this was before smart phones, back when kids didn't have Urban Dictionary to tell them what a Cleveland Steamer was, back when kids were kids, you know, so when she says sleep with me, I kind of know it's something serious, but I don't really know what it is. I shrug. Whatever. All I'm thinking is, sweet, maybe she'll play Pokemon cards with me when we're done.\n\n&gt; So we get home and pulls up her shirt and suddenly I realize I do NOT want ANYTHING to do with this (sixth grade, dude, I hadn't even hit puberty yet) and start saying, woah, no, no, please, let's just play Pokemon cards, please. But she's getting very aggressive, calling me names, telling me I'm garbage, that I'm a loser, that I don't deserve this, that I should be happy I'm getting anything since nobody likes me, just trying her hardest to break me and humiliate me into doing whatever she wants. But no. I've shut down at this point, crying, ignoring her, etc.\n\n&gt; Sugaree is on my bed, sleeping, or you know, doing that lazy half-lidded I-don't-really-care-what's-happening-right-now look, and Emily sees the cat and grabs her, and I start to freak out, and Emily, sensing weakness, picks up a pair of nail clippers and says she's going to kill my cat unless I do what she says.  I ask her what she wants, and she says \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\n&gt; Well, it was about that time that I notice this crazy cat-threatener  was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.

One day while being teased by school yard bullies at summer camp, he decided to run, but his vision was less than perfect because of the tears in his eyes. While running to a camp counselor who was inside, he slipped and fell into the nearby pool. Bashing his head on the concrete edge, he fell unconscious. The bullies that were teasing him were scared of the backlash and blame they would receive so they ran in the opposite direction of the pool, leaving him to die. Ten minutes later came a pool cleaner. The pool cleaner saw the young boy under the sheen of suns reflection in the water. Fast forward two weeks, Bonzi lies in a hospital bed, surrounded by his single mother and various other family members. \nDoctors were unsure whether he would wake up, especially without any permanent damage his brain my have had being without air for those 10 minutes. The boy was unresponsive to even his mothers voice. At about 11 AM that day, one of his aunts was feeling hungry and decided to pickup Wendy's for everyone to eat. While asking the mother near the boys bed what she would like, the boy slowly woke unnoticed by anyone. He spoke clearly, shocking everyone by saying he wanted a cheese burger off the kids menu. Turns out food was what it took to wake Bonzi out of this \"coma\". The aunt asked how much it cost, he said... Tree Fiddy.\nHope you enjoyed the story, I got the idea from when I drowned when I was six.

{"body": "First off, as others have mentioned, belief is not a choice. Belief is the result of being convinced. If you put your hand on a hot plate, you don't *choose* to believe it's hot and painful to touch; you're quickly and dramatically convinced by reality.\n\nYou may object that there's no similarly direct, convincing proof for or against the existence of gods. Unfortunately, that doesn't matter; what matters is whether the person is convinced. Religions tend to cheat here: they get an authority figure, either the parents or a cleric or teacher or all three, to tell the child that such-and-such is true. Children have less developed critical thinking (i.e. they're relatively gullible) so they end up convinced by just the evidence of someone's authority. From then on, confirmation bias, i.e. an unwillingness to change one's mind, keeps those convictions locked in place, often lifelong.\n\n----\n\nSecond, you'd do well to consider that there are millions of atheists who don't believe in gods simply because they were never confronted with the concept. It's like millions of Chinese folk don't believe in the Loch Ness Monster simply because they never even heard of it.\n\nI live in Western Europe, where very roughly half the people don't believe in God. Yesterday, a colleague and I approached our team leader at work to talk about something, and I jokingly said \"we're on a mission from God!\" He said that God wasn't someone he had any business with, and I quickly explained that I was making a Blues Brothers film reference. Anyway, in an urban environment most people will be non-believers. When I visit the US it seems very strange to me how everybody talks about God as if he were an everyday real-world phenomenon.

{"body": "(This is my morning brain exercise, so thanks for posting this. By the way, I'm not an expert in any way, shape, or form. Take this with a grain of salt.)\n\nI'm assuming that the Kogomo are settled, first of all; if they're nomads, don't expect them to do anything serious with geothermal. But if they're settled, and the springs are accessible enough, then you might just have something.\n\nYou could definitely take the hot water and move it elsewhere. Bathing in the hot springs themselves would probably become a recreational activity, since it feels nice and it's easy to make it a social endeavour. If someone wanted to pay for it, they could have the water taken by [screw pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_screw) and [aqueduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct_(water_supply)) to their house or elsewhere. Society may pay for this if it has wider benefits. For example, given your cold climate, springs may be the best source of water during the winter. Not only that, but now you don't have to pay (in terms of fuel) to heat water for cooking. All around, I can see this becoming common.\n\nIf the water is hot enough, and the distances short enough, you could heat houses or greenhouses with this water. [It's done today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_heating), and we've done it since the Paleolithic era. Of course, how efficient this is will depend on the situation, but it's definitely better and cheaper than burning wood or coal for it. According to Wikipedia, it's been done in France since the 14th century, so I'd call this plausible enough.\n\nAs for industrial uses, that gets a little more high tech. After all, your boiling water won't be hot enough to turn water into steam for use in a steam engine, since that's not how thermodynamics works. However, having your water pre-heated, particularly from very hot springs, might help you reduce the fuel costs of steam engines. Handwave the Kogongo a few coal deposits here and there (or a colony or external territory with the same) and your energy needs for that era are more or less solved. \n\nYou could also play with lava, but, well, this isn't Minecraft and I wouldn't think of that as practical. I mean, man, it's lava, how do you even handle it or control it? You could argue that it might become more practical with space-age materials and stuff, but by that point, you've got other, safer options. Also, you only tend to see lava in situations where getting the hell out of the way is a lot more important than finding out how to use the stuff economically.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429106210", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I actually had the opportunity to see an allegedly extinct species once!\n\nMy family had been planning on taking a trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, after my father had learned of a special, unannounced exhibit that would be having a big reveal. He wouldn't tell me (or anyone else) what it was actually supposed to include, but he *did* keep offering little facts about prehistoric sea creatures and such.\n\n\"Did you know,\" he told me once, \"that trilobites are directly related to modern-day butterflies?\"\n\n\"What's a trilobite?\" I asked.\n\nIn response, my father grinned and held out a small box for me. When I opened it, I found a smooth rock - about the size of my hand - with an intricate fossil set into one side.\n\n\"*That*,\" my dad continued, \"is a trilobite. They've been extinct for *millions* of years.\" His face suddenly broke out into an excited grin. \"So it sure would be *weird* to see one in person, wouldn't it?\"\n\nEven back then, I was more than able to take the hint... and although I hadn't even heard the word \"trilobite\" before then, I suddenly found myself feeling very excited by the prospect of seeing a living specimen. When the weekend (and the day of our trip) finally came, I was downright giddy, although I refused to leave home without first wrapping up my fossil and stowing it in my mother's purse (for later comparison to a living example).\n\nWhen we finally arrived at the aquarium, it became clear that my father wasn't the only person who had been offered \"secret\" knowledge of the \"unannounced\" exhibit. Throngs of people - most of them clustered into families - milled around near the entrance, and many of them were being turned away by the security guard. My father, fortunately, had somehow acquired tickets in advance, and he walked forward with confidence... until he, too, was stopped.\n\n\"Sorry,\" the security guard said, \"but only three of you can get in like this.\"\n\nI shot a look at my father, then my mother, and then finally at my younger brother.\n\n\"Really?\" my dad replied, surprised. \"I have two adult admissions and two child admissions.\"\n\nThe security guard nodded sympathetically. \"Yeah, but the child admissions are technically free, and they only apply to children under five.\" He leaned his head in my direction. \"Your son is, what, seven? Eight?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said my father, \"can we just buy a regular ticket in place of this one, then?\"\n\nOnce again, the security guard nodded. \"I'll need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nRight away, I felt the hair on the back of my neck raise... and it was about that time I noticed the helpful security guard was about forty feet tall, and was a huge creature from the Mesozoic Era! Without wasting a second, I reached into my mother's purse and pulled out my fossilized trilobite, which I flung at the monster while invoking the Ancient Chant of Tumehknatu:\n\n\"*Ye-oh-wah*,\" I shouted, \"*keh-vat-hoo-chee-fer-ray!*\" \n\nWith a blinding flash of light, the fossil exploded, and a swirling vortex opened directly in front of the monster. It let loose a scream of fury and moved as though it was going to attack me... but several glowing tendrils closed around its form, and it was drawn away into the unknown.\n\nMy family spent several hours in the aquarium after that. I was a little bit sad about having lost my fossil... but the chance to see an allegedly extinct creature more than made up for it.\n\n**TL;DR: I saw an (allegedly) extinct creature at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429112873", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

I'll get to those later.\n\nThe equivalents to bigfoot or area 51 here are:\n\n- Seljordsormen (Our Nessie, except it's said to be a serpent, living in a lake near Seljord in Telemark county)\n\n- Hessdalen (Popular UFO hotspot, supposedly. Located in Sør-Trøndelag county).\n\n- Gaustad Mentalsykehus (A fairly old mental ward, said to have experimented on human beings in the past, it's also fairly widely believed that there's a mass-grave on their property of dead subjects from around the 2nd world war to well into the cold war era).\n\n- There's several hidden military bases around the country, built into mountains and suchlike. I know where a few of them are, but not exactly what they're used for, in most cases. Few people seem to know about them though, unless they're interested in urban exploring and things like that. One of these bases were decomissioned and put up for sale at some point - a top secret, nuclear-proofed submarine pen, built into a mountain. There have also been a few bases from ww2 and the cold war that have been opened to the public eye in later years, and our state TV channel has done reports on some of them, which are quite interesting.\n\n- Many of our more high ranking politicians and business people have been attendees at the bilderberg conferences. They've been photographed going in. Including our current minister of finance. (Not saying I know what goes on in there, just that they've been taken pictures of, and it does fit the x-files theme of the thread, sort of).\n\nOkay, so for the older myths that people no longer buy, but used to. I'm going to exclude the myths specific to the norse, because that's more part of norse mythology, and can easily be found elsewhere on the net.\n\n- Huldra (trollish woman of staggering beauty that seduced people and dragged them into the mountain) Similar to british fairies.\n\n- Nøkken (strange river and lake dwelling creature that attracts girls and drowns them in the lake. He's also a bit of a lecherous bastard, so there's a condom brand named nøkken).\n\n- Bytting (Changeling. Before people understood the problems that can occur with pregnancy, it was common to blame birth defects or down's syndrome, and things like that, on trolls or fairies that replaced the baby with one of their own. It was a way for parents not to have to deal with the grief of what they were doing to the babies with such defects - leaving them in the forest to die of exposure or animal attacks, which brings me to the next myth)\n\n- A belief arose that crossroads were dangerous places, because the ghosts of bytting children would congregate there, and latch on to people who traveled the roads, and cause them bad luck and harm.\n\n- Nisse (Small gnomish things, essentially santa claus, but less jolly and more 'will fuck your shit up royally if you neglect leaving out porridge for them in the winter'). Similar in size and appearance to an irish leprichaun.\n\n- Pesta (personification of the black death (plague). supposedly an old woman, visiting people at night and making them ill).\n\n- Jostedalsrypa (a girl that supposedly was the lone survivor of the black death in the valley where she lived. the story also says that her mother had put her in a bed of feathers before the mother died, and that when people found her after everyone else in the valley had died, she had feathers growing out of her skin.\n\nThere's a bunch of other stories too, but I can't recall all of them off the top of my head.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429112959", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was an introvert mostly throughout High School.  I didn't go to many parties, nor did I have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked.  \n\nUnfortunately, I had 0 skills on picking up girls even though I was trying really hard to get a girl.  \n\nIn 11th grade there was a party around my school's christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it.  I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.  \n\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where.  I still remembered her name though, Vanessa.  She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\n\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me.  I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\n\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible.  She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back.  I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\n\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of.  Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\" \n\nI started saying more things.\n\nShe laughed even more.\n\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl.  But then it dawned on me.  I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where.  A strip club.  Vanessa was a stripper.  Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.  \n\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously.  My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once.  I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\n\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"  \n\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\n\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house.  This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue.  I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself.\n\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\n\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone.  A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms.  I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside.\n\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\n\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off Vanessa's clothes.  Finally, she was fully naked, as was I.  She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.  \n\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\".  Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\"  I couldn't believe it.  This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin.  I still can't believe it.  I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock.  She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to.  I told her I was a virgin too and she said good.  As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\"  \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\n\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life.  Been waiting for awhile for someone to post a question like this to askreddit for a long time now.  Happy I finally got the chance to tell that story.\n\ntl;dr: A stripper who aggressively threw herself on to me was actually a virgin.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429136444", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was once a house keeper for a couple that shall remain unnamed in Hollywood. I will tell you this couple is still quite well known, but I no longer work for them after this incident. \n\nI was going through my cleaning duties as usual. I walked into the master bedroom and BAM there's the lady of the couple going to town on another unnamed female celebrity. I say sorry and begin to walk out. But my boss says, \"No wait, come back.\" I go back with my head down because I'm embarrassed enough when I knew I shouldn't have just walked in without knocking. I'm thinking she's gonna fire me. She straight up grabs my junk and says to the guest, \"This is perfect. He's huge compared to my husband!\" Then she comes close to me and whispers, \"If you promise not to tell (her husband), you can have the rest of the day off and we will be your slaves.\" \n\nI'm in shock. I couldn't stammer out anything comprehensible, but she grabs me by the shirt and drags me over to the bed and sits me down. The guest says, \"Don't worry, we'll calm your nerves for you.\" So these two start going to town on my dick. Best blowjob ever. Like, I'm gonna come in two minutes good. They start kissing right in front of my dick and I get the double cumshot. The owner of the house says, \"Do you feel more relaxed?\" I nod my head. She goes, \"Good, now remember what I told you about us being your slaves?\" Nod. \"Excellent. Follow us.\" \n\nSo they lead me into this room I had been instructed to not clean when I started the job. They said they would always take care of this one. We walk in and it is the most incredible dungeon I've ever seen in my life. You name anything related to BDSM, it's freaking there. So the guest says, \"What would you have us do, master?\" I'm a classic kind of guy, so I have her hog tie my boss on this table. While she's doing that I find the biggest dildo I can. Thing is about 15 inches long and two and a half inches in diameter. I get back and my boss is tied up nice and tight and I give the dildo to the guest and and tell her to use that to fuck her in the ass. She starts doing that and the look on her face needed to get fucked. \n\nI start fucking her throat and gagging her while she's being abused by the hulk dildo. After I've had my fun there, I take the guest and bend her over and start giving it to her good while she's hulk fucking my boss with that dildo. I whisper in her ear, \"Is this what you want?\" She says, \"Yes, master.\" I say, \"Do you want more?\" \"Yes, master.\" \"What do you need?\" She whispers in the most seductive voice, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" And that's when I realized she was actually 8 stories tall and from the paleothilic era. I said, \"You get out of this house, you goddamn loch ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" So she flops out of the house, I finish fucking my boss, and I quit and moved back in with my parents because I didn't wanna see that god damn loch ness monster again. \n\nTl;dr walked into celebrity lesbian sex, became their master, left.

Usual routine, and just as I release the email, in the list of blocked emails from other users, there was something about one of them that caught my eye and so I clicked on it.\n\nOh Lordy – I opened Pandora’s box.  Over the next 8 weeks I followed all the blocked emails this person got and discovered one hell of a sordid life.  He was just an average 50 something male, with a family who quite enjoyed being a ‘Sissy’ on the side.  All the email were between himself and his mistress (who’s services he pays for amongst other thigns) were photos of him in see through night wear, frilly knickers etc.  and the emails would have stories about what the mistress would do to him on the weekend.  Usually involving him drinking her piss and being a general slave for her….  She would send him soiled underwear in the post TO HIS WORKS ADDRESS!! And he would email back the following week telling her what he had done with them. \n\nThen things started to turn for the worst.  He said he wanted to be a full slave for his mistress and that he wanted to go to ‘the next step’ but his mistress was not comfortable with this and told him to seek out a new mistress.  \n\nWhat was the ‘next step’?  He wanted to be used as a toilet!\n\nHe fantasised about eating the stuff and had booked in with a new mistress who catered for this kind of fetish.\n\nIt was several weeks before I heard from him again but then he was back.  He talked about how he’d spent a weekend wrapped in cling film, being force fed shit and being buggered by another slave that resided with the mistress and that he now wanted to be referred to by the new name ‘toilet’.  I’ll spare you the details but its fair to say it wasn’t like what he expected and made him consider his life choices.\n\nFor all of you expecting a Tree Fiddy….

At this point I knew she had to be bullshitting, but I played along and asked, \"Who will I marry?\" This question she was okay with. She held my hands and began chanting something Romaine and there was this orb in the center of the table and it illuminated. Fog started to fill the room and there was this creepy whispering. At first I thought the orb just had an electrical light in it, that the fog came from a fog generator, and that the whispering came from a speaker, but then something unnatural happen.

{"body": "Couldn't agree more man.\n\nThe other day I was walking through my hometown and I saw a man yelling at the top of his lungs about how sick and tired he was of having to support the younger generation. His, er, \"victim\" was some poor kid in his early 20's. \n\nI took pity on the kid and walked over to him once the geyser was finished his verbal tirade. He was holding a sign that read \"Too poor for college, too rich for financial aid\". It really struck me. I told him I'd like to hear his story and offered to buy him lunch. Not that he looked like he needed a free meal but who can say no to free Mackers right?\n\nSo we're sitting there in this fast food joint and I get the courage up to ask him what he meant by his sign. He explained to me that, on paper, his family had the money to pay for his education. When the University looked at his financial aid application, they promptly rejected him. The reality, he told me, was that his father owed a huge debt to a loan shark.\n\nApparently he was arrested on charges of possession. By possession they of course meant the half joint they found in his car. I couldn't believe it.  The bail posted was more than his family could afford, so they went to a loan shark. His dad has been working overtime to try and keep his knee caps in tact.\n\nI had to fight back the feels, this poor kid has been nothing but the victim of poor chance. I decided there was something I could do to help him. I had some money laying around that I was saving for a rainy day. Happily I had secured a decent raise and bonus a couple months back, so I wasn't really running my bank account low enough to need to dip into this savings fund. There was +- $1200 in there.\n\nWe went to his parents and I told them the news, that I wanted to pay the loan shark off and let them focus on their lives. There were tears and this time I couldn't fight back the feels.\n\nI asked him how much he still owed the loan shark. Through choked backed tears he told me \"I need about tree fiddy\".\n\nIt was at this point that I realised he was a 300 ft crustacean from the paleolithic era. \n\n\"Goddamit Nessy I told you I ain't got no tree fiddy!\" They all climbed aboard and I watched as they swam away, left with nothing but anger and a happy meal ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429266896", "subreddit": "Jokes", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"Oscar!\" erupted Josephine's voice from the other room. In the meantime, Oscar himself was catching up with the back cover of a National Geographic over the porcelain throne. \n\n\"Not now, honey!\" He bellowed, forty-seven years of marriage making this response reactionary. But it was not his stomach (still displeased with that thick lasagna last evening, don't tell Josie) that made the great growl that resounded through the house.\n\n\"Sweet Jackrabbits!\" He nearly fell off due to the vibration of mighty sound. \"What are you doing, Josephine?\"\n\nJosephine, in fact, was pressed against the wall in the foie, clinging to proper heart function like a middle aged actress to youth. \n\n\"Oh, please don't upset yourself!\" came a new voice, hilariously deep with sound wavelengths the size of their house. \"I needn't trouble you for long.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the Loch Ness Monster only spoke in an early tribal Scott phonetic, and the result came across to the Josie the school librarian as a series of growls. Inconvenience, apparently, ran amuck in this new world. \n\nFergus had been desperately lonely, of course, in the quite literally land \"loched\" pond that trapped him a millennium or so before, and one night, while the tourist hunters slept, he tip toed out (a day before they would accomplish their first sonar reading of the lake-- go figure) into a nearby river, which in effect functioned as a great water slide through the valleys until he appeared at the end in the Atlantic Ocean. Not taken with the cold salty water of that current, he found himself following warmth to what eventually turned out to be the Gulf Stream. \n\nIt was after enjoying how far he could go down the Saint Lawrence River that he took a wrong turn and ended up in a lake in Ontario. He would later comment that this had been the best mistake of his life.\n\nFor there is where he met his significant other, Catherine, known by her neighbors as the Ogopogo. They soon fell in a true and wholesome love, and moved to the wide and deep Mississippi, as they would never stay in one place too long to get caught, and they could enjoy a free range for their eternal lives. Soon after their home building, they had their daughter, Jillian, and they remained America's greatest secret for a decade. \n\nIt was a Wednesday when Jillian bumped into a group of Girl Scouts on a hike, as they were leaping off a rope swing into a tributary of the river. In fact, Priscilla Jordan landed directly on Jillian's back.\n\n\"Ouch!\" she cried, and \"Cool!\" she heard. With that, Priscilla and Jillian became best friends, and did everything together. They would read books aloud on weekends, and sing boy band music at the top of their lungs, and Priscilla even made her an honorary Girl Scout, without letting the world in on her secret. \n\nSo you can imagine how annoyed Ferguson was when he found out that Jillian had yet to fulfill her quota for cookie sales. Annoyance was rampant as well when he was staring down Oscar Malone's musket.\n\n\"Stay back, beast!\" he demanded. Both Josephine and Fergus rolled their eyes, Fergus at the puny weapon, and Josie at the unfounded macho-ness her husband picked up after reading a National Geographic. \n\nAs opposed to the deathly blows the Malones were expecting, Fergus reached behind him and offered up some Tagalongs in two boxes, and a clip board asking for a signature of merchandising and a fee of four dollars. It was then that Jillian clambered up wearing a Hannah Montana hair clip that Priscilla had made from old bicycle parts. \n\nOscar dropped the gun in disbelief, but Josie, finding a new strength, stepped away from the wall, laid down four dollars, and signed the clip board. Fergus nodded, smiling, then picked it out of her hands with one of his mighty molars and turned around to dip back into the pond next door with his daughter. \n\nIt was later that Oscar and Josephine's granddaughter came to visit, and upon seeing the Tagalongs, sighed and commented, \"Darn, I guess Jillian got to you first.\"\n\nJosie had always insisted she disliked the children her daughter-in-law allowed Priscilla to play with.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429278853", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had Reggie. When I met him he was standing outside my house with a snow shovel, and he asked me how much I would pay him to shovel snow. Being summer I told him I wouldn't pay him anything, but I had other jobs around my house if we was willing to work. It was then I found out how handy he was. That man could fix anything. I had a broken toilet, bam, fixed. He built a dog house for my dog out of an old potato crate and the even painted it. When my washer was making weird sounds, I called Reggie and within an hour he had if running like new. The most memorable time was my car breaking down, so I had it towed home, too broke to have a garage look at it. But you \nNow there was a lot odd about Reggie, he always spoke really slow, like he was really concentrating on something. He also always wore the same jacket, rain or shine, a black Carhart with a tear in the right sleeve. But the oddest thing was he never asked me to pay him for any of this, just that one day he will need a favor from me and to pay him back, I should do the favor. \n\nWell 6 months went by and no favor was asked, and I started to wonder \"well shit, what would he ask me? Help him hide a body? Be his get away driver?\". It was always in the back of my mind, but he was so damn good at fixing things, it was too hard to turn down his help.\n\nI asked him one time when he was repairing shingles on my roof where he came from and he was very vague, but did tell me he used to work for a very wealthy family as a grounds keeper, until he was fired for sleeping with his employer's 20 yr old daughter. As cagey was he was about his past, he still had amazing stories about different places he worked. After he was done working I would bring him a beer and he would thank me and shuffle on off to where ever he stayed. Sometimes I wouldn't see him again for weeks, but he would always show up, Carhart jacket on, tool belt ready.\n\nNow it was getting close to Thanksgiving and I invited him for our dinner. He declined but said he'd be back before Christmas. Determined to get him a gift,  I spent the next few weeks searching for the perfect one. I got him a sturdy pair of work boots, as he always complained his feet hurt wearing the cheap pair he owned. \n\nA few days before Christmas, it snowed. I woke up kind of giddy, first snow of the year and it was Christmas time! I walked outside and there was Reggie, holding the same snow shovel I'd seen when I met him months earlier. He said \"PCRenegade, remember when I said I'd ask you for a favor? Well I'm cashing it in, would you let me shovel your driveway?\"\n\nConfused and honestly kind of releaved, I accepted, and, headed inside, where I grabbed the boots to give to him. I came out and the driveway was done, a typic Reggie good job done. I smiled, with the boots handed out toward him and said \"Wow, looks great, here's a present, Merry Christmas!\"\n\nReggie looked at the boots and said it wasnt necessary, but as part of his favor he would like to be paid for shoveling the drive. I glady said I would pay him, and so I took out my wallet and asked how much he felt was fair. He said. \"I'm going to need about tree fiddy\".\nWell it was about that time that I noticed that Reggie was a 40ft tall creature from the Cerozoic Era.

So read the whole fucking thing\n\nNot a teacher, but this is an excuse my partner for a project we didn't finish  tried in highschool. In grade ten, our school was renovated, and part of it was torn down. Our English teacher asked for a steel beam from the part that was torn down. Then he got someone to cut it up into small pieces, and we were given the assignment of carving an original poem about our school into it. Then they would be displayed in the main hall of the school. Sense their was limited supply's (which was surprising, considering it was a fucking steel beam) we had to work in partners. I got stuck with the dumbest kid in the school, Clayton. The teacher handed out the special carving tools, and as soon as I got them, Clayton ran over and said \"Let me have these, i'll do the carving, you do the writing\". I didn't want to do all the writing, but I hate carving, its boring an takes forever, so I agreed. I spent all week writing a beautiful poem. I emailed it to Clayton, and told him to tell me when he was done the carving. Everyday I asked, but he said \"I'm almost done\". Finally, on the last day before the project was due, Clayton admitted he hadn't even started. WTF dude! I yelled at him. \"Yea, a sorry, I lost the tools\" he said. I was so mad. After school I went over to his house to try to carve the poem the poem into the beam with whatever we could find. No dice. We then spent an hour thinking up excuses, but we couldn't come up with a good one. The next day, everyone else had theirs done except us. The teacher made us stay after class and explain ourselves. Our original excuse was to say that we were done, but the night before, Claytons dad, not noticing the poem, sold it to a scrap metal yard. Just before we got up to talk to the teacher,  Clayton whispered to me \"I got a new excuse, the old makes my family sound ghetto\". \"Whats the excuse?\", \"Its a secret\", he said. I was so pissed. My fate was know in a colossal dipshits hands. We got up there and the teacher asked \"So why didn't you two do it?\" Clayton responded \"Do you have about tree fiddy?\" At that moment I realized that Clayton wasn't a 15 year old boy, but actually a 500 foot tall creature from paleolithic era", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429308923", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have a strong tie to Star Wars. Yeah, that reaction may be a bit over the edge, but there is a reason.\n\nWhen the Phantom Menace came out my 57 year-old Grandfather took me to see it. I was only 11, but I remember it meant the world to me because we never really bonded over anything. After we saw that movie he got the original trilogy and watched all of those before Clone Wars came out. Every time I went to visit them in Maryland we would talk Star Wars for hours.\n\nSo we made it a tradition to see the new movies together when they came out. It didn't matter what time; school-day, if I was in trouble, funeral, the Devil came up out of the earth, it didn't matter. We would always make it to the front of the theatre.\n\nClone Wars came out and we were hyped (He thought Samuel Jackson was the funniest thing in the entire series. Sometimes he would just yell Sam Jack lines when the situation called for it). The LEGO Star Wars short on Cartoon Network came out and we watched that. Literally everything Star Wars we watched together and it was great. Then Episode 3 was announced and we talked about it constantly.\n\n\"Do you think this is going to be the turning point for Anakin? He was really disrespectful of Obi-Wan in that last one we saw.\" \n\nSpeculation was high between us and it never stopped until one day I get a phone call from my Grandmother. (I'm tearing up right now typing this and I think you already know where this is going) She tells me that Pop Pop's stomach isn't too good and that my Dad and I are coming up to visit that weekend to see him.\n\nWhen I saw him on that hospital bed I knew something was going to happen. When he saw me he just did that smile that he always gave me. We said hello and gave each other hugs, then immediately as we pull away he says, \"Be strong, you'll be a knight soon\". \n\nFrom that point on I knew I had lost him, but when would it happen? We talked and talked about things other than Star Wars this time. It was like talking to a friend. Eventually the conversation devolved back to whether or not the Jedi were good guys in actuality and whether there were any black storm troopers or not. It was great. \n\nI felt my Grandmother's hand on my shoulder, then she told me it was 2100. We had been talking like this for 4 hours. Me just holding his hand and finger like I always had when we walked to the theatre. I turned around to see my Dad with his head in his hand trying to fight back tears. So I get up, and we talk about how we are going to see Revenge of the Sith in the next 2 weeks and that I should start preparing for it. Then I turn to leave after saying goodbye, but he grabs me and brings me in for a hug. I feel his grizzled mustache on my pre-pubescent cheeks and he takes me by the shoulders and says to me, \n\n\"John, before you go I need you to promise me one thing\". \n\nAnd I reluctantley say, \"What is it Pop Pop?\". \n\nHe looks into my inquizitive face and says, \"Tree Fiddy\". \n\nIt was at this moment I noticed that my Grandfather was in fact a 6 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic Era.\n\nNo, but seriously he died 13 days later.

So, Superman saving the day in the middle east, Sahara, etc..?\n\n*But the WEIRDEST fucking thing is this:* \n\n****** \nThe shot of Superman in the entrance of some sort of bunker, there are black clad soldiers on either side of him, elite, almost in a scary way...all are wearing the Superman LOGO on their arms where a flag would normally go! *(Superman, to his credit, seems uncomfortable with this, as he does at the Mexican holiday)* But, to make this scene with the soldiers even creepier, all of the soldiers genuflect (kneel) before Superman, which today is reserved for religious purposes. That, the almost SS-like uniforms, just with an \"S\" instead of a Swastika...and you can see why Batman is ready to put Superman on notice. \n\nI. Can't. Fucking. Wait. Stories like this, and Flashpoint Paradox and Mask of the Phantasm are why DC is so unique. \n\n**EDIT: The cinematographer said that nobody has noticed the best Easter Egg yet. So...after 3 hours of watching, pausing.........finally. Found it:**\n\nThe scene where, what I assume is the Batplane, is banking sharply over what appears to be a port area. It's quick because the Batplane(?)'s wing yaws to the left exposing some shipping containers for a second before going to the next cut. If you can manage to pause the video right at that moment you can get a good look at a massive area full of shipping containers. How many? About tree fiddy. And hiding *behind* those shipping containers is some 7 foot tall prehistoric sea creature, guarding a pile of underrated gems. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429322126", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 269, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"Fifth, 99+ percent of what you know, you only know because somebody told you. It is literally he said - she said all the way down.\"\n\nDegree of belief should correlate with the weight of the evidence.  \n\nFor example... \n\nI *observe* that I am currently sitting at a computer typing this message.  Personal perception can be wrong, but it's a good place to start.\n\nI *experience* physics in all its glory on a daily basis, so I more readily accept ideas that fit within its bounds.\n\nI *concur* that the Moon orbits the Earth.  I observe the moon's movement in the sky, and the physics tell me it makes sense for the Moon to orbit the Earth, not the other way around.\n\nI *accept* the more complicated aspects of rocket science and electromagnetic theory.  I may not directly experience them in a simple way, but I witness their results in aircraft, missiles, and computers,  and the on-paper math checks out. \n\nI *acquiesce* to the principles of string theory, the existence of the Higgs Boson, the impossibility of faster-than-light travel, and other similar principles.   I have no way to verify them, check the math, or witness their truth, and I won't be bothered if they turn out to be wrong, but I'll take the word of the experts for now.\n\nI *trust* that my neighbor had bacon and eggs for breakfast this morning.  I have no way to verify, but it's a reasonable claim and I have no reason to disbelieve him.\n\nI'm *skeptical* of many events from history - Homer's tales, Altantis, the murder of Julius Caesar, the murder of JFK.  Real historic events occurred, but the truth of the how and the why and the what has been muddled. Perhaps a little, perhaps a lot, but we don't know what the whole truth is.  Better historic evidence could shed light on them, and wouldn't change our understanding of the universe.\n\nI'm *dubious* of human telepathy, psychics, ghosts, alien UFOs,  bigfoot, the loch ness monster, and the chupacabra.  Such things range from 'mostly unbelievable' to 'wholly unbelievable', but there could be some rare kernels of truth, some elements of physics, biology, or psychology we haven't identified.  Some of these things, if they *did* turn out to be true, could completely change our understanding of the universe.  \n\nI *conclude* that the mystical premises of Christianity and other religions are false, because they can't be observed, experienced, verified, or repeated, and lie outside the realm of what physics deem reasonable.  If the claims of any such religion turned out to be true it would completely contradict almost everything we know about physics and the known universe.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429408877", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, so, storytime.\n\nMiddle of New Mexico, 2011, a good 15 miles east of a little hamlet named Moriarty, suburb of Albuquerque.  At the time I drove a navy blue 2002 Buick Century.  It was the middle of summer, very hot, and I'm driving down the road, no one anywhere near me, when the damn thing breaks down.  I pull over on the side of the highway in the scorching heat, hop out, and check the engine.  Overheated. (Turns out later it was a dirty air filter that caused this.)  I pulled out my iPhone, and just my luck, no service.  Now, I'm a pretty weak dude, and no way I could push the car on my own.  I tried the very dangerous and age old tradition of hitchiking, but to no avail.\n\nAbout ten minutes later I see this tow truck with \"Danlar Towing\" on the side comes up from behind, carrying another car.  I assumed it came from one of the state highways that let onto Route 66, where I was.  He pulled to the median behind me, rolled his window down, I walk over.  Pretty thin, leathered guy with a checkered shirt and trucker's hat on, full bear and all, sits inside, one arm rested on the side.\n\"Y'need some help pal?\" he called out to me.\n\"Yeah, that'd be amazing, my car's beat, man.\" I reply.\n\"Alright brother, I'm about to drop this puppy off at the lot and I'll come on back, pick y'all up and bring y'all to a repair place in town.\"\n\"That would be amazing, sir, thank you.\"\n\nSo this guy drives off.\n\nMaybe 20 minutes later he comes back and begins hooking me up.  We started chatting, first about the car, then when he noticed my Tennessee plate he commented about how I was not from around there, and welcomed me to New Mexico.  We talked about everything on the drive into town, family, dogs, our favorite sports teams, so on so forth.  Really likable, nice guy.\n\nSo, he drives me into town, did I mention I was riding in the cab with him? Anyways, he drops me and my car off at a repair shop that could figure out what the Hell was wrong with it.  I instinctively pulled out my wallet and asked him how much the ride costs.\n\"Oh no, man, that was for free!\" I was a bit astonished to hear him say this.\n\"You sure, I can tip if you wa-\"\n\"No no, it was my pleasure Sir.\"\n\nI replied, \"Well here, take tree fiddy anyways.\"  I look up from my wallet to give him the change and all I see is a crustacean from the paleozoic era, maybe 8 stories tall.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429419403", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "To be fair, let us remove the names that have \"obvious\" reasons.  They are either very core to the character or historical in some way.\n\n#Names with concrete reasons behind them, i.e. likely are M names by coincidence\n\n\n* **Mouse** - meant to be an ironic name for a big dog.  \n* **Michael** - Michael is a standard name for faithful people with the whole Archangel Michael bit.\n* **Mab** - Traditional name for the/a [Fairy Queen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Mab)\n* **Maeve** - Looks to be either a [corruption or alternative translation of the Irish Gaelic name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maeve) of a folklore character Shakespeare used as a base for his Mab.\n* **Maggie** - Named for her grandmother.  \n\n\nNow let's remove the names that probably have a reason before them, but you need to take some logical leeps.\n\n#Names I found possible reasons for their  use, but not 100% on.  Could just be coincidences or me rationalizing rather than finding the reason.\n## A.K.A. Where I learn just how many names are of Gaelic origins.\n\n* **Mavra** - I keep seeing the meaning for this name is \"dark\".  Interestingly, some of the name etymologies say this name is derived from Gaelic.\n* **Molly** - ~~A corruption/derivation of a Gaelic, interesting that pops up again, name Maili which itself is a corruption/pet-name of Mary.  Until Amanda the Carpenters look to be using a Bible inspired set of names for their kids.  So I strongly suspect  JB wanted to use the Gaelic version of Mary for the Gaelic thing he has going on, but leaving Molly down here since this is spec.  Though looking for the etymology of [Margaret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret) I see Molly may be a derivitive of Margaret as well.  So Harry may have two daughter figures named, in a fashion, after his mother.~~ Per /u/exodusmachine, Molly's real name is Margaret.  So probably a thematic literature thing on JB's end.\n* **Mac** - Slang for \"male stranger\".  Mac is a stranger to all to the extent we don't know who he is or even if Mac is his real name.  However, in Gaelic is means \"Son of\".  Probably one of these.\n* **Mortimer** - A necromancer, fine an ectomancer, named **Mort**imer.  JB probably couldn't pass up the pun, assuming it isn't a taken name to shield his real name.\n* **Martha Liberty** - She's African American.  There are jokes about how many African Americans, at least before the 60s, were named after  founding fathers.  She's a wizard with graying hair so she's extremely old.  Possibly old enough to be born around the founding of the U.S. So I wouldn't be surprised if pressed JB would admit her parents named her after a founding \"mother\", Martha Washington, and gave her the last name \"Liberty\".  \n* **McCoy** - Before I would have just shrugged and said this was probably JB pulling a \"Mac\" or \"Rover\" with a country like guy.  Turns out this is another Gaelic corruption.  In this case Mac Aodha.  Going by Wikipedia, *cough*, Aodha is either/both simply \"fire\" and a [sidhe/god of the underworld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aed_%28god%29).  So McCoy may be a reveal that Harry is descended from a changeling child of a Sidhe God.  Also, Ebenezer is effectively the Black Staff whose surname is equivalent to \"Son of Hades\", almost.  This was a fun one.  I expected it to be nothing.\n* **Malcolm** - Another Gaelic name meaning \"Devotee of Saint Columba\".  [Info on Columba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columba), alleged ability to perceive the future and present simultaneously.  Sounds similar to how Demonreach was made.  There is also this, \"Columba performs various miracles such as healing people with diseases, expelling malignant spirits, subduing wild beasts, calming storms, and even returning the dead to life\".  Also, Columba is, in written record, the first person to encounter Nessie.  I almost want to begin specing a time traveling Harry will influence his father, but JB seems consistent that we won't really ever learn or see much of Malcolm.  I am now wondering if Columba won't be tied into Merlin somehow.\n* **Murphy** - Playing on the \"Irish cop\" stereotype for one, but JB could have chosen a different Irish surname.  Although in fairness, according to Wikipedia it is the most common Irish last name.  It means \"Descendant of Murchadh\" with Murchadh deriving from Muir (sea) Cadh (battle/warrior).  So two plausible reasons for it.\n* **Morgan** - Another UK name.  There is a connection to Morgan le Fay.  There are [these things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgen_(mythological_creature\\)).  I'm admittedly stretching this one.  I don't know if there is a plausible reason here, or if Morgan is JB pulling a \"UK folklore\" version of Jeremiah, Michael, Samuel, etc.\n* **Marcone** - [There is a history with this name](http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Marconi), but this is my second to last name I'm looking up.  So my head is spinning and I don't see anything useful there other than it isn't a Gaelic name, for once.  I'm leaning more towards a homage to [this](http://shadowrun.wikia.com/wiki/Marconi_Family).  It may seem blatant, but then again [used](http://dresdenfiles.wikia.com/wiki/Heinrich_Kemmler) the name [Heinrich Kemmler](http://warhammeronline.wikia.com/wiki/Heinrich_Kemmler).  JB seems fond of table top games and would be familiar with it.  Maybe. \n\n\n\n#Names I just have no idea for.  \n\n\n* **Margaret McCoy** - I got nothing. Thought I would find something. \n* **Mister** - I expect ironic name or a playful name by Dresden regarding Mister acting like the true  owner/\"mister\" of the residence.\n* **Ancient Mai** - Not knowing if it is a given or surname makes this hard to look into.  The character she uses for her name would also influence things.  I'm sorry.  Not going to even attempt this since I have an article I need to work on for my one job.  \n\n\nIt looks to me a good chunk of these names have some reason to justify them and they happen to be Ms.  Then again, maybe JB just Googled \"Gaelic names\" one day and was just in an M mood with all the reasons I give being as factual as astrology.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429457949", "subreddit": "dresdenfiles", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "He's likely to be from the Paleolithic era. The earliest signs of civilization or farming settlements in ancient Mesopotamia is around ~[6500 B.C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaid_period). They grew crops, made canals for water, cooperated on various projects. Before that, I'm sure humans lived in nomadic tribes or similar. \n\nGenetically speaking, from the human genome project, we humans are all descended from a [common maternal ancestor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve) (a.k.a. Mitochondrial Eve) who is estimated to have lived about 100,000–200,000 years ago. Obviously, the actual Eve could be quite older. Our earliest y-chromosome common [paternal ancestor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam) is estimated to have lived 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. So it's quite possible that Adam was created sometime around that era.\n\nGiven how ancient history this is, and that what we have of this period is a few skulls and bones here and there, it's hard to figure out exactly how many of other human species were around and how much they interacted with them.\n\nEdit: So I was just watching this documentary about [Gobekli Tepe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTmCwAETM) a temple with stone monoliths discovered in Turkey built ~12,000 years ago (the oldest known in the world).

{"body": "I understood your 2 cents. The gist of it was do whatever you want and don't worry about what others are saying because 343i is obviously going to do their hardest to make the amazing or risk sinking the franchise. Am I right?\n\nSo I actually listened to the entire video and for every point you made, I couldn't help but come up with a rebuttal. I'm also assuming, based off the title, that the OP is also the creator of the video.\n\nSo in the beginning you mention that if you like the franchise, to go ahead and order the game unless you're afraid of being burned. To me it sound like you're advocating an impulse buy based off a gut reaction. Which is always a poor way to make a decision that is going to cost you more than a few dollars. You get the munchies and buy chips that taste like ass, oh well. You drop $60 and that could be one of your utilities. Then you bring up the point that 343i learned their lesson because the Halo 5 Beta worked so well in comparison to the MCC. Well..... that's a huge red flag. The H5 beta was launched in December. A month after the MCC was released. The MCC was still broken and during the H5 beta 343i pretty much dropped support of the MCC. That says 2 things; 1 the h5 beta was meant to distract people from the MCC and 2, 343i didn't really care about the MCC to begin with. That's an insult and a huge mark against 343i, not a positive. How is it that a game in development by the same company functions exponentially better than a game they just released?\n\nThat leads to your other argument. The MCC was a Frankenstein game with 4 different engines and a plethora of other developers involved. While this is true and that kind of development will invariably lead to bugs, the counter against that is pretty simple. 343i was the project manager. They were also the ones responsible for matchmaking. It was their job to test the game over and over and make sure everything would work. It's impossible to claim they thought the game was ready for launch and therefore they shipped a broken product knowingly. One can't look at the facts and seriously defend this launch or the subsequent debacle that followed in trying to get the game to a working state.\n\nFinally you mention that H5 already has a 200k pre orders and therefore telling people not to pre order is meaningless. Well here is the problem with that argument, Halo 5 has been available for pre order since at least Jan 7, 2014! That means that it has taken well over a year to reach 200k pre orders! So when you mention looking at that number at the start of April and therefore it should be much higher now, you sound uninformed. As of today that number is 205,691. Compare that to games like Black Ops 2 that reached over 2 million pre orders in a much shorter span of time. Furthermore many of the people that pre order are not doing it at gamestop, so they're risking the full $60 dollars, not just the $5 you have to put down at gamestop.\n\nIn conclusion, not only was I not convinced by your video, but I was actively thinking of how I disagreed with it as I watched. This may just be my own bias speaking, but I felt like there wasn't a very compelling argument there. At least not one backed by the facts.\n\nI'm not trying to be rude or bash your thoughts. Just offering my own 2 cents in response to yours. Now we have 4 cents total! If enough people throw in theirs maybe we can get tree fiddy and buy some of those chips I mentioned.\n\ntl;dr: DON'T DO IT!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429470810", "subreddit": "halo", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Drug scandals? I probably sold them. Fighting? Yeah I won those. SEX SCANDALS? Pff, of course. But there was this girl in my class, Ellie. The complete opposite. She was the most quiet and relaxed student in the whole school. Hell, I couldn't even tell if she was shy or relaxed most of the time. She aced every exam she sat and obviously didn't have the largest friend circle in the school. She was an oddball. Anyway, I digress.\n\nAfter school, I ended up in the same college as Ellie. She was studying Medicine, whereas I was studying Videography and film. She had opened up a little more since high school, let herself loose. Gone into one of those hippie stages I would say. (Yeah, hippie and medicine, great mix!).\n\nI partied with her quite a bit, we drunk together and hung out. She was a really nice girl and I was glad she had come out of her shell. I think it's good to mention at this point that I was very big into the porn scene, my dream was to end up as a cameraman for porn movies, and although the college I attended didn't suit my dreams; I still did everything I could to try and \"make it\" in the porn industry. Ellie was well aware of this and came up to me one day when she was drunk... she flirted quite a bit and suggested that I do some filming with her... She was hot, fuck yeah.\n\nSo we go back to her dorm as her roomate is out and mine is in. I swing by my dorm first and grab my camera. I'm thinking to myself; \"holy shit, this is gonna be good\". We bound into her round and she turns to me. \"Start the camera up then\". I turn it on and at that point I manage to get the first ever footage of the Loch Ness Monster rising up in all its glory as she transforms into this beautiful creature, leans down gracefully and whispers in my ear: \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429541372", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 15, "controversiality": 1}

The latter was of course your standard spread out the cards and find a match 2-player game, and Nintendo was highly interested in developing it for the Asian market.  Without the rights to use actual fish on the cards or in the title + marketing, Nintendo was at a loss.  A then 9 year old Shigeru Miyamoto suggested using water fowl as the depictions on the playing cards, and a series was quickly drawn and printed.

{"body": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a goat in possession of Elder God Summoning Materials must be in want of more Elder God Summoning Materials. So it was for Elizabeth Baahnet, who was one of five sisters living, with their elderly parents, in a stately house in Meehryton, Goatfordshire. Elizabeth's father, Mr Baahnet, a kindly goat with a well-groomed humantee (goats loathed the term 'goatee'), was a retired merchant dealing mostly in books; ancient tomes, of the dusty and heavy-bound variety, usually set with bits of metal and lettered in a variety of suspect inks, lined the venerable library of his mansion. Her mother appeared to most as the polar opposite of her husband: neurotic, with unkempt, shaggy fur, and with a most unpleasant demeanor. It was whispered by some that she indulged in arcane rituals, and that the wool with which she knitted was not, in fact, sourced from finest human as she claimed. The socks she made had an almost otherworldly, perhaps cyclopean quality to them. They kept your hooves warm, though.\n\nThe buzz of the week revolved around the rumour of a party. It appeared that... (wait a minute. Hold on guys, something else just appeared to me. Who *am* I really? Can I tell tales of other great goats without knowing my own worth, or lack thereof? No, sir or madam! I must leave, and find myself!)\n\n**(CTHULHU HERE, JUST TAKING OVER AS YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURHOOD NARRATOR. ...WHAT?

AS ANCIENT GOAT TRADITION REQUIRED, SEVERAL MALE GOATS OF VARIOUS DEGREES OF DESIRABILITY - THIS BEING CALCULATED BY PERSONAL WEALTH, AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS, AND INTELLIGENCE WHICH GOATS APPARENTLY POSSESS - WOULD ATTEMPT TO COURT THE FEMALE GOATS BY CARRYING OUT COMPLEX, NON-EUCLIDEAN PATTERNS OF MOVEMENT IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPACE.

THE PARTY COMMENCED, AND MUCH MERRIMENT WAS HAD BY ALL (ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS MUCH MERRIMENT AS I HAD LAST WEEK WHEN I WENT TO AZATHOTH'S PARTY - THAT RAVING MASS OF MADNESS KNOWS HOW TO THROW A PROPER ONE!). HARDLY ON THE MIND OF ANY WAS THE PATTERNS INVOLVED IN THE GEOMETRIC MOVEMENTS OF THE REVELLING GOATS - NO ONE BUT MRS BAAHNET KNEW THEIR HISTORY, CHANCED UPON IT AS SHE HAD IN ONE OF HER HUSBAND'S ACQUISITIONS.

{"body": "As a resident, I guar-an-tee you that once she left that train (and probably gave a few roses away), she went on to sell the rest of her roses. \n\nI know \"cynical\" - but it is the truth. I will tell you a great story.\n\nThere's a woman who works at a specific subway stop and she is elderly, a woman of color, and walks up to people very nicely and tells them she is sick with cancer. Her who spiel is perfect and she isn't rude, she kills people with kindness asking for a donation for her cancer treatment.\n\nI take the same subway daily, so I see her daily, and way back when I used to give her money too. Eventually I stopped because it was her, at the train, every day asking for money, and after a few years I became suspect.\n\nSo, while I was near the subway I had to go to the bank and use the ATM. I see her in the bank, standing in line. From under her coat, I see her pull out a bag. She opens it and there are bills, stacks of bills, not $1 bills but $10's, $20's and $50's. \n\nFirst off, I was shocked at the amount of money. Then I was pissed because after she deposited an insane amount of money (yes, I was snooping and curious by this point), she leaves the bank and gets into a brand new Mercedes E350 and drives away. \n\nThe next time I saw her, I confronted her, and told her \"How is that brand new Mercedes?\"\n\nShe sputters, \"MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!\" and charges past me, but in doing so she hits me in my arm. At the subway, there are two police, who I happen to know from seeing them daily, who stand there to guard it and they see her do this. \n\nNow what I can't believe is how they wrenched her arm and slammed her to the ground. She's a big girl. It took two of them to wrestle her to the ground. Meanwhile it is a huge scene and a crowd is gaping at the spectacle and i'm actually feeling like a total asshole at this point, watching this old girl get treated like this. \n\nFinally, after getting her cuffed, they stand her up and ask me if I want to press charges. At this point, after everything, I can't do it. I tell them to let her go, that I won't press charges.\n\nThey uncuff her and leave, while she's standing there smiling at me. I'm still kind of pissed off and I tell her, \"Look, whoever you are, just find some other place to go. I think it is disgusting that you prey upon people like this.\"\n\nShe replies, \"I will do that. And my name is Nessie. And I will leave if you give me tree fiddy.\"\n\nThat's when I realize that she isn't some old woman, but that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic Era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\", I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nI never did see her again. \n\ntl;dr: There was an old woman who tried to scam people at the subway, until she was discovered.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1429571551", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 15, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I can tell you from personal experience that laughing while officers are chasing something is not a good idea. \n\nThis one time, many years ago, I was relaxing on the hood of my car around sunset. There was a beautiful sunset in one direction, and some cliffs with giant owls who were exiting for their nightly feeding. I may or may not have been smoking an illegal substance. It was a nice spot, life was good. Then, all of a sudden, a donkey comes by hauling ass about 50 ft in front of me. Right behind the donkey come several sherrifs, angrily shouting and chasing said donkey. I think to myself, well this is even more interesting than the owls. The sherrifs are mad. They cannot catch this wily donkey. There's bad words being shouted at the donkey, and a couple of injuries from a local cactus. This donkey refuses to be cornered, and is just generally being a jerk. There is a lot of hee hawing (from the donkey). I on the other hand, being broke, was starved for entertainment and thoroughly and enthusiastically enjoyed the show. I occasionally shouted helpful things, like Brutality! and go donkey go! There was laughing (me) and some tears. This was some funny stuff.  After about an hour,  the sherrifs managed to wrangle the donkey into a capturing position. I applauded, clapping loudly. Well I found out that evening that guess what, sherrifs chasing donkeys absolutely did not appreciate my enthusiastic banter. They approached me, some might say with attitude, and said some angry words, like aheadinabox where is your ID, what are you doing here. I handed over ID, which returned the fact that I had a failure to appear warrant and that I was going to jail that evening. For some reason this cheered up and amused these formerly cranky cops, and they all seemed to be jockeying for the honor of taking me to jail. Real funny, huh? Well I was off to jail, had a wonderful baloney sandwich for dinner and enjoyed the AC and the charming compadres I met in The Pit. I saw the judge the next morning, and I told him the entire donkey tale. I explained that I thought the cops had no probable cause to ask for my ID, because laughing is not a crime. He disagreed with me and told me what my punishment was. I managed to pay the fine and have never laughed out loud at police since. The fine wasn't much, it was tree fitty.

I looked around only for a pistol, and managed to find a used one for only fifty dollars! Quite a steal, considering it was a perfectly fine pistol.\n\nThe seller asked to meet me in a rather populated, but poor section of town. I didn't have anything against that, but felt a bit troubled by it. I ended up meeting the guy around noon, talked with him a bit, and he was a pretty cool guy, just low on funds, and needed to pay the bills.\n\nHe offered to teach me how to shoot the gun for only a few dollars, so I accepted, nothing wrong with that, of course. Thus, he set up some bottles on the other side of the crowded street, and started to try to show me how to shoot the gun. However, I would be shooting past other bystanders, and one of them even yelled that I had a gun.

{"body": "Honestly a friendly and honorable staff will win you customer loyalty here's a story about how my LGS won mine.\n\nOn the road trip to AK I got the itch, the absolute unnerving need for a 9mm. Didn't have one, wanted one, had to have one. I wanted a Beretta 92. I had a budget of $350 (seriously, not a tree fiddy joke), called up my now LGS and asked if they could get me one of the 92S surplus pistols that everyone's been seeing lately. They said sure, transfer would be $10. I said OK I'll call SOG and have them call you.\n\n3 days later (and still on the two week road trip), SOG still hasn't gotten in contact with my LGS after repeated calls and emails from both my LGS and I. So I call up my LGS and the following conversation begins:\n\nMe: Hey, it's not working out with SOG, so I think I'd still like to order a 92S but this time from Classic Firearms.\n\nLGS: Ok sure, but let me ask, are you just trying to get a 9mm Beretta? Because I have one here in the store for sale.\n\nMe: Really? What's the model and price? Used or new?\n\nLGS: It's a 92FS, used with a good amount of wear. About as much as any surplus 92S you'd get anyways. Comes with a locking beretta case and 2 magazines, one 10 round, and one 15. $500. \n\nMe: Well that's kind of far out of my price range, any chance you can come down to maybe $350 since that's my budget?\n\nShockingly he said yes. Up till then I'd only met stingy gun dealers or vendors who wouldn't haggle even $50 less than what they wanted. This guy was coming down almost $200. I said deal and asked him to hold it for me. \n\n2 weeks later after the road trip, I walked in at the time I'd said I'd be there with $350 cash, and walked out with a new (to me) pistol.\n\nWhen I got the pistol home, I discovered it already had the upgraded metal parts kit. I was even more ecstatic. \n\nRemember, keeping your customer happy is pivotal in any retail business. Especially gun stores I feel since they often get bad reps. Help them out with deals every now and then, give them a real reason to come to you instead of Cabelas, or Bass Pro, or where ever else. Make getting what they want easier for them than the competitor.\n\n\nAlso have .22LR. Seriously. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429622740", "subreddit": "guns", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;You were arguing that one definition was right and the other was wrong.\n\nAristodemos94: \"Atheism makes a claim that no Gods exist\"\n\nGreyhaven: \"No it does not [wikipedia]\"\n\nMe: \"Yes it does [references to scholarly articles and dictionaries]\"\n\nI've said multiple times that my argument isn't that one definition is \"right\". I believed I followed the above^ immediately with something like \"when the common and the technical definitions of atheism refer to a belief in no-God, what is there left to define it?\" I'm appealing to popularity (because  language gets its strength from how many people understand a phrase) and to legitimate authorities (philosophy scholars).\n\nI'm not telling **you** to stop using whatever definition you want among internet atheists. Merely that it's rather pointless to be correcting others.\n\n&gt;\"Why don't you just call yourself this, because other people won't accept your definition of terms\" is not an acceptable bit of advice, personally. I will defy anyone that wants me to change how I define myself and what terms I use without good reason. \"I learned this in a religious studies class\" is not a good reason. \"Most academics wouldn't use that word that way in an academic setting\" is irrelevant.\n\nBut not only do most academics use that word that way in an academic setting, so too do common folk. I mean, what *is* a good reason to use a word in a particular way, if not \"this is how almost everyone else uses it and therefore is the most effective way to communicate\"?\n\nThe flipside of adopting your definition of the word is that it infringes on how other people want to define themselves (i.e \"agnostics\", who are now shoehorned into \"atheism\").\n\n&gt;Because an agnostic hasn't rejected theism in how I understand the word. Rejecting theism on the basis of the burden of proof not having been met isn't the same as believing NOT theism, since believing NOT theism necessarily entails a burden of proof. What am I supposed to prove about something I don't believe? However believing NOT does require me to prove that NOT is true.\n\nWhy \"understand\" the word like that then? When I found out that I was using \"belies\" differently to the technically-correct AND common usage, I immediately changed how I used the word without any sort of fuss.\n\nI disagree with the second sentence, let's see if you disagree with the following: \"assigning a low credibility to one possibility is the same as assigning a high credibility to its negation\".\n\n&gt;Because it accounts for someone that is not certain or willing to weigh in on the certainty, but doesn't believe in a god when asked due to the burden of proof not being met.\n\nI think you misunderstood the question. What \"imbues\" a word with a particular definition? Has the collection of sounds in the word \"atheism\" inherently been drawn towards being defined as \"mere lack of belief\" from the beginning of time, or what?\n\nIn any case, the atheist/theist/agnostic/ignostic covers all bases just fine, clarifying additional details without forcing someone into a box. Someone not willing to weigh in either way is called \"agnostic\". Not entirely sure that \"needs evidence\" even needs its own word - what people believe implicitly contains that which they believe has evidence supporting it, we all need **some** sort of evidence (not necessarily proof) before we believe something.\n\n&gt;The second the missionary pushed across the concept of a god, and they rejected the position of theism, they were atheists. But did they take the stance that god certainly does not exist? No they took the stance that the burden of proof had not yet been met, obviously. \n\nFrankly it's strange how you know their religious stance in such striking detail - do we know that they distinguished between \"believe not\" and \"not believe\", and that they consciously chose the latter if so? Most people don't really make that distinction - \"I don't believe in the tooth fairy\" is generally accepted to imply \"I believe that the tooth fairy doesn't exist\".\n\nRegardless, I see this all the time: \"I don't believe that God doesn't exist because I don't claim that God certainly can't exist indubitably for sure\". The two aren't the same thing - we believe things false all the time despite lacking certainty. If they didn't believe the missionary's claim, then I'd assume that they treated said claim like they treated the claim \"there's a unicorn in my bedroom\" - most people would tentatively treat it as false.\n\n&gt;The innocent until proven guilty is a presumed convention for the sake of fairness.\n\nI'm not talking about the convention - people will tentatively believe that a person is innocent long before he's conclusively proven as such. When the batsman hits the ball and it's flying toward the man with the huge glove, I will tentatively believe that the gloved person will catch it before it's conclusively proven that he does. And I have evidence (the general trajectory of the ball and the preparedness of the catcher). It's not conclusive, but since when did belief ever **need** to be?\n\nSomeone once told me that he refused to accept any epistemology that required him to be \"agnostic\" about fairies or the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n&gt;There's a distinction between those two people, wouldn't you agree?\n\nYes, but it's pretty irrelevant. The only difference is that one person assigns a higher credibility to the existence of God. We'd simply call this \"different degrees of certainty\". In terms of belief, this is called \"strong\" and \"weak\".\n\nAs a side note, \"gnostic theist\" means something completely different.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429653297", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm a hydrologist who often does work with ceramic material engineers and you're actually partially correct. Different grades of glass and ceramics have different properties associated with them which can impact how they perform in certain commercial and industrial situations. Because of this, there are certain standards set forth by various industry leaders (Dow, DuPont, Locke Medical, etc) going through all the standardization tests is a hassle for engineers and contractors, but some jobs require it. A good material fabricator can make a piece within ±5% of the standard (I've worked with some guys who can get it down to ±1%, but that's rare). Of all the properties considered, one of the primary ones is, in fact, surface tension. Surface tension is one of the coolest parts of water, in small tubes you can actually get water to flow *against* the force of gravity. That level of surface tension is not usually necessary (except in Dow Laboratory Grade-B Glass, Locke Grade-5 and a few others) but surface tension is still an important factor in ceramics. If you have an important valve in a closed system, you want to know how well your liquids are going to flow through it. That introduces another primary property of 'flow', which you also mentioned. As you can imagine, proper flow in an industrial system is very important. What I haven't touched on yet is commercial applications. Fine glassware manufacturers are particularly concerned with the surface tension and flow of their glasses and often put their glassware through rigorous testing by running water over it. This testing can get expensive, and is usually calculated as cost per dozen. I once decided to ask a few fellow hydrologists what their CPD was and the average was around tree fiddy. It was then that I realized that these testing standards were not standards at all but instead a 500 foot tall dinosaur from the paleolithic period.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429672978", "subreddit": "mildlyinteresting", "score": 98, "controversiality": 0}

Definitely nonfictional!**\n**Plot: Using a Time-Turner and a new portal stabilized in the Department of Mysteries that allows our camera team and hosts to jump back in time, we find out the TRUTH about the past.**\n\n\nWho are the main characters of your TV show? (5 points)\n\n**Buzz and Nessie are our hosts, with Nathan on the camera and Vanessa on sound.  Silphy the kneazle is in charge of lighting and doubles as the team’s mascot.**\n\n\nWhat is your demographic and how do you think this TV show would do? (5 points)\n\n**The best word I can come up with to describe this show is “edu-tainment.” Not only is it educational and shows a new perspective on history, but it is also enjoyable with action, humor and plenty of guts and glory (for violence reasons, this show is not recommended for witches and wizards under the age of 16). I imagine it would be quite popular indeed, with plenty of younger teens trying to sneak the show without their parents knowing.**\n\n\nWrite up a Synopsis (three to five paragraphs) of one of the episodes or the series arc. (10 points)\n\n**From an undisclosed place in Wizarding Britain, a group of four wizards and witches and their unnaturally intelligent kneazle buddy (two hosts and their camera team) have created a portal that allows them to travel back with a Time Turner and return to present day to show everyone what they’ve encountered.  Each episode involves visiting a different point in time and trying to “live a day in the life” for 24 hours.  Witness the humor, drama and suspenseful moments as our hosts travel and meet all of our favorite historical figures from Abraxus the Brave to Zarzincuzz the Not Too Bright.**\n\n**This is not your grandmother’s history program!  Be prepared for 100% Reality TV!**\n\n**The first season of Time-Turner Time will specifically handle the origins of Merlin, including his time at Hogwarts.  Was he actually a Slytherin student?  What were his favorite hobbies and extracurricular activities?  Who was his first love?  Will you visit the same places he did in the present and follow in his footsteps?  We’ll explore this and more on Merlin- The Original Wunderkind!**\n\n**Both Buzz and Nessie are adept morphamaguses with over twenty years’ experience, who can literally change their features to match any appearance.  Our camera crew is made up of animaguses with a history of stealth work. They will go undercover under the most dangerous of circumstances- daily school life with daily bonuses as the crew films their own reactions to having infiltrated our favorite, beloved school, becoming a new student at the very school they hail from as alumni!**\n\n**The second season promises to be even more extreme, as they will travel into the heart of the Goblin Wars, choosing specific times before, during and after to show firsthand the devastation and politics in play.  Aurors and Unspeakables will be on hand at all times to ensure that no historical timelines will be altered, and both the crew and hosts have signed forms that ensure the network will be held harmless if they do indeed lose their lives, so their survival is not guaranteed.  Our network’s more...sadistic viewers may find this adds an extra level of excitement to the show.**\n\n\nGuaranteed Bonus! Design a poster or promo for your TV show.

{"body": "That's true, in exactly the same way that it's true that no available evidence conclusively proves that it's not actually imperceptible gravity gremlins who make things go the way that theories of gravity predict. \n\nThe available evidence also technically doesn't distinguish between there being no leprechauns and there being tons of leprechauns who are just really good at hiding.  Same for Bigfoot, Nessie, and lizard people. \n\nBut in each case, there's zero reason to believe these things. I'm not arguing that the evidence rules out your view completely in a conclusive,  completely unquestionable sense (he said, for the umpteenth time) .  I'm just trying to show you that your belief is enormously silly in exactly the same way that most other silly delusions are silly. \n\nOf course, it could be true!  After all, there are an infinite number of things that technically could be true given available evidence.  I mean, as I said, by that standard, maybe there's a dragon standing behind you RIGHT NOW!!!1!one.  But that is a very low bar, and puts you in very low company. \n\nAnyway...I will tell you how I choose what to  \"take on faith\" once you tell me what you mean by \"take on faith\". \n\nBut as a tiny hint, I will say that I've stolen a lot of tricks from a very good method for evaluating empirical claims called \"science\" in which,  following a few basic assumptions  which even crazy people share with me (such as the assumption that there is an external world about which at least some information can be gathered through experience), we learn to do things like evaluate evidence in the effort to determine what sorts of things are most likely to be true. \n\nIf you will believe it, humans have had some small successes using this approach. \n\n(oh, and I if you do reply, could you please attempt to make a new point,  rather than rehash arguments I've already addressed? I'm tired of repeating myself.  In particular, I'd like for you to avoid saying anything more about how your belief has not been proven impossible, since we have Fucking. Gone. Over. That.)

Sometimes I found it really creepy and walked faster than usual: other times I was totally fine.\n\nOne night I was walking home and I got about 5 minutes from my house and just got a really eerie feeling that someone was behind me. I had my iPod in but I took it out so that I could hear anything if there was someone coming up behind me.\n\nI had to walk past this underpass from the train tracks and people always called it nasty things and said people were raped and assaulted there. It had been raining a lot and it was kinda flooded.\n\nThat's when I thought I heard someone scream. It was a creepy kind of scream, like a muffled cry for help and I panicked. I'm a young girl myself so I didn't really want to go running thru the tunnel to see what it was but I didn't want to keep walking to find out the next day in the news that something awful had happened.\n\nSo I called out, \"hello?\" Thinking that if someone were being attacked and they heard my voice then their attacker would run away. Nothing.\n\nSo I walked towards the tunnel and thats when I saw it. On the ground in the tunnel in a huge puddle was a monster from the Palaeolithic area. It met my eye and asked for tree fiddy. I threw a dollar at it, thinking it would leave me alone and I ran the rest of the way home.\n\nAfter that night I started taking the bus.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429796768", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "When I was in college, one winter I was working late in the computer lab in the Comm building. I had been editing a movie for hours when I looked up and saw the admin and all the other students were gone. It was about 3AM, so I figured I had done enough work for the day, packed up, and started heading back to my dorm.\n\nAs I passed the student center, I saw a tall man standing in the alcove where the door to the arcade was. It was pitch black, save for the street lamps that campuses have to leave on for students, and not a soul in sight. He saw me as I saw him and said, \"Sean!\", and started walking towards me.\n\nI froze in my tracks, my breath got rapid and shallow, and my heart was straight up beating out of my chest. The man was wearing khakis, a blue polo shirt, a watch, and tennis shoes.  In the middle of February. \n\nAs he approached the pool of light, I saw him raise his right arm to wave at me. He stopped right in the middle of it. \"Hey Sean, come over here!\"\n\nIt was my dad.\n\nMind you, my parents lived in New Jersey at the time, and I went to school in Arkansas. My parents hadn't talked to me about coming to see me, or being in the area, or anything else that would justify my father hanging out on my school campus at 3:00 in the morning in the middle of February in short sleeves with no luggage or outerwear with him. But I swear to god, it was my dad.\n\nI yelled back to him, \"Dad?\"\n\n\"Yeah! Come over here, I need to ask you something.\"\n\nLook, in retrospect, *of course* I shouldn't have gone over there. **No shit.** But it was 3AM, cold, and every sense (save logic) was checking in to say, \"That's your dad over there.\" So I walked over.\n\nAs I approached, he smiled. The light from the overhead street light cast a weird, long shadow over his face, so I couldn't see his eyes as I approached. But I saw his smile, the same smile I had seen from the day I was born until the day I moved to college. Even as my rational mind screamed, \"GET AWAY!\", I walked up to him.\n\nHe put his hand on my shoulder, the same way he had done hundreds of times over the years. It sent both reassurance and a chill through my bones. \"Sean...\"\n\nI looked up at him. \"Yeah Dad?\"\n\n\"...I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this moment that I realized my father was about 700 feet tall and from the paleolithic era, and wasn't actually my father at all. I shook its enormous flipper from my shoulder and ran as fast as I could, shouting back at him, \"God damn it, Loch Ness Monsta!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429817417", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

I just wanted to get this off my chest. USA is always a country of immigrants and hence has very loosely coupled culture. So what assimilation are you talking about? Assimilating to the 15% Italians ancestry Americans or the 15% german americans or the 15% Irish americans?? Why assimilate to them when they are simply following what their ancestor taught them?

I say \"Sure, why not?\" , and tag along with them.\n\n45 minutes later on day 2 , everyone was in Custody after a blotched rescue of the host. They all used they first aid kits and ammo bags, and all were waiting on me to hold off the wave of policemen until they could respawn and move the last remaining bags out the \"safety ditch\" into the helicopter (host said he had the hostage skill for cops, it wasn't mastered though). Police surround me, and I run out of ammo on my primary(JP36 best gun), and then swap to my secondary, a silenced Gruber, modded up with the slide, Plus a laser sight.  I had that, since we were trying to stealth the first section of it(not my idea but whatever). Using that I circle around a cop group and just go absolutely ham on them, picking up ammo for the primary. Then using that, I held out on the airfields far side,not the ditch, pass the wave, and get my guys back to succed on the mission, winning the challenge and a achievement as well!\n\nEveryone was so happy, and alot of folks went up a few levels, and disconnected to get their stuff, but me and the host started talking about doing more heists for leveling up. I asked how the the host got downed in the first place. He said he must have needed, and this is a true qoute, \"tree fiddy\" snipers shots to go down. Now it was about this time I realized that the host was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

There were always people there, friendly people too.  You would arrive during lunch, dinner, and there was always laughter, always people smiling... you could just feel the love.  The pizza was divine.  Crispy outside, chewy inside, the most tasteful mozzarella cheese you've ever tasted in your life.  I remember going there after soccer games and I'd try new toppings every time.  I swear every time I tried it, it just got better and better.  Their peppers were crunchy with a huge burst of flavor, their onions were strong but didn't linger, and their pepperoni was locally made by a deli that was right next door.\n\nI remember one time I was coming home from a soccer game and my dad took me there.

Run to the end of the room and you'll find a messenger fountain (kinda like the one you may find in chalice dungeons to get certain chalices) that will sell you a blood rock.

{"body": "If this was new52 walrus, this would be a totally different story (some of his offscreen feats are on par with reality benders/gods/immortals after he became enchanted by the Magic Fairy Wizard Man) but Silver Age walrus makes it a much more fair fight.\n\n\nMy guess is it would go like this. Bear is obv on his home turf on the moon, so I'll give him benefit of the doubt and say he gets an ambush on walrus. tbh the battle could end right here and now, if bear can pull off his Magnemite Chainlink Combo without interruption. But, I think walrus would be able to run to a safer location w/ his velociraptor legs (I'm assuming this is post-robot transplant, if not he's probably dead now.)\n\n\nNow that they're back on equal playing fields, walrus goes to town with his kung fu wizardry, seriously damaging bear. Again, though, bear's home town advantage comes into play. He knows where the secret cave of the Keyboard People is, so he secretly brings the fight there. When he arrives, the tiny Keyboard People flood the battlefield, sewing chaos. In the midst of the confusion, bear has enough time to shit out a lvl 128 Magnemite he got from talking to the man in Viridian City then surfing near Cinnibar. Big Daddy Magnemite unleashes a fully EV trained, choice spec'd thunder attack at walrus, going for the KO.\n\n\nJust in time, though, there is a shadow that blocks out the sun. A 30 foot monster lands on the moon just in time to deflect the thunder bolt. Lord Gaben has descended with a portal gun and a gravity gun in hand. Things are looking pretty grim for bear, but he isn't without help of his own. 4Chan Shrek digitizes from the masses of the Keyboard People. Although the battle seems lost, he has a trollface grin the size of you mama on his face. He has a plan. He shoves his fist up bear's asshole and pulls out his undigested lunch: a juniper tree. \n\n\nGaben, at the sight of something edible, loses all cognitive function and reverts to beast-mode. He lunges for the tree and swallows it in one gulp. He's essentially incapacitated for the rest of the fight as he needs time, space, and tranquility to digest. The fight is now 2v1, team bear is feeling confident. However, Gaben did not consume the tree so quickly that walrus didn't see it. Walrus gets mad.\n\n\nHis human arms melt off his body and are replaced by gigantic lobster claws, each one made of a different semi-permeable aluminum alloy, teeth sharp enough to cut through armor yet still slice a tomato. The toes on his raptor legs grow massive octapus tentacles. His tusks become supercharged with the energy of 1000 years of darkness. He has reached his final form.\n\n\nWith his now heightened intelligence, walrus aligns his brainwaves with the radio messages coming from earth. He manages to intercept a catalogue of all known Pokemon and their weaknesses. He sees the massive magnemite slowly emerging from bear's anus. He mentally reads the pokedex entry on the magnet pokemon. \n\n\n&gt; Magnemite, the asshole Pokemon. Magnemite is known to burrow into the asshole of various woodland creatures, able to be shat out on a moment's notice. If you stab it in it's eye, it immediately ruptures the asshole of it's father creature.\n\n\nWalrus pushes his glasses back onto his face and flashes an evil smile. He extends his octo-toes to grab hold of the massive magnemite that has now emerged. Using his giga-tusks, he punctures the gargantuan being's eyeball like a wiener stabbing a hooha. The creature screams in pain and grows 10 times it's size, now being almost as large as the moon itself. It extends one of it's magnet hands inside of bear's asshole and starts shredding. 4chan  Shrek looks on in horror. \n\n\n\"Please stop! I'll give you anything you want if you just leave my bear friend alone! What is it you want?\"\n\n\nThe titanic magnemite looks down upon the tiny Shrek. \"I'm gon' need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429869822", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Saying that atheism is 'simply a lack of a belief' is becoming more and more common as a debate tactic \n\nInteresting, I didn't realize explaining my view about Gods is a \"tactic\". Let's look at the options and maybe this will help explain my views:\n\n* I don't believe in Gods. What is this called? Atheism? Agnosticism?\n* I do not believe there are no Gods. This is because I have no evidence for that belief. It's possible that we lack the mental awareness, technology, and possibly space exploration that could one day lead us to Gods in the same way it has led us to see the outer reaches of the universe (so far!). I cannot confidently say that no Gods exist. I could say that about particular Gods that make particular claims. For example, Helios - as described - doesn't exist. We know there is no chariot in the sky - that's just the Sun. However, to me, atheism means all Gods, not just a particular view of a particular God.\n* As a result of this lack of knowledge either way (if Gods exist or not), that's called agnosticism.\n\nSo, I go by agnostic atheist: I don't believe in Gods but I don't know for sure. If you argue that the label is JUST agnosticism then I have to say that there are agnostic theists (and I believe most theists are agnostic theists) so I find the label incomplete. Besides, it's a label I apply to myself. If you feel like it's the wrong label to use, ok, thanks for your opinion. In our debates, I'll refer myself as belief #293Alpha6 which is defined above.\n\nIn addition, you need to go back to default positions. What is the default position for any claim? It's lack of belief in that claim (due to lack of awareness of that claim) but lack of knowledge to say it's true or false. That's exactly what I described above. It doesn't need to be proven - it's the default position of every claim. Young babies are agnostic atheists (though the more proper term is weak atheism due to lack of awareness of Gods).\n\n&gt; carried to its logical conclusion, it suggests that inanimate objects (which likewise can be described as 'lacking a belief') are atheists\n\nNope, atheism can only be used on intelligent lifeforms that know about Gods. If you go by technicalities that \"if you don't believe in Gods, you're an atheist\" then you could say that objects are atheists but that's a pretty silly thing to say.\n\n&gt; No matter what you believe at this point, however, it is more than \"lacking a belief\".\n\nActually it's exactly that since most reasonable people would pick the middle option of \"you have no evidence that they are or are not blue\". That's definitely lacking a belief but also lacking knowledge to prove or disprove the concept.\n\n&gt;  No, because although there are many ways to be unconvinced, all of them involve a positive belief of some sort.\n\nWow, I must be special because I have absolutely zero belief in Gostak. Do you seriously have some positive belief in Gostak, because that's crazy.\n\n&gt; You can believe that Gostaks are generally red\n\nActually, you're jumping the gun - my first hurdle is their existence before we get into color.\n\nNow let me try to figure out what you were trying to say. Let's say you are talking about a man named Gostak. I could then say that I still don't believe he existed but I could have some preconceptions about their maximum/minimum size, color, various attributes, etc. But that's not belief, it's a vague concept of physical appearance.\n\n&gt; They believe that the idea of a God is incoherent.\n\nI don't believe this.\n\n&gt; They believe that they have outgrown beliefs in the supernatural\n\nNo, I just can't reliably tell the difference between the supernatural and fiction.\n\n&gt; that the sooner theists do the same, the better we'll all be\n\nI don't think that. I only care what you believe in when you try to negatively affect the lives of others.\n\n&gt; if they did, the moment I asked them a related question, like 'what would it take to convince you', they would have to answer \"I have no idea.\"\n\nThis is a simple answer but a lot depends on the claims. If you say: do you believe in God who fulfils prayers? I can say no and when you ask what'll take to convince me, I'll say: let's start by having me pray and see if what I pray about will come true. Then I will pray for a 900 quadrillion ton turtle to float above New York City without any gravitational effects and see if that happens. If it does, then that'll go a long way towards me believing in that God.\n\n&gt; there are atheists who literally think they don't ever need to support an argument\n\nWhy would you need to support a default position? Do I need to disprove the Loch Ness monster when I say I don't believe in it? I only need to disprove Nessie when I say Nessie doesn't exist. I can easily do that by figuring how much food it would need to survive and lacking these available resources, Nessie is disproven. God is a lot more wiggly.\n\nIt seems like your TL;DR position is that everyone must have a belief in something or they have a belief that this something isn't real. That there are no middle in the middle who don't believe and have no proof either way.\n\n&gt; I've never seen someone describe themselves as having absolute 100% knowledge on this subject, and yet we need categories to describe them. Why?\n\nWell let me throw this back into the theist world. Most theists don't actually have proof of their Gods. They have faith and due to that faith, they believe in them. Is this knowledge? No, it's faith - which isn't knowledge. So, agnostic (no knowledge) theist (God-believer). This is as opposed to gnostic theists who have knowledge rather than faith to prove their position.\n\n&gt; Why not commit to something?\n\nLack of evidence against. Also, it implies that I live in the limited world of one God. What about people who lived 2000 years ago - did they believe in Jesus? No but they could have been convinced later in life.\n\n&gt; My point is that 'lacking a belief that the coin is either heads or tails' is still a belief.\n\nNo it's not, unless \"I believe in nothing about the coin\" is a belief. It's an empty and worthless belief, if it is one.\n\n&gt; I am awesome.\n\nSubjective statement that doesn't apply.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nHere's the thing... if you don't like the definitions of terms then that's fine, I'm sorry, but that's how it goes. Definitions change over time, like what a \"person\" means. If you don't like it then I guess you'll just have to put up with everyone else who uses the term differently than you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429884581", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "26 M here, this happened years ago.\n\nMet a girl in college, extremely beautiful and intelligent. Cute, well put together Puerto Rican woman with a smile that melted me. We had an economics class together and ended up in a study group together.\n\nBefore this I was in one bad relationship after another. Cheated on, shitted on and somehow always attracted the crazies. Being an athlete, I shouldn't care right? I could get any woman I wanted. But I was looking for real love and she seemed to be the one. We started dating and continued dating for a few months. We were absolutely in love. Deep, soul bearing love.\n\nOne day towards the end of our second semester, she came to my apartment. I opened the door to her crying her eyes out. I asked her what's wrong and she told me she had to go back home to Florida (we went to school in NYC.) When asked why, she was very hesitant and sort of stuttering her answer. She said \"he's sick.\" I asked who is he? She then responded with, \"he's dying and I have to see him before he goes.\" Me thinking it was her father or brother told her I'd come with her. She shouted \"NO!\" and began crying harder.\n\nSo after a few minutes of this I invited her in. Grabbed a beer and placed it in front of her at the table. I asked her calmly and with love.. \"Baby, please tell me. What's wrong?\" What she told me sucked the breath right out of me. The knot in my throat felt like a ton of pebbles struggling to work itself down my esophagus. She told me that her fiance in Florida is sick and dying. HER FIANCE!! She's been with this guy since sophomore year of high school, while dating me in college!! I asked her why she didn't tell me this, I thought we were in love. She said she did love me, and she loved him. But being far away she needed someone that cared for her, because he used to care for her like no other. I was the sucker that she chose. I was heartbroken.\n\nSo we both decided it was best to part ways, but with zero hate. I kissed her on the forehead and said goodbye. As she walked out the door I said in a high pitched voice, \"I'm here for you when you get back. If you need anything, I'll do it!\" I thought this would be just a one statement thing, and she would walk away,out of my life. Instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nI never saw her again after that. Last I heard from one of her campus friends is that she decided to stay in Florida. That changed my life forever.\n\nTL;DR No matter how beautiful she is and how in love you are, sometimes it's best to let go.

{"body": "*Story tiiiiime!!*\n\n**Paul and his fucking pony porn.**\n\nOkay, so we met back in college. Shared the same boring class with the most boring professor in the world. Have my laptop on, taking notes? Nope, I'm on this fucking site. Load a page and I see I have a new notification. Get the message and it's along the lines of \"This class is boring! Lol\". Alrighty, what the fuck? Reply back asking who it is and they tell me to turn around. I do so and it's Paul.\n\nNow Paul is.... ugh... a treat. Big guy, looks like he doesn't get out much and has the strangest smell coming off of him. I've talked to him a few times before and he had seen my laptop and--I still don't fucking know how--saw my username. So we keep messaging, and somehow we end up grabbing lunch after class. After some chatting I realize he is actually a pretty nice guy. His pony porn fetish aside, nice dude. We end up becoming pretty good friends. He is super awkward and never goes out so when I'd go to parties or out for drinks I'd drag him out too. My friends couldn't see anything in him, let alone why I'd hang out with him, but they got used to him.\nPaul always insisted he hated it, but I'd take him to the mall and we'd have a \"shopping day\". He had never had a girlfriend but told me he really wanted one. Well damn, being his friend I told him I'd help. He could talk to me so I promised he'd be able to talk to other girls too. After some time, and a bath and new clothes later, he was ready to go on his first date with one of my friends Janelle. She was a sweetheart and genuinely liked Paul, even before he was \"transformed\" and confident in himself dating. They go to dinner and come to my place where I have some other friends over for drinks. Talking to Janelle aside, she tells me the date went well. I find Paul and almost break his back hugging him so hard, I was so happy.\n\nWell after some time everyone is good and drunk. Paul didn't drink much so it's hitting him really hard. One thing led to another and everyone is discussing television shows. Out of nowhere, Paul pulls out his phone and proceeds to show everyone in the room multiple pony porn pictures he has saved on his phone. Discussing how amazing the show is and how sexy the characters are.\nI'm drunk and I start laughing my ass off seeing everyone's reactions. I look at Janelle and she is mortified, I thought she was going to puke. Another guy grabs his phone and throws it in the pool. Everyone else starts laughing and Paul starts freaking the hell out. He runs into the house and disappears. At this point I feel horrible for laughing at him. Everyone ends up leaving my place and I go find Paul. He's locked in the bathroom and all I hear is sobbing coming from the bathroom. After a few minutes he lets me in and I apologize but explain to him that what he did was fucking stupid. We keep talking and I remember his phone is still at the bottom of the pool. My guilt skyrockets. I felt like an asshole for this even more. I ask Paul what kind of phone it was and where he got it. Promising to pay for the damage. He just kinda laughs and tells me it's okay and not to worry about it. I insist on giving him money for it and ask him how much he'd need for a replacement phone. He thinks it over a minute and tells me, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" That's when I realized my pony porn loving friend was really a goddamn 500 foot tall monster from the Paleozoic era. I get up and tell him, \"Goddamnit monster, get the fuck out of my house!\" I ended up taking his phone and throwing it away. I was so pissed off. All of that time I'd spent with him, the friend I though I knew was totally bullshitting me.\n\nHaven't seen him since!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429927418", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I was only 19, but was in a dry spell of 6 months after my girlfriend of a year broke up with me.\nI generally kept myself busy over those months working at a factory for most of the day, but I finally couldn't handle it anymore. I needed that sweet release. My buddy John who I had known since childhood had the best ahem magazine collection in town.\n\n\nI traded him 2 packs of cigs, which at the time were about $1.75 per pack, for my mag of choice. Unfortunately that same weekend my family was hosting the family reunion at our house. I left work a little early to see if I could get back before any of them arrived, but I was two late.\n\n\nMy second cousin, lets call her Tiffany, had the best ass I have ever seen. I stand by that statement even today. But god did it get my my blood pumping. I couldn't take it anymore. I ran out to my truck, grabbed the bag with the magazine, and ran out to the woods.\n\n\nI wasn't thinking clearing. Before I knew it I was sitting on a log beating the fuck out of my dick like it killed my dog. Next I heard \"Kent?\". fuck. She watched me run into the woods and followed me. Quick as a flash I threw my dick into the waste of my pants, magazine into the bag, and bag under the log.\n\n\nShe didn't expect a thing. Unfortunately I was never able to find that log again. Thankfully I only payed about tree fiddy getting it.\n\n\nTL:DR Young, no sex in months, crazy porn collection, hot cousin.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429929760", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

We rarely get anyone in after 8pm, which means I have the place to myself and it can get quite boring.\n\nNow the layout of the place is such that we have a counter just in the door that's open during the day for personalised cleaning services and whatnot, and the machines for daily use go from the entrance around the corner, so they're not in sight.\n\nMost of the machines are stacked, one on top of the other, but around the corner there is one machine out of sight that is standalone. It has a flat top. You can see where this is going.\n\nSo one particular evening when I was feeling a little frisky, I put some change into the machine to start it going on a spin cycle. I have to clear the money out of the machines after we close (the doors have to be locked) so I could just pop some money in and take it out later on.\n\nThe machine going full bore, and I am out of sight. So I position myself on the corner and just sit on top of the machine. With the right angle, it's quite a remarkable experience. I have to move around a bit to find the perfect spot, but believe me, once there it's quite intense. So I'm just sitting there, having a lot of fun, when a customer walks in. Our door has a bell on it, so upon hearing this I immediately jump off and straighten my dress, somewhat irritated I didn't get to the end. Anyway, a gentleman walks in, and puts his laundry into one of the machines nearby. I watch him, and he looks irritated.\n\n\"This machine won't accept my money,\" he said to me.\n\n\"Oh, sometimes they do that, just keep trying and it'll work eventually,\" I reply, hoping I didn't look too flushed.\n\nHe tries again, and I'm feeling very antsy, eyeing the machine whirring away in the corner that I just left.\n\n\"Nope, look,\" he says. I walk over and try to see what the problem is. \"Maybe you can swap these coins so I can try different ones?\" he adds.\n\nIt's at this point I look at his outstretched hand, and see he's holding about tree fiddy. It was around this time I realised that he was actually 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said, and he swam out of the laundromat. I looked back, but the spin cycle of my machine had finished, and we were closing soon. I'd have to try another time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429967023", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 514, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, so even though you left out a serious tag and this post will turn to crap, I've been wanting to tell my story for quite some time.\nI am a successful man in his mid 40's who has had trouble finding a woman for quite some time. After many failed dates, failed attempts at online dating, and getting screwed over by a few women. I had given up. I told myself that I didn't need someone anymore and that I could go through life without a woman. Well, after about 5 years I started feeling depressed and lonely, as many men would. The only sex I was having was either with unattractive gold diggers or prostitutes. I felt like scum, the bottom of the barrel. I started feeling like I really needed some kind of companion, and even though dogs are great, it's not the same as a woman. So one day at the bar my friends mentioned something about mail order brides, and how they knew someone who's done it, and it was successful. So this sorta piqued my interest.\n\nAfter about a year of contemplation and research, I decided I was interested in trying it out. I had been attracted to Asian women so I found a company in Thailand that does the whole setup and finds you a \"match.\" The process was very long, it took about 4 months to get things set in stone, I had to travel to Bangkok a few times, which was slightly costly. These mail order brides are very expensive, and the service I used was fairly reasonable, about 10k plus flights. Everything was great, she spoke English fairly well, she was very willing to have sex, and I did spoil her because she liked it a lot. Anyways, we got married at the courthouse in 08. I didn't invite my friends or family because I was worried about how they would perceive my mail order bride. I tried to keep it a secret as best I could. Over time, her entire demeanor changed. She got angry at me all the time over little things like forgetting to pick up her dry cleaning and when I would ask her to stop smacking her lips while she ate. Our annoying habits were driving each other crazy and it destroyed our relationship. She didn't have any friends in the US, so I think she felt like she was stuck with me. In 2013 we had a particularly nasty argument where she said she just wanted to go home. Even though she drove me nuts, I was madly in love with her, so I decided the only humane course of action would be to buy her a ticket back to Bangkok. We're still legally married, but we've been separated ever since. I occasionally send her money to take care of her family. In February she asked me to send her money because her mother needed surgery. I asked how much it would cost, and she said \"about tree fiddy should cover it\". That's when I realized she was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era, that goddamn loch ness monster had tricked me again.

{"body": "&gt;And yeah I know, finding a transgirl who tops is like finding a unicorn with a mouthful of four-leaf clovers riding on the back of the Loch Ness monster.\n\nThis is a hilariously bizarre image. It almost sounds like the kind of artwork you would see someone paint who drops acid. XD I kind of want to see a sort of Boris Vallejo/Luis Royo crossover type painting of this very imagery.\n\n&gt;One actually thoroughly enjoyed it and was completely 50/50 vers.\n\nMost of my trans play partners have been bisexual tops who just completely nixed the cisgender dude thing out of the equation. I completely understand why, I've actually been involved in an altercation in public where a chaser (who hung out there and kind of skeeved on the trans girls) caught wind of the fact that my girlfriend at the time was telling our friends at the local LGBT club about topping me, where she had brushed him off before by saying \"I don't top guys\". Well, there ended up being a huge argument with him causing a scene and calling her a hypocrite for topping a trans dude and not a cis dude while I'm just sitting there like [this](http://replygif.net/i/707.gif) as I watched people stop walking to stare at us. So, yeah, full stop I completely understand the issue. I do feel bad in that a lot of cis guys don't seem to understand the emotional decisions behind such a choice, and feel unfairly slighted. :( I don't like people feeling \"left out\", if they're not just fetishizing trans people and truly have intentions beyond \"fuck em' and leave em\".\n\n&gt;The sex was amazing, but sadly the relationship was not.\n\nAh, the old adage about not sticking your dick in crazy, or letting crazy stick its dick into you, no matter how good the sex was. I know it well. D:\n\n&gt; The other...well, she did it because I enjoyed it, but I know she didn't like it herself.\n\nAck, yeah, just...please be careful with that. It's kind of hard to explain to someone that doesn't experience dysphoria, but if they're not into doing something, it usually carries more weight than your average \"I don't really like doing this, but I'll do it for you\". I peeped on a bit of your post history(sorry, I got curious and I was trying to answer the trans/cis question for myself after asking you!) and you seem like a really nice guy. Your modpost on T-girls about escorts caught my eye, and I really commend you for sticking up trans girls like that. It's pretty inherently obvious how 99% of the guys on there view trans girls as a walking set of tits and dick, which disheartens me, and I know it disheartens my straight trans girl friends. :( But, yeah, seeing how sensitive you are to the whole issue I think you might understand a bit of what I'm saying when I say \"be careful with that\". It's far more likely to be an emotionally loaded thing for a trans girl.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430006803", "subreddit": "sex", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"Acquired Tastes\" tend to develop around foods with complex flavors. Some cheeses, beer/alcoholic beverages, caviar, and more are popular foods where you must acquire a taste. \n\nI'm big on the flavor of beer, so I'm going to use that as an example. The first sense you use when you experience beer (let's say, a lager) is probably sight. You look at it. What's it look like? Piss or Apple juice. Since adults seem to enjoy it, it's probably apple juice. \n\nYou taste it, and your expectations are shattered. You get a mixture of several flavors, and you probably won't like it. \n\n- Sweet, but not as sweet as you expect/like\n- Bitter, from the hops\n- Sour from some of the yeastiness left over in the brew\n- Bready almost umami (a type of savory) - from the malts\n\nSo you get a drink that you don't know how anyone could like it.\n\n***\n\nSome time later, you might drink more beer, and oblige simply because you know it'll make you drunk, or you want to look cool. You'll automatically begin to tolerate the taste, but it won't necessarily mean you've acquired any of it.\n\nBut then you have your first high quality brew. If you're used to Busch Light, then a full-flavored Budweiser might be it; if you're used to shitty old domestic beer, then a craft brew might tickle your fancy. It's familiar - sweet/sour/malty/bitter all that, but the ratios are different. It's not \"good\" but it's interesting. \n\nThen you begin to experiment and make note of how different brews feature different flavors. Maybe your first IPA turns you completely off. Then over time, as you taste many different hops, you begin to appreciate the bitterness accompanied by a cascade hops (notes similar to grapefruit). Then you dig deeper and gain an understanding of all the subtleties and really begin to understand full flavors. \n\nThen you go back to that first, terrible domestic brew. You drink it. It's bland. You hate it, but only because it's like beer-flavored water. You've grown so educated and accustomed to more complex notes that this basic flavor profile no longer tickles your fancy. You plead your host for a stout, but he tells you that his family is a \"Bud\" family. He reaches for his shotgun, and you get the hint - it's time to go. \n\nOn your way out the door, something wet hits you on the back of your neck. You reach back, touch it, look at your hand, and see that he spit chewing tobacco at you. You ask him \"Christ, what do you want from me?\"\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nthis is when you realize that you weren't drinking beers with some redneck, but with a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. \n\n\"GOD DAMMIT LOCH NESS MONSTAH!

(wish I did, it was good) But it was about this kid who loves the idea of sailing because his father is a sailor. One day, the dad takes the kid sailing with him and the kid notices something funky off in the distance. Like something swimming towards the ship. He asks his dad what it is, and his dad can't even see it. Curious, his dad asks the rest of the crew if they see it. No one other than the kid, who insists that it's there, can see it. After realizing what is happening, they rush back to shore. The father says to the kid that he can never go back to the sea again. Because that's a monster (or something) that the kid sees. Only people who the monster is going to kill can see the monster. So for the rest of his life, the kid avoids the sea. He actually starts a very successful (land based) trading company. He creates a large fortune for him and his family, but still, he yearns for the sea. He walks on the beach every day and he can still see it off in the distance, and still no one can see it but him. Eventually, as the kid reaches his old age, he decides that it's time to die, and he wants to die doing what he loves. So he goes out to sail for one last time and he watches as the thing approaches. Eventually the thing gets to him, and instead of brutally murdering him, simply says to him \"Hey, can I have about tree fiddy?\" \n\nThank you /u/obscure_renegade for the gold.

While those two movies did help me through the most difficult time in my life, the most meaningful movie that to this day still brings tears to my eyes is Paul Blart Mall Cop.

{"body": "The difference here is that 'god' is much more vaguely defined. When the term is defined, it is usually made powerful enough that it could trivially avoid any investigation. For these other things you've mentioned, it depends on how strictly you define them.

It was like one of those super sappy 80s movies. We'd usually go hang out around town and get ice cream, feed the ducks, maybe see a movie, whatever felt right at the time. Hours seemed like seconds when we talked, but when I looked into her eyes it was like the whole world stopped for a moment just for me. As we stared into each others eyes, exchanging no words, just smiles, it started to rain. Seeing the rain glisten off her silken cheeks and drops falling from the ends of her long brunette hair made me realize, it was time. She understands. \n\nShe grabs my hand and we run to the nearest motel. Not very romantic, I know, but we couldn't wait until we got home as we were moments away from ripping each other's clothes off. We run inside for shelter from what started as a sprinkle and escalated to a torrential downpour and we ask the man for the key to any room available. \n\n\"Ok sir, that'll be $50. Don't make too much of a mess ya hear? *wink*\"\n\nAt this moment, her elated expression fades to a disappointed one, like her heart had been ripped out. Seeing her sad just killed me, so I plead her,\n\n\"What's wrong mi amour, let me make it better.\"\n\n\"I....I.... I only have $46.50. It's not enough. I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nThen I realize this whole time, she wasn't the beautiful brunette Italian my heart burned for, but the loch ness monster.\n\n\"Back off bitch! Ain't no loch ness monstah gettin my tree fiddy!\" I say. Then in a swift motion I kick the monster's soft spot, do a running back flip off of the receptionist and run away to somewhere safe.

{"body": "Life is dreary and very monotonous. I originally came from Uzbekistan at age 19 and due to privacy reasons I can't disclose which company I was sent through. I came from a very poor family that struggled to get anything done due to no status and income. I myself managed to get educated and went to a decent college in the capital, but I couldn't pay my school fees and my family was getting worse in terms of finances. I now live in Southern California with a lovely husband. I've spent about 12 years here and I've actually managed to get enrolled in the local community college and learn English quite well. My husband constantly shelters me and keeps me away from everybody, mainly because he puppies me. I rarely ever see anyone within the same culture in which I came. He and I agreed that I would send about 350 dollars to my family back home, every 4 months. He is trained in gorilla warfare and constantly is away in order to wipe scum like you off the face of the earth with his access to the entire United States military budget. So I don't see him very often which makes life boring. In my free time I like to watch movies, through Netflix (his account) and iTunes. I found that a way to solve my slowly developing depression is to watch Paul Blart Mall Cop, it seems to lighten the mood. Whenever he calls home from his adventures we usually talk about things we should do. He's introduced me to this website which is Reddit, and told me the golden rule which is \"never mingle with the 4chan people\" and \"always put a serious tag on your posts\" many of these lessons have been great. My English seems to always get better, but whenever I encounter people outside they always say \"why are you an enormous creature from the Paleolithic era!\" before I quickly devour their intestines. Oh boy but cooking is pretty great! There are no photos of me on /r/gonewild by the way. My husband trusts me!

The toothfairy thus achieves impossibility, since teeth dont get reported missing without any explanation from all children worldwide. You can wiggle specifics to bring them back to some marginal possibility but in the base state they are definitely impossible.\n\nBigfoot I think has some room for possibility, at least when compared to Nessie, because Nessie lives in a lake small enough to be scanned, explored and tested many times. That isnt to say Nessie is a logical impossibility, but its definitely fairly far toward that end of the spectrum.\n\nI reject matrix theory because I find it useless.

{"body": "&gt; To agnostic atheists: if I asked you if you explicitly held the belief that the tooth fairy doesn't exist, what would you say?\n&gt; Leprechauns?\nFaeries?\nFlying Spaghetti Monster?\nGod?\n\nFor the concepts listed above, I fail to reject the [null hypothesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/2w80uz/debaters_of_religion_what_does_your_flair_mean_to/cophl5g) that: {There is not any credible reason/justification, above the level of significance^(see note) , to believe/accept that the constructs quoted above exist}.  I fail to reject the null hypothesis as there is no support nor justification to accept the alternative hypothesis that {There *is* credible reason/justification, above the level of significance, to believe/accept that the constructs quoted above exist}.\n\nThe result is that my baseline position is one of non-belief or lack of belief on the constructs quoted above (the agnostic atheist analogy position).  On top of this baseline position, I also know (have knowledge), to varying levels of significance (depending upon the above construct and upon the history and origin story of the construct), that the constructs do not exist (the gnostic atheist analog position).\n \nNote:  While the existence of a \"God\" would be an extraordinary actualization, the qualitative level of significance (or level of reliability and confidence) I use as a threshold for consideration of such a claim is not an extraordinary level, but rather a level higher than an appeal to emotion/Faith.\n \n&gt; Nessie? Bigfoot?\n\n\"Nessie\" and \"Bigfoot\" have physical and behavioral descriptions that correspond highly to creatures that existed in the past (i.e., extinct). So against the existence of these constructs, I will have to add a temporal modifier within the null hypothesis that there is no credible reason to believe/accept that these constructs exist as live creatures now.   \n\n&gt; Do you explicitly believe that the matrix theory is false?\n\nI remain skeptical of the reality of the [matrix theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_theory_%28physics%29).

{"body": "Chuck Klosterman came up with these questions, and I am not Chuck Klosterman. He deserves all credit, not me. \n\n1. Let us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn anymore; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence. **Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?**\n\n2. Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots. **Would you attempt to do this?**\n\n3. Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical. **Which option do you select?**\n\n4. You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Credence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it’s being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it’s being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a Capella (but it will only sound this way to you). **Would you swallow the pill?**\n\n5. At long last, someone invents \"the dream VCR.\" This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR. **Would you still do this?**\n\n6. Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week. **You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?**\n\n7. You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson's gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film's \"deeper philosophy.\" **Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?**\n\n8. A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commercial success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man). **Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likelihood of you reading this book?**\n\n9. You are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that--somewhere--your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill. **Would you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie?**\n\n10. You meet a wizard. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, \"I will now make them a dollar more attractive.\" He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But--somehow--this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can't deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though--you can only pay him once. You can't keep giving him money until you're satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front. **How much cash do you give the wizard?**\n\n11. For reasons that cannot be explained, cats can suddenly read at a twelfth-grade level. They can't talk and they can't write, but they can read silently and understand the text. Many cats love this new skill, because they now have something to do all day while they lay around the house; however, a few cats become depressed, because reading forces them to realize the limitations of their existence (not to mention the utter frustration of being unable to express themselves). **This being the case, do you think the average cat would enjoy Garfield, or would cats find this cartoon to be an insulting caricature?**\n\n12. You have a brain tumor. Though there is no discomfort at the moment, this tumor would unquestionably kill you in six months. However, your life can (and will) be saved by an operation; the only downside is that there will be a brutal incision to your frontal lobe. After the surgery, you will be significantly less intelligent. You will still be a fully functioning adult, but you will be less logical, you will have a terrible memory, and you will have little ability to understand complex concepts or difficult ideas. **The surgery is in two weeks. How do you spend the next fourteen days?**\n\n13. You have won a prize. The prize has two options, and you can choose either (but not both). The first option is a year in Europe with a monthly stipend of $2,000. The second option is ten minutes on the moon. **Which option do you select?**\n\n14. Your best friend is taking a nap on the floor of your living room. Suddenly, you are faced with a bizarre existential problem: This friend is going to die unless you kick them (as hard as you can) in the rib cage. If you don’t kick them while they slumber, they will never wake up. However, you can never explain this to your friend; if you later inform them that you did this to save their life, they will also die from that. So you have to kick a sleeping friend in the ribs, and you can’t tell them why. **Since you cannot tell your friend the truth, what excuse will you fabricate to explain this (seemingly inexplicable) attack?**\n\n15. For whatever the reason, two unauthorized movies are made about your life. The first is an independently released documentary, primarily comprised of interviews with people who know you and bootleg footage from your actual life. Critics are describing the documentary as “brutally honest and relentlessly fair.” Meanwhile, Columbia Tri-Star has produced a big-budget biopic of your life, casting major Hollywood stars as you and all your acquaintances; though the movie is based on actual events, screenwriters have taken some liberties with the facts. Critics are split on the artistic merits of this fictionalized account, but audiences love it. **Which film would you be most interested in seeing?**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430157903", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Second would be to then determine if that god could exist based on my understanding of the universe.

It's just that the stories we get are the ones that deal with them.\n\nAs for the video evidence, the Empire wiped out all references to the Jedi. They had much tighter control of the Holonet than any current government has of the internet.\n\nNot to mention, **Han Solo isn't even questioning the magical power aspect of the Force.** The quote is\n\n&gt;\"Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\"\n\nHis issue is more with the Force's supposed effects on destiny and other large scale things. Force pushes can be explained as a trick by using a compressed version of the technology ships use to take off. I think a lot of people (including yourself) forget that in a galaxy with such advanced technology, a lot of those Force abilities would be easily reproducible. Most of the Force's true power vs technology is in more subtle things (the precognition, visions, enhanced speed and strength).\n\nHan's view of the Force is shaped by him traveling throughout galaxy and visiting many different regions and seeing no evidence of an all encompassing power tying it all together. To a skeptic, any video evidence of could be explained away as technology (like UFOs today) or photo doctoring (hello, Nessie). It's not until he's with Luke for an extended period, when he gets to see all those subtle things start to add up in someone he met as a simple farmboy, that he starts to think that maybe the all encompassing part of the Force is real.\n\nYou're also putting far too much credence into Watto knowing about Jedi mind tricks as evidence of widespread knowledge of Jedi abilities. Rumors get passed around about people and groups all the time, especially when they have a position of power. Yeah, Watto likely heard that Jedi could influence people's minds, but other rumors might say Jedi could turn water into wine, fly through the air like superman, and do other amazing feats that they really couldn't.

I tried to overload my self with the video hoping that it would make me sick of it but it only made it worse. I had failed at making it stop. \n\"DEEZ NUTZ\"\nThen it got worse. I would wake up and start saying it. Not just thinking it but saying it and yelling it in reaction to everything. In class, at work, if anyone asked me what was wrong I would choke back \"DEEZ nuts\" and cough and say I was fine. \n\"DEEZ NUTZ\"\nAfter a month or so it was worse and worse. I was near my breaking pink and people were noticing. They knew. I knew they knew. They were nice though and ignored it. \n\"DEEZ NUTZ\"\nFinally I got home one day and my family and loved ones were around and they said they needed to talk and that they loved me. So I sat down and they asked me if I knew what was wrong. I screamed \"DEEZ NUTZ\"! And broke down in tears. I could stand it anymore. My father made a phone call and twenty minutes later, two big guys in white came through the door and grabbed me. My family waved goodbye. I spent the next few days taking pills and tossing and turning. \n\"DEEZ NUTZ\"\nThen one morning I awoke. I was in a couch and there was a doctor there. He looked at me and said it was done. I didn't believe him.  He said look. He asked me what my favorite thing about my body was. I said my hair. He looked at me and I started to cry. I didn't scream deez nutz. I didn't. I didn't feel the urge to. I was free. For the following few days I slept like a baby. It was heaven of earth. I even saw that video again. And nothing. I was free. I ran to my parents and thanked them and embraced them. The treatment worked. I cried and asked them how could I ever repay them. My father laughed and said \" Don't worry!

{"body": "&gt; But atheists also use science (the lack of a scientific discovery that serves as evidence for God's existence) as proof of his nonexistence.\n\nOnce again, this is not accurate.  While I'm certain there are plenty of atheists that don't understand the scientific method, the correct atheistic position is to place belief in God in the same category as belief in fairies, pixies and the Loch Ness Monster...ie, until evidence to the contrary is presented, the only logical, rational, scientific viewpoint possible is God, fairies, pixies and the Loch Ness Monster do NOT exist.  That is the null hypothesis.  You cannot PROVE the null hypothesis, you can only DISPROVE it with evidence.\n\n&gt; And I think both are wrong.\n\nNot according to the scientific method, they aren't.  Belief in something without evidence is wrong, belief in nothing without evidence is correct.\n\n&gt; Since, if I start believing in things for which there is no evidence, I could eventually be convinced of anything. But even taking a \"agnostic\" position, I would still be vulnerable to illogical thinking. For example: I can't prove that at least one unicorn doesn't exist at least somewhere on Earth. So, what am I gonna say? Am I just gonna acknowledge that I can't prove it either way and leave it at that? Of course not! I'll take the position that unicorns don't exist anywhere on Earth.

After leaving the museum, out of nowhere, as I was looking around for a place to eat, I met her. She was so beautiful and nice, her smile shining like the sun. Our eyes met and I swear you could hear lightning thundering around. It was an instant crush on my side and, as I was stuck, petrified by the idea of losing such pure grace, she simply looked at me grunting in a way too cute to be described properly with words. Instead of crumbling the pedestal of deity I already put her on it pushed me forward and allowed me to start one of the best afternoon I've ever had. It was beautiful, and, for hours, it felt like we were the only people in the world. We hit hard. As time flew,the sky became darker and darker, I asked her if she had somewhere to crash so we could continue. She told me she was lost, escaped from some place far from here and that she was hunted by some sort of private police. We ended up at my hostel room where we made love passionately for hours. Waking up during the night, I had a doubt tinkling in my head, something telling me to learn more  about her. Our clothes were scattered around the place and, in the darkness, I mistakenly put on her shirt instead of mine. I opened her purse, her name was Sarah. Nice name. Then, suddenly I realize I had tried Sarah tops. She awoken, and told me she was sure she couldn't trust me. She then told me I needed to pay for her taxi and that it was going to be about tree fiddy. It was around this time I realized Sarah was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.

I was camping with my family in the north-west and I was in the middle of helping my dad cool our lunch on an open fire while my brother and sister were cleaning the tent because some dirt had got in. Anyway, because I wasn't 'old enough' to manage things on my own, I was pretty much in charge of all the mundane tasks like cutting up a few things, gathering up the waste and washing the things we used. It annoyed me more than it should have just for the fact that  I thought I was a pretty good chef so why would I have issues working with a camp fire. \n\nMy brother ad sister began to argue in the tent over something stupid. As always, it was my sister who started it. So my dad went over to sort out the problem and told me not to touch anything. Being the rebellious young teen, I decided that I would just stir the pasta that was cooking because it seemed like fun doing it over a camp fire. I grabbed the spoon we used to stir with from the bench and went over to the pasta. I gave it a few stirs with a bit if vigour because I was angry. After about my third stir, the pot moved a little but I didn't care. I kept going and very quickly, the pot moved too much and it began to tip over. I leant over to try and save it by grabbing the handles which wasn't helpful as they were metal but they also dragged me with the tipping pot. I fell with my torso into the fire and my shirt caught light, too. I was terrified and let out a massive scream while I writhed around in the dirt trying to stop the burning. I could smell my charring flesh.\n\nMy dad came sprinting over with my siblings in tow and grabbed the nearest water canister. My brother called for an ambulance and my sister went for more water. \n\nThey put the flames out really quickly and I went to the hospital. Everyone there was really nice and helpful. I was discharged about 2 weeks later after being treated and monitored for 2nd burns.\n\n On the way home, my dad sopped at the video store and said that I could pick out any movie I wanted for the night. I knew exactly what I wanted so I headed straight for the counter. The woman said \"that'll be about tree fiddy\" and my dad paid.

I had one patient come in who had broken both ankles and was convinced they were paralyzed, but upon examination it was clear that they just (seems wrong to say JUST here, since it still would hurt like a bitch) broke both ankles, one shattered, one with a more minor break.

It was at that point that I noticed that this patient was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430321699", "subreddit": "Whatcouldgowrong", "score": 2, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:\n\nThere is no doubt that our country has faced, and still faces, many challenges.  Our enemies abroad threaten us with cowardly acts of terror.  Our citizens fight to earn a decent wage.  Our nice guys are still being friend-zoned by the stupid women who choose mindless jocks over them.\n\nHowever, while the fight is not yet behind us, the State of the Union is strong.\n\nTonight, our economy grows,  and will continue to grow.  I have asked congress to pass a bill legalizing marijuana across the nation.  This bill will create an average of 420,000 new jobs in each and every state.  It will put millions of Americans to work, and provide a much needed boost to our economy, allowing us to be a strong competitor in the international rare pepe market.\n\nTo anyone who questions a seemingly drastic change in policy, I ask you to consider the story of one of our outstanding citizens, Mrs. Doris Peckner.  \n\nMrs. Peckner was born in Waco, Texas in 1930...Mrs. Peckner, please forgive me for giving away your age! (laughter)  Mrs. Peckner lived through the Second World War, losing her father at a young age after he made the ultimate sacrifice on the beaches of Normandy.  Her mother, stricken with grief, tragically took her own life when Doris was only 16 years old, leaving her to care for her six younger siblings.\n\nWorking a day shift at a factory and a night shift as a waitress, Doris was able to provide for her family.  Because of her hard work, each of her siblings was able to attend college and eventually achieve success.\n\nHowever, today's generation of young people is a different story.  Our young people are having difficulty finding jobs.  They take out thousands of dollars in student loans, but the competition for jobs is so strong that even finding work as a waitress is difficult.\n\nI spoke with Mrs. Peckner and asked her, as an American who has lived through so much of our nation's storied history, what she thinks our government can do to give our young people a chance to work for a living and provide for their families, just as she did long ago.\n\nMrs. Peckner gave me several solutions.  Student loan forgiveness, to ease the burden on our next generation of workers.  Job training programs, to provide an alternative to four-year schools.  However, there was one thing she said she truly needs, a solution to all of our nation's problems:\n\nMrs. Peckner asked me for about tree fiddy.  It was then that I realized that Mrs. Peckner was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.  I said \"God Damnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy.\"  Goddamn Loch Ness Monster got me again.\n\nThank you, \"God\" bless you, and \"God\" bless the United States of America! \n\n(tips fedora)\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430406425", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 233, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Generally, they like a little romance in their life. If it's a first date, you need to start off with some compliments. Oh, the compliments - they are the secret \"go-to move.\"\n\n\"You look really nice in that dress\" \"You smell really nice\" are simple little compliments that will do you a world of wonder. She may play coyly and brush off the compliment but that is just part of the game.\n\nAs the date goes on, try to find excuse for physical contact. If you brush against her arm, does she move away? Does she let you brush again? Does she brush you back? Each of these represents different levels of attraction. If she lets you brush again then she is the more subtle type that is clearly into you but needs you to continue being the aggressor. If she brushes back then you know she likes to play aggressive too.\n\nAs the date winds down, don't just rush to the finish line hoping that the date will either A) be over or B) lead to sex. You can't be a desperate horn dog. But you also have to show that you aren't wanting the night to end yet.\n\nThe car is an awkward place to make first moves, so don't try your 1-2-Combo on her there. Try going out for a walk around the city, allowing you bond, laugh, and get to know each other. For many people, bonding leads to horniness.\n\nTowards the end of the walk I would suggest finding somewhere nice to sit down and wind down. This gives you the perfect setup to either put your arm around her, or to make mutual contact with hands. Both are good signs of intimacy. Next you will want to get a giant can of bug-spray because the girl is a giant fucking praying mantis demanding you pay her tree fiddy for the time she wasted on your date. Before she takes you back to her place for her to finish you off, black-widow style. It really is as simple as that.

I call it:\n\n&gt;Having a Dream, and making it real.\n\n&gt;I grew up in a nice part of town, with a nice family.\n\n&gt;The privileges I had are too many to count, and I will always be thankful for them.\n\n&gt;Long ago my father told me that one personal trait was more important than all others if I wanted to make it in life.\n\n&gt;Experience, experience and more experience, both through my own effort, or the effort of others.\n\n&gt;Right away, I got to work. \n\n&gt;Deciding on a career in politics was a no-brainer for me.\n\n&gt;I wanted to help the country.\n\n&gt;Decision-making came naturally to me. \n\n&gt;Nothing else was even close on my list of dreams.\n\n&gt;Off to college I went.\n\n&gt;The things I learned there reinforced my convictions, and motivated me to achieve greatness.\n\n&gt;Having gotten my degree, I went off to find work.\n\n&gt;I soon discovered how hard it can be to find employment. \n\n&gt;Nothing seemed to work.\n\n&gt;Gosh, I came pretty close to quitting more times than I can count.\n\n&gt;Wonderfully, I soon became involved with democratic party in Illinois.\n\n&gt;Riding out success after success, it was pretty clear to my peers that I was destined for greatness.\n\n&gt;Only the presidency would be fitting for you, they told me.\n\n&gt;Now, having achieved that dream, I can only say to all you folks watching at home, getting ready for your futures. \n\n&gt;Good luck. \n\nJust don't read the letter of every sentence (pauses, looking confused before continuing). Let me tell you folks, being president can be a wild ride. The intensity of the work leaves an aching in my bones at the end of the day. Sometimes, I just want to get off of Mr. Bone's Wild Ride, but I know that I'm here forever. Hopefully, I haven't lost the game yet, but just the other day, I ran into an old friend of mine. We were catching up on old times, reminiscing, but something felt really wrong. I finally realized it when he asked me he needed to borrow about tree-fiddy. I looked up and realized my friend was five hundred feet tall and from the paleolithic era. I felt so scrawny and beta in that moment. \n\n&gt;A loud bang is heard as the teleprompter shuts off and begins spewing smoke all over the room, a spokesperson said that they will quickly go print out the rest of the speech for the president to read. After a couple of minutes an intern comes back with the printed speech and hand it to the president, but he is clearly upset about the format\n\n-whispering- This is all you guys have for me? This looks like it was printed over a page of a trashy tabloid magazine! \n\n-also whispering- That's because it was sir, this was all we had to work with back there, it's pretty sketchy seeing as DARPA hasn't come around to update this yet. \n\n- Some of these words printed on here don't even make sense!\n\n- It's a really old computer, it had a hard time converting the document format. There is nothing else we can do, just go with it. \n\n&gt;The intern walks off, and Obama struggles as he tries to read the remainder of the speech\n\nOh mAn Im noT gOOd WitH cOmpUter PLz to [help.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ooer)\n\n&gt;Obama holds up the paper for the people in attendance to see\n\nI'm sorry folks, but this is all I can really read, as the rest of the speech is covered up by this unflattering picture of Andy Sandberg. \nI'm just gonna wrap up this event and let you all go home. \n\n&gt;suddenly the teleprompter comes back to life, and on the broken screen, only two little words are visible. Obama squints to make them out, and reads them out lout. \n\n[Allahu](http://www.reddit.com/r/unexpectedjihad) [Ahkbar](https://youtu.be/0G6_JPDZ4t4?t=12s).\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430416093", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The virgin stripper. Let me explain. I was an introvert mostly throughout High School. I didn't go to many parties, nor did I have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked.\nUnfortunately, I had 0 skills on picking up girls even though I was trying really hard to get a girl.\nIn 11th grade there was a party around my school's christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it. I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where. I still remembered her name though, Vanessa. She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me. I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible. She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back. I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of. Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\"\nI started saying more things.\nShe laughed even more.\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl. But then it dawned on me. I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where. A strip club. Vanessa was a stripper. Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously. My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once. I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house. This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue. I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself.\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone. A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms. I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside.\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off Vanessa's clothes. Finally, she was fully naked, as was I. She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\". Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\" I couldn't believe it. This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin. I still can't believe it. I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock. She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to. I told her I was a virgin too and she said good. As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\" \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life. Been waiting for awhile for someone to post a question like this to askreddit for a long time now. Happy I finally got the chance to tell that story.\ntl;dr: A stripper who aggressively threw herself on to me was actually a virgin.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430432206", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
