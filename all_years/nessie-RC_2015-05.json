{"body": "So back in HS me and some douche had been getting into each other's shit, finally one day I'm walking by and I can see from my peripheral he's staring me down, then as I go by I hear, \"That's right, keep on walkin'\".\n\nDon't know why really, probably hormones and being a teenager, but this set me off. We had been building up to this for weeks. Anyway, I turn around and get in his face, he says something or other, and I just quick grab him by the neck.\n\nAt about this time a teacher, who is also my football coach, comes around the corner instantly not happy to see me in a scuffle and grabs both my arms restraining me.\n\nEverything. Slows. Down. To. Almost.... A.... Crawl.\n\nI can see the look in the dudes eyes, he wants to hit me, I have time to register his doubt at whether he should hit a restrained person, then I watch his intent change when he knows for sure he's going to do it. He winds up,... I swear this moment took a day... I'm standing there having been just pulled off the guy calmly, as though I had all the time in the world, considering my options. Parry? Lunge? Go for a leg? Nah. I'm gonna head butt this mother fuckers sucker punch.\n\nWait for it... I remember telling myself to wait, otherwise it would forecast what I had planned, because after all of the above thinking the punch was still only halfway to me. Is your girl coming over tonight? Geez she's got a great ass, I think to myself to pass the time.\n\nFinally, the moment of truth, I headbutt down as hard as I can. I racked my bottom jaw on my chest a bit, and it will be the worst of my injuries. Guy connects square on the crown of my head with both the force of his punch and the force of my headbutt. I hear some bones in his hand break. I could almost feel them break ringing in my skull.\n\n\"Now that has got to fucking hurt!!?\" I taunt. Honestly it hurt me pretty bad too, but at this point time had sped back up and I was feeling the adrenaline kick in. Kid doesn't even think of trying the other hand, just has this look on his face like he can't believe what just happened. Dude was a bully who was used to winning fights. Coach lets go of me and grabs the dude and takes him to the office.\n\nThis was the eighties, so I apologized to him with some nudging from the principal, my parents paid to have his hand set, and that was that. Can't say I was ever great friends with him after that, but we never fought again. I like to think he was a little less of a bully after though, at least a little.\n\nNo tree fiddy, no loch ness monster. This shit happened. I am a badass. This wasn't the only fight I've won, and I have lost a couple, but this was the best one.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430440873", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

So as you see. I didn't.

I dont know if I agree or disagree. I cannot say what I find agreeable/disagreeable because you refuse to specify. It is a mark of intellectual cowardice. Say something vague and presented with a counter point go \"Oh I didn't mean that\".\n\nAllow me to show you the absurdity of your statement laid bare.\n\n I could have a lot of reasons why I would be unwilling to present good points why the Loch Ness monster exists to you, assuming they don't exist is an interesting mindset. As an alternative try looking at it from the other side and you might have been able to figure the points out youself.\n\nSo you would assume I have good points on how the Loch Ness monster exists and not ask me to make them clear?

{"body": "There is one really weird dream I have had many a time. I never remember it all, but I have been able to piece it together. \n\nI find myself walking through a forest in the middle of autumn. The trees are covered in a crisp red and orange, the air smells of spice, and a cool breeze rustles the leaves. For a while I Just walk, enjoying the forest. Slowly though, things begin to get darker. Shadows ooze from the trees, which are becoming more and more sickly and twisted. Out of the corner of my eye I catch flashes of movement between the trees, a black blur, a red eye. Low growls replace the rusting of leaves. I grow more and more nervous, nearly reaching a state of panic. As I am just about to start running, a man appears in front of me with a flourish. He wears a stylish overcoat an tophat, and carries a gold inlaid cane. The man bows, and informs me that I have found myself in a very dangerous place. He might be able to get me out, but I will need to stay close behind him, and do exactly as he says. Eager for a way out of the cursed forest I agree, and we take off at a brisk pace. The trunks of the trees are now gnarled and yellow, and little light pierces the oily shadows. The growls grow louder, and the creatures moving in the darkness seem tenser, their blood is up. The man breaks out into a run and I follow, as howls pierce the darkness. Loping steps sound behind us, the panting of frenzied maws. At last, light begins to seep through cracks in the darkness, the edge of the forest. Unfortunately, we haven't made it on time. The light reveals a pack of jet black wolves, with glowing red eyes. They circle us, slobbering, preparing to pounce. \"Stay behind me.\" The man says, and he casts off the bottom of his cane to reveal a beautiful, light sword. One of the wolves howls and jumps at us, and the man shoves his sword into its exposed gut. Instead of blood, black smoke leaks out around the blade. The wolf whimpers, and drops to the ground. The others bare their teeth, but back away, widening the circle until they turn and run off In search of easier prey. We finally burst through the inky wall, and emerge into the sunlight. \"Thank you.\" I say to the man, \"how can I ever repay you?\" \"well,\" he replies, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430448302", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Now that's the thing. The man obviously expected *mostly* serious replies. Or even *some* serious replies. Instead, he got over thirty thousand comments of karmawhoring. The fact that this can happen to a thread, along with the instances of Tom Cruise and fax-machine circlejerks, is why we need to crack down on these things.\n\nHumor is fine. An excess of attempts on humor, to the point that very few could find it even objectively humorous, is not. Shaggydogging, that is, spinning a story of a very long nature and ending it by stating its uselessness, a la Loch Ness Monster, is not either. These things end up as irrelevant posts masquerading as relevant posts, wasting the time of any who read them and serving as nothing more than a sink for upvotes for the people who upvite these things, grudgingly or otherwise.\n\nYou make it sound like it's trivial; that anyone bothered by this has no sense of humor, and that's it.

As I stood up off of my computer chair I turned back to see the imprint of my ass perfectly molded into the seat.  I stumbled back to my bedroom and thought about what you said.  \"Mayan you should go outside\".  I thought to myself, \"what do normal people wear in this \"outside\".  I went to my closet and spotted the perfect outfit.  A fishnet tank top and jorts. I put that shit on with the quickness and began my search for some sweet kicks to wear.  The first ones I seen were a random pair of corona sandals with built in bottle openers.  I thought to myself, \"bitches will dig this shit.\" And slid those bastards on.  It was a struggle because my toenails were curled under from sitting on reddit all the time and I couldn't take care of myself.  Anyways, after I got all situated, I figured it was time to make the big step.  Outdoors. I walked to the front door and looked at the imitation brass handle.  Sweat started beading on my forehead as I reached out towards it, my stomach started to turn. My mind said do it but my body literally couldn't. I took a last deep breathe, gripped the cold knob in my hand and gave it a twist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy mind could not comprehend the beauty of what was before me. A cool, crisp breeze brushed my nipples.  The sun warmed my pale white legs. A bird chirped. One step....   Another step....  I'm officially \"outside\".  I stumble out into the \"yard\". And into the \"grass\".  I breathe deep and smile.  I haven't smiled like that since that one meme that hit the front page that I made.  Out of the corner of my eye I notice a beautiful woman.  I've seen her before.  She is my neighbor Vanessa. She glances over, shocked,  seeing her neighbor for the first time in 3 years since he had moved in.  I know it's \"Ness\" because I have admired her through the window by my battlestation for years.  Anyways, she looks at me and smiles.  My heart melts.  I smile back.  She waves sheepishly.  I wave back. SHE IS WALKING IN MY DIRECTION?  Holy shit what do I do!?  She's in my yard now... \n\n\"Hi\" she says\n\n\"M'lady\" I say\n\nShe blushes and looks at the ground....  She glances back up at me and whispers. \"Nigga, you got about tree fiddy?\"  I start farting uncontrollably and moonwalk back into my house.

{"body": "It's my time to shine. Hoo, boy. Warning: Wall of text. \n\nSo, I (single, brown male, 31 years old) am at a TGI Fridays in my town for team trivia. I'm sitting in a booth alone waiting on my teammate(s). There's a girl in the next booth. She has super short hair, spiked up, but I don't stereotype and I think she's kinda cute. We start talking and at one point, mid-conversation, she puts her hand on my back just below my neck and starts rubbing. I realize at this point that she is drunk. \n\nSo, trivia happens (she played on a different team) and after, I go over to make sure she has a safe way home because she's probably still drunk. She doesn't have a ride so I offer to give her a lift. Turns out, she only lives a few streets down from me, so no worries. \n\nThe ENTIRE ride home, she has her hands on me. On my arms, my back, giving me hugs. She told me I was a prince and a gentleman and that I was SOOO sweet for being nice to her. I smile and play it off like no big deal. \n\nWe pull up to her house and she tells me that her grandmother (who lives with her) is going to be PISSED that she came home drunk without her car. Me being Mr. Smooth, I ask if she just wants to hang out until she's sober and then I can take her back to her car. She agrees and we head over to my place. \n\nWe hang out for a while and chit chat and she makes herself a new BFF with my dog. After a while, we're sitting on the couch and we're talking some more. She has her arm around my shoulder. We make eye contact. Sparks fly and I think to myself, \"What would Will Riker do?\" I move in for the kiss, and it is brief and flirty. \n\nThen she whispers something to me that I will remember forever. (This is where I tree fiddy my friends. Alas, there is no tree fiddy here).\n\n\"So, are you transitioning?\" \n\nMy mind does not compute this and I ask what she means. \n\n\"You know, from male to female?\"\n\nMy mind begins to wrap itself around this and the horror breaks over me like a storm upon the rocks. \n\n\"No, I'm just a straight guy,\" I say.\n\n\"Oh...\" she says, and then she proceeds to tell me that she is gay and that she thought I was interested in her because I wanted to be a woman. I have no idea how she made this spectacular leap of logic, but apparently she did. \n\nSo, we hang out for a little while longer and it wasn't TOO awkward. She mostly just played with my dog (not a euphemism). Then I drove her back to the restaurant, made sure she got home and went back to my place, where I meticulously checked every room for hidden cameras because clearly my life is either a rom com or The Truman Show.\n\ntl;dr I'm a straight guy and I made it to first base with a lesbian because she thought I wanted to be a girl.

{"body": "Addendum to my comment;\n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nIf you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n\n*Additional links*  \n\nOn the claims Christianity;\n\nAside from the complete lack of evidence, a problem Christianity shares with other religions, I'd have to say a problem is the core belief of Christianity itself.\n\nThe completely unsubstantiated, second party blood 'sacrifice' atonement, by and to the same party, to make up for an alleged crime(original sin) committed by someone else before I was born, on penalty of eternal torture and damnation, amounts to little more than a spiritual mafia-style shake down that's a whole lot less appealing to an outsider than you might imagine.\n\nAn excellent analogy, [Kissing Hank's Ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaFZQBb2srM)\n\nThe Immorality of Christianity;\n\n[Evil Bible](http://www.evilbible.com/) has many references to the  immorality contained within the bible, including; [ritual human sacrifice](http://www.evilbible.com/Ritual_Human_Sacrifice.htm), [rape](http://www.evilbible.com/Rape.htm), [murder](http://www.evilbible.com/Murder.htm), [intolerance](http://www.evilbible.com/BiblicalIntolerance.htm), and [slavery](http://www.evilbible.com/Slavery.htm). \n\n[Christopher Hitchens: The Bible is Immoral](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyBS84i7KXs)\n\n[Matt Dillahunty: Christianity is an Immoral System](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz_ryHYc_Pc)\n\nOn the Inerrancy of the Bible;\n\n[Skeptic’s Annotated Bible’s list of biblical contradictions](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/contra/by_name.html).\n\n[Infidels.org's list of biblical contradictions](http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html).\n\n[NonStampCollector's video on biblical contradictions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3g6mXLEKk).\n\n[On the validity of the OT versus the NT](http://www.evilbible.com/do_not_ignore_ot.htm)\n\n[Scientific Errors in the Bible](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scientific_errors_in_the_Bible )\n\n[Wikipedia entries criticism, scientific &amp; historical issues of the Bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy#Scientific_and_historical_criticism )\n\nOn the historicity of Jesus;\n\nDid Jesus exist?

{"body": "Right out of the academy one of the other rookies and I went out on the town. We end up at this comedy place right near where one of the vets patrols his beat. Anyway, Ramirez makes a comment about \"man, better be careful not to get too drunk tonight, you know how Santiago gets about other cops acting up on his turf.\" Anyway, Ramirez and I were pretty close at this point. We went through the academy together and our first few months at the department we'd run into each other quite a bit. We make it a point to get together at least once every two weeks, keep the tension from work down and let off some steam. So we decide that since this is Santiago's turf one of us better be the \"responsible\" one and make sure nothing gets out of hand. We decide that whoever can get a phone number from an attractive girl gets the honor of being the drunken slob for the remainder of the evening. I go first, I spot this cute red head at the lobby of the comedy place. I notice her spot me out of the corner of her eye and I can feel her still staring at me when I look away. I decide this is the girl I'm going for. If I fail on this first attempt, Ramirez gets to go next (trying to hit on a different girl of course). I walk up and use my favorite line: \"excuse me miss? See my friend over there? That's Ramirez and he's really shy. He wanted me to ask if you think I'm cute...\" She immediately blushes and I know I'm in. I don't want to just go in for the kill, however, I only have one shot after all. I talk her up a bit and I notice Ramirez is getting impatient. I decide to use the excuse of my friend waiting on me to speed up the process. I smoothly transition into her and I getting together to go watch a Yankees game since she loves baseball so much. She gives me her number and I offer to buy her a drink before I go. She says \"how about we do a shot instead?\" I, being a red blooded American order two shots of Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey. As smooth as the shot went down, I notice the bar tender demanding I pay up immediately. He's being a bit irrational but it is my first time at this bar and I don't want to make him mad. This is after all, Santiago's turf. Anyway, I hand him my card and when he hands the receipt back, I notice he cleaned up the bar and threw away the cocktail napkin on which I had scribbled the redhead's phone number. I decide to ask her for it again, and as I glance down at the receipt to sign and tip there it is. Her phone number was already written down, the bar tender saw it on the napkin and kindly wrote the number down on the guest copy. I was a bit puzzled as to why he was demanding I pay up then so kindly wrote the redhead's number for me. Well by the time I make my way back through the crowd to let Ramirez know, I succeeded on the first try and that he better stay sober; I realize I'm going in the wrong direction. I plant my heel and do a one hundred and eighty degree turn, only to find Santiago towering over me. I stuttered and started trying to explain myself, Santiago wasn't having it. He demanded I fork over my badge and gun immediately. He said Ramirez was just arrested for trying to solicit a hooker right outside the comedy club. I hand over the badge and gun, calmly walk outside (with whiskey on my breath no less) and see Ramirez there on the curb. He had his hands behind his back and was sobbing uncontrollably. I asked him what happened and he said he went out for a smoke and was just talking to this quiet nicely dressed girl outside. He thought she was a patron of the comedy club. She got real flirty and he figured since I was taking so long that maybe I had struck out. He decided to ask her for her phone number but she wanted more. She told him she wanted to go on a \"date\" with him. Ramirez being the naive guy he was, said he would love to go on a \"date\" with her. She then started talking about how she was struggling financially and if he would be able to help her out at all. He immediately said he would (poor guy is a sucker for a pretty girl). He asked her how much and she quickly replied how about tree fiddy? Turns out she wasn't just a cute girl. She was about five hundred feet tall and from the paelolithic era. Also I'm adding some text so that it's not as obvious. The guys at the department wouldn't let Ramirez live it down. I ended up transferring because of the incident. Guess you could say Ramirez and Santiago never looked at a spatula the same way again!\n Edit: changed names so that identities (and careers) are safe.

{"body": "**It ain't easy being Red**\n\n*Adult themes, sweary, silly*\n\nIt ain't easy being Red. I ponder that as I read the note left on the pillow - \"You were Awesome, love Sonja and Scarlette\". I date the note and file it under 3somes/non-sleb. Of course, once they upload the video they'll be minor slebs. It's still odd that that a night with me can transform a glamourous nobody into a reality TV star, but you've gotta give back to the community, right? My gaze lingers on the file marked The Two Jennifer L's. That was a wild weekend, but still I wonder what would have been if the third JenL had turned up.\n\n14 SECONDS\n\nI feel it counting.  I think that's how I could press when others could not.  I won't be the only Red for much longer anyway. I hit the gym for a light session but can only bench 50 times my bodyweight. Getting slack. Breakfast perks me up - salmon, steak and strawberries. Wash it down with the tears of a thousand Purples. Check reddit. See some toshbag about to post a MFW so I yell through the web at him. He shits himself. To death. Through the mouth.\n\n14 SECONDS\n\nTake a shower. Flex in front of the mirror and accidentally warp spacetime. Gotta stop doing that. I dress, but keep my flair tucked in. I walk through the park to the cafe. There are groups of Greys mooching around. Just waiting. There's a queue at the cafe but I don't even have to flash my flair, they just wave me in. I consider Earl Grey but opt for Redbush. Must give Lindsay a call later.\n\n14 SECONDS\n\nThey're definitely getting closer together. I take my tea to go, pausing only for a selfie with The Queen. Keep it real Ya Maj, look after lil' George and Charlotte for me. She winks and nods. She knows the score. The paper tea-cup has a phone number written on it followed by \"... Fuck me, please. Delores ( o Y o )\". Must have been the new cafe girl with the *high centre of gravity*.\n\n14 SECONDS\n\nNot long now. \"You won't be the only Red forever,\" I mutter as I walk along the river, and sometimes on it. Why are there so many Greys loitering? I get home around noon and knock out a few more chapters of my autobiography. It's fairly boring until the point where I'm chosen for Red. Then it's all defeating 300 chess grandmasters simultaneously whilst blindfolded, solving the Hodge conjecture and teaching the Loch Ness monster to speak. She's not such a monster, *once you get to know her*. Lindsay calls. She's high as a kite. I talk her down, keeping us all safe for another day.  Give back to the community, right? \n\n13 SECONDS\n\nFuck. That was an autoclick cluster for a lucky 13, followed by 8 Purples. Not long now. Have to make every hour count. Make a to-do list. Check it twice. Who do I do naughty, and who do I do nice? I check the news. Problems in the Middle East - I should probably fix that. Community, right? I email the stakeholders with a plan that makes everyone happy. Water under the bridge. Problem solved, what's for dinner?\n\n13 SECONDS\n\nStill an autoclick. Such fucking cheaters. Make a mental note to haze the fuck out of all the autoclicking Reds. \n\n\"It's tradition,\" I'll say. \"Now pudit inya mouth.  Stop crying, bitch 'for I giv'ya summit to cry 'bout\". \n\nThere's a knock at the door.  I freeze, thankful no-one has seen my pants-down-gangsta posturing. \n\nWho knocks on my door?\nIt's her. The *good* JenL.\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm late. Is it still on?\"\n\n\"That was a week ago.\"\n\n13 SECONDS\n\nA natural 13. Lucky for some. \n\n\"I've got time now,\" I say.  Not much time, though.\n\n\"You mean, I don't have to share you with anyone!?!\". Her face contorts into something altogether unwholesome as a puddle sploshes around her ankles.\n\n\"That aint tinkle, bro,\" she murmurs. \"Giselle\".\n\n\"Giselle?\" I ask.\n\n\"Girl-squirt. Gash-splash. It's Jizzzz-elllle. Giselle\".\n\n\"Is that what we're calling it now?\"\n\n\"Yeah. From now on\".\n\nI stroke my chin and ponder the meme potential of the phrases \"That ain't tinkle\" and \"Giselle\" framing the faces of any of the three JenLs. Abtruse and Subversive. Just then a sea-otter drifts by, bashing away at a bi-valve mollusc, which re-focuses my mind on the topic at hand.\n\n\"If you're ready for me boy, you'd better push the button and let me know, before I get the wrong idea and go,\" she says plagiaristically.\n\n\"I'll put on some Barry White. Shit's about to get real.\"\n\nLater, as I lie naked beneath the stars in the smouldering ruins of my house, my mind turns to the button and my place in the universe. Press or don't press, but don't hate on another's choices. That's the best I can come up with, given recent events. Who knows what the future holds?\n\nFrom under the broken billiards table a phone rings.  It's the Queen.\n\n\"Hi Liz, what are you wearing?\"\n\n\"There's no time for that!  We need you to get here and fix the situation!\"\n\n\"What situation?\"\n\n\"Didn't you feel the earth shaking?  The skies lit up like fireworks?  Gabriel's trumpet!?!\"\n\n\"I just assumed that was...\"\n\n\n\"....It's happening *now*.  The Butto-ckalypse.\"\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nTHREE WEEKS after *The Butto-ckalypse*.\n\nThings are getting back to normal. The domes have retracted back into the earth and there hasn't been a black-lightning-storm strike for days. Thank fuck the Yellows were immune to that shit, eh? Every colour played their part. Only one ex-grey preaching in the street with a megaphone about the dangers of pressing. Let it go dude, the button was cracked and broken with when the Blues disabled the Hierophant's alderblast. Nothing is coming through now, or ever.\n\nLindsay unfriended me on Slebbook; I'm ok with it because soon I'll be too mundane to be a member. The Middle East relapsed, again - you can only do so much. Giselle is the new superfood-of-the-week, *thanks* \"Dr\" Gwyneth. They let me keep the red flair; it's on the mantlepiece.  I'm meeting that girl from the cafe for dinner.

I'm just near climax when the unexpected happens. The door opens, apparently it had been unlocked, and in comes a girl scout trying to sell me cookies (thin mints, samoas, graham crunch). I put my dick away and asked for some graham crunch. She then said she needed about tree fiddy. It's then that my vision returned and I saw that there was no girl scout, but a 40 foot plesiosaur from the Cretaceous period, and I said, \"I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!

{"body": "Alright so this one was definitely a first. Ive been through tons of interviews and they all pale in comparison. \n\nWe had a new position open for a sales rep. Its a monday and I walk in and call the first candidate in. Normal looking woman, Blonde wearing a white skirted suit, white blazer and a black top. So there was nothing about her attire that threw out any red flags. \n\nSo, I tell her to have a seat and I ask her about her prior experience, and go through all the typical interview questions. Even I know most are bullshit but I'm required to ask them. \n\nStrengths/weaknesses.\n\nHow do you work in a team\n\nDescribe a time where you had to use quick problem solving skills.\n\nSo far so good. Nothing out of the ordinary except she seemed a bit fidgety and anxious, which is normal for interviewees. Nothing I hadn't seen before, only she was fidgeting a bit more than most people do. Whatever. \n\nAnyway, about this time, I get an a call on my speaker phone from the receptionist stating that my wife was on the phone and it was urgent. So I apologize to the woman, tell her i need to take the call and I'll be back in a minute. So I take the call and return to my office, informing her that my wife just couldn't find our daughter's asthma inhaler. \n\n\"sorry, that was my wife, anyway my next question was-\"\n\nI stop dead in my tracks. This woman is on the floor completely naked talking in to her shoe as if its a phone. Its about this time that I realize she's actually a 500 foot tall monster from the paleozoic era. And I say \"What do you want?!\" \n\nAnd the monster leans down and says \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430834088", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "He makes the point that in the court case, \"not guilty\" is not the same as \"innocent\", it simply means refraining from asserting guilt, without thereby asserting innocent.  So that gives us three possible positions: asserting guilt (G), asserting innocence (I), and refraining from both assertions (R).  The analogy to the case about God's existence would then likewise give us three positions: asserting that God exists (GE), asserting that God doesn't exist (GDE), and refraining from both assertions (RG).  He then claims that by \"atheism\" we mean the analogy of voting not-guilty, without thereby asserting innocence i.e. the analogy of R.  The analogy of R is RG: refraining from asserting either that God exists or that God doesn't exist.  So he's saying that atheism is refraining from asserting either that God exists or that God doesn't exist.\n\nThe problem with this is just that it isn't true: we understand \"atheism\" to mean the thesis that God doesn't exist.\n\nNote that his next analogy contradicts this one: he compares atheism to disbelieving in the Loch Ness monster, or disbelieving there's a body in the trunk of his car, characterizing these as default positions.  But if we go by his court room analogy, where the atheist is someone who refrains both from belief that there is a God and belief that there isn't, he would have to say here that by default we should refrain both from the belief that there is a Loch Ness monster and from the belief that there isn't.  If the default is, rather and as he argues, to believe that there *isn't* a Loch Ness monster (and *isn't* a body in the trunk of his car), and this is an analogy for atheism, then naturally atheism must be the position that there *isn't* a God--which is indeed, *pace* his courtroom analogy, how we typically understand the term.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430861659", "subreddit": "askphilosophy", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "First, the analogy sucks. In a courtroom setting there's a difference between what you should *believe* and how you should *vote*. If you believe (but aren't extremely confident) that someone is guilty, you should vote not guilty. So he's trading on intuitions about procedural fairness (how you should vote) and passing them off as intuitions about what you should believe. Bad move.\n\nHere's the deeper issue. The proper default position with regard to some claims (loch ness monster; falsity of *modus tolens*; ESP) is disbelief. The proper default position with regard to some other claims (veracity of many perceptions; truth of *modus tolens*; tenability of scientific inquiry) is belief. The proper default position with regard to still other claims (artificial sweeteners cause cancer; the life expectancy in 2100 will be at least 90) is somewhere in the middle. Which category should belief in God belong in?

I thought, \"Damn that's a steal\", then I felt kind of bad because the guy is actually a cool dude, and is just so drunk he doesn't give a fudge. I told him I only have a 10 on me, and he says that's cool and shit his pants immediately. Like seriously, I didn't even have time to finish saying I only have ten dollars before he started pushing. By this time about 15 people were coming out to join us for cigs, including this one chick he was crushing on at the time. I laughed harder than I ever have, and ever will. The smell was so pungent, ugh. I was almost embarrassed for betting him he wont, and being proven wrong. I gave him the 10 bucks and left shortly after.

{"body": "It had been the worst day of my life. \n\nSince I was young, I knew I was a bit... off. My conscience, you see, manifested itself visibly to me. I know what you're thinking, but I was checked for schizophrenia. As far as medical science is concerned, I'm sane. \n\nThe guys on my shoulders have always said the same thing. There's two of them. An angel and a demon. Pretty standard, sure, but it can be entertaining. Somebody steals my seat? Angel says to be cool, devil says break his face. Find a lost wallet? Angel says turn it in, devil says keep it. Like I said, pretty standard.\n\nUntil today.\n\nI lost my wallet in a berbershop (where I was given an awful haircut, by the way) right before I rear-ended a cop. I was lucky to get out of going to jail. The devil would've had me punch him and run, but I'm not an idiot. He did have my car towed until I can prove registration, though. I walked over to my girlfriend's place and heard a struggle. Turns out, she wasn't struggling that much, she was really enjoying herself. So was my brother. At that point, even my conscience was in shock. The devil was shaking with rage and the angel shook it's head and muttered \"Damn, dude....\" \n\nI had the knife in my hand before I realized it, and my brother and now ex-girlfriend were looking at me with guilt, shame, and horror. I stalked towards them, the devil screaming \"DO IT! DO IT! THESE ASSHOLES HAVE IT COMING!\" The angel, for his part, sort of shrugged and said \"Man, I got nothin'.\" \n\nAnd then time seemed to stop. A beautiful white light appeared over my head. I heard a voice, beautiful and clear, call out to me.\n\n\"Jim, don't do it. It isn't worth the pain, and you have much to live for. Fill your heart with love, and it will guide you.\"\n\nThere was such peace, then. I dropped the knife, dropped to my knees, and said \"Thank you! Oh, I've been such a fool! What must I do to live a life full of love?\"\n\nThe voice hesitated, and spoke...\n\n\"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nIt was then I realized this glorious white light was a 500-foot tall lizard from the Paleolithic Era.\n\nThe angel on my should screamed \"Get outta here, ya goddamn Loch Ness Monster! We ain't givin' you no tree-fiddy!\"\n\nThe devil scowled, \"I already gave you a dollar.\"\n\nI was irate. \"You can't go givin' the goddamned Loch Ness Monster money! He won't leave!\" \n\nI sighed in defeat.

{"body": "1. Your premise is not demonstrated to be true or false.  There are no known examples of anything \"beginning\" to exist.  All we have ever observed is matter and energy changing from one form to another.  We put labels on certain configurations of matter and can point to a time where that configuration began to exist.  But this type of observation cannot be extrapolated to draw conclusions about the beginning of the universe.  So it is not acceptable to use a premise that is not demonstrated to be likely true and could be true or false.\n\n2.  There could be lots of other possible explanations for the universe besides God or the necessity of its own nature.  It could be a complex simulation running in a lab.  It could be that the universe was created by Satan or some other anti-god type character.  It could be universe creating pixies that have no powers other than the ability to create universes.  It could be lots of other things.  It is not valid to use a premise that limits the number of possibilities without demonstrating that those are the only two possibilities.\n\n3.  The universe may or may not have had a beginning.  Although to be more clear I will say the cosmos may or may not have had a beginning.  The word \"universe\" has two distinct meanings so saying cosmos is more clear.  There are valid cosmological models on both sides and there is no strong consensus either way among cosmologists.  Of course most cosmologists would agree that our observable universe started with the big bang, but it is not know whether the cosmos had a beginning or not.  So it is not acceptable to use this as a premise.\n\n4.  I don't see any reason why the existence of a god could be logically possible but not actually exist.  This is true of everything else so why not God?  It is logically possible for there to be an omnipotent space lobster that roams through space eating planets.  It is logically possible for the Loch Ness Monster to exist.  It is logically possible for Elvis Presley to still be alive.  But none of these things are true.  The fact that something doesn't exist doesn't mean it is not logically possible for it to exist.\n\n5.  The premise is flawed.  First by incorporating a qualifier like \"curious\" into the premise you make it subjective, unfalsifiable, and meaningless.  Second, you cannot determine that something is intelligently designed based on the fact that it seems be a useful adaptation to some end.  Third, there are examples of things that appear to meet the criteria that were probably not intelligently designed.  You could look at the long neck of a giraffe and think that it is well adapted towards to eat from higher trees.  But we know that their necks have over time become longer and longer through natural selection without any intelligent intervention.\n\n6. Everything ever observed within the universe has appeared to operate according to universal physical laws which appear to be completely indifferent to any ends.  You cannot assume an \"end\" simply by looking at the end result and making assumptions.  You need to know how it got to that point.  Otherwise you are making the same mistake people who see the face on Mars and immediately jump to conclusions.\n\n7.  Once again when you insert the subjective qualifier \"resembles\" into the premise then you have rendered the premise unfalsifiable and meaningless.  You could always say that anything \"resembles\" human contrivance.  Even something like the universe, which is about a different from any human made thing as you could possible get.  Humans have never been able to create anything ex nihilo, or create anything as big, or determine things like physical laws.  But subjectively you could still say that the universe is just like things humans make.  The premise is meaningless.\n\n8. Just like any other human concept, no outside power is required in order for them to exist.  Good could simply be a human created word describing a human created concept.  There is no universal law that tells us whether a person is healthy or unhealthy, but the concept \"healthy\" still exists.  There is no reason why the same could not be true of the concepts \"good\" and \"evil.\"\n\n9. I think the best description of the concept of morality is simply that it is a way of trying to determine how actions impact human well being.  This appears to be true of both religious and secular morality.  So if some moral law is discovered it could simply be an objective fact that is discovered about human well being, not something that comes from any outside source.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430935537", "subreddit": "DebateAChristian", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Personally when one comes across a wall of text either in the making or in the wild the amount of focus they can contribute to it is entirely dependent on how bored they are, what they're doing at the time, how distracted they are, and their esteem for the poster. We'll let a friend ramble on and on and on and on and on for about as many years as we'll let them until they are old and grey, and sometimes our own ego might prompt us to ramble on and on and on and on and on for about as many years as we have air in our lungs and water to slake our poor, ravaged throat. In general the polite action to take on seeing a wall of text is to try to find something, maybe a single brick that you can comment on, though you run the risk of looking like you missed the point of the whole, but on the internet this is expected, and often even encouraged! Whereas if you have no interest in the topic and the long-winded approach doesn't encourage any, it is also acceptable to dismiss the conversation completely. If you are really serious about the topic, you might try replying line by line so that you don't lose your place, and also to discourage your counterpart in the conversation from posting so much again. It is best to think carefully while you're formulating your responses so that you don't produce a vast bramble of words, impenetrable and dark, because if you can't focus on something it is very unlikely that a reader will be able to focus on anything, or indeed even bother.

{"body": "That is a good question. You see, a wall of text is often composed of many sentences, which are often composed of words. These words, in turn, are composed of letters. Often times, they are not properly divided into paragraphs, which would make them easier on the eyes. However, on Reddit, that can be considered a flaw in the formatting system, since you need to press enter twice to even make the tiniest of line breaks, which, in most cases, do little to alleviate the feeling that all the text is one giant block. When most people encounter such a, as you and most people call it, \"wall of text\", they often avoid reading the post that contains it. Or, they just read the first few and last few sentences of it and assume they get the jist. Then, they may reply (if their reply is anything other than \"tl;dr\", which means \"too long, didn't read\", and is a common reply to verbose posts such as these) to just that beginning and end, while completely ignoring any hidden messages in the middle. I shot JFK, and am personally responsible for 9/11. It turns out, Jenny fuel can melt steel beams. Also, I've actually been the Loch Ness Monster this whole time. Hail Satan. Now, as for why people might make walls of text, sometimes people just have a lot to say on a certain subject. This is true no matter what the subject is. For example, people can go on and on about their personal views on the lore in TPP. I'm sure we've all seen that many times on the main subreddit. Perhaps it may be beneficial to trim down the verbosity to make it more likely that people will read what you have to say, but quite frankly that can be quite difficult. So, there is no easy solution to this issue. A little bit of proofreading can make sure that you aren't saying the same thing over and over, but that can be quite difficult and there is no easy solution to this issue. Anyway, those are my thoughts on walls of text. I hope you enjoyed them.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430965504", "subreddit": "TPPKappa", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I had always been a little short about my past when talking to her and it is okay. She just thought I had a rough child and bad parents. So now Reddit I tell you about my mother.\n\nMy family grew up in a military style house. Dad served in the Air Force for 20 years and ruled with an iron thumb. They met at a local skating rink where my old man deejay'd on the side. They fell in love and out came me. For some reason my mother always resented me. To this day I can feel her emptiness during the pregnancy. Something just wasnt right about her. Growing up I would never get any attention from her. With dad in the military, I looked up to my mother, but she was never there. She favored my siblings a lot more. This caused me to rebel and I had a lot of trouble in school. I was always getting in trouble. Even my relationships growing up suffered. I could never give my other the attention she deserved. I felt the same emptiness that my mother had for me. I never counseled about it. Fast forward to my wedding day, I finally decide to talk to my mother about it. We had a good talk and we both cried. She explained about how she went through post traumatic stress about my father going to war and being left alone by herself with a new baby. As I was about to go walk my bride to be down the isle she said, \" Hey I need something else if you don't mind\" I said sure whats up? She said \" I need about tree fiddy\" It was around this time I realized that she was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned loch ness monster had gotten me again!

{"body": "I took my seat in the back of the restaurant, I wanted a bit of privacy. I suppose most people who say that have something to hide, guilty conscience will get the best of me someday.\n\n\"Hello sir, how would you like to start today?\"\n\nI looked over the menu, nothing looked appetizing, and I was trying to lose weight, \"I'll take a grilled cheese and a bottle of two buck chuck.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" the man replied with a tight bow and a graceful stride.\n\nI could see other patrons in the dimly-lit establishment, each seemed to be lost in their own bubble of rapid-fire madness, though for most each scene passed by too quickly for me to understand, unless I've seen it online myself.\n\nBernie Sanders streaked past my table, arms flailing above his head, startling me. He was pursued by a pack of sweater vest wearing young men, hurling copies of *Atlas Shrugged*. The scene was surreal, and I wondered how they got past security. I peeked around the corner and noticed the bouncer was surrounded by dozens of kittens. Clever move, college Republicans.\n\nNobody else seemed to notice the commotion though, which worried me. It was loud, and surely the books thrown would have landed close enough to disturb *someone* nearby. But I couldn't pick out a single person that had lifted their head or even blinked at the sight. Is this what it feels like to unplug?\n\nThe waiter returned with my order, \"here you are sir.\"\n\n\"What is this?\" I fumed, \"I ordered a grilled cheese, this is a melt!\" In a fit of rage I tried to flip the table, but my years of websurfing left me with minimal upper body strength.\n\n\"Calm down sir,\" he replied in a sing-song voice.\n\n\"Is this table bolted down?\" I asked as I peeked under, noticing the layers of boogers stuck to the underside. I shuddered.\n\n\"No sir, but I apologize for your meal, and I wasn't able to tell you it was already paid for, before your little outburst.\"\n\n\"Are you patronizing me? You... wait what? It's paid for, by who?\"\n\n\"The gentleman over there,\" he replied as he waved him over. I recognized him immediately, an old coworker. I called him Mister X, though never to his face.\n\nMister X was the kind of guy who could go on about anything, literally any topic was on the table when he spoke. And I was young enough at the time to remember hearing about the kid that the Columbine killers told to leave, before they did what they did.\n\nMister X was cut from that mold. I wanted to be the guy he told to clock out and go, so we talked. About things vacillating between mundanity and insanity, he'd flip flop without me noticing most of the time. When he left suddenly one spring day, I made a point to find a new job as quickly as possible.\n\nI didn't think I'd see the guy again, \"hey man, umm, how've you been?\"\n\n\"Fuckers ignore my facebook posts,\" he said. Am I one? I don't think he friended me, or vice-versa.\n\n\"Yeah, I stopped using facebook, it was all baby pics or Obama photoshops,\" I chuckled nervously, leaning toward the edge of the booth, \"I don't know what's worse, heh.\"\n\n\"Definitely the baby pics, nobody knows how to cook them right,\" he deadpanned.\n\nI was going to try to keep up the absurdist banter as long as I could, but something about his tone curdled my blood. I motioned for the waiter.\n\n\"Yes sir,\" he said with a pained smile.\n\n\"Can you box this up for me, I just realized I'm late for a meeting,\" I said, summoning every ounce of calm I had left.\n\nMusic came up out of nowhere as the waiter rolled his head back, \"*you can log out any time you like, but you can never leave!*\"\n\nI scanned the room and I finally saw it, the shackles, the manacles, the belts and restraints. These people weren't lost in their own little worlds, they were chained to their terminals, unable to pry away. Their look wasn't absent escapism, it was exhausted resignation. I hadn't noticed my shackle until now, as I was pushed into the booth by a large flipper. How could I have not seen that my waiter was a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\nI wanted to scream but the hand on my mouth startled me silent, Mister X stared deep into my eyes with his soulless gaze, \"you've seen some good gore recently, haven't you?\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431034528", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I used to have this friend named Sheridan in high school.  In 10th grade we met but we didn't really talk that much, 11th was about the same but senior year we became really, really good friends.\n\nWe hung out everyday and used to tell each other all about our girlfriends and such.  He was my most trusted friend at the time, which was kind of weird for me since I had some weird trust issues from always getting other friends using me and not really wanting to be my friends.. if that makes sense\n\nBut that's not important.\n\nAnyways, there's an amusement park called Lagoon a few miles from where we live, it's a pretty fun place and it's a good hang out spot in the summer for teens.  We spent the entire year being friends and when the amusement park opened for the year in early June, we decided we'd both ask out a girl if they wanted to go to the amusement park with us and just hang out for the day.\n\nI ask out two girls before one says yes, he only needs to ask out one.\n\nThe day there was pretty fun, we went on rides, played the side games, at lunch and dinner there, and overall had a really fun time.\n\nTowards the end of the evening we decided to switch into our swimming suits (which we had brought with us) and go to the waterpark section of the amusement park.\n\nSo, we get our stuff and go into the water park.  We haven't changed into our swim suits yet so the girls go into the girl locker room and me and Sheridan go into the boys locker room.\n\nFor some reason, Sheridan got really self conscious about his body all of the sudden.  I asked him jokingly what was wrong and he got very offended, saying things like, \"Fuck off, dude.\" and \"Leave me the fuck alone.\"\n\nI'd be joking with him, but he sounded very serious, so I decided to lay off and get dressed.  Instead of getting dressed with me he runs with his swimming suit into a bathroom stall.  I get dressed and go out of the locker rooms to wait for him.\n\nAfter 5 minutes the girls come out but Sheridan still hasn't come out. Another 5 minutes goes by and me and the girls are starting to get worried.  I tell them I'll go check on him.\n\nI walk into the locker room and can see his feet and clothes everywhere under one of the stalls. (The locker room and bathrooms were in the same room, by the way, this might be confusing)  \n\nI thought he was masturbating so I get a genius plan to pop out under the stall and say \"boo\" or something.\n\nI creep up to the side and slide under the stall and shout \"STOP MASTURBATING\"\n\nHe was masturbating.  But that's not the bad part, I expected that.  The scary part was I discovered he was a hermaphrodite.  I would have never known.  I have nothing against hermaphrodites but I was absolutely shocked at finding this out.  It explained why Sheridan was self conscious about taking his clothes off in front of me and everything.\n\nHe started freaking the fuck out when he saw my facial expression change so quickly. \n\n\"DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK? OH, GOD\" he kept saying over and over.  I kept saying \"sorry\" as much as I could but he was absolutely furious.\n\nI felt absolutely awful, still do in a way.  I get him to calm down and he starts yelling at me, \"I need you to never tell anyone.\"\n\nI say something like, \"Ok dude, I will never tell anyone, I promise. Is there anything else I can do?\" , he responds, \"No.\" but I keep insisting that I do something else for him.  He keeps telling me no, so I suggest we go swimming now.  As we're walking out he says, \"Wait, I need something else.\"  \"What do you need?\" I ask.  \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Sheridan was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That damned Loch Ness monster had gotten me again!  \"Damnit Nessie, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam off into the distance.\n\nI didn't get laid that night, neither did any of those girls.  I'm sure they were confused when I tried to tell them the story and they probably didn't believe me.\n\n**TL;DR: Friend has a secret that I never would have expected, I find out the hard way.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431035914", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, I'm an astrophysics undergrad, and the students have the key to the university's observatory, so we will occasionally head up there for some out-of-class observing.\n\nMy classmates view it as a sort of social event, in addition to the observing, though I myself am just in it for the astronomy. Anyways, they sometimes bring some beer to drink and salmon to eat (we have a grill up there; I don't know why). There has also been at least one instance of someone bringing drugs.\n\nSo, one night, all of us were up in the dome, getting some images of the Orion Nebula. Aligning the telescope took a long time, since the CCD camera was throwing it off balance, and some of the cords don't really connect too great anymore. We were up in there a good two hours before we could really start getting images.\n\nWhile we were up there getting it aligned, I offered to go down and start cooking up the salmon, if only to get away from the chatter for a little while. I put them on the grill and paced around just a little bit, when I came across something odd sitting on someone's bag. This was the time that someone brought drugs up. I'm strongly anti-drug, and I was pretty angry that they brought it up there. I don't know exactly what it was, but it didn't exactly look like a prescription.\n\nI must not have been thinking straight at the time, but I thought, if they were going to do drugs up there at the **observatory** of all places, the university-owned observatory, then heck, I might as well just give it to them early. So I crushed it up and sprinkled it over the salmon. A seasoning, if you will.\n\nI finished cooking the salmon, and called up to the others that it was all ready, and they happily chowed down while I took the opportunity to go and have some time with the telescope by myself. 45 minutes later, nobody's come back up, and I start feeling a bit regretful and concerned. I head outside, and I just don't see them anywhere.\n\nI call out to the group, but with no response. I go out to where we all parked, but all the cars were still there. I have no idea what happened to them. I still don't. They were never found (the observatory is in a clearing in an otherwise dense forest in the middle of nowhere), despite me reporting the disappearance to the police--omitting the drug aspect.\n\nI guess in their high state, they wandered off into the woods, and something must have happened to them. I can't imagine they would have been in any shape to fend off a mountain lion or bear.\n\nThis crushed me inside. I've always tried to be a nice guy, and consider myself a pacifist. I was consumed with guilt, but tried to get on with my life. I regretted it, but didn't want to go to jail or anything.\n\nSo one day, I head back up to the observatory. I'm driving up the road, just thinking about what happened last time I was there. I even thought, maybe they'd all just be there waiting, eating salmon and kicking back a few beers, having a great time.\n\nI parked my car, turned off my headlights, and slowly wandered into the clearing in the woods. As I neared the site, a realization suddenly dawned on me. It was about this time that I noticed, the observatory was actually an 8-story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era and I'd been using it to image about tree fiddy galaxies.\n\nI'm sorry.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431063970", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I was just full of bad luck waiting to happen I guess. \n\nOn my way down, I kicked the elevator door in frustration and pushed the \"open door\" button, and got myself stuck in the elevator....for maybe less than a minute. After pushing lots of buttons, it seemed to fix itself and took me downstairs. \n\nAnyway, I called it from a hotel-friend's phone and I could hear it ringing. It was alive!! I had been sure it had broken and a lost cause, but now I had newfound determination to get this phone. \n\nI went to the front desk and asked if they would get it. They refused. They said they were no longer allowed to open the elevator door for safety reasons- only the fire department could handle elevator issues. \n\nHmmmmmm.... Only the fire department huh? Yeah I went there. Now I knew there was a way to jam myself into the elevator, I just had to make it permanent.  It's an old elevator, and it's only a 3-story building...\n\nIt's Friday and I don't know anyone here, so whatever I'm gonna do it. I can't afford a new phone. I ordered some pizza and chilled out and then decided enough time had passed that I could attempt my plan, without the risk of anyone else needing the elevator that night. \n\nI'm going up and down the elevator, pushing on the doors, mashing buttons, until I was satisfactorily stuck. The magic move was to use my foot to pull one of the doors as if I was trying to open it. I called the hotel through the elevator-phone-thingy, to tell them I was stuck. Did you know that waiting in an elevator for a long time is really claustrophobic, even when you do it on purpose?\n\nFinally, the fire department arrives and I can hear them fussing around with doors and such. I had no idea where I had ended up stopped- turns out I was halfway between the 2nd and 3rd floor which was actually sort of terrifying. I wasn't expecting a wall when the door opened. I had about 3 feet of a gap at the bottom to jump down to the 2nd floor... The very nice firemen helped me down and treated me like a trauma case, but I was all good. Maybe a little sweaty. I almost forgot to ask them, but as they were leaving I asked them if they could do me a favor and grab my phone out of the bottom of the elevator shaft. They were a bit confused, but they obliged. We walked down to the bottom and the doors were already open- I guess that's how they found me. Fireman dude jumps in and I realized how dangerous that actually was, to be standing UNDERNEATH a broken elevator. I felt really bad for manipulating them to do this for me. Everything was fine and he found my phone and gave it back. It was dead, but it charged up and worked like a champ later- barely a dent. By the way, the bottom of elevator shafts are really gross and dirty and there's a lot of change down there. Probably about tree fiddy. No I'm kidding. Oh yeah, guess what time they got there? 3:13 am. Not kidding. \n\nAnd that's how I got stuck in an elevator the first time. On purpose.\n\nAnd THEN, 3 days later I got stuck in the elevator at work. On the \"14th\" floor. Yeah. That also didn't last long, they fixed it without me having to jump out. \n\nAaaaand that's my hardly believable elevator story!\n\n**TLDR: It's not a tree fiddy story!

{"body": "&gt; She could find out both of these things if fArya meets Arya in Braavos, as Jeyne has been spending time with Theon and was sent with Justin Massey, who in turn was sent to Braavos. \n\nI would love that! I can see it happening already. Arya would be so confused at first.  \nImagine...  \nApplause and Braavosi murmur filled the playhouse as the troupe of mummers bowed deeply on a stage that somehow seemed to tilt. Near the edge of the pit, a girl with a thousand league stare sat still as a statue, her cup untouched. At her side a knight smiled at the costumed girl who blew a kiss in his direction. He drank the last of his Andalish sour and grimaced.  \n\"Would that we understood their tongue at least...\", he said and turned towards the girl who averted her head and ran her fingers through tousled hair. The cold had claimed the tip of her nose, and while Ser Justin did his best not to look, she never failed to notice how uncomfortable she made him.  \n\"I see the way you look at them. The girls. I saw it often enough in Kings Landing.\"  \n\"My lady...\", he began.  \n\"I used to dread those looks. How silly of me. There are far worse things to dread.\"  \nAround them, some patrons prepared to leave, while others prepared to eat and drink. Especially the latter.  \nSuddenly the knight tensed up and slowly placed a hand on the hilt of his sword, his eyes fixed on a stout serving wench seemingly heading straight for their table. As she approached the knight rose and stepped between her and the girl.   \n\"You have the wrong table.\", he said with a voice cold as ice.  \nThe wench frowned, she seemed to know but a little of the common tongue of Westeros. Finally, with a smile, she set down her tray.  \n\"Cake of lemon, gift from Mercy, mummer girl!\"  \nSer Justin scanned the room, but the mummers were nowhere to be seen.  \n\"Oh... Oh! And... where could I give my thanks to this.. Mercy. Will she be around?\"  \n\"If quick, room for other clothes up stairs, end of hall, many big rooms.\" The wench pointed at a door next to the stage. \"Only thanking!\", she laughed, and left.  \nSer Justin Massey bit his lip and gave the girl a quick glance.  \n\"Go to her.\"  \n\"Would that I could, but my place is here, it's the honor of a knight to protect his lady.\"  \n\"I'm not your lady, and I'll be fine. No one will recognize me.\"  \nThe knight fell silent, looking down at the table.  \n\"To be sure, no one will bother me, not anymore. Go.\"  \n\"Well... as my lady commands. I will be back in a few heartbeats, before your cake is finished. Please do eat something at least.\"  \nHe left in a hurry, and as the door closed behind him she was startled by someone standing next to her, a girl her age dressed in a brown wool tunica and heavy boots, the very same that had blown a kiss from the stage.  \n\"Ser Justin went to look for you.\" the girl said.  \n\"Just so.\" The mummer replied, and climbed into the opposing chair silent as a cat.  \nA few moments passed while the mummer stared into her eyes.  \n\"Mercy?\"  \n\"Mercedine really, they call me Mercy. What do they call you?\"  \n\"I... I don't know, if...\"  \n\"You don't know your name?\", the mummer asked amused.  \nTears welled up in the girls eyes. \"I do, I do know my name, I am Arya of House Stark, I remember my name, I remember...\"  \nMercy's smile disappeared and she blinked a few times.  \n\"That, I did not expect,\" she finally said, \"what brings you here Arya of House Stark?\"  \n\"My father was killed. I had nowhere to go. I've seen and done things I don't want to think about. But we escaped.\" She stared at the lemon cake. \"I feel like the ghost of a complete stranger.\"  \nMercy said nothing, but reached out and touched her cheek. \"Your knight will be returning soon, I should leave, but remember, when then winds of winter blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. I can help you survive. Valar dohaeris.\"  \n\"Before you leave, tell me true, how much do I owe you for the lemon cake?\"  \nMercedine pondered this. \"About tree fiddy.\"  \nShe rose and left.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431087918", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

Well about halfway through the flight I noticed two women about mid twenties get up and go to the same lavatory together. I didn't think nothing of it at first, but after awhile I started to wonder. So like 30 minutes go by and these girls are still in the damn lavatory. So I walk up to the door knock and ask if everything is ok and I don't hear anything back. So I start getting worried. I try to open the door, but it's locked so I go and get the key. When I unlock the door I can't believe what I'm seeing before my eyes. \n\nThe two women were 69ing. You may ask \"How in an airplane lavatory that's small as hell?\". Well just sit back and listen my friend.  One woman was sitting on the toilet like you do when you're taking a shit and the other woman upside down with her head basically in the toilet. The one woman sitting on the toilet looked up and gasped and farted or shit I don't know which probably both. The upside down girl started screaming \"Why tf did you shit you nasty bitch!?\". At this point I don't know what to fucking do. I'm at a loss for words and can't believe this shit. \n\nAll the sudden the plane starts shaking hard because what I thought was turbulence. It wasn't turbulence it was much much worse. The woman sitting on the toilet lets go of the upside down woman during this and the woman falls knocking me out of the lavatory. I get back up and see shit all in the hair and forehead of this naked chick and I'm grossed out as hell. I look back towards the other woman and she's gone. Turns out it wasn't a woman at all!

They said they were no longer allowed to open the elevator door for safety reasons- only the fire department could handle elevator issues.\n&gt; Hmmmmmm.... Only the fire department huh? Yeah I went there. Now I knew there was a way to jam myself into the elevator, I just had to make it permanent. It's an old elevator, and it's only a 3-story building...\n&gt; It's Friday and I don't know anyone here, so whatever I'm gonna do it. I can't afford a new phone. I ordered some pizza and chilled out and then decided enough time had passed that I could attempt my plan, without the risk of anyone else needing the elevator that night.\n&gt; I'm going up and down the elevator, pushing on the doors, mashing buttons, until I was satisfactorily stuck. The magic move was to use my foot to pull one of the doors as if I was trying to open it. I called the hotel through the elevator-phone-thingy, to tell them I was stuck. Did you know that waiting in an elevator for a long time is really claustrophobic, even when you do it on purpose?\n&gt; Finally, the fire department arrives and I can hear them fussing around with doors and such. I had no idea where I had ended up stopped- turns out I was halfway between the 2nd and 3rd floor which was actually sort of terrifying. I wasn't expecting a wall when the door opened. I had about 3 feet of a gap at the bottom to jump down to the 2nd floor... The very nice firemen helped me down and treated me like a trauma case, but I was all good. Maybe a little sweaty. I almost forgot to ask them, but as they were leaving I asked them if they could do me a favor and grab my phone out of the bottom of the elevator shaft. They were a bit confused, but they obliged. We walked down to the bottom and the doors were already open- I guess that's how they found me. Fireman dude jumps in and I realized how dangerous that actually was, to be standing UNDERNEATH a broken elevator. I felt really bad for manipulating them to do this for me. Everything was fine and he found my phone and gave it back. It was dead, but it charged up and worked like a champ later- barely a dent. By the way, the bottom of elevator shafts are really gross and dirty and there's a lot of change down there. Probably about tree fiddy. No I'm kidding. Oh yeah, guess what time they got there? 3:13 am. Not kidding.\n&gt; And that's how I got stuck in an elevator the first time. On purpose.\n&gt; And THEN, 3 days later I got stuck in the elevator at work. On the \"14th\" floor. Yeah. That also didn't last long, they fixed it without me having to jump out.\n&gt; Aaaaand that's my hardly believable elevator story!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431115944", "subreddit": "intrusivethoughts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Last semester, there was this girl in one of my philosophy classes who was really intriguing. Redhead, really bright green eyes, great hourglass figure wrapped in the irresistible combo of hipster scarves and ironic t-shirts. She was the adorable artsy type that I would find really attractive just walking across campus, but since I got to hear her talk in class all the time, I didn't need to feel guilty about being shallow; her brain was just as hot as the rest of her. Honestly I could barely follow what her opinions were, because she played devil's advocate all the time and used her witty humor to run circles around everyone else. In a way, that was my downfall.\n\nI generally consider myself a smart guy, and I could usually keep up with the discussion even if I couldn't tell when this girl was being serious or just goofy. And I usually could poke holes in other people's arguments. But I felt like this girl was entirely out of my league unless and until I could demonstrate something close to her wit. I actually became one of the top contributors in the class just with that goal in mind, and things went pretty well. Pretty often we would just go back and forth with each other, and it felt like we were building chemistry without even dating. She certainly seemed to enjoy it as much as I did.\n\nFinally, a couple of weeks after midterms, I'd got to the point where I thought she was pretty impressed with me. It was time to make my move. So after class one day, I stopped her to ask some trivial question about her opinion on Kant's absolutist prohibition of lying, and as soon as the rest of the class had filed past, I asked her out. It took some serious nerve, at least considering how much I'd built her up in my mind, but oh wonder of wonders, she accepted with a grin, and even said she'd been waiting for me to ask. We made plans to go see Skyfall. So far, so awesome.\n\nSo we went to the movie that Friday night, and agreed that it was better than Quantum of Solace, but a little short of Casino Royale. Soon we started talking about The Master, and moved on from that to Scientology, psychology of religion, etc. It turned out that one-on-one, she was a lot more serious, less erratic about her arguments, but just as smart. We talked for nearly four hours, and by the end of it I was entirely in love with her. I started working myself up for going for a kiss, but before I got there, she floored me by checking the time and saying, \"It's too late for you to come back to my room. I guess we'll have to be content with your car, huh?\" I stammered like an idiot, the first time I'd been at a loss for words all night. Fortunately she was already invested, and it didn't faze her. Off came the hipster scarf, then the ironic t-shirt, and we started making out right there in the car. She didn't even want to pause to move to the back seat, but asked me if I had a condom.\n\nNow see, there was an interesting thing that came up in philosophy class. Fairly early on, before I knew her style well, she made an argument that sperm are really indistinguishable from toddlers if we are talking about potential for human consciousness. Okay, not entirely indistinguishable, I figured she meant, since she was just poking holes in someone else's definition, not explaining her own theory in full. I had long since forgotten about that discussion. Big mistake. Now, in my car, the dry humping was not helping my judgment any as I pulled a condom out of my pocket. \"I'll put it on with my mouth,\" she said. \"Special skill.\" My focus was on her fantastic boobs when she tore open the condom packet. A moment later, my penis was surrounded by the welcoming warmth of her lips and tongue (holy hell, did I mention she had a tongue piercing?), and took all my effort to avoid cumming right then. Pretty soon she was riding me, rolling her hips to great effect, and I was the happiest man in the world. After a few minutes, she sped up, threw her head back, and moaned, \"I want it, I waaaant it!\" \"What do you want?\" \"About tree fiddy,\" she said. And right then I realized that this gorgeous redhead with the fantastic figure and charming intellect was actually the motherfucking loch ness monster. She leapt off my cock and begin swimming away to join Cthulhu. Holy fucking shit.\n\n**TL;DR: Beautiful, intelligent girl from philosophy class turned out to have some really weird desires.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431120937", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Just the other day, I was watching The View. The topic was “My Family Blames Me for a Murder”. On this particular episode, there was a woman who at just the age of fourteen years old, shot and killed her father. She killed her father because from the age five until fourteen, he was molesting her. She had soon learned that her younger sister had fallen victim to their father’s abuse, as well. The woman said she knew she had to take care of the situation, and ensure that it would never happen again. She did just that, by shooting her father, twice in the head. It was amazing to watch this woman, and see just how she was able to keep herself together while telling her story. The woman was crying, but mostly because she had not spoken to her sister in over twelve years. Her younger sister did not understand why she killed their father, and resented her because of it. It baffled Sharon how this woman was able to move on with her life, and how she even made it as far as she had. Her response to him was, “Sharon, from that experience, it defined my life and made me the person that I am today.” As traumatic an experience as it was, she mustered up the courage to move on with her life, and used her experience as a way to define her own existence. Man must not be mistaken; life is unpredictable, and suffering is unavoidable. If we know this to be true, why not remain optimistic in this journey through life.\n\nThere are no specific set of rules that man must follow, in order to live the good life. It comes down having the freedom to make your own choices. We are in favor of what is in the best interest for ourselves. However, man must respect that his decisions not only affect him, but all of humanity. Even if we decide not to choose, we have still made a choice, and that choice ultimately affects all of mankind. \n\ntree fiddy", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431124034", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

For him the arrival in Valhalla felt like more of a punishment than an honor.   \"Adrianople\", he muttered and stared off across the room.  It was then he heard a nasally voice say, \"It's all in the numbers.\"  Valens was sitting alone and wondered where the voice could have come from.  He looked around and the only people he saw were seated to far away.  Besides, he knew the voice of northern men and warriors such as these.  None would have so unmanly a voice.  Then he saw him.  A man on the far side of the room sat tapping on a white contraption.  He stared at a box in front of him that glowed with a gentle white light.  Valens could see him mouth it and heard it again.  \"Its all in the numbers.\"  How could he project his voice from such a distance.  No others seemed to take notice and more importantly what did this funny looking little man mean?  Valens stood and walked toward him.  He walked past the tall north men and the stern looking ones from the steppes.  He walked past the leather clad Japanese warriors and the red coated men before he finally arrived at the desk of the man with the strange voice.  \n\"What do you mean that it's all in the numbers\", Valens asked.\n\n\"Odin employs me to tally the goods used here in Valhalla. Tyr employs me for numbers in war.\"\n\n\"You don't look like a great warrior,\" Valens said.  \n\n\"Looks are deceiving\", the man replied.  \"I was known to have the highest DPS on the server.  Over a million orcs fell before my wizard.  Only exhaustion could slay me.\"      \n\n\"And who exactly are you\", Valens asked.  \n\n\"I am Ted the Accountant.\"\n\n\"I was wrong not to have waited for Gratian wasn't I\", Valens asked remorsefully. \n\n\"That would have changed the numbers\", Ted replied.\n\n\"I am surrounded by great warriors and my legacy is one of defeat.  What do I do now Ted\", Valens asked as tears rolled down his cheek.  \n\n\"Lend me about tree fiddy\", Ted replied.  \n\n\"Damnit!   I ain't lending you no tree fiddy!\"   \n  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431150687", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, story time. And this is a true story, not a tree fiddy or a \"should've marked serious\" story.\n\nStarted out at a local beach where there are a bunch of firepits. It's a popular summer night party spot. A buddy &amp; I, knowing one had to be there hours early to snag a pit, would buy a bundle of firewood at the supermarket, bring a couple of flasks, walk around, and get invited into a group. Worked many times and we had fun. Behind the beach is a long, steep, high hillside, mostly covered in trees, with houses up on the ridge.\n\nOne night, some guys at the party we got in on kept talking up 'the swing.' It was apparently up in the woods somewhere, and they spoke of it like it was the greatest swing ever made. They started debating going to the swing, and when they finally decided to do so, we tagged along. So we walk up to the woods and enter the trees, up a steep little bit that looked like a trailhead, but about a hundred feet up - and it was *UP* - it started getting dicey. The other folks were using cellphones as lights and they obviously knew the way, but I'm glad we both had small flashlights, because at some points, the trail was sloped laterally about 45 degrees! We slipped a few times.\n\nFinally, when we're wheezing and panting, the trail opens out into an enormous and *very* dark clearing. We let our eyes adjust, and I wish I had photos to describe it better (I need to go back up there by day and take some!) The clearing was still very much a hillside. A bit under halfway up was a flat, level area, with a firepit and log benches on one side. On the other, someone had lashed together a crude teepee from branches, about 15 feet tall, covered with grody old blankets and with some camping furniture inside-- it definitely wasn't rain-proof. There were scattered trees forming a very high leaf canopy, maybe 35-40 feet above the firepit area. Between the teepee and the firepit were cut big, wide steps, leveled out and with a log at the front to keep them from eroding; they started at the bottom of the hill, continued up past the firepit, getting smaller, narrower and more numerous, to another flat spot with a bench, which was maybe 15 feet up the hill from the firepit. Past that was a narrow stairway which continued another 8-10 feet to the top, almost in the forest. Hanging in the open space between the teepee and firepit was a rope swing made from a single very thick rope, with a round board at the bottom, tied way up high to 3 ropes going out to nearby trees. Yes, it *was* worth the hype!\n\nThe guys got a fire going and people began using the swing. You'd grab it and climb the stairs to the very top, and its length was arranged so that at no point was the wood seat less than about 3 1/2-4 feet off the ground, so your feet wouldn't drag. You'd hop on at the very top, and it was actually a pretty thrilling little ride in the mostly-dark, over the firepit and out over the brush-covered slope below the clearing. Once it started to run out of steam, someone would grab the disk, walk you back part-way up so you could hop off, and they'd climb up to get on. Apparently, I was told, some (their term) \"old hippie\" who lives up the hill built all this.\n\nWe hung out with them, talked, swung and drank for about an hour, maybe a bit more, then did our best to go down (it was tricky). We've been to the beach several times, but that was THE best experience, period.\n\nEdit: Runner-up were some friends whose house had a basement rec room, which had a nice fireplace, lots of couches, a little dance floor, and a wet bar. I'd be the bartender at those parties, and the girl-of-the-house would usually decree that only I and one other person (to keep prying hands out when I took a break) were to be back there. One time, the other guy was a BIG guy. He was, as I was, to stay mostly sober. I went out for a ten-minute break. Walk back in, ten fucking minutes, the guy is *wasted* drunk... and refused to let me back into the bar! Several of the biggest other guys there had to drag him, kicking and clawing at the bar, out of there, let me dart back in, and then block the entrance as he fought to get back to the sweet, boozy goodness waiting back there.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431177798", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I have only one kid myself, and the relationship I have with him wasn't the greatest during his youth. \n\nThe day I really realized that my boy was growing up was not too long ago. I  was doing some work around the yard, and he came and asked \"Dad, can I ask you a question?\" so I said, \"Sure!\"\n\nAfter that he asked me what I make an hour, So I told him that I make  37 euros an hour (Before taxes, ofcourse. I'm  from holland) \n\nHe then asked me \"Can I borrow fifty bucks?\" To which I replied \"If the only reason you asked me about my pay is so that you can borrow some money to buy some random bottle of booze, you can get away from my house. You know I don't support that.\"\n\nHe quietly looked at me, thinking to himself in deep thought. I just got angrier about my boy's question, How dare he ask me about money after all I did for him?  but then I thought: Maybe there's something he really needs for those fifty bucks. So I say \"I'm sorry son. Here's the cash.\" so a day later he comes back, and I ask him where he needed the cash for. his reply was  \"I  needed to buy a good pair of pants so I can apply for this job.\"\n\nNeedless to say, I was incredibly proud of him. From that moment I realized that my little boy had become a man. Prioritizing a job above messing around with his friends. I then asked him: Son, was there any change? He replied \"Yes, About three fiddy.\" which he refused to give back. It was about that time I realized my son was a 7 stories tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damn loch ness Monster had gotten me again. Damnit, monsta, you ain't getting no three fiddy.\n\ntl;dr.

{"body": "Addendum to my comment;\n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nIf you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n\n*Additional links*  \n\nOn the claims Christianity;\n\nAside from the complete lack of evidence, a problem Christianity shares with other religions, I'd have to say a problem is the core belief of Christianity itself.\n\nThe completely unsubstantiated, second party blood 'sacrifice' atonement, by and to the same party, to make up for an alleged crime(original sin) committed by someone else before I was born, on penalty of eternal torture and damnation, amounts to little more than a spiritual mafia-style shake down that's a whole lot less appealing to an outsider than you might imagine.\n\nAn excellent analogy, [Kissing Hank's Ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaFZQBb2srM)\n\nThe Immorality of Christianity;\n\n[Evil Bible](http://www.evilbible.com/) has many references to the  immorality contained within the bible, including; [ritual human sacrifice](http://www.evilbible.com/Ritual_Human_Sacrifice.htm), [rape](http://www.evilbible.com/Rape.htm), [murder](http://www.evilbible.com/Murder.htm), [intolerance](http://www.evilbible.com/BiblicalIntolerance.htm), and [slavery](http://www.evilbible.com/Slavery.htm). \n\n[Christopher Hitchens: The Bible is Immoral](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyBS84i7KXs)\n\n[Matt Dillahunty: Christianity is an Immoral System](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz_ryHYc_Pc)\n\nOn the Inerrancy of the Bible;\n\n[Skeptic’s Annotated Bible’s list of biblical contradictions](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/contra/by_name.html).\n\n[Infidels.org's list of biblical contradictions](http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html).\n\n[NonStampCollector's video on biblical contradictions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3g6mXLEKk).\n\n[On the validity of the OT versus the NT](http://www.evilbible.com/do_not_ignore_ot.htm)\n\n[Scientific Errors in the Bible](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scientific_errors_in_the_Bible )\n\n[Wikipedia entries criticism, scientific &amp; historical issues of the Bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy#Scientific_and_historical_criticism )\n\nOn the historicity of Jesus;\n\nDid Jesus exist? Maybe. But what can we know about him, if anything? Most if not all of the accounts about the life and deeds of Jesus are non-contemporaneous. The oft cited accounts of Josephus are likely forged.

{"body": "A day before his 15th birthday, the son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, 'Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?'\n\nThe son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.\n\nFinally, the son said, 'Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.'\n\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, 'If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.'\n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.\n\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.\n\n'Father,' replied the son, 'I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'\n\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.'\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.\n\n'Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.'\n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?'\n\n'A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed.\n\n'I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.'\n\nAnd so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a \ncarton of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next \nday, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.\n\n'Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?'\n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. 'Please humour me, dear father.'\n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.\n\nThe next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.\n\n'Dearest father,' the son started, 'I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.'\n\nOne of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.\n\nThe next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than \nat home.\n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.\n\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the \nfather braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.\n\n'Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.'\n\nIt was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.\nThe next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.\n\n'Father,' the son said, 'You've made me very happy yet again.'\n\nThat night, the son spent on board the tanker.\n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.\n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.\n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. 'My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?'\n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. 'Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; I would like about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this time that his father realized that his son was an 8 story tall reptile from the Paleozoic era.

When we were both young, camping in the backwoods of Alabama, we kissed each other.  We were laughing, crying, rolling in the moist grass, and I was happy.  Then, our Scoutmaster John came over.  He punched me so hard that I felt as if my teeth could fly miles away.  As for Mark, he kicked him down a hill, where he rolled until he hit a large Oak tree at around 20 miles per hour.  Mark had to go to the hospital, but he couldn't.  He couldn't risk the townsfolk learning that there's a homosexual in town.  John left, spitting to us \"If I EVER catch you goddam faggots hanging by this here woods again, I will fucking kill you both!\"  Mark really needed to go to the hospital, and he couldn't let the others know of anything.  So, we figured that he could ride the bus.  We walked around 10 miles to the bus station, dehydrated, starving, and bleeding.  I had to carry Mark the back half of the way.  When we climbed onto the bus, the driver halted both of us, as he needed to say something.  \"Gunna need bout tree fitty, aight?\"  It was at this moment when I realized that Mark was an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era.

Oh, or maybe show me you cleared the rent on your own; that'd really take the wind out-\"\n\nPete pulled the hammer back, the noise satisfyingly loud in the mostly empty diner. Beth's sardonic expression froze. Her mouth was suddenly dry and she became acutely aware that Pete wasn't nervous. A bit of sarcasm came to mind about the size of the magnum being a matter of over-compensation, but Pete's decidedly irrational state of mind forced her to store the jape in the vault for later use. If there was a later.\n\nShe straightened her apron and slid into the booth. \"Alright. No problem, big guy. No need to get all Charles Bronson. I could use a break anyway.\"\n\n\"Really? Seemed pretty dead tonight.\"\n\n\"Well it isn't and I'd like to keep it that way. So let's talk. It's obviously something you couldn't have, you know, texted or IM'd. It's not that latent oedipal thing is it-\"\n\n\"I have a gun, B. You can go back to cutting me down when you answer my questions, or rather, if I believe what you have to say.\"\n\nBeth glanced at the table across the room where a a smattering of hipster nighthawks sat chattering about the culture they loved to hate. She wondered if they'd have the presence of mind to call 911 if they noticed Pete's gun, and immediately worried how Pete would manage getting into that kind of trouble. \nShe sighed. \"Ask away, man.\"\n\nPete laid a manilla folder on the table with his free hand and slid them across. \"I'm going to put the-the gun, under the table. You take a look at these and maybe extrapolate my questions. There's a video on my phone, too. But the folder first, for context.\"\n\n\"What's in here? Grainy photos of Nessie? Stock images of an alien autopsy? No, no, Jimmy Hoffa is alive and well in Columbus with Aunt Chelsea. Pete, if this is weird porn, you're going to need the gun, because I'm gonna-\"\n\n\"Stifle the bile for ten minutes, Beth. Goddamnit, I brought a fucking gun, I am not joking, and given the nature of the situation you shouldn't be either.\"\n\nBeth opened her eyes wide, cocking her head to the left and shrugging. \"Okie-dokie, 'Deepthroat'- let's see what Nixon's been up to.\"\n\nShe opened the folder. The photo on top was black and white, a bit hazy at the corners, and taken with a wide angle lens. The point-of-view was from under Pete's TV stand, looking out on the couch and coffee table. She recognized Mike on the couch, under a large black-and-white zebra print blanket and a monstrous Yellow Labrador, Apollo. Daniel was in the recliner to the right of the couch, mouth agape in a monstrous snore, wearing a thick wool hooded sweatshirt. The table was adorned in the accouterment of a friday night: beer cans, a red glass water-pipe (nicknamed \"Scarlet\" if she remembered correctly), and a stack of pizza boxes each picked as clean as a gazelle's carcass. \n\nThe next picture was the same scene, but now showed Pete in the hallway. The next shot showed Pete entering the kitchen, and another figure in the darkened hall behind him. The final shot revealed the figure moving behind the couch, holding a small box under one arm and heading for the door. \n\n\"That's you, Beth. Last friday. I have no idea what the box is, or where it is from. You were supposed to be at Hope's.\"\n\n\"This has to be some kind of joke, right Pete? I mean, that looks like me, but I was at Hope's all weekend. You can ask her.\"\n\n\"I did. She said you were. That's why I got one of Jameson's guns.\"\n\n\"Hold on, where did these pictures come from? Did you put a camera in the living room? Gross! You know that's where Daniel and I-\"\n\n\"I didn't put it there. I got this earlier,\" he laid his phone on the table, the screen showing a single text message: \"There is no eye in team, but there's one under the TV. - Rook -\"\n\n\"Wow. That's punny, Pete, \" Beth looked back at the pictures. \"And 'Rook'? Come on, this is probably just Haley messing with you guys. She's into gadgets, she's into chess. You're getting pranked, or maybe she's just trying to get you to play an alternate reality game or something. If that's the case, I want in, but you gotta ditch the hand cannon. Jameson's getting some pretty scary hardware these days. Is that the full-frame model or-\"\n\n\"B, for the love of fuck, you know me. You know I would have assumed there was a game at play from the start, because that's what I did. I assumed that you, Haley, and Hope were just trying to mess with me and the guys. It's the video, B.\"\n\nPete picked up the phone, made a few swipes, and laid it back down before giving it a tap. \n\nThe video was from multiple angles in Pete's house, from what Beth guessed was months ago based on the arrangement of the furniture. The video jumped from room to room, showing each one to be empty, until it paused at Pete's room. After ten seconds of inactivity, Pete's closet door opened, and Beth watched herself step out holding the black box from the pictures. Psuedo-Beth walked over to Pete's bed, and slid the black box beneath it. When she stepped out of frame, the box seemed to disappear, and Psuedo-Beth returned to the closet. \n\nBeth pushed the phone across the table. \"What the actual fuck, dude. So that's why gun?\"\n\n\"There's my first question. Also, yes. That's why gun.\"\n\n\"I have no idea, Pete. I still think someone is messing with you, doctoring some videos and some pics or something. But I think this is out of Haley's range. Hope is barely tech literate enough to use a smartphone, let alone photoshop that well. And this Rook thing, the whole thing is weird and as much as I hate to sound cliche, you should probably go to the police.\"\n\n\"What's in the box, or hell, what is the box? The video doesn't looked doctored at all, and it is plainly you. So let's have some explanations that make sense before I go down to the station and hand over a big pile of unanswered questions that include photographic evidence of drug paraphernalia in my fucking living room.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to tell you, Pete. Maybe I'm a Manchurian Candidate sleeper agent. Maybe I'm a terminator who is taking way to long to deep six it's target. But I think that gives you too much credence. You're no John Connor,\" Beth said, \"but I know that whoever is in those pictures and on that video isn't me.\"\n\nPete sighed, slowly letting the hammer drop into place and putting the gun back into the concealed holster tucked into his waistband. \"Fair enough, B. I just had to show you what I've seen and hear you tell me you've got nothing to do with it. Thanks for being so calm about all of this. This might be the wrong time to ask, but I need you to help me explain this problem to the guys, now that you're aware of what's going on.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure.

The bones of the teenagers cracked and splintered, quickly reassembling and shuddering into a single chaotic mass. \n\nPete withdrew the gun from its hiding place and joined Beth, both moving towards the counter, putting space between them and the thing from table twenty-three. The fleshy mass pulled itself along the floor, the mouths of the teenagers being torn along the trembling form, each one twisting in pain and wailing in pain.\n\n\"What the actual fuck!\" Pete leveled the revolver at the hipster-beast. Beth reached up and grabbed his arm.\n\n\"Seriously, man! You've seen the movies! When the gibbering-hell-creature-that-should-not-be starts shambling your way, you fucking leave!\"\n\nShe pulled him towards the door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY, shouting that her Jetta was parked in the backlot and that she'd never been happier to have a remote start kit, when they both came to a halt.\n\nBrett stood by the exit, his hands and eye sockets empty, chest heaving and tongue licking his bottom lip. He spat a gout of blood. \n\n\"Ms. Hornlaw, I don't believe your shift is over.\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431283084", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

There have been 11 previous expeditions of small groups of scientists to Area X but bad things always seem to happen to them. This follows the unnamed Biologist on the 12th expidition. I was intrigued with the premise but also wary - it's much easier to come up with a mysterious premise, but making it payoff in any meaningful way is harder. This book didn't pay off for me at all. The writing is very vague and because of that the characters and their world doesn't feel substantial. The reader is very robotic but she was probably just trying to fit the character so I wouldn't hold this performance against her too much.\n\n**[At the Water's Edge](http://www.amazon.com/At-Waters-Edge-Novel/dp/B00TXRHW52/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=)** by Sara Gruen read by Justine Eyre. \n\nAnother dud. This is a romance novel about a stuck-up American woman who goes to Scotland during WWII with her husband to look for the Loch Ness monster. The three main American characters are truly despicable, and the narrator's reading makes them sound even worse. The narrator Justine Eyre gave one of the all-time worst performances I've heard. At the end of every sentence her voice gets constricted and breathy. I'd never heard anything like it and couldn't figure out what she was doing. It got very distracting - I would listen to each sentence just imagining how she would ruin it. I was perusing some reviews of her online and found one that hit the nail on the head - each sentence sounds like she is working through a particularly difficult bowel movement. \n\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431305636", "subreddit": "audiobooks", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I had a drink in my hand, sat down and i fell backward, drink goes onto my shirt and I fall down the hill. When i say everybody saw, I mean EVERYBODY. He must have told them he was going to do something like this. \n\nAnyway let's get to my revenge. I was really excited, i had planned it for days and of course I did it at another one of his parties. I went over and started to set up the prank. He would open up the door where he hid his big surprise of the party(his new paintball gun) and i put a bucket of ice cold water on top of the door. Then i would walk up while he had his eyes closed from the water and smash a pie in his face. I know this sounds really cartoony but hey, i'm not the most creative person in the world. \n\nFast forward to the party. Everyone is having a good time and of course I am out of my mind excited. He stands up and says to everyone \"okay, calm down\" or something like that, then begins to make a big scene about how great he is, and walks over to the door. He opens it up and the water falls perfectly all over his face, shirt and pants. I have the pie in hand when i walk over and realize it isn't my friend at all! it's old Nessy wearing a lot of make up! The Loch Ness then asks for some change and it will leave but all i have is three dollars and 60 cents, she says she only needs tree fiddy, not this time Nessy, and i smacked the pie in her face.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431380989", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

People usually gave money when I offered them the card, because for some reason that's common practice. Well, I was walking, knocking doors and ringing door bells, handing out those cards. And I come at a house, and an old friend of mine opened. I used to go to school with this guy, and he moved away, and I hadn't seen him in a long time. So, he invited me in. Apparently they just finished dinner. And we talked a bit, exchanged phone numbers, you know the deal. We talked a bit more, and suddenly his little brother comes running downstairs. This kid must have been around 7 or 8. He comes running down butt naked. So from here on it's awkward. Nobody seems to care, though. So I figure I'll ignore it. I am really stunned when his sister comes in the room absolutely naked. I figured they were just really comfortable with walking around in the house naked, or maybe they just don't like clothes, until we run in to his just as naked mother (which, honestly, was a sight I wish I could forget). At this point I feel like leaving, so I make up an excuse I need to go.

{"body": "Addendum to my comment;\n\nEvery claim of evidence or reason to believe I have ever heard a theist present boils down to; personal experience, logical fallacy, or blind faith. None of which are good reasons to believe anything, let alone an extraordinary claim.\n\nPersonal experience is poor evidence because it is often unreliable and not repeatable. Personal experience and 'eyewitness' testimony is often mistaken or inaccurate and sometimes contradicted by evidence. Plus, if I can't share your experience, I'm unlikely to put much weight in your unsupported claims.\n\nFallacies are all too commonly given as evidence to support the existence of deities; \"you can't prove god/UFOs/Bigfoot don't exist\"(prove non-existence), \"everything has a cause, except god who is an un-caused creator\"(special pleading), \"god is real because the bible says so &amp; god wrote the bible\"(circular reasoning), etc. If your most compelling reason to believe in god is a fallacy, don't expect me to find it convincing.\n\nIf you say you believe based on faith alone, I accept that you believe it, but, faith can be used to justify anything; I could have faith that Odin exists, faith in the Loch Ness monster, or faith in Tarot cards, etc. How useful is faith in determining what is true if faith can be used to justify any belief?\n\nSome might argue that you can't disprove god. This is shifting of the burden of proof, a fallacy(proving a negative), and it's not necessarily true. Many definitions of god can, in fact, be dis-proven. I could prove that Zeus does not exist if he is defined as a corporeal being living atop Mount Olympus who is responsible for lightning bolts because those are testable characteristics.\n\nGod could also be defined as have logically contradictory properties like being all knowing, all powerful and all good/loving/compassionate. This type of god could neither create, nor allow anything that could be bad, evil, or harmful, yet such things do exist.\n\nIf god were redefined into something unknowable, immaterial or existing outside of space and time, as most modern theist tend to do, then this god might be impossible to prove or disprove...but this god is also, arguably, no different than something wholly imaginary. I could assert that this vague definition of god doesn't exist, be 100% right, and still have zero ‘proof’ that I was correct. Besides, what possible evidence would you expect there to be that would prove the non-existence of this god?\n\nSo, I will continue to not believe in gods until given a valid reason to think otherwise.\n\n*Additional links*  \n\nOn the claims Christianity;\n\nAside from the complete lack of evidence, a problem Christianity shares with other religions, I'd have to say a problem is the core belief of Christianity itself.\n\nThe completely unsubstantiated, second party blood 'sacrifice' atonement, by and to the same party, to make up for an alleged crime(original sin) committed by someone else before I was born, on penalty of eternal torture and damnation, amounts to little more than a spiritual mafia-style shake down that's a whole lot less appealing to an outsider than you might imagine.\n\nAn excellent analogy, [Kissing Hank's Ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaFZQBb2srM)\n\nThe Immorality of Christianity;\n\n[Evil Bible](http://www.evilbible.com/) has many references to the  immorality contained within the bible, including; [ritual human sacrifice](http://www.evilbible.com/Ritual_Human_Sacrifice.htm), [rape](http://www.evilbible.com/Rape.htm), [murder](http://www.evilbible.com/Murder.htm), [intolerance](http://www.evilbible.com/BiblicalIntolerance.htm), and [slavery](http://www.evilbible.com/Slavery.htm). \n\n[Christopher Hitchens: The Bible is Immoral](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyBS84i7KXs)\n\n[Matt Dillahunty: Christianity is an Immoral System](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz_ryHYc_Pc)\n\nOn the Inerrancy of the Bible;\n\n[Skeptic’s Annotated Bible’s list of biblical contradictions](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/contra/by_name.html).\n\n[Infidels.org's list of biblical contradictions](http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html).\n\n[NonStampCollector's video on biblical contradictions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3g6mXLEKk).\n\n[On the validity of the OT versus the NT](http://www.evilbible.com/do_not_ignore_ot.htm)\n\n[Scientific Errors in the Bible](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scientific_errors_in_the_Bible )\n\n[Wikipedia entries criticism, scientific &amp; historical issues of the Bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy#Scientific_and_historical_criticism )\n\nOn the historicity of Jesus;\n\nDid Jesus exist?

My wife is dead, and I'm next if I don't act quick.  \n\nI place all of my sentimental possessions in a chest and lock it.  I begin burying the chest, and my wife- ex-wife, I suppose.  Why?  Well, this psychopath obviously has a clear passage into my home, and I can't risk him destroying anything else close to me.  It pained me to bury that chest, not knowing if I would ever be alive to open it back up.  So many memories, and so many stories lied in that chest, and this might be goodbye.  The absolute toughest thing for me to place in that chest, though, had to have been the pregnancy test; positive.  \n\nOkay, enough with feeling sorry for myself, I need to find this mans money.  This man is a monster.  His very presence has towered over me ever since we made that deal.  I knew when I married my wife, that he would be looking down on me, as if he was a God or a beast, watching every move I do.   I knew now was no exception.  He just killed my wife.  He can't be far.  And, honestly, I've always had a hunch he never was.  \n\nI met him on vacation in Scotland; coincidentally around the same time I met my wife.  He seemed innocent enough, and even treated me and my wife to dinner one night.  All seemed fine.  Then, one day, he and I went out for- to put it lightly- a wild night.  We both had done things we instantly regretted when we woke up the next morning.  These weren't just \"slept with an ugly girl\" caliber regrets. These were \"he and I accidentally drowned a girl\" kind of regrets.  Of course, when we each came to our senses and realized just what we had done, we knew it wouldn't take long for police to figure out she was dead, and who did it.   So, he did an extremely honorable thing, or so I thought, and took full blame.  It easily would've ruined my relationship with my wife if I had been arrested, and he took the 20 year jail sentence as one of the greatest favors a man can do.  The only catch, which I blindly agreed to, was to have a good amount of money waiting for him when he got out.   \n\nWell, as you may have guessed, he got out.  And I hadn't saved a single penny for him.  I thought there was no way he'd remember, or think I was serious. Besides... I'm pretty sure he did most of the drowning anyway.  It was a good thing they caught him and not me.  Alas, no matter what I tried to convince myself happened, I knew that a deal was a deal.  \n\nAnd now, my wife is dead.  My family is in danger.  My house may not be there when I return.  I have no other option but to give this man his money.  \n\nI hated myself for still knowing the number he gave me to call.  I dialed slowly on a pay phone hours away from my home.  There was nothing but open fields around me, yet, I somehow still felt this monster was hovering over my shoulder.   \n\n\"Well?\" He said on the other line.  He felt so distant. Like he was in a tunnel or a lake.  Maybe he was disguising his voice as a precaution.  Maybe I just remembered his voice wrong. \n\n\"Please, no more. I'll get you your money.\" I pleaded with him. \n\n\"All of it?\" He asked.\n\n\"Yes! Yes! All of it! All of it and then some! Just... how much do you want?\"  I leaned over the pay phone, on the verge of crying again. \n\n\"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"  Tree fiddy.  It was about this time I realized this man who had murdered my wife after serving 20 years in prison for taking the blame for drowning a girl I drowned was actually a 500 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.  \n\n\"God dangit loch ness monster! You ain't getting my tree fiddy!\" I screamed in anger.\n\n\"How about a dolla?\" \n\n\"Fine, I'll give you a dolla. Just leave me alone you god dang loch ness monsta!\"\n\nAnd so, my journey had come to an end.  I had given in, and gave the beast what it wanted.  I returned home to see the FBI waiting at my house.  I didn't care anymore.  I would tell them anything they wanted to know.  Except, the one agent looked a little tall.....

{"body": "The editorial: \n\nSo, who really flew the first airplane — the Wright brothers or Gustave Whitehead?\n\nThat's a question that has, so to speak, flown around the state for a few years. It's time to ground it permanently.\n\nMr. Whitehead, who lived in Connecticut, claimed to have flown a proto-airplane in Fairfield in 1901, two years before the Wrights' flight in Kitty Hawk, N.C. His alleged feat was reported in the weekly Bridgeport Herald.\n\nSince 2013, Whitehead believers have trumpeted the fact that the authoritative Jane's \"All the World's Aircraft\" published a pro-Whitehead article in its centennial edition. More recently, however, Jane's has backpedaled considerably, now saying that the article was purely one writer's opinion, not holy writ.\n\nPerhaps the biggest stunt occurred two years ago, when our state legislature pledged allegiance to the Whitehead tale and declared Connecticut the true birthplace of aviation. A bill this year designating Aug. 14 as Gustave Whitehead Day to honor \"the first man to make a manned, powered, controlled flight\" didn't make it out of committee, fortunately.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that matters of fact aren't decided by vote. The Scottish Parliament might vote unanimously that the Loch Ness monster is real, but that doesn't make it so.\n\nDespite some Nutmeggers' fondest wishes, it's evident that the preponderance of evidence favors the Wrights.

{"body": "It was Wednesday, he didn't start right away but I knew he would eventually. It was early that night, all my kids were half asleep and it was just about that time where a new dad could relax in dreary tea scented silence. TV was banned on the colony, or at least so they said. You could look out your window at night, at say 9 pm, and count the little glowing windows in the identical row houses of the massive cul-de-sac that made up the colony. They were specks, tiny things, but once a month at the end of every month you could count on the fact that those lights would go out, never to be lit again.\n\n\"Dead,\" people in the colony would say. We had these stupid fucking get together every Saturday, and because we were all shut ins with no technology we had nothing better to gossip about. They served kool-aid (I shit you not, none of us even knew the irony) and crackers. the kids would play the the mucky front yard with home-made wicker toys. \"they deserve it too,\" the soccer mom types would say. To be honest I never believed they killed them, I just figured they took the damn TVs away. Besides, it was only one dude who made the rounds to \"supposedly\" check for these things, what the hell could he do? It, however, was enough for my wife to draw a thick line in the sand \"Out of the question\" she'd say when I asked about it. I don't know why, but fuck did I want one. I *really* wanted one.\n\nSo, yeah, I fucking got one. A really shitty one, it was white and circular with a screen burn of *cash pyramid*. In hindsight it was probably some old grandmas, but all I knew was that the bum who hung near the gate let me have it for 10$, and that's all I cared about. \n\nBack to Wednesday night, it was late, my wife had gone to bed early and I had jury rigged this bad boy to the outlet we usual plugged the toaster into. I didn't want to wake her up, so I was hunched over this thing with the absolute lowest volume. I honestly can't remember what the show was, maybe cops, because I remember some crazy guy babbling while being loaded into the car. I don't think I even cared what show it was, just the principle of the thing, fuck it might have been just to piss off my wife.\n\nThat's when the knock on the door came. A firm, hard knock like a tree branch on a windowsill . I can feel my pulse in my neck as I hurl the TV underneath the cabinet (I even considered bashing the screen in so I could pass it off as some kind of obscure kitchen appliance). I was panicking, I didn't even know any fucking obscenities to shout in my head, but if I did I would've.\n\nAnother loud knock, and I rush over there and slowly open the door with my trembling hands. He said, \"Could I have about tree-fiddy?\", that's when I noticed it was a huge crustacean from the paleolithic era at my door. \n\n(OP, serious tags exist for a reason)\n\nEDIT: I refuse these downvotes, y'all have no sense of humor.

{"body": "I grew up involved with the Quiverfull movement, a type of Christian Fundamentalism that involves having a bunch of children, home education, extremely modest dress including headcoverings, the practise of \"courting\" and \"bethrothals\" (basically semi-arranged marriages taking place as soon as the girl was old enough to marry), and something called \"Christian patriarchy\", wherein the father is viewed as a sort of mini god.\n\nI grew up attending a small Christian school run by the local Independent Fundamentalist Baptist church, where every student was Quiverfull. We were required to wear extremely modest clothing (ankle length skirts, hemlines that covered the base of our necks, etc. We had wardrobe checks multiple times each day.)\n\nEach morning we pledged allegiance to the Christian Flag and to the Bible. It's been years, but I can still recite both pledges by heart. Then we recited the chapters of the Bible we were working on. Yes, I did say chapters. We memorized several books of the Bible (Jonah, all of Paul's epistles, most of Genesis, Daniel, a decent amount of Leviticus and I think the Gospel of Mark.)\n\nOur schoolwork was primarily books published by Abeka, BJUPress and ACE. Our textbooks claimed that:\n\nno transitional fossils had ever been found\n\nthe Loch Ness Monster had been proven to be real and was a plesiosaur\n\nthe Great Depression never happened but was just a myth made up by the socialists\n\nslavery was a win-win solution for all involved\n\ndinosaurs breathed fire\n\nthe KKK were great dudes who got a bad rap\n\nthe trail of tears was actually super great\n\nouter space wasn't real because if you blew on a pile of baby powder, a new planet wouldn't form (this was demonstrated)\n\nthe Liberals don't believe in personal responsibility\n\nthe world is about to be attacked by the floating Space Jerusalem\n\nWe never covered much actual math, science, etc. Learning the truth about the government's plan to kill Holocaust the Christians was seen as much more important.\n\nFor one year the girls also took Christian Charm. This was primarily about how God really, really cares about whether your chest is 10 inches largest than your waist or not. Girls were forbidden from standing with their feet parallel, \"like a man's\", instead having to keep our feet at ridiculous and painful angles. We couldn't walk without being careful to \"glide gracefully\" and avoid \"swishing\" our knees. We were forbidden to not smile, but our smiles were never big enough, or they were too big.\n\nThere wasn't much time for real schoolwork anyway, since we were all so busy being punished for having an ungodly facial expression, and forced to spend the rest of the school day standing on our tiptoes on one foot in the corner.\n\nIn fourth grade my parents chose to pull me out and homeschool me. We joined a local homeschool group filled with Quiverfull homeschoolers. My parents had gone to a different church, one which was very Charismatic (we spoke in tongues, exorcised people, \"healed\" with prayer) but not necessarily quite so extreme as the IFB school I had been sent to. However, as my father became more violent (he had a lot of mental issues and was an extreme hoarder), my mother (who was a borderline hoarder and very depressed, so much so that for the first ten years of my life she barely left her bed except to use the washroom) became more and more heavily sucked into this subculture.\n\nMy parents had already gotten rid of most TV channels over concerns about evil spirits and only allowed us to read a few classic books, but after this my mom first stopped allowing us to read anything non-Christian, then banned novels altogether. We began being forbidden to see anyone who did not go to our church or homeschool group. Since my parents never really started teaching, and I had little access to books and at the time no internet, this left little to do all day aside from copy out Bible verses and stare out the window for hours. Time sort of stopped meaning anything.\n\nWe became more into the Biblical patriarchy thing, where my father was seen as the head of our household and a sort of direct representative from god who women were to serve and obey in every way. You weren't supposed to express any kind of wishes or desire, but leave it up to your husband/father to make all decisions for you. (if you were his daughter, this included selecting your husband--girls were expected to be stay at home daughters, serving their fathers, until marriage) Biblical femininity was emphasized, which in this case basically meant long skirts and not having opinions or desires, except to serve whatever man God chose as the best \"helpmeet\" possible.\n\nFor a couple of years my mom, who was herself a nurse stopped allowing us to take medicine, believing it to be witchcraft. She became more and more crazed about the idea of demons trying to attack her and our family.\n\nUnfortunately, I was born with a birthmark on my leg. She believed that this made me Satan. My father and mother both searched for ways to fix this. I've been exorcised, had oil poured over me, had everything I owned burned, etc. It apparently didn't work.\n\nAfter my father died we were at least spared his extreme violence, but my mother became only more unhinged and depressed. We shifted from being Quiverfull to being Charismatic--we'd been both for a while, but my dad's death pushed us all the way from one to another. She mostly gave up on her idea of me as Satan, but became absolutely obsessed with the idea of Satan attacking our family. This belief is reinforced by our church and all the Charismatic material she reads. She even abandoned our homeschool group, believing it to not be concerned enough about how demons are possessing everyone.\n\nOur church is obsessed with spiritual attacks, which are seen as stemming from absolutely everything. Anne of Green Gables? Witchcraft! Christian music? Actually sung by Satanists, filled with subliminal Satanic messages! Cabbage patch dolls? Demons who stay still when we look at them! (I'm 100% serious) The only way to ward this off is speaking in tongues, making prophesies, etc. A few people in my church believe they hear the voices of demons in their head, and said demons are chasing them. I've been there as we've all laid hands on people and prayed for them to be liberated from the demonic oppression in their lives.\n\nI still live with my mother and sister. I still go months without seeing anyone who isn't from my church. I still have no real education. \n\nI posted this in another AskReddit threat and was almost rescued. Unfortunately, the person who had been trying to help me [had to delete everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2mxst0/what_happened_to_that_quiverfull_girl_that_was_on/cmjtdl8). I'm very grateful to her, and to everyone who tried to help me. I haven't given up yet, though. I *will* get out, I just don't know how yet.\n\nAnd to the people who've messaged me and I haven't responded: I'm very sorry. I've been avoiding Reddit for the most part and *never* using this account, but it really does mean a lot to me that a couple of people have messaged me encouraging words or remembered my story and asked how it ended. Thank you folks.\n\n[Homeschoolers Anonymous](http://homeschoolersanonymous.wordpress.com/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431491964", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 60, "controversiality": 0}

Sherri was as beautiful as she was kind, and instantly made me forget about the outside world. I never wanted to leave The Center and was thus blind to the fact that it was a cult.

I find myself questioning, again, whether or not I *should* be choosing different terms to describe my ideology, for two reasons. 1, as was amply demonstrated above, some people are ONLY interested in semantics, and 2, it just so happens that I feel semantics count for SOMETHING.\n\nwords mean things. I'm a writer, and I hold those meanings to be sacred. HOWEVER... an awful lot of meaning is determined by context, and no ideology is one-size-fits-all, which is why I find the reaction to my use of the term \"feminism\" (ALL FEMINISTS HATE MEN GRAR) to be, frankly, baffling. (not unsurprising, but still baffling.) I don't understand how anyone's worldview can be so lacking in nuance.\n\n...but, just because it is incomprehensible to my intellectual sensibilities, doesn't make it any less manifest. I agree with you that narratives define our political reality, and that, just as movies tend to gloss over a lot of the details of \"real-life events\", these narratives are necessarily simplified and many if not most people will never think beyond them. and I agree that this is depressing.\n\nhowever, from an academic standpoint, I see no reason why the popular misperception or misuse of an idea should stop me from applying it to my own worldview, especially when I flatter myself to have a worldview NOT lacking in nuance. I don't think my use of the term \"patriarchy\" is academically incorrect, or overly broad -- but you are forcing me to examine why, and that's good.\n\nif I were to describe Teh Patriarchy as a literal conspiracy, as, apparently, some do, this would not be any less nuts than using the term \"Illuminati\" with a straight face. that said, the concept of the Illuminati is useful when dissecting certain social phenomena, as is the concept of the patriarchy. as I said in response to another poster, and as ties in with your references to practices and attitudes shaped by thousands of years of agricultural division of labor, we do not have to consider these structures as being the result of some Grand Design, simply as having been *effective*, in order to examine their existence and persistence. this is meme theory -- the idea that an idea will spread, and evolve, and self-perpetuate, just the same as a genetic mutation, should it prove in some way to fill a niche.\n\nthis is not about a deliberately-constructed skyscraper of male advantage over women. it is about the fact that survival-based impulses gave rise to certain beliefs and customs which, when the populations which adopted these constructs were successful, then self-perpetuated and reinforced the structures within which they arose. exactly like the biological feedback loop that led to bipedalism -- and exactly like that feedback loop, the results are jerry-rigged and poorly \"designed\" and we're stuck with them. however, just as we are on the verge of being able to re-engineer our spines from the DNA on up, we are now becoming capable due to advances in technology and other social phenomena of re-evaluating, and altering, our cultural skeletons.\n\nI'm not 1000% sure I follow how you are teasing out \"gender roles\" as being separate from \"systems of rule and how that influences society\", and thus less academically correct. I understand why you might reject my use of the term \"patriarchy\" based on my rejection of the idea that it is automatically advantageous to men, as opposed to potentially equally harmful to men... but I submit, as I have said, that the \"system of rule\" bit is the salient point. a kingdom is a patriarchy -- and that doesn't change the fact that 99% of the men in a monarchy are serfs. it does, however, impact how everyone in the kingdom relates to each other, does business, enforces the rule of law, allocates resources, etc.\n\nthe very fact that I came here, because OP's assertion of \"gosh, I wish there weren't so many crazies\" caught my eye and I wished to say, \"I feel your feelz, man,\" and the very first response I received was a more-or-less personal attack based exclusively on my use of the F-word, strikes me as an EXCELLENT litmus test for the presence of Teh Patriarchy. similarly, I would feel the same way if you popped up on /r/TwoXChromosomes (which I also only read once in a blue moon, ftr) and said, \"hi, I consider myself an MRA, but I agree with such-and-such point because...\" and were vilified by people shutting down and ceasing to pay attention the second they see the label. these control matrices exist in the first place because -- just like rules against pork in Leviticus kept people from dying from trichinosis, never mind that they didn't understand WHY, they didn't NEED to -- they were effective. they continue to rear their ugly heads because, just like herpes and the WBC, they are entrenched -- however, unlike herpes and the WBC, they are largely invisible -- and as such, they affect everyone. this is not expanding the definition. it is applying it.\n\nour brains evolved in tribal contexts wherein fear and loathing of \"the other\" made sense due to competition for resources. given how many people are still starving in the world, I would argue that competition for resources is kind of still a thing, even ignoring social resources such as capital and \"power\". (and, again ftr, I am frustrated by definitions of the Patriarchy which would fit in nicely on /r/FirstWorldProblems, not least of which because they undercut, IMO, discussion of the \"real\" issues.) but here in the First World, where we have the luxury of discussing such things on our marvelous electronic gizmos, we have an opportunity, and, I feel, a responsibility to redefine our concepts of \"other\", and I see failure to do so as a symptom of a systemic and culture-wide set of norms which must first be acknowledged if they are to be combated. the initial step in dealing with a problem is widely recognized to be identifying it.\n\nwhen I can't say I have mostly male friends and spent several years in a \"non-traditional\" workplace role without being met with \"yeah, and I'm sure you know lots of black people too,\" that's a problem.\n\nwhen I encounter, over and over again, the fact that Male Remains the Default in discussions of entertainment narratives, with the result that, as I said, men are treated as expendable/interchangeable and women are treated as precious commodities/sacred cows (so to speak), that's a problem.\n\nwhen we can't discuss issues of privilege -- whether, male, white, straight, cis, native-born, able-bodied, WHATEVER -- without people getting seventeen different kinds of defensive because we are ALL being led to believe that \"our\" group is in some way marginalized, that's a problem.\n\nwhen these underlying mechanics are capitalized upon by, say, the diamond industry, perpetuating the false and frankly disgusting dichotomy that men are johns and women are whores, that's a fucking problem.\n\nwhen I look back at my personal role models and close personal relationships and realize that very few of them have been women/with other women... maybe that's not a problem. maybe it's just how I'm wired. or maybe it's indicative of a persistent cultural message that men are, I dunno, *cooler*, even if women are generally presented as more moral, more virtuous, blah blah blah. that \"narratives\" thing again. I think it's a problem that I'll never know for sure, even though I don't see it as a problem at all that I am thus predisposed to relate to my son.\n\nas a sex-positive, male-positive feminist -- and anyone who doesn't believe that exists can check out [the fucking Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism) (granted, the Loch Ness Monster has a Wikipedia page as well, but Wikipedia doesn't define \"sex-positive feminism\" as cryptozoology) -- this is intended, as you said, in good faith, and I sincerely hope it is also coherent, because sometimes my ideas get away from me and result in word salad.

I launched it on one of the computers in the back, maxed out the volume, and turned off the monitor and all the other computers.\n\n* When she was conducting a really weird mock auction to have us practice saying numbers in Japanese, C kept bidding \"tree fiddy\" on everything\n\n* When we were giving the aforementioned presentations, C included [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q16KpquGsIc)\n\n* We did a weird activity where we sat in a circle and threw a ball around.

One day, the dad takes the kid sailing with him and the kid notices something funky off in the distance. Like something swimming towards the ship. He asks his dad what it is, and his dad can't even see it. Curious, his dad asks the rest of the crew if they see it. No one other than the kid, who insists that it's there, can see it. After realizing what is happening, they rush back to shore. The father says to the kid that he can never go back to the sea again. Because that's a monster (or something) that the kid sees. Only people who the monster is going to kill can see the monster. So for the rest of his life, the kid avoids the sea. He actually starts a very successful (land based) trading company. He creates a large fortune for him and his family, but still, he yearns for the sea. He walks on the beach every day and he can still see it off in the distance, and still no one can see it but him. Eventually, as the kid reaches his old age, he decides that it's time to die, and he wants to die doing what he loves. So he goes out to sail for one last time and he watches as the thing approaches. Eventually the thing gets to him, and instead of brutally murdering him, simply says to him \"Hey, can I have about tree fiddy?\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431567797", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It wasn't really like that, but there was one exception.\n\nI was in a cell with a guy named Johnny. He hated being called John, never said why. He was in for armed robbery and B&amp;E. 4 years into an 8 year stretch. He was an alright guy really, just the usual bad background, set up to fail early story. \n\nBut I guess he ratted someone out really bad, and a few guys came to pick him up one day. Now, I was in for assault for two years, knock one off for good behavior. Didn't have any problems at all, because it seemed like many if not most of the guy in here were, while scary, relatively ok fellows. But they came and got Johnny while I was in my bed. They told me to just mind my own business, they'd be quick, and they'd know who ratted on them if anything came back.\n\nIt sounded pretty bad, but was thankfully short. A lot of crashing and banging, but strangely no voices, not even Johnny. And I kept telling myself to be quiet and don't look, hear no evil, see no evil. But I had to. Something in me had to bear witness to this entire event.\n\nAnd when I turned around, I was mortified and scared.

{"body": "\"Get to the courtyard!\" she yells into the megaphone. \"I want to see everyone get through this alive!\" the building was slowly catching on fire due to a gas leak.\n\nThe courtyard unfortunately was surrounded by the burning building, smoke was choking and grey. there was no way out except back through the building. That was around the time we heard sirens in front of the building. soon the fire was out and we were able to leave.\n\nSeveral months later i get a call from the DMV, it's at that moment i realize that despite the ordeal, i still need to get my tags updated. there's nothing worse than going to the DMV, it's even worse when you have to drive a town over to get it done. \n\nI sat in the lobby of the starkly white building, and waited for my number with some crossy road. the moment my number was called, i came to the window like a 'price is right' contestant. the time that it took to get everything completed was only a few moments, but it felt like i had been talking to this woman for a decade just to get the blue sticker to go on my license plate. \n\nI get home and play some GTA, it was cathartic to get the stress of the day taken out on 8 year olds with no concept of maturity. the more i play, the less stress i feel. It wasn't long until i got hungry and ordered some pizza, it was chicken with white sauce, like heaven on earth. the delivery driver was a younger guy sporting rainbow dyed hair, i thought about hitting on him but my stomach made a fool of me, as i could barely help grabbing the pizza and hissing 'my precious'\n\nthe next day i go into work, the server is down again. it won't be long now before the hard drive that i keep nursing to life finally fails permanently. CFO told me that we don't have the money to replace it, while he was on his way to get his new jag's oil changed. A couple genital shakes and the motor kicks on and the system reboots. those clicks will be the death of the accounting system for sector 'c' but whatever.. my ass is covered. next on my agenda is the box on my desk, there's a note \"computer doesn't work\" how helpful. I attach the computer to my workstation and turn it on, nothing happens so i grab the side of the case to unplug it, when my hand feels the unnatural feeling of AC power coursing through it. I pull my hand back and flip the switch on the power strip. I open the case to find that someone has done a little... rewiring, the power supply is open and wires are scotch taped around the case. As much as you would think this would be surprising by now, it isn't. I grab a new PSU and get to work, surprisingly when everything is wired back to normal, it boots. but it's not booting windows.. or any other OS i have ever seen.. those aren't human characters...\n\nnext thing i know I'm in a space ship, they got me tied down to a table and they are talking in some language that i can't understand. their bodies are like raptors, fluffy raptors that are wearing very militaristic clothes. i seem to be their prisoner when one of them comes up to me and drags me to a cell. the cell isn't uncomfortable, it's actually quite nice for a cell. there's a computer screen that says \"continue talking\" and so i talk to my self like a mental patent for a good several hours until a green check mark appears \"language acquired, you may stop now\" \n\nI am lead to a chamber with a massive chair, the leader is sitting upon a captains chair and looks down upon me. He doesn't appear threatening, but very commanding. \"we need your help\" he says in a deep voice. \"i look up at him, my throat runs dry \"how can i help you?\" he grins and says \"i need about tree fitty\" and it's about that time i realized that the space ship was actually a Scottish lake and that the captain was a large reptile from the Cretaceous era.

{"body": "I have terrible asthma, so I carry a small albuterol machine in my carry on whenever I travel. It never fails to cause me grief at the airport, so I carry a signed doctor's note that discusses my condition and why the machine is important. In addition to the machine, I usually carry 2 or 3 doses of albuterol, which come in a small plastic tube with a breakaway lid. One day, when my wife and I were flying to Florida from Newark, the guard who was in charge of watching the baggage x-ray flagged my bag and called me over to discuss the machine they found inside. I didn't think it would be a big deal...until I was escorted into a tiny interrogation room, where I was left for over an hour. I couldn't text my wife to tell her what was going on because the guards also took my phone. Finally (after missing my flight) a guard entered the room and proceeded to grill me about my machine. I explained to him that I had serious asthma and the machine helped me when I was in crisis. Then he shouted \"Then what about THESE?!?\" and threw my albuterol canisters on the table. I started to explain that it was albuterol, but he threw up his hands and said \"I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!\" I showed him the signed doctors note, but he simply snorted and said \"this proves nothing\". He then proceeded to get on his radio and ask for a police escort, since he had just apprehended a drug dealer. I was really getting panicked at this point..so of course my asthma kicked in. I tried to use my emergency inhaler, but the guard knocked it out of my hands and would not let me pick it up. I was really starting to get agitated at this point and, between gasps I frantically asked him what more he needed as proof that I had asthma. He looked me square in the eye and said \"I need about tree fiddy\". It was at this point that I realized that the TSA agent was an 8 story tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

{"body": "One time my family and I went away on a vacation to Canada. My husband has family up there as he used to live there up until early high school. We stayed with his aunt and uncle and upon the first day they remarked on the excellent skate rink that was in the small town and how it was known for its youth hockey teams. So the next day we decided to go as a family taking our son and two daughters. Now my son at the time was just going into his senior year of high school and was starting to transition into a more outgoing boy. So of course at the ice rink he see's a group of girls around his age and he tries to impress them with his skating as he played hockey when he was in elementary school. But unfortunately he wasn't paying attention to where he was going and crashes into a wall, dashing his chances of talking with these girls in his mind. So we left and he was quite about the ordeal. About a week afterwards he says he wants to go back and I say sure. So we go back and he see's the same group of girls. Instead of skating to impress them this time he went straight up and asked them to see a movie later that night. So later that night I took him to see it and even decided to go see a movie that night too. Upon being behind my son and his date when I see him ask the ticket clerk for tickets to Paul Blart Mall Cop 2.

{"body": "Jason Reitman's drama *Men, Women, &amp; Children* is the closest I can think of that incorporates the internet / digital world into its story.  A large cast, portraying several families in AnySuburb, USA, goes about their business while doing nasty, naughty, secret things online or with their phones.  Each character gets into some sort of conundrum with their respective use of digital technology.  Unfortunately, I strongly disliked the movie &amp; didn't feel it had anything new or interesting to offer; if, by 2014, you don't know what self-imposed \"dangers\" lurk within modern technology, you probably don't use it &amp; wouldn't watch a movie based on it.  It seems to have come from the same place that movies like *Crash* (Haggis) originate, movies that try to act as PSAs &amp; do an awful job of it.\n\nSome of these might be reaching, but a few that I've seen in recent months that are loosely connected to the topics you mentioned:\n\n- *The Truman Show* is as optimistic &amp; deep as anything I can think of, as far as commentary on reality TV &amp; voyeurism.  It champions the humanity behind it all in a way that seems to defy the cynicism that seems inseparable from the medium.  \n\n- I had problems with Jon Favreau's *Chef*, in that it was a brazen promotion for Twitter (it can make or break your business; it can bring your estranged family together; it even stops to give a tutorial on how to use Twitter).  It didn't ruin the movie for me, but it was annoying &amp; distracting.\n\n- The remake of *Carrie* shows that the humiliation of Carrie in the locker room is not enough anymore; they take video of it &amp; upload it to youtube &amp; play it at the prom.  It was an extra level of bullying that is kind of chilling.  \n\n- Zak Penn's *Incident at Loch Ness* has nothing to do with phones or the internet, but it's brilliantly playful about \"reality\" TV (in this case a documentary) &amp; the lengths someone (Penn's own character in the movie) will go to for promotion &amp; buzz.  Werner Herzog, playing essentially himself, goes to Loch Ness to do a documentary about the allure of Nessie, &amp; how it relates to the human condition; Penn's character is documenting Herzog making his documentary.  However, Penn is in direct conflict with Herzog, as he lacks any of the integrity or maturity that Herzog has, &amp; seeks to punch things up at every opportunity.  \n\n- *Dear White People* has Tessa Thompson's Samantha using her blog to vent &amp; tease racial stereotypes, particularly how whites view blacks.  Samantha uses it as a shield as much as anything, &amp; offline her character has to confront things about her own identity.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431717884", "subreddit": "flicks", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm in biomed and just finished 3B.  I've been shadowing doctors at Grand River Hospital for two years and just confirmed that I'd be continuing it through fourth year.\n\nThere were a few steps that I had to do to get this job.  First, I volunteered at the hospital in my hometown during the summer after first year.  My aunt is a nurse and she helped me get it set up, but in my hometown they pretty much let anyone volunteer at the hospital.  I was an inpatient volunteer and got to spend time with patients at their bedside.  This helped greatly when I applied at Grand River.\n\nIn 2A I applied to volunteer at Grand River.  They are slightly more selective in their process and conducted interviews and asked me for references.  Since I was at the hospital three times a week in my hometown, eventually nurses and doctors knew who I was, which meant I had quite a few references.  Once I got hired, there was a two-day training session, and eventually I got a position directing patients to the areas of the hospital they needed to be in.  I did this for all of second year.\n\nIn 3A I went back to Grand River, but since they knew me and trusted me, I was able to work with the medical secretaries on the surgical floor.  I met lots of surgeons being on that floor twice a week, and eventually I got the courage to ask if any of them would help me find a doctor to shadow because I thought it would help with my med school application.\n\nMost of the surgeons and other doctors said they would ask around, but nobody followed through.  Thankfully, one did, and set me up with one of the oncologists, telling me I could shadow him for two hours a week as long as it did not conflict with my volunteer work.\n\nFast forward a few days, and I'm finally getting ready to shadow this doctor.  I'm waiting in the reception area of the oncology wing, and I see him approaching me.  I stand up, extend my hand and introduce myself, but doesn't respond.  I introduce myself again, and he responds asking for me to grab him a sandwich from the cafeteria because he had missed lunch.  I ask him how much a sandwich costs and he says \"about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that this doctor was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

{"body": "I care about the number...so let me tell you my story\n\nI was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in. This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It's painful to watch.\nBut then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says \"heeeey. It's OPS. Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, three five oh. Thanks.\" And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting.\nAnd then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe.\nHe slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour). But then he pauses and just looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, and says any chance you could spare about tree fiddy?\n\nSo that's why I'm trying to press at 0350.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431744744", "subreddit": "thebutton", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A wide-eyed hunter emerges from the deep woods of Washington state hauling a ten foot Bigfoot carcass, claiming he shot the creature after catching it drinking from a stream. He posts a grisly photo album to Facebook, and within a few hours the police department and local media are all over it. The cops get involved because the pictures look so human-like they have to make sure this wasn’t a murder, and the local media because, you know, it’s a dead fucking Sasquatch. Within a 36 hours the hordes of FOX and CNN personnel have descended on this small community. Finding himself the center of America’s full attention, the hunter reluctantly pulls his Bigfoot out of his freezer and surrenders it to biologists at Washington State University, who quickly determine its authentic – a previously unknown species of Gigantopithecus. Judging by its brain to body ratio they conclude the animal was shockingly intelligent. \nThe hunter gets interviewed by 60 Minutes, National Geographic, etc. – which kind of backfires because he turns out to be a real rambling eccentric, making this one of the most surreal news stories of all time. Everyone is asking themselves “how the hell did a ten foot hominin stay hidden in America for so long?” Not only is everyone who ever claimed to see Bigfoot shouting “I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO!” now UFO fanatics, conspiracy theorists, and all kinds of cryptid believers are feeling totally vindicated – and who can blame them? This obviously wasn’t the only Sasquatch in the world, there had to be a reproducing population. Research teams, big game hunters, and Bigfoot enthusiasts comb through the forests of the Pacific Northwest, Appalachia, parts of Canada. All of a sudden there are dozens of research vessels dotting the surface of Loch Ness and Lake Champlain. More than one team enters the Congo in search for Mokele-mbembe. \nNo signs of a Sasquatch population are ever found anywhere in the North American forests, only adding to the mystery. This spectacle is not followed by a crashed UFO or concrete proof of Nessie, and after a year you’d expect people to have moved on, but people just can’t let it go – fucking Bigfoot’s real, who would have guessed…\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431759383", "subreddit": "FutureWhatIf", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I went through this exact process.  I should be graduating at the end of this term, but in total it took me 8 years to get my undergrad.\n\nI came to UW in 2007 from a high school in Toronto with a long track record of sending its best students here for math and engineering.  Since so many of my older friends had gone through CS here, I assumed I would be able to do it easily too.  I slacked off in 1A and failed two courses, but I managed to do well enough in 1B to get myself back on track in 2A and make the Dean's List.\n\nDuring my 2A co-op my family was hit hard by the 2008 recession.  Both my parents were laid off from their stable, well-paying jobs and were now wondering how they could possibly support three kids off their savings.  It was at this time that I put my education on hold and got approval from the university to take a year off (starting at the end of my 2A coop term) to help my family.  I ended up working at that coop job for 16 months in total, until my parents got back on their feet.\n\nAt this point, I re-enrolled in classes no problem.  The only form I had to submit was one to the registrar saying that my year \"off\" was over.  I went into 2B, but the 16 months I had spent working had made me lack any motivation for doing work in the classroom.  I failed three courses but managed to petition to stay in coop.  I went on to my co-op term, working at a startup in San Fran (this was not nearly as common 5 years ago as it is now) that actually seemed like it was going to make it.  They asked me to stay on full time to work there, and I decided to drop out of school entirely, which I did.\n\nFast forward three years; I don't really like this company anymore, and because of some incidents with the other employees, nobody will give me any references for any companies down there.  On top of that there was a lull in VCs handing out money to startups during this time, so I couldn't get any traction with what I was doing on my spare time.  I decided to move back to Canada to try to finish my degree.\n\nTo come back to UW there was a long petition process that I had to follow.  The committee was already familiar with my story, and frankly, had little sympathy for the 5 failed courses and multiple WD's I had on my transcript.  After four months of meetings, they decided to admit me, but with the caveat that if I failed one more course I would be done for good.\n\nI was ecstatic; I was finally going to finish the degree that I had been dreaming about since high school.  I worked hard for four terms, back-to-back-to-back-to-back, and now I only have one course left to graduate.  Unfortunately, the course that I need isn't online, so I'm stuck in Waterloo all summer for one course.  Life's not bad though, I've been marking assignments for one of the profs that I've had a good relationship with since 1A to make some money on the side.  Funny story, actually.  I went into his office the other day, and we were chatting about the struggles I had throughout my degree.  He talked about how proud he was that I came back, and suggested we go grab a beer at Molly's to celebrate what would soon be my completed degree.\n\nWe went to Molly's that night, and asked what their special was (it was Keith's).  The waiter brought us each our bills, but my prof had forgotten his wallet in his office.  He had a toonie in his pocket, but asked if I had any more change.  I asked how much he needed, and he said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time that I realized my prof was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431788014", "subreddit": "uwaterloo", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I witnessed a hit and run once and saw a man nearly die. This happened a few years ago and this is that tale. I was driving along one day when a seemingly homeless man was crossing the street. An old red Ford pickup from the 80's was chugging along the road ahead of me and completely slammed into the guy as the man entered the road. \n\nMy quick instincts kicked in and I turned on my caution lights as I slammed the brakes stopping about 10 yards from the man's body mangled on the road. Another car pulled up behind me as I hurried towards the man. \n\nThe truck had long gone down the road and his license plate couldn't be properly read. I called back to the man in the car behind me to call an ambulance as I bent down next to the man. I did my best to straighten his arms and legs out and supported his neck with my hands. That's when he put his hand on my forearm and attempted to speak. \n\nHis breathe was weak and forced but managed to blurt out the words, \" I need...\" I said, \"what is it, what do you need?\" As the air was escaping him, he muttered to me. \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" \n\nIt was then that I realized that the man was 6 stories tall and from the paleolithic era. I said \"God Damnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy.\" Goddamn Loch Ness Monster got hit by a car. \n\nThe ambulance had arrived and pushed me out of the way as I pondered the whole ordeal in my mind. I heard that he survived the accident. I also heard that the driver of the old truck was never caught. I'm still not sure what to think of the situation to this day.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431805386", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

We rode motorcycles between a few cities worth the help of a guide. During one such ride our guide recommended a seldom visited temple off in the mountains of Peru. It was about a half day out of our way but that additional time was okay for us as one of the bikes had broke down and we had to purchase a jeep in town.  In the last town before our turn I noticed our guide calling someone and speaking in hushed tones seeming worried. I asked him about it and he said he was just telling his wife he would be an additional day or two so I left it at that. The next day we were off to the temple. About three hours into the trip the kids were asleep next to the wife in the back seat and I was chatting with the guide and asked how much longer and he said another three or so hours so I decided to take a nap. When I awoke the sun had dipped low towards the horizon as we bounced down the road I glanced at the clock and realized four hours had gone by. I didn't hear anything but the drone of a Latin song on the radio and hum of the engine I quickly looked in the back seat only to find my wife and kids no longer there, as I started to panic and come full awake I realized my hands were bound. It was then I looked at the driver and realized he wasn't what I thought he was. I managed to form some semblance of a question \"wha...  What want where's family?\" I stammered. To which he replied don't worry your family is fine and you'll see them again as long as you give me exactly what I want. \"What do you want from me\" I asked and he replied \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy\" As I stared in disbelief it began to dawn on my He wasn't some Peruvian guide he was actually a large reptile from the paleolithic era with glowing red eyes and OP should have used a serious tag.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431811022", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I can't begin to tell you how much this art inspired me. I grew up in northern Somalia, born in 1976. I wasn't born in Somalia — my family fled to Somalia from Rwanda in '93 a year before the start of the genocide. My mom, Mutetwli, was taken from us the day we were supposed to leave. For some reason the woman in the photo reminds me of her. \n\nMy mom was a strong woman, she survived near starvation when the Yahzdi destroyed her village as a kid and burned to death her dad and mom. The children were kept as Yahzdi slaves, but when my mom was supposed to be married at age 15 she escaped with my father and tried to start a new life, which ultimately collapsed in 1994. I said she was taken, but what I didn't mention is that the Yahzdi commander killed her in front of me and my dad by a punishment they call \"necklacing.\" They forced her into a tire small enough to stick around her ; her arms crossed in front of her and pinned to her torso by the tire. After that they poured petrol in the tire and set it alight. I can still here my mom's screams tot his day.\n\nAfter my dad and I moved to Somalia I enlisted to join the army and fight against the Islamist extremists. I had one photo of my mom, I took a picture of it on a cheap phone I bought from the capital, Mogadishu. My dad kept the physical photo on him; he was killed by extremists in '03 and his body burned. All I had left of my mom was on that phone. Then about a year and a half after my father died I was on the front dedicated to attacking the extremist's stronghold about 60 miles south of Mogadishu. \n\nOne night when I was tasked to scout the leader of the extremists, Istahbule Ahmedabad, I found myself cornered by 2 of his patrols. I had gotten too close to the perimeter and due to convoys being attacked by other radicals I found myself near 6 of Ahmedabad's men with only a combat knife and my phone that had the picture of my mom.  I did the only thing I could think of at the time; I prayed, and I took my phone with the picture of the woman who birthed me and held it close to my chest and ran. I ran to protect what was left of my mom, a single photo and me, her son. But as I ran I heard a sharp crack, then another. I felt a burning sensation in my abdomen like I was pressing against hot coals, right under my ribcage. I knew I was hit. But when I looked down I saw that the phone had caught the bullet and that I was fine. \n\nI wasn't sure whether to be happy or sad, nor did I have time to be because right then a man charged through the bushes and told me to put my hands on my head. I asked him, \"before you kill me can you please send this phone to my son, it's all he has left of his family.\" The man nodded his head as if to comply and said, \"I can, but only for a price.\" \n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"I need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nIt was about that time I realized that I wasn't talking to a man at all but a god damned giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era. And I said \"Go away you God damned Lochness monster you ain't getting no tree-fiddy!.\"\n\nAnd after that I got my phone back and lived out the rest of my days in Somalia until I moved back to Rwanda last year. So great art! Thanks for the inspiration.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431825043", "subreddit": "pics", "score": -18, "controversiality": 0}

Then he discovered Reddit.\n\nHe discovered a superpower, a way to make time disappear in the blink of an eye. From gifs of porn, to gifs of upvotes, to the satirical nature of circlejerk subs, the lad discovered a wealth of internet that had yet to be explored, yet to be conquered. So he dove in, assimilating into the crowd, becoming one with the crowd.\n\nYears passed, and soon the lad had amassed a large amount of a currency known now as \"karma.\" This karma was given to a user by another user as acknowledgement of positively contributing to the ~~cult's~~ site's content. He continued to peruse the so called \"Reddit,\" discovering the famous hacker known as \"4chan,\" and went on to acquire greater knowledge of both the internet and world at large.\n\nThen the war came.\n\nNo, no the Koreans weren't able to bomb this mystical land of \"Reddit.\" No, Kim Jon Fresh III had traded his bombs for genetically engineered squirrels from the Germans, which were subsequently consumed not long after they had arrived in ~~North~~ Best Korea. No, the Koreans summoned the power of the ~~Loch Ness Monster~~ Lizard Squad, the rival to the hacker known as \"4chan.\" This Squad of Reptile Enthusiasts bombed the network that Reddit used with DDoS hack after DDoS hack, until Reddit finally collapsed under the strain. The ~~POTUS~~ admins were unable to bargain with the Reptile Enthusiasts, as they had ran out of dank memes to trade to the Koreans. The Koreans happily took them to build their homes, as they were able to withstand great temperatures. But when the Redditors ran out of dank memes, there were consequences. \n\nSo here we are today. The year is 37 P.R. (Post Reddit) I sit here in this bar in the future and I drink away my sorrows, contemplating which dead end job I'll take for the next few months to make the rent. As I swirl the remaining booze in my mug as I solemnly gaze into it, I noticed as a rather attractive, too attractive to be seen in this dingy dump of a bar, woman casually make her way in and sat next to me. She ordered, \"I'll have whatever he's having.\" I acknowledged her with a grunt, and asked, \"So what're you doing here.?\"\n\nShe had a shit-eating grin on her face as she took a swig of her drink.

{"body": "Not sure how applicable this will be, since I was in Bioinformatics and I don't know what you major is.  I graduated in 2013.\n\nI showed up to UW in first year with no work experience and little programming ability.  I did okay in my classes but nothing special, and had no extracurricular activities in first year.  Because of this, my resume was really weak for my first time applying for co-op jobs.  I ended up getting no interviews and working retail in my hometown for the summer after first year.\n\nIn 2A I decided that I needed to beef up my resume so I got a job with a biology lab instructor as part of the work-study program.  I also joined the CS club, and started coding small projects related to stuff I was doing in the lab.  I stopped drinking in 2A too and really focused on school, so my grades shot up as well.  All of this stuff helped me when I was looking for a co-op job.  I got a few interviews with Environment Canada, but ended up taking an offer to work a dev job at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research.\n\nI ended up working at that job for my next two co-ops as well, but as computational cancer biologist.  I really loved that job because it let me use a lot of my biology knowledge, but I didn't feel like it was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\nAfter that I went to work at the BC Cancer Agency, which was amazing because I was working in downtown Vancouver.  Even though this was originally listed as a biology job, they moved me around once they found out I could code, and I ended up building and testing some software that researchers at UBC now use for mammograms for early stage breast cancer detection.\n\nI spent my fifth co-op at Bioinformatics Solutions in Kitchener developing automated test tools for protein identification.  The atmosphere was great but there was also quite a bit (a LOT) of QA involved that they weren't up front above, which I didn't enjoy.\n\nI went to California for my sixth co-op and worked at Zenith, a medical insurance company.  My job was pretty cool, and I actually ended up doing a lot of work with another UW co-op who was in ActSci.  We were in the LA area, but went up to San Fran fairly often and built a decent network, and I ended up meeting a few people working on some cool projects at Palantir, healthcare.gov being one of them.\n\nI went back to Waterloo for 4B, and during that term a guy I had met who worked at Palantir had messaged me saying that they were looking for a programmer with a strong biology background to work on one of their projects.  I did a phone interview then they flew me out over reading week for an in-person interview.\n\nThe interview went well (I had pretty much read \"Cracking the Coding Interview\" cover-to-cover) and I had no doubt they'd be making an offer. I went out for drinks after with the two guys who interviewed me, and we totally tore up this dive bar by Stanford with dollar drink specials.  We ran some stupid tab and the waitress got really annoyed because her shift had ended an hour earlier and we were her last table.  The drunk manager who interviewed me noticed and yelled across the bar asking how much the tab was so we could close it.  She turned around and said \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time that I realized the waitress was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431904593", "subreddit": "uwaterloo", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

I went up to the cashier to ask for a pack, but he greeted me in this very gay tone like he was attracted to me.

{"body": "Wow so this is a long story, so bear with me because this really hits home.  In 2011 I was dating my ex girlfriend at the time and she was a hellcat.  The sex was great but her temperament?  Not so much.  She threw a lamp at my mother and my dad told me I wasn't allowed back in the house until we'd broken up.  So we went for the stereotypical \"long drive.\"  You know, the full moon, both parties uncomfortably staring either out the window or at the road, and not talking for a good twenty minutes.\n\nSuddenly, she starts going into this apoplectic (is that the right word?) rant about my \"retahded\" (she was a boston girl) mother and how my dad is fucking a-hole and she threw the lamp at her because of how \"retahded\" the situation was.  She just kept saying that word over and over and finally she looked back right as I rolled my eyes (probably for the ninth time) and so she reached over and whacked me, with one of her heels.\n\nNow I'm a big dude (6'6\", 250lbs) but a stiletto to the arm hurts like a bitch, and I accidentally flipped the car in my pain and anger (don't hit the fucking driver, I don't care how mad you are at them.\n\nWell next thing you know I'm seeing everything from third person, whole nine yards of \"ascending\" or whatever the crap happens.  Maybe my brain was playing tricks on me, I don't know.  My ex is sobbing into the ground by my body (at least try to resuscitate me bitch!) and everything is going all white and fuzzy.  \n\nFinally I see the paramedics arrive (hallelujah!) and they're clearing the scene.  One gets to work on chest compressions and the other takes my girlfriend over to the side because she's sobbing uncontrollably.  I'm still disembodied looking at the whole scene in third person, and I swear to god, that medic looked at her and said \"I can save your boyfriend, but I'm going to need about tree fiddy.\"  And god damnit that's when I realized It was around this time I realized that he was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

This momentous idea came as a haven for millions of awkward nerds who avoided the daylight and physical activities at all costs. It came as an escape from the real world.\n\nBut ten years later, we face a new threat. Ten years later, our website has been crippled by the dankness of overplayed memes. Ten years later, the average Redditor must endure overplayed inside jokes one after another. Ten years later, we’ve as a website have isolated those who could give a fuck about “ayy, lmao.” And so we’ve come here today to stop this madness.\n\nWe have come to this subreddit to remind Reddit of the staleness of its jokes. This is no time to ignore this pressing matter. Now is the time to end this dark time of memes and move into a new era of originality. Now is the time to downvote and save our brethren from experiencing the same eye-rolling material.\n\nIt would be fatal to overlook it any more. Twenty fifteen is not the end, but the beginning. There will neither be rest nor satisfaction in Reddit until these memes are purged from our front page. The brigades of revolt will shake this website until we can all look towards the light of better content.\n\nBut this should not divide us as Redditors. Many of us share the same qualities and despite the iron curtain of our computer screens, still have feelings. As evident with the many who listen to my message, we can work together for a common goal. Our fates are tied together and those are tied to this very website.\n\nWe cannot downvote alone.\n\nAnd as we moderate, we must remember what countless others have fought for.\n\nWe cannot censor each other.\n\nThere will be those who ask “when enough is enough?” But we cannot let them deter us. For it is never enough until we can browse without needlessly scrolling through “tree fiddy” comments. It is never enough as we watch Redditor after Redditor fight about the legitimacy of memes. It is never enough until you no longer have to give a forced chuckle to a joke you’ve heard a million times before.\n\nLet us not be reminded of Kevin, I say today, my friends.\n\nI have a dream that all Pepes will be rare. No longer be posted by the truckload.\n\nI have a dream that Jolly Ranchers will once again be a delectable snack.

{"body": "Most people chose dragons. When everyone chooses to be one of the most mystical creatures in fantasy, they kind of lose their appeal. Don’t get me wrong, dragons are great, but when you have a shitload of dragons flying around they just don’t seem as special as you imagined them to be. I’ve also seen golems, minotaurs, pegasi, mermaids and even a loch ness monster. There are some people who really knew their monsters. There are many different kinds of creatures out there and some of them I have never even heard of. But when you have all these creatures running around, you also have a crapload of trouble along with it. I guess when those people decided they wanted to be dragons or werewolves or even vampires, they never understood what else came along with it. I mean, yeah, the thought of being able to fly wherever you want and being able to breathe fire is great, and heightened senses and immortality also sound amazing. But what happens when you get hungry? Dragons aren’t vegetarians, and when there’s not enough cows to go around, you know what they like to eat? Humans. You would think that after being human, the thought of eating one would be unappealing. Apparently, that’s not the case at all. I guess when you’re that hungry, you eat whatever you can. And vampires seem all suave and cool in the movies, but in real life that’s not the case. Don’t get me wrong, I know some pretty cool vamps out there, but the ones that can’t control themselves can really lose themselves in the hunger. I’ve seen families torn apart because of a vampire’s addiction to human blood. And I mean literally torn apart. One time it took me a good hour to piece together a whole human body, and even then there were still some pieces missing. It was quite puzzling if you ask me. \n\nBut the good thing about all these monsters running around, is that it’s damn good business. Most people are too scared to deal with it themselves and when the local authorities need someone to hunt down a wanted creature for causing trouble, it’s me they call. I’ve slain creatures of all kinds. Each one is different, and they all have their weaknesses. I’m pretty renowned in the mythical creature hunting community and most of them know who I am by reputation. Everyone’s surprised at how an ordinary guy like me could be so good at hunting down such powerful beasts. But I guess that since I hunt down creatures for a living, they never considered that I could be one myself. But I guess not many people would pick a wizard as their mythological being, or even consider it to be one. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432003295", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A working, $2000 Gaming Computer.\n\nHere's the story.\n\nLast year, my uncle and I (he is a couple months older than me, we were both 14 at the time, I'm 15 now.) we're walking around our small town. We are big on gaming, and don't really do anything other than play our computers, so we really didn't know what to do.\n\nWe brainstormed for a while, and he remembered watching a video on YouTube of people doing parkour. We were near a park, so we decided to go there, and climb/jump around, just to waste some time.\n\nAfter a little bit, we got bored and tired, so we tried to think of something else to do. I remembered that I once watched a video about this man who would go dumpster diving at places like GameStop, Best Buy, etc. Luckily, we weren't too far from any of those places!\n\nMy uncle and I went to Best Buy first. We snuck behind the store and found the dumpsters. Bingo! We were excited, although the trash smelled *disgusting*. \n\nI was the one who did most of the 'dirty work'. (My uncle has Aspergers Syndrome and is easily bothered by things that are dirty. I don't really mind.\n\nI found a few boxes scattered around the dumpster, all for components to build a computer. I found 2 GTX 970 Graphics Cards,   an i7 (can't remember the #k) processor, a really nice white case, multiple power supplies (we took a 650w and a 700w), multiple hard drives (mostly 1Tb) and a motherboard. There were plenty of RAM sticks laying around in the dumpster, we grabbed as many as we could in hopes that they were all working. \n\nLike I mentioned earlier, my uncle and I are pretty tech savvy and love PC gaming. So we knew what all of this meant, and we were freaking out. We had no way of knowing if the parts were working, but still, finding all of the parts to build a gaming computer that would kick the shit of both of ours combined in a dumpster was just unreal.\n\nWe struggled to carry everything home, but we managed. (We put the RAM sticks in our pockets, and each put a processor in our big hoodie pocket) \n\n\nOur parents were out shopping (groceries, IIRC) so unfortunately we couldn't tell them what we had found. We take all of the components and propped them up in the table.\n\nThe next 3:50 were spent assembling this monster of a computer. Unfortunately, we bent the pins on the first processor we tried to install (that was a pain in the ass) but it was alright. We got the next one in fine.\n\nAfter double checking as making sure everything was installed correctly, it was time. Time to turn it on.\n\nWe hooked the computer up to my uncles monitor, and booted it up. Unbelievable! It *actually* worked! Me and my uncle were in disbelief. This was amazing.\n\nAs it booted up, there was a knock on the door. A man was behind it, he was wearing his Best Buy outfit. It was the manager. We open the door, and greeted him.\n\n\"Boys, I'm afraid that you can not just take those parts off of our property. That is stealing, and you can get charged with theft. I want you to hand over the parts that you took, now.\" the man exclaims.\n\n\"Please sir, it was all in the garbage, it was free to take, it was going to get taken to the dump anyways! There has to be some way you will let us keep it!\" I say.\n\n\"We'll you know, there is one thing that I need, and if you can get me it, you can keep the parts.\" he says. \"Imma need about tree fiddy\" \n\nSuddenly the man transformed into a 50 foot long monster from the Mesozoic era, right infront of our eyes.\"\n\n\"I ain't gonna give you tree fiddy\" I state.\n\nThe Lochness monster screams 'DAMNIT' and swims away into the street.\n\nThat damn Lochness monster almost got me again.\n\nAnd that's the story about how my uncle and I got a free $2000 gaming computer.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432006628", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -9, "controversiality": 1}

Also I love how theres no picture for a queen album on last.fm, if only I wasnt lazy as fuck.\n\n* Also included is Rapper Chinx now, fucking sucks even though im not that big of a fan.\n\n[Im conflicted on taylor and kendricks collab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo)\n\n&gt;Tfw Brezhnev forgets to say a theme for next week", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432015112", "subreddit": "lewronggeneration", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Obligatory not a garbage man, but... About 5 years ago, I went to the local dump to rummage through some things on my drive home from work. Most days, I don't find too much, but it's always worth a glance just to see what's arrived since I had been there last. After a few minutes of looking around, I found an antique cash register, like the kind that you only see in old movies in a general store. It was rusty, sure, but I figured I'd take my chances on seeing how much I could fix it up and resell it for. It looked like maybe it could be shined up, and I figured I could get a couple hundred for it if I was able to restore it a little bit if I sold to the right collector. There wasn't a key with it, but I figured it'd be easy enough to pick the lock to make sure I wasn't missing out on anything hidden before reselling it. I thought restoring it would make for a great summer project to do in the evenings. It was a lot heavier than I expected, but I guess most things were back then, before everyone started trying to make things as cheap as possible. After  lugging it near the exit, I had to pass the security guard, who usually looks through what everyone got. He has been working here for years, and he loves seeing people's eyes light up as they proudly show and explain to him what they're taking home with them. I started approaching the guard, and he slowly turned his head toward me and mumbled, \"I can pop that right up here and try to give a look-see inside,\" he offered, since there was no key. As I got closer, I realized that his face was green, and he looked like he was straight out of the Paleolithic era.

{"body": "Not tipping a waiter if he doesn't do a good job, in the US I always feel there's seems to be an obligation to tip regardless. \n\nIt reminds me of a time I took a girl on a date to a pretty fancy restaurant. She was a really nice girl, who I'd always sort of had a thing for and we flirted a lot but we worked together so I didn't want to mess that up. \n\nI finally left my job to get a new one and when I told her she was quite upset we wouldn't see each other every day anymore, I half joking said I'd take her out for dinner to make up for it, she easterly agreed to my pleasant surprise. \n\nI took her out a few days later to this nice ish restaurant, still a little confused as to what to expect, whether we were going as friends or something more. \n\nSo we sit down and our waiter comes over, some 16 year old kid, clearly working part time through high school. Brings us menus and but the lady and I (her name was Ellie) carry on talking. 5 minutes later he comes back to take our orders and I apologise that we're not quite ready, could we have a few minutes. He doesn't look happy and walks off. \n\nFew minutes later he comes back and takes our order, but still with a crappy attitude like he really can't be bothered with us. I don't think much of it, I'm enjoying just talking to Ellie. \n\n45 minutes later, no drinks and no starters I'm a little pissed off, I look around for the waiter and he's nowhere to be seen. I call another waiter over, the place isn't that busy and ask where our waiters gone and why I've waited 45 minutes for drinks. He apologises and says the waiter went on his break half an hour ago but will be back any minute. Asks what we ordered and goes to get it himself. \n\nThe drinks and starters finally arrive and I'm a little annoyed but figure it's probably a mistake. The kid comes back again and clears the table but knocks my beer into my lap. He just said \"oops\" and walked off, I'm like what the fuck? He comes back, without any napkins or anything bringing our main. I ask him if he can get me another napkin since you know, you spilt this on me. \n\nHe doesn't look happy but goes and gets a napkin, as he hands it to me, he says \"it's your fault for leaving your beer on the edge\", I almost flip out but don't want to look rude in front of Ellie. So I just said \"whatever\", dry myself off and carry on. The main was okay, but I'm getting on really well with Ellie, there's clearly a romantic connection between us and we're just discussing future plans, what I'm going to do in my new job, but still flirting a lot, lots of eye contact etc. \n\nWe decide against dessert or coffee and I ask for the bill. I'm talking to Ellie again so  I don't even notice it's been like another half hour, I see the kid talking with another waiter and wave at him, like \"dude hurry up\". Again, a huge scowl from him back at me. \n\nFinally the bill comes and I leave cash, but no way I'm leaving this little shit a tip. Ellie's smiling, looks like she had a good night and we agree to go back to hers for coffee. \n\nAnyway as we're leaving the kid realises I haven't tipped him and runs to catch us, looking pretty pissed off he asks why I didn't tip him. I tell him his service was appalling and he didn't deserve it. He does not look happy and gives us a load of abuse saying he needs the money to help fund college. This really upsets Ellie and I thought about getting the manager but decide it's better to leave, still thought there's a chance I might get some tonight. \n\nEllie was still upset as we're walking to my car saying the kid didn't mean to be rude but a couple of extra dollars might have really helped him. I just said I didn't think he deserved it, I'm happy to tip normally but this kid was rude and apathetic.\n\nWe get in the car and Ellie's gone a bit quiet now, but turns to me and said she used to work as a waitress and hated it when she worked hard and got nothing as a tip. Trying to be nice I swallow my pride and ask if it's better we go back and give this kid a few dollars. She says no, he didn't really deserve it but just think, nobody wants to be there, it's just a shitty job, he's trying his best. \n\nI drive off but without telling her pull up outside the restaurant and say you can go top this kid. I get out my wallet to give her five dollars to give to this kid, she smiles and says \"Okay but I need just one more thing from you\". Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time I realized that Ellie was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" As she swam off into the distance. \n\nI never saw Ellie again but it left me feeling really bitter towards tipping when people don't deserve it. \n\nTLDR: didn't tip a waiter, cost me the chance to get laid with a an ex-colleague who had been a waitress.

{"body": "Edits: Typing super fast and drunk, spelling was a mess.\n\nWhen I was 22 I was traveling through Europe, and ended up stopping for a while in a little town in Romania. Beautiful little village, right on the edge of a forest near the mountains, so like right about roughly the center of Romania.\n\nI'd met a guy while I was in Italy who was from the area, and we had went out drinking a few times and he had given me the info of a friend of his in that area. I had told him I would be making my way through Romania, so he told me to get in touch with them and they could most likely give me a place to stay. So when I got to Romania I looked them up, and they were more than happy to let me crash, initially for just a few days. It was an older guy (40's maybe) who was a friend of my Italy buddy's father, his wife, their early-ish teenage son...and a daughter. Well they had a little farm/ranch type of deal, and while they let me stay for free the offered me some petty cash to work around the property. So I thought why the hell not...make some spending money, save my own, and use it to extend the trip a little bit. I'd spend the days working with the son around the property, and it was actually super legit. Nothing really intense or backbreaking, and the weather was awesome. Good exercise, awesome views.\n\nLike I said, family had a daughter, about 20 at the time I believe. Beautiful chick, dark hair, super deep brown eyes. And I'm usually a fan of lighter blue or green eye, but those brownies...I actually introduced her to the song Brown Eyed Girl, and she absolutely loved it. She spoke pretty decent English, and although we didn't hook up at first we immediately hit it off. She would come talk to me while I was cleaning up around the property, bring me drinks...honestly all super cliche stuff, and it almost didn't seem real. Like...this shit doesn't happen in real life. Stop in the middle of a European village to make cash as a sort of farm hand and get hit on by the hot eastern European farmers daughter?? After a couple weeks we started to hang out a little more, go to the pub, stay out late, all that good stuff. It was fucking awesome. Still very PG-13 (the alcohol and whatnot) but no actual hooking up just yet. Although we both knew we were great together, and at this point I fully planned to stay and see where it went.\n\nSo...about another week in and she makes a move. I'm outside at about midnight smoking a cigarette and she slips out to meet me. Takes my cigarette, takes a drag giving me the eye, and it's on. We get down and dirty on the porch while her families asleep inside, and my mind is split between how awesome this is and how likely it is that I end up with a shotgun blast to the face, my body hidden in a field in the middle of the Romanian countryside. Well...that's when things got weird. At breakfast the next day, they fucking knew. Dad, mom, the damn son. They all knew, and addressed it immediately. Although not with, \"get the fuck out of my home before I bury you.\" More like, \"So...you're moving in? Prepping for the wedding? Should we contact your family?\" I knew there had to be a damn catch, this had all been way to good to be true. And she was on board as well, 100%. After breakfast she starts talking about what the wedding would look like, all that shit. Like they all assumed it was a foregone conclusion. Didn't even ask me. So now this shit was all getting way to weird and intense for me. And she was acting weird too, on top of the whole crazy assumed marriage commitment. I figured fuck...okay, no big deal. I'll survive this day, grab my shit once everyone goes to bed and slip out in the middle of the night. Rural area, but not too bad that I couldn't hike up the road a ways and catch a ride to a city. And get the fuck out of Romania at this point, asap. I bide my time, wait until nightfall. Of course, with how amped up everyone was they stayed up later than usual, but given we were in her parents house, our soon to be wed selves still had to sleep in different rooms. So I wait until I don't hear anyone awake, and prepare to make my move. Grab my shit...also had some stuff still on the other side of the house, but I thought fuck it, I can't chance this. Sure, I could have tried to just tell them, but again...this had taken a turn from badass farm life in Europe to creepy, you're gonna fucking marry my daughter isn't this wonderful!! status way too quick. Something just didn't seem right, to the point where I knew in my gut telling them it wasn't going to happen would not bode well for me. I called a couple buddies in the States to let them know what was up just in case, and they of course laughed their asses off. But at least they knew where I was now. I open the door to the bedroom as quietly as possible, and there she is. Standing right outside the door silent as a ghost, in her long shirt with no pants like some kind of slutty little ninja. Fuck it...I just have to tell her. So I say, look, this was great. But I have to go...I have a life, soon to be job, family, friends. And she looks at me with those gorgeous brown eyes, and I'm like shit. This might happen. I could just do it. Why the fuck not? Marry, stay here another year or so, bring her back to America and show off my super hot European wife. And she looks at me and says, \"Please. Before we go any further, all I need...is a serious tag, and about tree fiddy.\" And she pulled off her mask, revealing herself to be a goddamn gigantic prehistoric reptile from the mesozoic era! And I said no, god damn you. I ain't giving you no god damn tree fiddy, and I grabbed by bag and got the hell out of there. And back to America I came.\nSo all in all, great trip through Europe, and I would highly recommend it, but be super careful when hooking up with European chicks (if you're a dude, of course). Shit can backfire on you real quick. Awesome family and a beautiful little village overall, but that damn daughter...she got me.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432172497", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Did you not see my quote directly from Robb Wolf's website which claims that the diet is beneficial because of it's genetic advantage? \n\nAlso from wikipedia, \"Proponents of the diet posit that during the Paleolithic era — a period lasting around 2.5 million years that ended about 10,000 years ago with the advent of agriculture and domestication of animals — humans evolved nutritional needs specific to the foods available at that time, and that the nutritional needs of modern humans remain best adapted to the diet of their Paleolithic ancestors. Proponents claim that human metabolism has been unable to adapt fast enough to handle many of the foods that have become available since the advent of agriculture. Thus, modern humans are said to be maladapted to eating foods such as grain, legumes, and dairy, and in particular the high-calorie processed foods that are a staple of most modern diets. Proponents claim that modern humans' inability to properly metabolize these comparatively new types of food has led to modern-day problems such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. They claim that followers of the Paleolithic diet may enjoy a longer, healthier, more active life.\"\n\nThe basis of the paleo diet most certainly goes beyond \"these are healthy food choices.\" It also extends as far as claiming, not only that the diet is evolutionary/genetically superior, but that foods  that specific foods are inherently bad for human consumption (legumes, dairy, grains) because we have not evolved past a certain point, which is also not true.  You can read through the rest of the wikipedia page to see why the basis for paleo is false. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432186064", "subreddit": "Fitness", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I never thought you could share a connection like that with another person but Vanessa proved me wrong.\n\nWe planned a trip to Niagra Falls for our 7th anniversary -it was actually a few weeks after because of work commitments- since we'd always wanted to go, it was one of the first things we spoke about when we met all those years ago.

From Aliens to Bigfoot to Loch Ness monster, we've seen false fables become fairly popular within the past century.

Perhaps not “*aliens who have visited Earth*”, but rather aliens that exist somewhere else, this seems to be almost a given statistically speaking.  There are too many planets for evolution to only happen on Earth.\n\n2. Bigfoot and Loch Ness are extraordinary claims, not because they found a beast in a particular place, but rather because the beast is of a novel species for which we have no good evidence.  There's an implicit categorical claim that the species in question exists.  But Jewish peasants in roman occupied judea are not a novel class.  I don't see this being an analogous comparison.  Maybe if you modified the claim to be a magical/mythical version of Jesus, then sure you can argue some kind of analogy exists there… but the claim is about a human of a specific name being crucified in a place we knew did such things, and by a person who we know existed and did such things.  If I say “*A man named Bob Johnson got thrown in jail in Texas in 1940*”, this isn't categorically implausible.  In the total absence of evidence you'd have to at least be fairly agnostic about Bob Johnson's existence, and if you found a couple documents on him, it becomes more reasonable.  That's a better analogy (although likely still imperfect).\n\n\n&gt;  Just because some people believed the tales of Jesus before Paul is not any evidence of his historicity.\n\nAnd how exactly does one justify using this logic to deny Jesus's existence, yet not somebody like Pythagoras or Alexander the Great?

The collectivization of agriculture occurred when in 1928 Stalin phased out the NEP (New Economic Policy), a state capitalist policy enacted by Lenin that was intended to have been running for much longer.

{"body": "Hi there! I'm an ERS student currently on my last work term so I guess I can speak pretty well about the program at this point.  ERS is one of the programs that some people feel gets left behind on campus behind math and engineering, but there's some great things going on in the Faculty of Environment!\n\nIn terms of workload, the program isn't too heavy.  You get a lot of freedom in choosing which upper year ERS/ENVS courses you get to take, so the difficulty is really up to you.  I've taken quite a few courses and labs from the Earth and Environmental Science departments, and that made my 3A and 3B terms pretty stressful.  There's also a lot of field work involved in many of the courses, so you can expect to spend a fair amount of time outside of the classroom.\n\nJob prospects are generally good for co-op, but much better if you have a science background instead.  Environment Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Environment hire a lot of co-ops.  Keep in mind that ERS competes with Environment and Business, Environmental Science, and Civil/Environmental Engineering, so there's a lot of competition as well.  I've been fortunate enough to find a job for all five of my co-ops though, and already have a job lined up for once I graduate!\n\nI spent my first two co-ops working at the Toronto District School Board as an Outdoor Education Intern.  I was at a day centre that the board operates and students come to for field trips.  I was developing and teaching outdoor programs, mostly to kids in grades 4 through 6, as part of their science curriculum.  There were also quite a few high school kids who were taking outdoor ed classes.  This was a really fun job, and it was nice because whenever it was nice out I got to spend &gt;50% of my day outside.\n\nI spent my third co-op working in Uxbridge at the Durham Forest Environmental Education Centre.  I was doing similar things to at the TDSB, but this was an overnight program for grade 6's.  I facilitated orienteering, taught them about the forest, and about how to be environmentally conscious during outdoor activities.  A caveat of this job was that I had to live in the centre, but I think the experience I got, especially because it was a summer and there were lots of environmental summer camps running, was worth it.  All my food was provided too so that was cool!\n\nI went to Sudbury for my next two co-ops to work for Xstrata.  I was working at a nickel mined doing environmental surveys of groundwater at active and inactive mine sites across the region.  This was a great experience because I finally got to apply a lot of what I learned in my assessment courses.  This is actually the place that offered me a job starting next May.\n\nEven though Xstrata offered me a job, they thought it would be good for me to get industrial experience with another company, to see how other environmental management systems work.  I'm now working at AMEC, reviewing data from subsurface investigations and planning layouts of tailings disposal sites.  There's a lot of engineering stuff that I'm learning on the job (dams, channeling, freshwater diversions) that is super interesting.  \n\nFunny enough I'm currently on a field visit to this site just past Timmins to do water testing to start checking the feasibility of a tailings diversion project.  In total its me, two civil engineers and a chemical engineering co-op on this trip.  We flew from Toronto to Timmins on Tuesday and we're flying back tomorrow.  We took some samples and surveyed on Wednesday and today, then tomorrow morning we have consultation with a few of the aboriginal leaders.  Getting the samples was probably the coolest part of any of my co-ops.  We got to see a few of the tailings ponds that the mines have, which are basically just lakes of wastewater.  We were samping during sunrise and it was really pretty.  As I was looking around observing and just being generally content with my co-op experience and degree, the chemical engineering co-op I was with asked me to hand him some sample vials.

Anyway, we'd been drinking and smoking pot until about 1 in the morning but me and my room mate decided to head home. Like I said, it's not super safe, but since there were two of us, we figured we'd be fine.\n\n My room mate had been smoking weed and while we were walking back he got real hungry. He was complaining while we were walking and we had just passed a gas station, so I told him to go back and grab some chips or something. He didn't have any money, so I had to lend him some. I gave him my cash (only had a few bucks at the time) and told him I would wait. \n\nA minute or two passed and I was looking at my phone. I heard footsteps, assuming they were my roommates, and said \"Did you find what you were lookin for?\"\n\nIt wasn't my roommate though, and by the time I turned around I had a fucking gun pointed at my face. I said I didn't have any more cash, what do you want? He replied \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was about this time I realised it was an 8 story tall crustacean from the protozoic era holding a gun to my head.

{"body": "I once got serious with a really old woman.  She never told me her age, she only said 'you never ask a lady her age or weight.'\n\n But everything about that relationship was phenomenal. There were no communication problems, neither of us wanted kids, she had plenty of wealth from trading gold when that was big and I had a really nice paying job, and to top it all off she shared my passion for all things water.  And don't even get me started on the sex(I'll just sum it to feeling amazing and loud, odd moans)\n\nWe would pack some towels, sunscreen, water, breakfast and lunch and spend all day on the beach. From nearly sun up til sun down we would be in the water.  Our favorite thing to do was to see who could find the coolest thing that day.  I had no idea how she did it, but nearly every time she would find some watch or busted pair of sunglasses.  \n\nAfter quite some time I bought her ring and was gonna pretend to 'find' to finally out do her and ask her to marry me all in one.    \n\nBy now, you've noticed how its all been past tense... So this shouldn't be a surprise.  \n\nBefore I could 'find' the ring, some man tried to steal out stuff from her while I was in the bathroom but she fought back and got shot in the stomach.   I heard the shot and ran to see her leaned up against the wall and the robber sprinting away, way faster than I could.\n\n  I couldn't call an ambulance because our phones were in the bag which was quickly disappearing and our car was a good 3 miles away and she would easily bleed out before we could walk there.  Our only hope was that someone heard the shot and would help. After 15 minutes of trying to calm her down and waiting on help which never came, she started to drift in and out of consciousness.    \n\nI knew she didn't have long, so I pulled the ring out of my pocket and asked her to marry me.  And barely above a whisper she said 'yes, but I need something from you.'  \n\nI said, 'anything.' And her intelligible last words were 'I'ma need about three fifty'.   It was then I realized she was 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era and it was also then I realized OP should have used a serious tag. \n\nTldr: dmhs ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432265071", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I grew up in rural Pennsylvania in an old mining town that is very drug addicted, racist, and impoverished. It is a town that capitalism has left behind. My dad is disabled and my mother worked in a university cafeteria in a wealthy suburb of Pittsburgh. She drove an hour and a half each way to a job that made barely above minimum wage. And our family was considered better off than most of my friends' in town. As a kid I used to work on a neighbor's farm on weekends and during the summer, and they used to pay me in cash and fruits and vegetables. That was always special because it was a break from the shitty cafeteria food that mom always brought home. \n\nWhen I turned 15 I started selling weed, and I was finally able to buy nice things. I helped pay for my dad's medication and our phone bills. By around 17 I started slinging coke. Mom must have known what was going on, but she didn't say anything. After all, her bills were finally getting paid. At that time we had studied the Communist Manifesto in school and it really resonated with me I think her and I both realized that working for someone else isn't going to get you anywhere in your life, and working a bullshit job is just going to work you to your grave while your boss laughs all the way to the bank. I really was able to see how capitalism had negatively impacted my life and the lives of everyone I had ever loved. \n\nAfter a few years, I developed a pretty serious coke problem, and next thing I knew, I had sold all my things and I moved back into my parent's house. I continued to sell out of my bedroom, just so that I could keep my own stash full. One day, one of my customers was pulled over leaving my house after I sold him an 8 ball. Apparently he immediately flipped, and when he left my house the next day, a fucking SWAT team busted in my house, threw me down on the ground and arrested me at gun point. Luckily dad was out of the house, because he might have died in all the commotion. I was taken to the booking station, and in the morning I had my bail hearing. I went in front of the judge crying my eyes out because I was so scared. She asked me if I wanted to say something. I tried my best to articulate that my family is very poor, and the money I made selling coke was the best money that anyone in my family has ever made. I told her that I anyone else in my situation would do the same thing when they are getting fucked over at every turn. Then she did the most heartless thing I could imagine someone doing, but knowing my experience with capitalism, I should have expected it. She says, \"Drugs have no place in my society, so I'm setting your bail at tree fiddy\". That's when I realized that the judge was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Damn it, Nessie! That goddamn Loch Ness Monster had got me again. Not being able to pay my bail, I waited in jail until my sentencing, when I spent three years in prison wondering why OP would post a serious discussion in a circlejerk subreddit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432276072", "subreddit": "FULLCOMMUNISM", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My parents met when they were both very young. My dad was a city kid through and through again. He lived in NY for most of his childhood, and he could tell you where any local deli was from anywhere in the city, but he couldn't light a fire to save his life. \n\nMy mom was the exact opposite. She too lived in NY, but she hated the constantly bustling city. She lived in the heart of the city next to Grand Central and her favorite memories were catching a train out of NY and into the country side with her Grandpa where she would spend most of her summers playing in the barn and milking cows to make pancakes for the morning. \n\nThey first met each other at Grand Central station when they were, I think they said, 13 or 14. My dad wasn't much of a looker back then according to my mom. He had a really heavy New York accent despite only being 13, and apparently acne had set in early for him. My mom on the other hand, well my dad said she was any teenager's dream. They were both waiting for their train and were sitting on a bench.\n\nMy mom sat down first, close to the edge of the old wooden bench. My dad arrived at the station and went to find a seat. He saw my mom sitting there and nervously sat at the opposite end. Again, my dad was no looker, and he knew that too. Impressively though, he managed to work up the courage to talk to the beautiful girl. He asked her for her name, to which she replied, \"Sharon\". They started smalltalking and my dad mentioned he was heading out to the country to attend his grandmother's (my great grandmother's) funeral. My mom replied that she was going out for the summer with her grandparents on their small farm. \n\n\nThe train finally came and they bothed hopped on, sat across from each other, and kept talking. I think my dad said his train stop was about 2 hours away while my mom's was longer. They talked for the entire two hours they were together. They both said it was here that they first really fell in love. But things happen and they never exchanged methods of communication and they both fell out of one another's memory, although never completely.\n\nThen when they were both in their twenties, they met at a conference, it was big medical event. My dad was studying to become a doctor, my mom was in the pharma business. They were sitting across the room from one another, but they found each other during a break for snacks and refreshments. They were both trying to meet as many people as possible, and my dad had just finished shaking hands with a fine gentlemen when behind him he saw a familiar face. Now at this point, my dad had gone from this fugly city kid to this broad shouldered handsome man. He walked over to my mom, and for the first time in forever, got nervous. She was talking with someone else, and had just finished that conversation and begun to turn towards the snacks when he intervened. He said hi and shook her hand, and apparently gave her this creepy look because she almost left until he explained that they had met before. Thry both pieced together the story with fleeting memories that grew more frequent throughout the conversation. They were both in tears laughing by the time the intermission was over. He quickly asked for her numbe, to which she of course obliged before going back to sit down, giddy with happiness.\n\nThey got together, had drinks, and then, before they said bye that night, kissed. It was at that moment that they both knew they were once again in love. Fast forward 3 years of dating, they were vacationing in Scotland. They were walking around the edge of some famous lake, on the beach. He turned towards her,  and looked her in the eye for a second. She asked why he was looking at her so funny. He got down on one knee, pulled a vevet box out of his back pocket, and opened it up. \n\nConfusion ensued when upon inspection by my mother, she did not find a ring inside. Instead, she found a note. She looked at the note closer and realized it was a receipt. The receipt read, \"Grand total: $3.50\". She stumbled backwards, dazed and hurt. She looked up at my dad, then realized something she should've noticed a long time ago: my dad was actually 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

I'm assuming he was still wrestling with who he was/what he wanted/how he identified himself.  So, as showbiz goes, they drifted apart.  She would (I guess) write to him and he would respond.  Then he stopped responding as often... then not at all.  My mother (Candice) met my father (Ronald).  On their honeymoon, they ran into Elton in Italy.  Sitting on a park bench, Elton was writing a song.  They sat for a while and caught up with each other.  My mother introduced my father.  They chatted for a while and then went on their way.  It was the last time (that I know of) that they spoke to each other.\n\nThe song that Elton was writing ended up being Benny and the Jets.  When it came out my mother was struck by some of the lyrics: \"Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet...\"  He even called them \"keen\" which is very close to my last name.\n\nAs time went on, my parents grew to hate that lyric.  My mother wasn't sure if it was meant as a compliment or if he was being condescending.  \n\nTHEN she grew to DESPISE it.  She decided that because the song used their names, and it would be easy to prove he was writing about them, she was owed royalties.\n\nNow I'm grown up.  I'm a big guy and I would love to run into Elton and ask him one thing.  For about three fifty in royalties.

{"body": "Bigfoot is my absolute favorite crypto-zoological creature; I *really* want it to be real. Consequently I've done a fair bit of research on the subject and concluded that it almost certainly does not exist. \n\nAs I understand it, if I see something strange in the woods, or as is more often the case, someone else reports to have seen something, there are several options for a rationalist to consider. First, it could be a mistaken identification as a bigfoot (or Nessie, or aliens, or chupacabra, etc.), by this I mean that I really saw a bear or tree stump or a disheveled hermit and only thought it was something new. I suspect these sorts of mistakes are what caused the origin of the myth. I might be suffering from hallucinations or I might be lying. I also might have been the victim of a hoax. Finally, Bigfoot might be real. \n\nAs a rationalist, I must now evaluate all of these options as to how likely each one is. There is verifiable evidence that humans are victims of hoaxes, perpetrators of hoaxes, susceptible to hallucinations and to misidentification.  So all of these options are likely explanations for any particular Bigfoot claim. There is currently no verifiable evidence that supports Bigfoot being real (in particular, DNA samples or captured animals, but even high-quality pictures or groups that could not easily be faked). Thus, for any particular claim, Bigfoot being real and the proffered evidence being legitimate is the least likely conclusion. \n\nSo, when evaluating particular pieces of evidence, such as the Patterson footage, a rationalist must grant little probability to it being genuine. It is MUCH more likely to be a clever hoax than the real deal, and by itself is not conclusive. But, one could argue that there are a huge number pictures and videos out there and an even greater number of eyewitness accounts; surely the sheer volume gives them all some weight. Unfortunately, the volume of claims over such a wide geographical area (virtually all of the US) without a single verifiable bit of DNA or any specimens makes the whole thing much more likely to be false. A few isolated sightings or blurry images all centered on a remote area might be suggestive, but boatloads of claims from all over densely populated areas drain credibility from all sightings.\n\nA rationalist is left with the conclusion that Bigfoot almost certainly does not exist. And with the probability being so small, most people would simply say that Bigfoot does not exist\n\nAll that being said, this does not mean that it is impossible that it does exist out there somewhere.  It is plausible, to my mind, that some sort of unknown hominid is lurking in out-of-the-way corners of the world. Perhaps the claims centered on the pacific northwest are true, but they are lost in the sea of false claims. It is up to us to remain skeptical and find the evidence.  Until then, unfortunately, Bigfoot will remain a myth.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432329789", "subreddit": "science", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I had a couple of friends who could get shit on the cheap so i started small dealing weed. nickle , diming, and quarters to other college kids. Then shit started to big BIG i mean real BIG, i was selling pounds by the end of the semester to basically the entire dorm room building as their \"local\" dealer. Then that is when they started asking for the harder shit like Special K and Coke. So i went and asked my buddies if they can get that shit, they were like \"yeah\" we can give it to you for dirt cheap, tree fiddy for the ounce of k and 900 for an ounce of coke. That is when real money started to kick in, i started selling that shit and had to find people to help, so I found some classmates to help sell that shit, i would give it to them for 550 for an ounce of k and 1200 for ounce of coke and whatever they made, was theirs after they gave me what they owed. Now the prices of k was 60 bucks  a half ball which is 1.7 grams so there is like 28 grams in an ounce, so you get like 16 hbs in an ounce. well 16x60 and you do the math.  It's a lot of money for a college kid then the prices for coke, you sell 80 bucks for a gram and 80x28 is a lot of money too.  So you have like 3 kidsds basically selling it to the entire college and BAM all that money is raking in. That is when shit fell apart one kid gets caught and snitches on the whole operation, and i get caught with an ounce of coke and some k on me.

The data, originally compiled by the gang leader to aid in managing the organization, contain detailed information on both the sources of revenues (e.g. drug sales, extortion) and expenditrues (e.g. costs of drugs sold, weapons, tribute to the central gang organization, wages paid to various levels of the gang). Street-level drug dealing appears to be less lucrative than is generally though. We estimate the average wage in the organization to rise from roughly $6 per hour to $11 per hour over the time period studied. The distribution of wages, however, is extremely skewed. Gang leaders earn far more than they could in the legitimate sector, but the actual street-level dealers appear to earn less than the minimum wage throughout most of our sample, in spite of the substantial risks associated with such activities (the annual violent death rate in our sample is 0.07), There is some evidence consistent both with compensating differentials and efficiency wages.\n\nSo I don't know dude, maybe you ought to just not comment on things you don't understand or something?

{"body": "&gt; I often come from a place of self confidence and often am accused of being \"high and mighty\" or \"looking down on others\"\n\nUntil someone actually calls you out on your bullshit.  You're not \"high and mighty\", you're sad and pathetic.  It took absolutely no time to figure you out.  You *do* whine about how unfair life is to you and other minority groups.  You *do* live a life where people are always out to get you.  You're made of glass.  Delete your account and start over.\n\nSee, if you want to debate anything with anybody, you need more than just \"academic papers\".  You need to look at yourself, what you are defending, and why.  Your motive is crystal clear.  This argument began about Walmart employees and how they are being forced to slave labor by the \"system\".  You think sending me to a list of links (which you obviously didnt read) about articles on \"wage slavery\" somehow makes it true and validates your own feelings about the subject.  You couldnt be wrong, because gee...someone wrote a \"peer reviewed article\" on the subject.  Big deal.  You think some kids housed up in a university knows shit about living in poverty and moving out of it?  But because it's in a repository like that, it must be true and everything else is false.  Hate to burst your bubble, but here's how to get something published on that sacred site:\n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/intl/en-us/scholar/inclusion.html\n\n\nIndividual Authors\n\nIf you're an individual author, it works best to simply upload your paper to your website, e.g., www.example.edu/~professor/jpdr2009.pdf; and add a link to it on your publications page, such as www.example.edu/~professor/publications.html. Make sure that:\n\nthe full text of your paper is in a PDF file that ends with \".pdf\",\nthe title of the paper appears in a large font on top of the first page,\nthe authors of the paper are listed right below the title on a separate line, and\nthere's a bibliography section titled, e.g., \"References\" or \"Bibliography\" at the end.\nThat's it! Our search robots should normally find your paper and include it in Google Scholar within several weeks.\n\n\nWow, thats it!  You need an edu address, and a pdf!  My gosh, that must mean anything you find there is ABSOLUTELY TRUE!\n\nIf that's the best you got, it's not much indeed. You live in a fantasy, where you back up your own personal rejections based on what you read in a dump of college student articles.  It's hilarious.  Based on your \"repository of truth\", [God is real](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=God+is+real&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C43), as is the [Loch Ness Monster](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=lochness+monster&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C43).\n\nAnd before you run off about how scholar isnt a repository, Im well aware that it's a search engine...just like the one I linked to.  You did nothing more than a google search and tried to use that as \"evidence\", which is retarded.  No, you're not \"high and mighty\" at all.

{"body": "&gt; I think the problem with this question is that once you have to admit that atheism doesn't solve what many point to as a major problem with religion, namely that people are cunts to one another in the name of a larger cause...\n\nWell, a cure for cancer won't prevent people dying from other diseases. Should we not bother trying to find a cure?\nAlso, I made a [relevant post](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1qhgyc/eliminating_religion_from_the_world_will_not_fix/) a while back.\n\n&gt; Atheism is no better than any other cosmological view...\n\nAtheism isn't a cosmological view. It's not even a world view. If it is then not believing in Big Foot or the Loch Ness Monster must also be considered world view. You're conflating something like scientific materialism with atheism. It's true that a lot of atheists have views based around a scientific understanding of the natural world, but some do not - many Jews and Buddhists, for example, are atheists but may have 'spiritual' beliefs.\n\n&gt; \"Sure, maybe Islam and Christianity killed more people,\" they might say, \"but they had a lot more time! Mao killed a third-as-many in less than a decade!\"\n\nYou're completely missing the point. The atrocities committed by a religion are done in the name of that religion and its god(s). Mao/Pol Pot/Stalin did *not* kill in the name of atheism.\n\n&gt; If you're truly comfortable with yourself and what you believe, you don't have to piss on anyone else and their beliefs when they don't believe what you believe.\n\nI honestly couldn't give a crap about what people actually believe providing that they keep it to themselves. The reason that I mostly oppose religion is because a significant number of religious people are not content with keeping it to themselves - they want to force their beliefs on others and interfere in their lives.\nYour sentiment is all well and good, but you don't appear to recognize that beliefs influence our actions, and that's why so many atheists and anti-theists are vocal about the harm that religion can do.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432386513", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

She was shorter around 5'5 I would say and had a great ass and tits. I remember always sneaking looks in at her when my friend wasn't paying attention but I didn't think either of them had noticed. Anyway after we got to his house after school his mom yelled at him that she told him to clean his room before I came over and to go do it now,she was laying outside tanning at the time and told me I could wait outside with her. She was laying on her stomach and I could tell that she didn't have a top on when out of the blue she started asking me about stuff with girls. That's when she rolled over, looked at me and said \"I need about tree fiddy\" That's about when I noticed it wasn't my friends mom it was that God damned lochness monster! \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432410701", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 123, "controversiality": 0}

By the time I got back to my apartment that night I had forgotten about that, and I was about to go to sleep, but who should show up but that same girl. She explained that she was let go, as the person they were looking for had a different middle name. She also said that being cuffed and man handled by me turned her on. Naturally, I invited her in.\n\nAs soon as I closed the door behind her, I instantly ran my hands all over her body, She moaned, turned around, and then bent over. I instantly unzipped my jeans, and I was about to pull down her pants when she goes \"I need about tree fiddy.\"It was about that time that I noticed that my ex was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era. \n\n\nTL;DR I had to arrest my ex-gf, turns out she was innocent, we did the butt sex.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432453171", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

Snow every now and then, but not too cold.  The breeze is refreshing every morning.  Campfires in and outside of the cabin.\n\nThen.  Then there are bears.  Then come the snakes.  Then the trees.  Oh god the trees.  Leaves, branches, bird shit everywhere.  Ever try raking an angled yard?  I would use a lawn blower but it attracts the goddamn wolves.  And let me tell you about the fucking wolves.  When they know you're inside the cabin, they won't fucking leave.  Those asshats are smarter than the fat bears that claw at my walls at night.  They prowl around, waiting for you to haul your mountain ass towards your car.  Then, when you finally had enough of their shit and assuming you find your way into your car without wolves gnawing at your femur, you now have to drive down the fucking mountain.  Ever drive down a fucking mountain?  90% of the road is dirt and rail-less.  It's also usually one-way, so if you run into someone going up that same mountain, one of you either backs the fuck up or you fight each other with chains before the wolves can get there.  This is if you're lucky.  Did it snow in the past 2 days?  Road is mud.  Can't get down.  Did it rain in the past week?  Road is mud.  Don't even try.  Did a tree fall down on the road?  Ha.  Good fucking luck.  If that wasn't bad enough, the sole reason I moved up into the mountain in the first place was to avoid having neighbors.  On the very last day/night of my living in the mountain, some prick loudly bangs at my door at midnight, attracting who knows what towards my cabin.

You'll probably end up associating your impression of Jack with the black race. If Jack was tall, you might extrapolate that black people are tall. If Jack had a big thumb, you might generalize that black people have big thumbs. \n\nThis is problematic because whatever impression you got may be (and most likely is) an individual variable, belonging to just Jack. Jack might be tall and/or big-thumbed, but black people as a whole are neither tall nor big-thumbed. However, race is a very convenient and powerful delineator for organizing your perception of the society and unless you are *exposed to more black people who break your generalization* you will go on believing in your very limited impression. And this applies to less whimsical perceptions: in Korea, the view that American women are morally ambiguous is common while in America, the view that black/Latino men are dangerous is prevalent in certain social circles.\n\nI see a few ways to become more tolerant. Just getting to know more people of multicultural backgrounds can break your stereotypes. Traveling and experiencing different cultures afford you a better cultural context as well. And interaction doesn't always have to be in real life: the media can provide a way of cultural interaction, though not perfect (imagine if minorities were portrayed with the same complexity as white characters!

{"body": "&gt; How is withholding judgement not a position of not believing?\n\nBecause belief is not dichotomous, but is a matter of degree. Do you believe the sun will rise tomorrow? I imagine you believe it very strongly. Do you believe there is any milk left in the fridge? I imagine that if you believe in this, you believe it somewhat less strongly. You could also put a number on it if that helps. So you e.g. believe the sun will rise by, let's say 99.9 (out of 100, where 100 is complete belief, and 0 is complete disbelief). And you believe there is milk in the fridge by say 60.5.\n\nDo we agree so far?\n\nAlright, so imagine I put a box in front of you and I tell you to guess whether it is empty or not. This reality of the situation (ignoring quantum physics) is that these are the two options, and they are mutually exclusive. Assuming you have no evidence, at all regarding whether it's empty or not, what would you as a reasonable person belief? Clearly you would have to accept that one is just as plausible as the other, so that would equate a 50/50 split. You believe as strongly in it being full as in it being empty. Another term for this is \"withholding judgment\". If you don't like that term, no problem. But that was how I was using it.\n\n&gt; Remember not believing something is not the same as believing the opposite is true. \n\nThat depends. If the two are our only options, and if they are mutually exclusive. Then certainly complete disbelief in one, is the complete affirmation of the other, again, unless we are being unreasonable. Some people do perhaps actually believe strongly both that the box is full and empty. But we can agree that this is an unreasonable belief.\n\n&gt; Anything that is not A is not A as states the rule of non contradiction.\n\nThat doesn't look like the law of non contradiction. It looks like the law of identity. Did you forget to remove a word? The law of non contradiction states that two mutually exclusive propositions cannot both be true at the same time. That was what I was getting at. But that two mutually exclusive propositions cannot both be true at the same time, is a fact about the world. Not about our reasonable beliefs. It is entirely reasonable to believe with the same conviction in both A and not A /a 50/50 split.\n\n&gt; So if withholding judgement is not a position of belief than by definition it is a position of not believing. I'm not sure i can simplify it any more, but ill try if need be.\n&gt; \n\nI'll just restate it here. Withholding judgment is the middle ground between complete belief and complete disbelief.\n\nEdit: oh, didn't see the before now. O.K., now it gets complicated. First of all, he seems to define atheism as any belief state between 0 and including 50 in the god proposition. And Theism as being any belief state between 51 and 100 in the god proposition. This is all fine and good if that's how you want to use the terms. However, there is still a middle position where you believe as strongly in god and not-god. That position follows from agnosticism insofar as agnosticism means that you we cannot know whether god exists or not.\n\nIn other news: The second claim the bald guy makes is wrong. The default position is not that god doesn't exist, or at least it isn't if we lack evidence at all, and that's why it's a bad analogy. The reason why we deny the existance of the Nessie is that we actually have tons of observational evidence that contradicts the hypothesis of her existance. However regarding the god hypothesis is more like the box case above. And here the default position is thus a 50/50 split i.e withholding judgment, i.e. the position that follows from agnosticism.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432493492", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;It's a rejection of a claim, but it is also a belief. \n\nHow is the rejection of a claim a belief? You assert it but now you have to prove it, so go on then. Prove that rejecting a claim is a belief.\n\n&gt;You believe that God does not exist.\n\nNo I don't. I've never said that. I follow the evidence where it leads and there is no evidence for or against the existence of a god. Just like there's no evidence for or against the existence of Bigfoot, the loch ness monster, fairies, trolls, or any other supernatural claim.\n\nI don't know nor have any belief that god does or does not exist. How would anyone prove that in either direction? There are two positions to take here. Either you:\n\nBelieve all extraordinary claims until proven false.  \nor  \nDisbelieve all extraordinary claims until proven true.  \n\nThe default position is to disbelieve all extraordinary claims until proven true. And when someone can't prove their claim is true, that doesn't make the opposite position of that claim automatically true by default. Nor does that make anyone who disbelieves one claim automatically believing in the opposite of that claim. That's just bizarre. \n\n&gt;You do not know God doesn't exist\n\nThat's called agnosticism.\n\n&gt;you simply believe God doesn't exist.\n\nThat is **NOT** atheism. \n\nYou don't get to pretend that atheists believe the opposite as theists do, that's dishonest to its core. There are two claims here: A god exists and a god does not exist. Atheism and theism only address the first claim that a god exists. Theists posit that a god exists, atheists reject that claim. **Atheism is the null position of the god claim.**\n\nThose who make the claim that god does not exist are not atheists, they're anti-theists. Please learn the difference. Theism and atheism address the claim that a god exist, nothing more. \n\nSince you seem so confused on what belief and rejection of belief is, here's an article that will help you understand:\n\nhttp://atheists.org/activism/resources/what-is-atheism?\n\n&gt;yet new evidence may someday change your belief.\n\nStill not a belief as I've already clearly explained to you.\n\n&gt;Eye witness accounts are often the main pieces of evidence to have someone convicted.\n\nOh really? That claim is demonstrably false:\n\nhttp://agora.stanford.edu/sjls/Issue%20One/fisher&amp;tversky.htm\n\nhttp://www.apa.org/monitor/apr06/eyewitness.aspx\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/\n\nhttp://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/mistakenid.html\n\nhttp://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/03/supreme-court.aspx\n\nBoom!\n\nBut let's entertain your illogical and demonstrably false conclusion that eyewitness testimony serves as evidence. I am now telling you that god came down from the sky and told me I am his messenger. I am to lead the world. God also told me to specifically tell you to give me all your money. It's true because I'm an eyewitness to it.\n\nNow what? Either eyewitness testimonies are proof as you claim and you now owe me all of your money as ordered by god, or you can admit you were wrong and keep your money. This is the corner you've now painted yourself in. If you want to cling to your claim, then you are forced to give me all your money because clearly I'm telling the truth since I'm an eyewitness.\n\n&gt;Do you now understand my original statement that Belief = Evidence + Faith?\n\nI understand the poor reasoning and lousy fallacies you tried to use to justify your untenable position. You're trying to claim that atheism is a belief yet you have not proven it to be true. You've tried to conflate atheism with anti-theism which is blatantly dishonest. You've tried to claim eyewitness testimony is valid evidence which is demonstrably wrong. \n\nYou're twisting and warping definitions to suit your agenda and I'm not letting you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432494297", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I'll have what he's having, the strip steak.\"\n\n\n\"and how would you like that cooked, sir?\"\n\n\n\"I'll take it well-done, thanks.\"\n\n\na momentary pause. the waiter stares at you. the potential client raises an eyebrow. \n\n\n\"o...okay, gentlemen. I'll go put this in now.\"\n\n\nthe mood is noticeably soured. you're trying to pitch your firm to the client, but he's now resistant to you. you can't really quite figure it out, he seemed to be in a great mood just a few minutes ago and now he's giving you the cold shoulder. you think to yourself, was it something I said? something I did? is there something in my teeth? but the food's coming out now. you begin to relax a little, sure that the food will improve his mood. \n\n\n\"NY strip, medium rare for you, sir....and here's your well-done strip. anything else I can get for you gentlemen?\" the waiter asks, as he hands you a smoldering, charred, sorry excuse for a steak.  \n\n\n\"oh, right,\" you say, \"could you bring me out a bottle of A1?\"\n\n\n\"...uh, sorry sir. we don't carry any A1 here.\"\n\n\n\"oh, no problem, then. just bring me out some ketchup then?\"\n\n\n\"...okay, sir, I'll see what I can do.\" \n\n\nas the waiter walks away, the client just looks on in bewilderment. it's hard for him to imagine someone could be so...uncultured? unrefined? oblivious? he's not sure what the correct word for this situation is. but here's the point: currently, 4 different companies are competing for his account, and this guy's firm is now dead last. \n\n\nso obviously, the mood does not improve. you're sitting there, waiting, and say, \"hmm, I wonder where that damn waiter is with my ketchup...\". the client looks up from his tender, juicy, delicious, medium rare steak, which practically melts in his mouth, rolls his eyes, and continues to eat. \"so, is that the best steak you've ever had, or what?\" you ask the client, trying to lighten the mood, to no avail. \n\n\nyou're sweating, fidgeting, nervous as hell. he's obviously not too happy, but you can't quite figure out why. there goes my bonus, you think. guess we're not going on that big family vacation after all, the kids are going to be really disappointed, not to mention the wife. that's when you feel a light tap on your shoulder. shit, it must be the waiter with my ketchup, finally, you think. you turn. \"excuse me, sir,\" he says to you, \"could you spare about tree fiddy?\" \n\n\nand that's when you finally realize it. the person you're talking to isn't a waiter at all, but in fact an 8-story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. god damn lochness monster!

{"body": "There are so many answers in the universe we have no logical explanation for but that we never bother to question because it doesn't seem to meaningfully impact us. If we could both shift our perspective and somehow discover these unanswerable questions, we may come one step closer to understanding how the universe ticks. \n\nFor example, where do dragons come from? That sounds like a basic question, but really, really give it some thought for a moment. Dragons aren't a recent invention. They date back for millenia starting out in China. Take the Chinese Calendar for example. It has lots of animals on it, such as rat, ox, pig...but one animal is not like the other. That's right. Dragon. And the Chinese dragon is a particular kind. Kind of long a bit like a snake, but can fly despite not having visible wings. However, another type of dragon later gained popularity and recognition in the west, presumably completely separate and apart from the east. How? Why? How could there be two wildly different interpretations of dragons that are both accurate? \n\nBut screw the history lesson, let's get to the good stuff. Okay. Think about how many things dragons are in. Really thing about it. They. Are. Everywhere. Books? Eragon, Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings. Movies? How to Train your Dragon, Neverending Story. Video Games? Skyrim. The more you think about it the more you realize how popular and almost accepted they are. I mean sure, most of these are fantasy pieces...but why dragons? The human mind is incredibly imaginative. Why not a bird with wings? Or why not some of the other mythical creatures like Chimeras or The Loch Ness Monster or Yeti or whatever else? True, these creatures do come about from time to time. Vampires recently went through a period of great popularity. But dragons are a bit different. They endure. They show up all throughout our history and even now things with dragons in them seem to succeed. Why is it that dragons are so popular? Why is it that human beings as a collective species are so drawn to them? ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432555298", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Those things are death machines.\" \n\n\"I know!\" Michael said, frightened. \"You have no idea how much I appreciate you taking me in.\"\n\nEric got his radio and the two continued to listen to the broadcast.  Things looked grim.  The cities were in flames, death tolls reached the millions, and at one point in the night, the news broadcast even cut away.  While the station did not say why, it was evident what had happened.  \n\nIt seemed like a post apocalyptic nightmare. Finally, faced with the toughest decision a President can make, he decided to bomb the monsters.  All of them.  Nearly 90% of the Earth's population was wiped out with the bombings and attacks, but the last 10% slowly began to rebuild.  Eric and Michael became good friends over time.  They helped rebuild with the few colonies left alive on the planet.  A majority of the land that was once bustling cities was now ash and rubble.  \n\nTHIRTY YEARS LATER\n\nEric tells the story of the great Loch Ness Monster attack to a group of children at an assembly.  Similar to how holocaust survivors speak- Eric toured the country making sure the world never forgot.  No monsters made it out alive.  Some bones are available at a few museums, but other than that, nothing.   \n\nThe world has thrived quite well after thirty years.  Cities were beginning to look like actual cities again.  Things were looking good.  \n\nTHIRTY YEARS LATER\n\nEric was eighty years old at this point.  He had stopped touring, since his old body couldn't handle all of the traveling.  He's still sometimes interviewed, along with Michael, about what it was like living through the great Loch Ness Attack of '15.  \n\nOne day, during one of his countless interviews, Eric fell unconscious.  He was rushed to the hospital and told he had days to live.  As soon as Michael heard the news, he rushed to the hospital to be with Eric.  \n\n\"We've been through a lot\" said Michael, smiling back at his friend. \n\n\"We sure have\" said Eric.\n\n\"Eric, since this may be the last time I ever speak to you, there's something I've gotta tell you.\" Michael said.\n\n\"Of course.\" Eric said, tear falling down his cheek.\n\n\"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"  Tree fiddy. It was about that point when Eric realized Michael was actually a 500 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\n\"God dang it Loch Ness monsta! You ain't gettin my tree fiddy\"\n\n\"How about a dolla?\"\n\nAnd right as Michael said those words, Eric died.  He flatlined and doctors rushed to be by his side trying to revive him.  But that was it.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432569336", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 38, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\nI used to be one of those people.\n\n\n\nWhen I first discovered I did not have to type the entire word, it changed my life.\n\nI no longer felt depressed, because finally for the first time in my life, I had time for myself.\n\nYou can't imagine what it feels like, knowing that you now have the time to do anything. In a sense, it made me feel, well almost immortal, like nothing could stop me from living.\n\nAt first I used my newfound ability mostly for myself, I took up word working and began carving furniture, selling it for a small profit. \n\nThe money didn’t matter, however the small amount of funds I managed to scrape together were significant enough that I decided to put them aside, save them for when I needed them.\n\nEventually, I saved enough money to buy a small fishing boat which I loved very much.\n\nI named it Annie, and even though it wasn't the most powerful of vessels it found it's place upon the great lakes with me, where we would spend hours simply taking in the tranquillity of being in a place so quiet you can hear your thoughts speak.\n\nTo this day I can't exactly explain it, but as the weeks passed I noticed that I no longer felt tired at all, almost as if I awoke every morning feeling more rested than the next. As a result, my Marriage drastically improved. My wife and I no longer fought, as every time she needed me I was there for her, there to comfort her hold her and tell her I loved her.\n\nI often would take her with me on my boat and we would lie there all night just talking to each other, sharing our dreams and hopes, our greatest fears and worries.\n\nThe next few months were the happiest moments of my life.\n\nEverywhere I would look I would find new things to do, new places to go. Everything seemed to go at my pace, like the world had slowed it's orbit to pass me by and smile at me, blow me a kiss and send me on my way.\n\nEventually  my wife became pregnant, and the doctors told us it would be a little baby girl. \n\nWe both teared up when we heard the news, my wife because she had always wanted a baby girl, and me because I knew the world I would be bringing  this child into was perfect, I had everything to offer my child, a bright future, loving parents, and most importantly, the time to be with her, the time to help her, the time to watch her grow up.\n\nI'll never forget that day in the hospital, the day of her arrival into the world. Me and my wife had both decided we wouldn’t name the baby until she was born. after all, there was no rush, and we had all the time in the world.\n\nI remember walking towards that hospital door.\n\nI remember seeing my wife in bed, her face white as a ghost.\n\nI remember asking her if she was all right, and I remember her face when she shook her head and pointed towards the crib in the corner of the room.\n\nI turned and walked over to the crib, and looked down at the figure that lay there motionless.\n\nAs I stared, tears began streaming from my eyes, and I picked up my newly born child and held it close.\n\n\"Why?\" I whispered, \"I could have given anything you wanted, anything you needed. Why did you leave? what is it you want?\"\n\nAnd then I heard it. the most chilling sound I will ever hear. \n\nI need about tree fiddy.\" It was around this time where I realized that my child was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Sticking along the East Coast corridor it would seem, first Kings Dominion and now BGW...\n\n**[Here is my most recent live trip blog from Busch Gardens](http://www.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/34pspr/live_trip_blog_busch_gardens_williamsburg_on/)**\n\nA lot of great points already started but some short and sweet thoughts:\n\n* BGW is literally one of the prettiest parks around, the use of the landscape/green space makes you feel relaxed despite some serious scream machines. The small European touches and multiple pathways that meander through the park make for a nice walk from coaster to coaster. You never feel like speeding up your stroll, which is a lot coming from someone who is told to stop running by the Cedar Point security on a regular basis. \n\n* The newest coaster addition of **Tempesto** is actually quite good despite the fact its a clone. It is nestled in next to Apollo's Chariot, it has some effort in the theme that does work in that part of the park, and is a belly churning laugh of a 45 second ride. Stop the hate until you ride. [ [RCDB Page](http://rcdb.com/12277.htm) | [POV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6zHIgJ67g) ]\n\n* Also, not enough love goes to **Verbolten**. It certainly plays in the \"high family thrill\" coaster category and it replaced a beloved ride known as Big Bad Wolf, but its a fantastic achievement for the park and it operates throughout the year even during the winter season's Christmas Town. Its even better at night later in the season when its hard to see in the outdoor sections of the track. [ [RCDB Page](http://rcdb.com/9463.htm) | [POV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6dIsCuiCDY) ]\n\n* Speaking of **Big Bad Wolf**, that was a great Arrow suspended coaster (note my flair) that had a signature dive over the \"Rhine River\" at its conclusion - there is a nod to that dive on Verbolten. Many people from the area who are in their 30's and older remember Big Bad Wolf fondly as one of their first thrill rides. [ [RCDB Page](http://rcdb.com/111.htm) | [POV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWO7AYCRaxE) ]\n\n* Another curious story from BGW is that of **Drachen Fire**. It was a short-lived pain machine that only a handful of enthusiasts had the (mis)fortune of experiencing. There were some issues with ordering and implementation of the ride, which was an install that was to be the sister-investment to Tampa's Kumba around the same time. Some good background can be found in the [History section of the ride's Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drachen_Fire). [ [RCDB Page](http://rcdb.com/112.htm) | [POV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyOzDpYNsow) ]\n\n* I still find **Griffon** to be the park's best coaster, but many B&amp;M hyperboys fawn over **Apollo's Chariot**. Although the Chariot is good, I think it doesn't stack up against other similar coasters like Intimidator (Carowinds), Nitro (Six Flags Great Adventure) or Raging Bull (Six Flags Great America). Classic coaster lovers still fill the queue for the interlocking inversions of **Loch Ness Monster** - which I believe was on the cover of a few math books back in my school days - despite the fact its getting a bit rougher with age. **Alpengist** has a beautifully done theme and if you like intense, speed heavy inverts then you will be happy ridding this usually short lined machine.\n\n* My number one recommendation for anyone who is visiting the park for the first time is to go get a cold beer at the Festhaus and walk down to the [Rhine River Cruise](http://seaworldparks.com/en/buschgardens-williamsburg/attractions/rides/rhine-river-cruise/)  for a very nice cruise ride with a cold one in hand.

{"body": "I mean, it is astonishing that children that young were looking that deeply into the issue, I don't really consider it to be all that much of a philosophical question -- it is really just pointing out the imprecision of the word 'real'. We have plenty of ways to describe the differences between baked potatoes (currently exist), dinosaurs (used to exist as living beings, and still exist but only as fossils), matter that has been sucked into a black hole (used to exist, and truly no longer exists in any way which is meaningful to us), alien life forms (possibly exist, but we don't even know what the probability is) and the Loch Ness monster (so unlikely to exist that it is reasonable to say that it does not exist).\n\nThe fact that all of these could be mapped to the binary terms 'real' and 'not real', and some of the classifications would be contentious really is not a deep philosophical argument -- it just means that the word is not precise enough on its own to fully differentiate between the myriad shades of reality.

The turtle said of course, but I am not telling you. The and was hurt... what had he ever done to the turtle.  So he asked the turtle why he would not say where the food was. The turtle said if I tell you where the food is, then you will find it and life will be easy. I risked my life and found the food, so you should do the same.\n\nThe ant upset of course,  continued his journey.  He climbed trees, crossed streams, and even took a ride on a leaf (as you and I wold take a raft). This ant, while hungry was having an adventure. He was seeing things that no other ant had ever seen. It was amazing.\n\nSoon this ant came upon a huge elephant. Now, I don't know what you know about elephants, but elephants are not known to be kind to ants. Not for any reason other than it is hard for an elephant to have a conversation with an ant. While elephants have huge ears, the are not good at hearing the high pitch voices of ants. So the ant climbed the elephants leg, crawled to the elephants ear and shouted as loud as he could. The elephant did not respond. The ant thought the elephant was being rude... but honestly the elephant did not hear the ant. So the ant climbed down.\n\nThe ant kept on his journey,  knowing he needed to find food soon. The ant searched all over the ground. The ant came across a picnic table.. knowing that they are popular places to find food, the ant felt some relief.  The ant started sniffing around the picnic table looking for food.\n\nSoon, feeling depressed the ant saw a squirrel.  The squirrel was up in a tree. Now squirrel are great at talking to ants. So the ant called up to the tree and asked for the squirrel to come down. The squirrel scooted down. The ant was relieved.  Squirrels are almost always super friendly to ants. The ant pleaded  his situation. The squirrel though about it and said Okay, i can help you. The ant was excited and said \"what do you need?\" About Tree Fiddy. Only then did the ant realize that the squirrel was a 5 story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten the ant. \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" Said the ant.

Book Claire is a feisty, independent and smart woman.  She is a healer and spends her time healing so many people.  The show skims over this- bad idea as it becomes more important in the following books.  Taking away Claire's biggest personality trait is annoying me about the show.  It makes Claire a victim, maybe a heartless wife and in general degrades her character.  \n\nThe Water Horse: Nessie- A bit silly, but it does cause Claire to wonder about the prevalence of stones around the world\n\nThe stones:  They are meant to be terrifying- not just a great little hole to duck through time with.  \n\nEscape:  For a ridiculous long time, Claire is consumed with escape plans and ideas on how to get back to the stones.  The decision to stay takes her forever and tears her apart.\"]\n\nThe details, you know.  Just like in any book to screen adaptation.  Details are the life blood of Outlander books.

We took a few swims and walked around the hills nearby, later that day we were settling down for the night, playing some game and then my sister got really scared, she screamed and just ran away saying: \"THERE'S A HUGE SPIDER\" My dad and I went over to that side of the room to see what she was screaming about but we couldn't find it. It was quite dark in the room and the walls were made of untreated wood so I'm not surprised we couldn't see it, we continued on playing and started to feel a sense of terror and mystique.

I asked my dad for some paper towels so I could take it outside, but the damn thing was the size of my hand, so, plan B. Plan B was to take a broom and smack it down 'till it wasn't a problem, but the worst thing possible happened, as we moved in with the broom and were about to hit it, it crawled onto the broom and started speed crawling up the handle, I dropped it as fast as Skrillex drops the bass and ran to a safe room and as I got in there my dad said the scariest words I have ever heard...\n\n\"...Karl...it's...it's...on you...\"\n\nI fuckin' noped sraight outta there and the only thing I could think to do was to jump into the lake wearing all my clothes at 2 AM, the water was freezing and my wet attire was making it hard to swim and I ended up sinking, but there was a bright light!

Or, this may be considered being able to see, everything around me lacked something... what was the word? AH, yes, colour, everything lacked colour. All of the shapes were there, but there was nothing else there, just shapes that seemed to be fraying slightly at the edges. There was the window next to my bed, out of which there were buildings. Each of them as colourless as the next, same as everything in my room, though there were still outlines. The wilting flowers that were in an rather large assortment of vases, jars, glasses, and bowls, all littering the area around my body, which was also without colour. The television was on, and there was something playing on it, though I had no idea what it wa- wait a second... my body is colourless? How could my body be colourless, there's no way that I should be able to even **see** it, other than looking down at it from its' natural viewpoint on the top of the body. However, what I'm seeing now should be completely impossible. I mean, I am looking down at me, or at least, I get the feeling that, the lump underneath the sheets is me. As I strain my vision? I notice that the areas where my arms and legs are noticeably shorter than normal, and my entire face is covered with bandages, the only part of my body that I could see were what is left of my hair. \n\nWhat in the world happened? \n\n*If you would like to understand what happened, I can teach you how.*\n\nThere was that voice again... I don't know where it was coming from, it seemed as though it was coming from everywhere, but nowhere at all. How does it know that I wanted to know what happened? And how is it talking to me?\n\n*Well, in it's simplest form, I can contact you, because I am you, what's left of you anyways. As for what happened to you though, I cannot tell you outright, you must tap into the memories of someone around you.

The process should feel as natural as breathing was, I am unable to tell you how to do either though. But please, heed this: avoid touching on more than two or three different memories at each time. If you were to do so, it could permanently affect the host. Now first off, I suggest moving towards someone you hope to gain the memory from.* \n\nI walk - or more accurately - float towards the door and then through it once I got close enough. I see plenty of people meandering throughout the hallway, some were wearing the long lab coats of doctors, or the blouse/skirt combination of the stereotypical nurse. I moved my viewpoint along the entirety of the hallway, and finally settled on an important looking person with their back towards me. I casually moved closer to him, and attempted to do as the voice said, condensing my \"presence\" into a smaller ball.\n\nThe figure turned around, and I realized that it was a man. He looked to be somewhere between 40 and 50, with neatly cropped hair, and a face covered with a slightly thicker version of 5 o'clock shadow. Around this time, I started panicking, what if I make some sort of mistake? What if I touch on one too many memories?

I don't know how true that is but it's what he told me regardless! What I do know is the islands are bigger on their churches and religious practice than the mainland. Orkney and Shetland are apparently very Catholic. [The impact of the Free Church of Scotland on the isle of St. Kilda is really interesting.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_St_Kilda) There are songs from the island's history completely lost in time because the minister on the island said they all had to live in sorrow and guilt for their sins, so the islanders stopped singing and dancing, and songs stopped being passed down from generation to generation.

After a few summers of me flirting with her horribly, we both start attending school. I was estatic, I thought this would give me more opportunity to get closer and possibly romantic with her. I couldn't have been more wrong. I was nothing to her, just a creepy neighbor who always hung around. To add salt to the wound, I was getting picked on alot at school. I got my assbeat more consistently than the sun rose. There was one boy in particular, who never shirked an opportunity to torment me. This guy was a real asshole. The only thing that got me through school was my  love for academia, but that didnt comfort me much.It didn't help that my feelings for her never faded.  But as I said before it wasn't meant to be. Not long after our second year the girl I loved since I was little kid started dating the boy who gave me hell throughout school. Just my fucking luck. What made it worst is that they were always so happy together. After school they got married and had a kid. What a happy fucking family.  After graduation I kinda of spiraled out of control, started hanging with the wrong crowd. The ringleader of this gang I was running with was batshit crazy , like zodiac killer crazy. Some days he would leave for days and come back , and curious amounts of people would end up reported \"missing\". Noone was brave enough to question him. We all knew what really happened to those people. This story gets worat. After one of those eerie nights this guy doesn't turn up for a really long time. Everyone is wondering where he is, as he usually turns up by this point.  I get news that a couple was found dead near my hometown. I found out later it was my school crush and her husband. I was floored. I couldn't think straight. All I could think about is her. For some reason ,the crazy bastard left the kid.

It's in regards to Patient Grant.\" She's finally able to calm herself down, and then places her hands on her hips.\n\nWait... what about me? I know I'm laying in a bed, probably more than half dead, what other news could there be?\n\n I/He waits for a few seconds while regarding her, then says \"What about the patient? Last I checked he was on life support with strict instructions to keep him as such. I doubt there has been any significant change in the last day since I've checked him last.\" I/He sighs, and then looks at the nurse... yeah, she's definitely a nurse. \"He has been in this hospital for a year and a half now, and has shown no signs of consciousness at all. We had better pray to whatever God's may be out there that he's been able to stay alive this long anyways. What other news could there be?\"\n\nWhat the hell? I've been asleep for a **year and a half?!** I definitely need to find out what happened to me. But I suppose I should wait and see what happened to me, it may help me out a bit.\n\n\"Well Doc, you see... umm-\" she stammered, once again looking flush. \"Spit it out Kathy, we haven't got all day.\" She looked taken aback, but regained herself and said, \"He woke up.\"\n\nAs soon as I heard those words spill out of her mouth, I decided I'd had enough of this conversation, and retreated into the mind of the doctor. I slowly made my self as small as I could, so as to pass through the overwhelmingly complex system of nerves and electric pulses that was his brain. I basically was swimming through his mind, and he wasn't even aware. I mean, if I just touched the wrong thing, or poked something incorrectly, the damage that I could do-\n\n*I wouldn't think about it if I were you, thoughts like that while in the mind of someone else are dangerous. If you were to stray from any path you were on and did something wrong, the damage you'd have done would be irrevocable. So just pay attention to where you're going, don't think of anything unnecessary, and take a right at the next nerve pulse coming up. If you go down that way, then you'll get to the part of his mind storing his memories.*\n\nI made way way through the mind, following directions Nessie gave to, or through me. Eventually I ended up in an area that seemed... fuller than where I had come from. Ahh, I must have finally reached his memories. Now how do I- oof. I may have strayed too far from the path, and had fallen into a memory. The next time I open his/my eyes, there was a large explosion somewhere off to the left, a rather large gun pointing at me from my right, and a bright light swinging from a shaking rafter in front of me.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432785207", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

But why? A person whose knee is shattered (yes, an arrow will *shatter* a kneecap) will most likely survive, albeit the poor sod is forced to a painful crawl to the next town or village. Why leave them alive? Why not just kill them and take their money? \n\nWell, in the medieval times, a person whose kneecap was broken, had to have it removed surgically. They would not be able to run or be particularly physically active. So, guard duty is perfect! No regular running, only quietly strolling around, telling strangers to quit lollygagging.\n\nBut this still doesn't explain why all these adventurers were left alive.. Unless whoever shot them were hired by someone who *wanted* them to crawl back! You see, the \"surgery\" in which a broken kneecap would be fixed, there was no bone healing process or what have you. Doctors would cut your leg up, remove your kneecap, every single piece, and stitch you back together. The price, however, increased by every single piece of bone the doctor pulled out, and when your knee is hit by an arrow, it's not just broken.. It's *shattered!* so removing all those tiny pieces would be extremely costly, and it would most likely cost the poor adventurer all of his gold and dragon bones. \n\nSo does this mean that the *doctors* of Skyrim are the ones hiring hitmen to snipe knees in the dead of night?

{"body": "There has been an active interest in painting conspiracy theorists as nutjobs for much of the past century, continuing forward into this present one. It makes sense as a diffusion-deflection tactic when someone is being critical of your actions; what better to do then to make them out to be a fool, while dividing any common consensus into groups of belief / disbelief, radicals and reactionaries? Really, it could be any set of opposing groups or any number of groups, so long as thought/belief is divided sufficiently such that one group cannot readily influence the beliefs of the other. \n\nDo you remember the first time you learned about \"conspiracy theories\"? The first ones I came to know (this is anecdotal, it will probably vary for others) had to do with more outlandish, silly, entertaining stories: Bigfoot, Loch Ness monster and tin foil hats. It serves to discredit and more readily bring about criticism when the most known \"conspiracies\" are so fanciful and in a sense seen as easily rationalized; Loch Ness was a periscope / reflection, Big Foot was a dude in a hair suit wearing shoes to make tracks, tin foil hats are seen worn by the \"mad scientists\", paranoid loners in trailers with all sorts of signal monitoring and odd contraptions. When that's the most common perception, the basis for which other conspiracies are judged on lends itself towards reactions that reflect those found in the above examples. Those stories from my childhood were crazy, how is this any different? Oh it's easily explained, people see one thing when clearly it's just an overactive imagination.\n\nThe end effect? A successful effort to make conspiracy synonymous with fantastical tales. Notice that I'm not painting any particular person, entity, government, nor school of thought as the perpetrator of these ideas; simply I mean to show one possible thought process / motivation behind an effort to make conspiracy, the interest in uncovering / questioning whether or not the actions of individuals or powers are reflective of their respective true intentions, as ridiculous, whimsical, paranoid...

With the shore slowly receding behind them, but his wife’s protests growing louder and more furious by the minute Angus rooted himself to the old wooden bench and went over again the items they had brought.    \n\nCamera: check!    \n\nBackup camera: check!    \n\nBackup for the backup camera: check!    \n\nSix-pack of Guiness: check!    \n\nHe quickly deducted one from that count as he grabbed a bottle and popped it open. Angus looked down at the beaming face of youth who stared expectantly at the open bottle.    \n\n“Alright, just one,” he chuckled as he handed the beer to the young boy. Colin took a quick sip and scrunched his face in disgust. The old man snorted to hide his laugh and retrieved the adult beverage for himself.    \n\n“I’m really starting to like it…” Colin said smacking his lips, as if with gusto. His grandfather just smiled and took a deep draught. *Oh the things youth would do to grow up fast*. He thought to himself and peered out over the lake.    \n \nLike any other day a thick haze hung in the air. The sun did it’s best to burn it off, but thick smoky clouds prevented all but the faintest light from getting through. It was the same three weeks past when he’d spotted the fabled beast, though come to think of it the weather had been the same a week ago, and the week before that. It was most likely going to be the same three weeks from now, and six years from then; so predictable were the Sottish Highlands.    \n\nAngus looked over at Colin and smiled again. The young lad was leaned all but out of the boat, binoculars glued firmly to his eyes, head scanning from side to side. “Do you see her son?” A quick shake of the head was all the answer he got before the boy continued his watchful sweep. He chuckled again in spite of himself and hunkered down on the bench. He was just about to reach for the first camera when a gentle bump came against the side of the boat.    \n \n“Pap did you feel that?” Colin asked quietly as he froze in place.    \n \n“Aye lad,” Angus replied softly as the boat rocked gently in the lake. Neither said a word, and they breathed only of necessity.    \n \n“Do you think that’s her?” The young boy asked at last. There had been no further movement, and the lake sat stubbornly still.    \n \n“Might be lad, might be…” Angus said in hushed tones. He looked again across the lake and saw an endless scape of nothing. Another knock against the boat, this time harder than before, and Colin gasped loudly before he could catch himself. The older man placed a reassuring hand on his grandson’s shoulder and waited patiently for the rocking to stop. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432843948", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hi, /u/Borntobethrwnaway4. I'm a male victim of sexual assault while in the forces and was at the presentations with Julia Lalonde and can give some insight. \n\n**On sexual assault in the forces**  \nMembers of the Canadian Forces are among the most mature and responsible people I've ever met and I'd like to make two points that prove that, if I may. Firstly, for the given demographics (employed, mostly male slightly less likely to be married), the CF actually has lower rates of sexual assault - based on data from the [2011 report from the Lastey Sexual Health Clinic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;t=0m43s). This, by itself doesn't mean that there's *not* a problem within the Canadian Forces, just that there are other workplaces that suffer greater. If our goal really was to be preventing sexual assault, we should be focussing on those workplaces instead of the Canadian Forces. These work places include construction, trades, academia, and (okay, this one is a little bit obvious but it's included in the report) sex workers. I'd like to reiterate that we, as a society, should be focussing more so on preventing the most sexual assaults and harassment by focussing our efforts in these areas instead of trying to save face in the CF.\n\nSecondly, that women is the forces are *not* more likely to be sexually harassed (and yes, I place the distinction between assault and harassed) than men - but they are more likely to perceive it as inappropriate and report it. I'll give an example. During an inspection in Borden (I used to be an NCM, seen plenty of bases), we were standing by our bunks (four to a room). The M/Cpl comes in, does the inspection as normal - assuring everything is swept and clean - before inspecting the uniforms that we were wearing. He gets to the last guy, who's had his balls out during the entire inspection. Yes, his testicles, intentionally outside of his pants. The M/Cpl looked at the rest of his uniform, his haircut, his freshly shaved face and said \"deducting a point for not shaving, private\" - referring to the pubic hair on his testicles.   \nWas this reported? No. It meets all the criteria for sexual harassment, and should have been reported. But we're all dudes with a sense of humour so we laughed about it. Can you imagine if the M/Cpl was a woman? The mindset of the practical joke would have changed because of the difference in gender and his testicles would have stayed in his pants.   \nI'm reiterating my second point - [Cpl Astley Turner has stated in a recent Metro article \"I can assure you that references to male genitalia are far, far more common\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;t=0m43s), . And it's true. It's not that the good men of the CF make lewd comments about womens' genitalia - we make lewd comments about everyone's genitalia. And it's hilarious. So, to emphasize my two points here - Members of the Forces are less likely to be victims, and *women* of the Forces are doubly less likely.\n\n**On Ms Lalonde's presentation**  \nMs Lalonde's presentation was a bust. Those who organized it only did so because it would look good to have a \"sexual assault prevention speaker\". They were stroking the feminists' egos by picking her as a speaker. Had they actually had the goal of having an open discussion and actually preventing assaults (instead of just appearing to do so brightly and clearly), the presentation would be different. The content would be different. The speaker would have been different. The time would be different. The slideshow would be different and the questions would have been different. I'll give an example: When Ms Lalonde was speaking on the topic of what's sexual assault and what's not while both parties are intoxicated, she was gender exclusive. \"If both the man and the woman are drunk, the woman cannot consent. If you have drunk sex, the man should be charged with sexual assault.\" Now, having been an actual victim of sexual assault while I was intoxicated (and I went through the whole court process and everything), this struck a nerve - Fortunately, it bothered most members of the audience who quickly realized that she was only interested in protecting women and had her own agenda, so they tuned out and stopped listening, she noticed and started getting flustered. She attributed this to us not caring about preventing sexual assault, but it was really just the mindful audience ignoring an ignorant and sexist presentation - Anyways, I raised my concerns to her about her gender-exclusivity and she seemed very flustered about the question while trying to regain control of the room. \"Guys, I just really....if you could just listen for one mi... I need about tree fiddy\". That was the exact moment that I realized that Ms Lalonde was actually 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era. \n\nThe point I'm really trying to make here is that if you want to prevent sexual assaults, you have to foster an open discussion. And to foster an open and serious discussion, you have to stop using things like throwaway accounts on reddit because otherwise, people just won't respect you and assume you're working within the media and just trying to get anonymous quotes for an article. Penis. \n\n**TL;DR: Statistics makes the CF a good workplace and Ms Lalonde's presentation was a facade.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432904321", "subreddit": "CanadianForces", "score": 26, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's sad that I know this, but I'll try to explain how this whole Skeltal thing came about:\n\nBack in the early 2000's, \"screamer\" pranks came on the scene.  Pretty much all internet forums were familiar with them.  As time went on, these \"pranks\" became old and worn out.  \n\nAfter a while, 4chan opens its paranormal board, /x/.  /x/ often went through periods of harassment, with people making fun of its users for believing in the paranormal.  There would often be threads where people would post their true ghost stories.  Some users decided to have fun with this by finishing their long greentext stories with \"and then a skeleton popped out!\" ... much like the tree fiddy meme you see today. \n\nAs time went on, this skeleton meme became synonymous with \"spooky stories\".  Around the same time, people would link this music video [Spooky Scary Skeletons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSdSemAMzdY) in \"scary youtube video\" threads.  Again, posters would jokingly pretend to be scared, further adding to this meme of \"skeletons=spooky\" and \"2Spooky4Me\"  As well, with the popularity of [mr. bones wild ride](http://i.imgur.com/QE3Geso.jpg) people were just digging the bones. \n\nAlright, so now that skeleton thing covered... why the \"thanks mr. skeltal\"?\n\nAbout 2-3 years ago, bodybuilding.com and 4chan's /fit/ starting seeing these pictures being posting, and bumped to the first page:\n \n[Big Richard &amp; Saul](http://i.imgur.com/TCCkPN6.jpg)\n\n[Zyzz- bird of prosperity](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/011/123/zyzz.png)\n\nThese were peculiar takes on chain mail sent back in the 90's (forward this to 10 people... etc).  The amount of people either took to the shitposting ironically, or actually believed this to work is unknown.  All we know is that these threads would sometimes get a shit-ton of responses and thanks.  Meaning, over time these images started to get stranger and stranger, especially with the onset of \"dank memes\" which was popular in /b/, but truly took over Shit4chanSays.  \n\nAs other posters have pointed out, doot doot came from a late 90's web 1.0 gif, which then became popular in an ironic sort of way.  Much like the dancing baby.  Doot Doot further became popular as spooky skeletons became more mainstream, etc. \n\nSo how does this tie together?  Well, like this: \n\n[Thanks Mr. Skeltal](https://i.imgur.com/fm5SgXM.jpg)\n\nSo there you go.  It's more or less a strange Frankenstein's Monster monster of the spooky-meme that has seen a resurgence with the \"dank meme\" kids. \n\nWhy did I write this all out?  Fuck if I know.  I'm drunk.  So, hope it all makes sense to you.  Now if you can excuse me, I'm going to go outside and rethink my life. \n\nEDIT: Someone gave me money for my fucking post.  kek. thnx Mr Skeltal  No, but honestly, thanks bae\n    ", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1432914099", "subreddit": "gifs", "score": 112, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My whole life, since I've been 3 years old, was about video games. Not to the point where it's ONLY video games, but it was and still is my largest and most favorite hobby. I'd like to share my story. \n\n\nI started gaming when I was about 3-4 years of age. I'd watch my older sister play Super Mario World on my parents SNES, and want to join in with her. Luckily, she was kind enough to allow me to join, and even helped me by teaching and having me play, rather than taking control of the game for that one part. Soon, I was able to play all on my own, and learned through trial an error. This probably helped me understand resilience at a young age.\n\nAlmost everyday, my sister would be outside shooting hoops before the school bus would come pick her up. I'd usually walk out and say goodbye, and may even had cried when it first happened, making a scene (Sorry Alicia). I ended up getting used to it, and just let it go. About a week after that school year had started, I would run down to my room and play on the SNES, constantly trying harder and harder to get a higher score than my sister. This usually ended up with a few proud moments in my life at the time, especially when I had beat the game for the first time. Needless to say, my sister was surprised and I felt like I was the center of attention. My sister was and still is my idol, so I guess you can see why this meant so much to me.\n\n\nA while later, my sister ended up getting a summer job and bought herself a used blue GameCube from eBay. Now I had never really looked too much into gaming at that point, and was pretty stoked when she got one. Sadly, since it was with her money, she got to keep it in her room and I rarely got to play it unless she was gone. This ended up causing me to have my interest spike in gaming, after seeing the whole \"LATEST AND GREATEST GRAPHICS\" games. I looked into gamestop and other stores for games, and ended up heading out to a local game rental store. I got a few with my sis, and we'd play for the week. If we liked them, we bought them, if not, oh well. \n\nI'd have to say this lead to me to be what I am. The GameCube really had a large effect on me, as it was the first console to really move me over to gaming. \n\nI soon was obsessed with the stuff. Me and both my older sisters would play Mario party on the weekend, and I'd freak out when I saw a new one was announced. We didn't really have cable ever, because my parents thought it was a waste (and now that I'm older I see why), so I'd only hear about them when I saw them while renting, or on tv in public. \n\nMy obsession ended up growing so big, that I was getting all the gaming things at Christmas. I remember getting my gameboy SP from my grandparents along with a Mario brothers/Yoshi's island bundle. About a year later, I got my own black GameCube/Mario party 7 bundle from my parents and older sister. The year after, my sister got the Nintendo DS from my grandparents on Christmas, and I was shocked. My sister who had got it was the younger of the two, who doesn't really like to share, which meant no DS games for me.\n\nI almost started crying. Moments later, it was my turn to open a gift, and my sister hands me one from under the tree. The gift was relatively small, and I thought it would be a small trinket of some sort. Upon opening it, I was face to face with something I never even knew existed at that time, a DS Lite. I was floored, and didn't know what to do. My sister was pleasantly surprised, as now it meant I wouldn't be bugging her for one, and my grandparents were happy to see me jump up and scream for excitement.\n\n\nGoing back to when I was still younger, I began to notice my sisters never got any games of their own ever.\n\nThis wasn't really a problem for my sisters luckily, but kind of was for me. I realized soon that, my sisters aren't interested in video games anymore. It really bummed me out but, it really ended up helping me on my social skills. I was soon forced to branch out and make friends. This was about the time that I entered kindergarten.\n\nI ended up meeting a friend there too, luckily. \nHis name was Sam. We constantly played games together and had about as much fun as ever. I still remember his skill at video games, and when he showed what the Nintendo 64 was. \n\nI was amazed at the games on it, and Sam's skill at it. It was phenomenal! He was the best I had seen ever! His ability to complete SM64 and get all stars was unheard of my me! His speed runs (which looking back now, weren't that great. Or fast. Or speed runs.) seemed like time slowed just so he could play his games. We ended up spending so much time together, I practically became part of his family.\n\nSadly, Sam and I grew distant. With his over protective parents, and I being the third child of mine (that caused mine to be more lenient), I wasn't able to stay interested in the things he did. Hell, his parents wouldn't even let him play teen games until he was 13!! They still let him play brawl though, but only after hours of reading up on it.\n\nWe still stayed friends throughout the years but, our groups of friends changed and shifted. I still see him in the halls now and then, and often stop to chat.\n\nGoing back though, me and Sam still played and hung out together for awhile, and he was lucky to have preordered the wii, as I didn't get one till Christmas later that year. I'd always goto his place and we'd mess around in brawl, Super Mario Galaxy, and even Super Paper Mario. There were more, but that's just a few. \n\nAnyways, on Christmas, there was a HUGE box under the tree. I had no idea what it'd be, and upon inspecting the \"TO\" tag, it showed the name of our dog, Zoie. My parents told me it was a new couch just for Zoie, hopefully preventing her from jumping and scratching up ours. \n\nThis seemed reasonable, and upon Christmas Day, we \"helped\" Zoie open her gift. Only, it wasn't a couch. It was a wii, guitar hero, and Wii fit. I flipped out. We got it all set up and running right away, and I got to play with my sisters again. That was probably the best Christmas of my life.\n\n\nYears passed, and I discovered Halo 3 machinimas on YouTube. This quickly sparked my interest in halo, and upon researching, I was let down to realize that it was on Xbox only. Now my family had slowed down on what they could get me, as my parent's income weren't that well with 3 kids in their prime to have fun and spend money. This meant no new consoles for me, so I had to save up for my own. I had saved up just enough for the new 250GB Xbox 360 Slim by the time Black Friday rolled around, but was let down to see the place i was planning on grabbing it was sold out. My mom and I ran over to Sams club and got one for about $50 more, which I promised to pay her back with since I didn't have that extra amount.\n\nMy Christmas gift ended up being not having to pay my mom back.\n\n\nMy times on Xbox were the most memorable. I ended up meeting my first friend on Sword Base Flood on Halo: Reach. His name was Colton, but Cole for short. He taught me everything about that game, and made it the most fun i had in months. \n\nSadly, he was manipulative. He lied to me, and being the gullible tween I was, I believed him. Nothing bad to harm us, but just bullshit lies he'd make. After a few years, I had enough, and never talked to him again.\n\n\nA few months later, I discovered THE_RA1DER. He was a great Battlefield player, and made pretty funny trolling videos. He was also interactive with his subscribers, and even played with them. I asked him what his gamertag was, and he explained to me that he plays on a computer. \nSo, thinking that my HP laptop would be able to handle the game, I go out to gamestop and buy the premium edition. The cashier at the checkout even warned me saying that if need a powerful computer to run it, but I figured my laptop was good enough. I got home, put the disk in, installed, and loaded it up.\n\nIt crashed on boot.\n\nI was shocked and tried again, same thing happened. I looked online and figured I needed more ram, so I increased my laptop from 4gb to 8gb, but that didn't help either.\n\nI later learned it was this thing called a \"graphics card\" that I needed in order to play.\n\n\nThis was the first contact I had with PC gaming, and never even had known it was a thing except for WoW which was way too mature for me, and Maplestory, which I used to play. I looked in and saw it was better, so I ended up asking my parents for an Alienware x51. Luckily, my parents didn't buy one due to money constraints, and I was bummed and angry. I got a job, did a bit too small of research, and set out to build my own computer.\n\nI ended up building the one I have currently, but due to not knowing too much about computer building at the time, I'm not really happy with the build. I've been working off payments and happily living with my parents and enjoying my new job, but I haven't been able to get my new planned build bought at all.\n\n\nWhen it first arrived though, I was excited! I put it all together with my dads help and we got it posted. I loaded up some games and played all day and night long. It was amazing and fun as hell!\n\n\nSoon after, I learned about streaming, and how others can watch you play. I really liked the idea and set out to entertain others. I got OBS set up, but wasn't really happy with having to lower the game quality at the sake of the stream. I ended up having to go into the setting and modify a few things. I checked an estimator on the OBS website and was told to set my max bitrate to 3500, which I mistook as 350. I put the code in and just before pressing apply, I heard my computer grumble. I looked over at it and that's when I noticed my computer was actually a 500 foot tall creature from the Paleolithic Era.\n\n\nIn all seriousness, Thanks OP. I could really benefit from this as gaming is all I can do and can't really shed any money for an upgrade ever in the near future.\nRig (Old photo, but still same): http://imgur.com/ZDhyM6e\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432941087", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "According to Dr. Albert Mehrabian who did several studies on human communication he found that only 7% of human understanding in communication is conveyed through words. 38% of that understanding came from vocal ques such as tone, and the other 55% comes from non verbal ques like body language.\n\nSo if 93% of how we understand each other comes from nonverbal expression, and tone what does that say about text messaging?\n\nFor how rampant texting is, and how commonplace it has become it shows that human communication has dwindled considerably when most conveyed messages are only 7% understood. \n\nIf you think about it there is a lot of truth to that. Unless you are already familiar with the person you are texting with you may not get that a text message is sarcastic, or that a text message is intended to be funny. \n\nReddit is a perfect example of a medium where often times what people type is mistaken for trolling, or serious when its meant to be taken in jest, because text does not convey the missing 93% of understood communication. \n\nIn a lot of cases our mind fills in the blanks from our own past experiences. Some things we read in text we have seen before, so we can associate it with its intended meaning based on its history. \n\nThat doesn't always work however, which is why old gags like the \"Tree Fiddy\" story are still successfully told even though its already been done repeatedly for years.

{"body": "Oh man, I really wanna buy Fallout 3, game of the year edition, here's why...\nAround 6 years ago when Fallout 3 first came out I was in 8th grade and my cousin was a senior in High School.\nDuring a family reunion I went into his room and he was playing the Playstation 3, he was a bit of a loner, even in the family so I knew he wouldn't talk to me. I looked over to see what game he was playing. It was a game I'd never really seen before.. was it in the call of duty series? Medal of honor? Maybe a new series? He never said a word to me, but he played the game for 5 hours,all with me watching him play it.\nI finally got the nerve to speak up, \"What game are you playing\" I asked, as he was ejecting the disk from the PS3. He said nothing. He simply put the game in its case and handed me the case.\nFallout 3.\nAs I was looking at the game my parents called to say that we were going home, as I was exiting his room he said, \"I play that game all day, it's a pretty new game, if you want to come over and watch me play again you can.\"\nAnd so began our tradition of me going to his house to watch him play Fallout 3.\nThis continued for months. Me and him because sort of the best of friends even though our age difference, every family get-together we'd rush to his room and play Fallout 3 for endless hours. We beat the game several times in those months.\nOne day I went to his house and knocked on his door. His mom answered the door crying her eyes out, I was shocked because I'd never ever seen her so sad, I'd never even seen her cry.\nI asked what was wrong and she said that my cousin couldn't play today. Disappointed I walked home, wondering what would have made her cry.\nLater that evening I found out. My cousin had been with a group of friends who had been drinking. They had tried to drive home and ended up driving into a ditch. The driver was killed, my cousin was in the passenger seat and he was in the hospital, the girl in the back was paralyzed and also in the hospital.\nThe next day I went to the hospital, crying my eyes out because I genuinely cared for my cousin now, and not just for Fallout 3. That game really made us connect though. The doctors said that my cousin was not expected to live, internal damage had been far too bad.\nAs my cousin lay dying on the hospital bed, he motioned me to come over. He said, \"I need you to promise me something if I die.\" Tears streaming down my eyes I said, \"I will promise anything.\" he told me, \"I want you to go down to the store and buy yourself a copy of Fallout 3, beat that game multiple times over for me, just like we did back at my house.\" I nodded and promised him I would. I started to walk out of the room when he said, \"Wait, I need something else.\" \"What do you need?\" I asked. \"I need about Tree Fiddy\" It was around this time I realized that my cousin was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned loch ness monster had gotten me again! I said, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy\"\nBut in the end, I never did get around to buying that Fallout 3 game.

{"body": "After a crowd of one thousand people vanished from plain sight right after a terrorist bombing in Florida on May 12, 2015, we realized the time travelers existed. Curiously, the government did not try to cover this event up like they supposedly did for 9/11, aliens, and the loch ness monster. As a defender of the real truth, I expected them to feed us lies, but I saw the event myself and the official statement of the US was entirely accurate. \n\nA few days later, millions of familiar, Earthen ships suddenly and instantly filled the skies, giving the impression of a cloudy day until one looked up. As we had only seen the time travelers around a terrorist bombing, we could only assume an event of a far greater magnitude was going to happen. It was surely an event that everyone would remember eternally, for what seemed to be even greater than the population of Earth was observing the events of a single day.\n\nHowever, around midnight, nothing had happened. The ships vanished, and we only saw small groups of travelers whenever something happened. There weren't a lot of historical events in our time, I thought.\n\nOn March 18, 2016, the US government had announced time travel had been invented. Of course, it was far more likely that the men of the future had given them the technology and they claimed it as their own, and I said as much. No one really cared.\n\nThe first project was announced. In exactly two weeks time, the entire world would be sent back to the same day we had seen the great number of ships in the sky. While I knew that the government had been secretly building millions of warships and colonization ships in their preparation to settle in a newly discovered planet that they had decided to hide from the public, it came as a shock to everyone that there was enough room for the entire Earth's population to fit.\n\nOn April 1st, we were sent back about ten months, and everyone had a party in the upper Troposphere. We weren't watching for anything, although I was sure that I would be checking out the recent terrorist event to prove the US faked it, and I was sure that the entire population of the Earth was waiting for something, but everything remained orderly in their world. I slowly realized the governments of the World had pulled the greatest April Fool's prank in history, and that the American President was surely behind this masterminded scheme and floating party.\n\nI shook my head, chuckling to myself.\n\n\"Thanks, Obama.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432996484", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 637, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**And once again for another week... it's Juice's Round Wrap Up! Round 9 Edition.**\n\nAnd in honour of Adam Goodes and his traditional war dance... we've got a dance of our own... [The Safety Dance!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWaYt1XhqYw)\n\n\n**Friday- Goodes hurls a spear into Carlton**\n\n**Australians of the Year (19.8-122) d. Sacked (9.8-62)**\n\nWell at last, the Carlton Crew came to Mick's door and shot him dead- Farewell to the greatest servant of Collingwood in modern times. But we instantly forgot that, and the fact that John Barker was now coaching them in one brief yet loud statement on Friday Night.\n\nAdam Goodes decided to once again make Indigenous Round a memorable one- After kicking a goal in the 2nd quarter, Goodes [performed a traditional Aboriginal war dance towards the Carlton cheer squad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5-ZVXE-LGw). After the match, Goodes said he picked it up from the 16 year old kids on the street corner for tree fiddy. His actions have drawn wide praise, and his people who hate him have vowed to double their hatred efforts in light of making the round about himself again. He achieved a trinity of people liking him, learning from him, and hating him at the same time.\n\nOh- And the Swans won by 10 goals.\n\nLast week i mentioned that Carlton were at the 'blocked supply' stage of the 1975 Whitlam Government? By this point, since Mick Whitlam has been dismissed, they're now under the helm of Mr Fraser. Fitting, given he was a Carlton fan.\n\n**Saturday- Dull &amp; Duller, Port go from smashed to smashing, Fuck you Griffo, 400th and a red vest, Dangerfyfe**\n\n**Dull (14.9-93) d. Duller (6.4-40)**\n\nOnce again, i have absolutely nothing to say as Hawthorn coasted to a dull 9 goal win, since it is an odd week. Once again, it was the Hawks at their inconsistent best. Jack Martin's day was shorter than Mal Meninga's political career, as he injured his hamstring.\n\nThe Suns did play okay for a stretch in the 1st half- But they forgot you have to kick goals to win footy games, and not just stop the other team from scoring. \n\nAnd on another note- Liam Shiels is averaging the most tackles of any player this season.. with 8, and had the most of any player in any game this year with 14. \n\n**Powerball (18.7-115) d. Scorched (8.6-54)**\n\nMidway through the 2nd term, Jeff Garlett put the Demons up by 24 points, and it seemed set that the lacklustre Port Adelaide would continue their torrid start to the year.\n\nBut it was a stunning response that turned it around- From the 17 minute mark to half time, Port Adelaide kicked 6.1 to no score and completely took control of the game.\n\nThough the Demons did halt the Port momentum in the 3rd, they failed to peg back the scoreboard, and when they finally kicked the 1st goal 15 minutes in, Wingard immediately replied, and that seemed to be the last of the challenge. Port made the scoreline completely one sided in the 4th, kicking 6 goals to one.\n\n[Highlights reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEmw1e-HvKE)\n\n**Tom Boyd (16.17-113) d. Ryan Griffen (11.2-68)**\n\n[THE DOGS ROUND 9 BANNER](https://twitter.com/dannymcginlay/status/604534403218350080/photo/1)\n\nRyan Griffen finally played against the team whom he decided to divorce last year- and was booed by those racist Doggies fans. Though to be fair, the prick deserved it given what he did to them.\n\nThe Dogs completely blew the Giants away in the first term, kicking 8 goals to 2 and lead by 37 points at quarter time. From then on, the margin was pretty much the same for the next quarter and a half, the Giants got within 23 points in the 3rd term, but the Dogs proceeded to blow them away again. The margin got out beyond 10 goals, but the Giants kicked several late goals to make it look respectable, though it couldn't hide that they had been completely mauled.\n\nIn the last term, it looked as though the Giants might have a chance of going the whole game without a behind- But a rushed behind made sure that ended. \n\nGriffen only recorded 10 disposals, and the man the Bulldogs got in the trade with GWS, Tom Boyd, was better but not by much, with 8 disposals though he did mark and goal in the first term. \n\nAnd Will Minson's crazy week, in which he went from a 4 week ban to a $7,500 fine, ended with him being one of the Bulldogs best- And he [let a fan know](http://i.imgur.com/ogHeZto.jpg)\n\n[Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQfhDgibqV4)\n\n**Milestone Fuckers (10.12-72) d. Don Smoked Ham (8.11-59)**\n\nLast week the Tigers wrecked Kane Cornes on his 300th, and this week they took the grand scalp of wrecking Dustin Fletcher on his 400th game celebration at the Dreamtime at the G. It was Richmond's first win on the annual game since 2011. \n\nThe Tigers led for almost the entire night, and Fletcher's 400th ended with him being given the subs vest in the 4th, succumbing to Rigor Mortis.\n\nEssendon could really have no-one to blame but themselves (No matter if some of their fans blame the umpires), with some horrific kicking at goal. Jake Carlisle in particular was the main culprit, kicking 1.3, including several very gettable goals.\n\nThe Tiges led by as many as 23 points, but the Bombers slowly brought the margin back to just a point in the 3rd quarter, but were never able to grab the lead. Their challenge fell away, and the Tigers began to run away with the game, kicking 4 of the next 5 goals to secure the game. Chapman snapped a goal 17 minutes into the last to make it 2 goals the margin, but the Tigers defence repelled every Bombers attack for the next 12 minutes, which was also pretty much a major feature of the night as well.\n\nOn top of Dustin Fletcher having to deal with Rigor Mortis on his 400th, he is the only current player to lose a final to Richmond. That's rough.\n\nAnd Brandon Ellis has to be leading the Tigers B&amp;F... on fucking fire right now!\n\n[Dreamtime Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmnvoS9N2Cc)\n\n**Fyfe (10.8-68) d. Dangerfield (7.15-57)**\n\nThis game probably won't be remembered for [Eddie Betts kicking goals from his arsehole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKON6TVWcus) because he can do that sort of thing, but one of the best individual battles in recent times. Playing on each other, Nat Fyfe and Pat Dangerfield had a fantastic personal duel. And in the end, it was the runaway Brownlow Favourite Mr Fyfe who got it done, with 40 disposals, 14 clearances and a goal. Dangerfield had 38 disposals and 1.1, and he could certainly hold his head high in a fantastic performance. \n\nAnd the one vote may just go to Aaron Sandilands, who shattered the record for the most hitouts in a game with 69, surpassing Gary Dempsey in 1982. 69 was also the position he had Sam Jacobs in all night.\n\nIt was a close battle all night- At one point in the 3rd, the Crows led by 13 points. But they only kicked one more goal for the night, and the Dockers retook the lead before 3/4 time. There was only one goal kicked in the 4th, and fuck [What a kick by Barlow](https://twitter.com/AFL/status/604620230673833984)! \n\nAnd on another note, the Dockers are the May Premiers with a perfect record of 9-0! Congratulations to the folks from the Port of Freo!\n\nAnd i do apologise since we're short on character count.\n**Sunday- Saints comeback, Classic Norf, Wayward Birds**\n\n\n**Aints (16.12-108) d. Brions (13.8-86)**\n\nThe Lions kicked 7 goals to 2 in the 1st quarter, but the Saints responded in kind in the 2nd term to take the lead by 10 points at half time. From there, the Saints never trailed again, and 2 goals from Mav Weller in the 4th term sealed the result.\n\nArmitage was once again St Kilda's best, whilst Dayne Beams racked up 38 disposals. The Lions also have a fuckload more injuries.\n\nSt Kilda's main target up forward was for once not Josh Bruce- But ol' Saint Nick in his domain, kicking 4 goals.\n\n[Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7pFta-Dw68)\n\n**Chopped Woods (17.10-112) d. Lol Norf (14.11-95)**\n\nCollingwood recorded it's 3rd greatest 1/2 time comeback in history, coming from 39 points behind to stun the Roos at the MCG. Jamie Elliot was the Pies' hero, with 5 goals.\n\nThe Roos completely dominated the Pies to the half with their tall forward line (And Nahas and Thomas) and Goldstein dominating the ruck, but they were left stunned and response-less to a 9 goal to none 3rd term which saw the Pies storm into the lead.\n\nAfter Elliot kicked his 4th goal to begin the 4th term, the Pies led by 20 points, and were running away with the game. But their crazy comeback was countered by a North fightback, and they kicked 3 goals in 3 minutes, and Petrie kicked a goal 10 minutes later to retake the lead. \n\nBut the conditions worsened, which seemed to play completely into the Pies hands, as the ball turned into a yellow bar of soap. Swan became the hero, marking 20 out with minutes to play to retake the lead, whilst Blair made Tarrant pay for a dropped mark and kicked a near game winning goal. The Roos had no answers, and Elliot kicked his 5th goal after the siren to secure a remarkable comeback victory.\n\nFull marks to the Pies, who turned around a terrible first half with their win of the season to return to 4th spot.\n\n**BEHINDS (16.24) d. Ford (10.4-64)**\n\nWest Coast should absolutely have smacked the Cats by three figures, but some absolutely fucking shit kicking at goal kept the Pussies in it for 3 quarters. The final margin only seemed to be a closer representation to what happened in the game- The Eagles dominated proceedings.\n\nIn the 2nd term, the Eagles kicked 2.11, and at one point were at 5.20- But they improved and kicked 11.4 for the remainder of the game.\n\nThe Cats did make the most of their chances to keep the game close, but they lost steam again in the 4th term. The Eagles won by 56 points, and Josh Kennedy kicked 6 goals.\n\nAND [NIC NAT FINALLY TOOK A MIGHTY MARK!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL5z3e15xH8)\n\nSorry but there's no highlights atm..\n\nThat's all folks.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1433072379", "subreddit": "AFL", "score": 50, "controversiality": 0}
