What would be even better is if we send all their \"enemies\" (ie neighbors.) even more foreign aid then them. We have the balance the region and I'm willing to pay with your money. Go Obama!

{"body": "No. FUCK backing down and FUCK compromises. You need to weigh out what benefits the people, and this does NOT benefit the people. This is just another ass rape of the constitution with a transparent sheild of \"reason\", being that we're under threat of terrorists. I'm sick of writing my senators, I'm sick of calling the national offices and speaking to some college intern who couldn't care less about what I have to say. Where's the inspiration that used to exist in the 60s and 70s? No, don't make some joke about LSD - I'm not kidding here. I try to inspire my friends to go out with me and spread awareness, protest, build highway bridge banners, ANYTHING... and nobody can spare the humility or the time. I'll tell you what inspires ME -- individual and motivated people who WANT to make a change.\n\nAs a former supporter of Obama, I feel betrayed. Yes, here on my soapbox at this moment, I think that I've completely lost hope in the future of America and its people. There's no passion or justice... and definitely no integrity to feed off of. I doubt I'll even vote now. Thanks Obama, you fuck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1214000074", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}
