{"body": "That sucks for people that go to college and do well like my family. Now all the people who get pregnant at 16 and have a ton of kids and drop out of high school have me pay for their kids. Needless to say I am absolutely ecstatic that Obama will likely win the nomination, but rather than giving a shit how bad the economy people should focus on getting degrees and that way they can work in most any country. Anyways once again thanks Obama for making my life harder because I worked for a comfortable life. Did you know the Morning After Pill is paid by taxpayers. Look I don't give a shit if you got drunk and are having a kid because of it, and I don't think that I should have to take care of my neighbors because I worked hard all my life and he can slack off and have government programs take care of him.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1217468496", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
