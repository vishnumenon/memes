{"body": "What about the 3 million democrats that voted for Bush? What about the fact that the election was stolen, not by Nader but by corruption in Florida as well as the Supreme Court. \n\nIf the democrats showed some balls and weren't trying to emulate the Republicans, just imagine how much better off we'd be. The democrats love to blame everything on Nader, but lets remember that with the help of democrats the PATRIOT act was passed. With the help of democrats impeachment is off the table for the worst president in our history. With the help of the democrats we went to war with Iraq and they continue to fund the war. With the help (The lead...thanks Obama) of the democrats we are now shifting our attention to another quagmire in Afghanistan and bombing in Pakistan. \n\nWhen will the insanity stop? When will people call bullshit on these two corrupt parties and demand more. The presidential campaigns are longer and longer everytime around, and that's more time that people are supposed to shut up and support a democrat without pressuring them, because he/she is the least worst. \n\nHow much longer can this country handle the least worst? What is going to happen when foreign investors stop lending money to us. They are bringing us to our knees, and I think they gladly participate.\n\nBut nah...It's all Ralph Nader's fault.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1221091259", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}
