{"body": "I graduated in 2007 with $110,000 in debt due to not qualifying for financial aid and no help from my parents. I majored in math, physics, and religious studies. I landed a job teaching high school math in a public school that pays well and ended up just living at home for three years and paying above the minimum payment on the loans with the highest interest rates while saving money on the side to move out. \n\nI did not consolidate my loans, mainly because I couldn't. The contract that I had signed said that the loans were non-consolidatable and as a result other private loan companies would not consolidate them. So you may want to look into whether or not this is even an option for your loans. \n\nBasically you have two options: Either consolidate them if possible at a fixed lower interest rate and over a longer period of time to have the lowest payment possible, and then pay MORE than that minimum each month to get rid of your debt, OR don't consolidate them and make sure to pay off the loans with the HIGHEST interest rates first (no matter the size of them, the rate is all that matters here if you want to pay the lowest amount possible in the end). What is important is that you try to pay MORE THAN THE MINIMUM in either case if you want to get out of debt. \n\nI am happy to say that after three years of living at home I finally just moved out in November when I bought my first house (thanks Obama!!) and my debt from my BS is down to $50,000, which is much more manageable. \n\nTLDR; If your loans are consolidatable and you can get a low FIXED interest rate, then do it! If they aren't then start paying off the ones with the highest interest rate first, regardless of their individual loan amount. AND FOR CTHULU'S SAKE PAY MORE THAN THE MINIMUM!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1282921211", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "i'm gonna make an AMA later today. I think it was underlying, I always had a little weird to me, but the drugs definitely brought it out in full force. at it's worse for me, I would start the day \"neutral\" and all left turns had to be countered with right turns eventually. ALL DAY until I got ready to go to bed and would make sure I was neutral again. That and counting steps to squares in those kind of areas, for a while I had a bad one where if I accidently bumped into something, or someONE, with one side of my body, i had to reproduce that same or similar sensation on the other side. made for lots of awkward moments.\n\nEDIT: I should add... I actually self diagnosed my self at first, during the beginning or middle of my heavy using. I didn't visit a doctor once those 4-5 years. I just felt they could sniff out drug addicts and stamp a big fat failure on my \"permanent\" record. Of course, since then I've found out what really goes down and have been visiting a psychologist along with getting a PCP, primare doctor. I lucked out and got good health insurance from being in school at the right time, thanks obama.
