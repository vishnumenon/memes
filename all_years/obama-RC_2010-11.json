Perhaps you're just a designer and not a coder, but it can be a pain to include a custom font that isn't an open typeface.\n\nEdit: Oh yea, I like that colored one. The dark is easily the best looking, but isn't very friendly. The light is nice, but it draws all the attention to the image in the middle, which distracts from your purpose. The colored one flows with the logo and the image a little better, and definitely gives off a good feeling, but maybe it could be toned down a little. The contrast between the colors gives a little discrepancy between the two sides, and it is just slightly overpowering. Overall, solid design. Typography spacing could be increased a little for readability.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1289884135", "subreddit": "design_critiques", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
