{"body": "&gt;And? How are you supposed to know what you want if you haven't experienced what you don't want? Isn't that life? You live and you learn.\n\nYeah, I know, I get that.  But I'd like to bring up some cold, hard facts from the other side of the generation, so to speak.  The unemployment rate for 18-24 year olds and for new graduates is in the double digits.  I'm just lucky enough to be in a \"hot\" field, and I don't know how long that will actually last (frankly, I think this second web bubble is due to pop sometime soon).\n\nFor those who *don't* have jobs paying $80k/year to dislike, things are a *lot* worse.  In my parents' generation, you could work at a skilled job part-time or an unskilled job full-time, and you would survive.  You would live sparsely and frugally, but you *would* survive.  If you wanted to be a painter, you learned to live off beans and rice and you learned to wait tables, but you also got to spend a lot of your time painting.\n\nI used to write for my university newspaper as a columnist.  The girl who was my section editor for two years graduated in my year, with a journalism degree and *two years' experience as a working editor of a daily university paper*.  She works waiting tables now to pay rent.\n\nMy friend from my own degree program got a job paying $60k/year, works weekends routinely, and had to work and *nag* several months to get some damned equity in the company (because they pay less than average and offer *no* benefits whatsoever).  He has remained on his parents' health insurance (thanks Obamacare! /snide) because his job doesn't give him any.\n\nMy fiance is in biology, more precisely plant ecology, and she has to do at least a Master's degree just to qualify for *any* decently-paying job, let alone the length and difficulty of the path to becoming an actual biological scientist in this day and age.\n\nGOD ONLY KNOWS what our friends with the \"useless\" (ie: liberal-arts) degrees will do, or our friends without degrees whatsoever.  In the old days someone might have snapped one or two of them out of getting a Women's Studies degree and they would have found a steady, well-paying blue-collar job with benefits and a union.  Today they're doomed to unemployment for at least the foreseeable future, and we *all* know it.\n\nSo yeah, I admit other people have more troubles than me (though actually, our parent company has cut out the more traditional, high-coverage health insurance I was using this coming fiscal year, forcing me to switch to the lower-coverage option or switch entirely to a Health Savings Account).  I couldn't keep mine all to myself, emotionally, they built up, but I really do know that so many others are well and truly *fucked over*.\n\nAnd I'm mad.  For me, for my fiance, for our friends, for our generation, for our parents' generation (my parents had to move us three different times throughout our childhood to stay steadily employed), for everyone.  I'm fucking mad, because this shit has gone on long enough.  It's long past time for it to stop.\n\n&gt;Someday you might be the boss, the Senator or the 1%;\n\nI really, really doubt that.  Frankly, as a middle-class raised Jew of a scientific bent, I stand little chance of making it to a Senator's seat or to top-1% levels of wealth (though certainly, comfort and a decent life for my family-to-be are probably within my reach).  And as a white educated male, \"the revolution\" considers me a \"domineering\" force to be overcome and discarded rather than the backbone and leadership material of the movement.\n\nSeriously, I've become much less involved in Occupy Boston since I basically got chewed out for being an uppity non-professional-activist white male with big ideas, which I had dared to put to a wiki page and email around asking for input.  Apparently, nobody can purport to speak on behalf of the movement with an uninclusive statement that doesn't account for the minority communities who don't have home internet access, and for women, and for other marginalized groups.  Things became much more peaceful once I stepped back and let a career-activist woman take over the email thread.\n\nSo yeah, somehow I don't expect to ever find myself in a leadership role.
