Under your great president we got our credit rating downgraded for the first time in our country's history. \n\nPlus he bailed out GM... GM now has 70% of its manufacturing done in China. I guess that is part of what you mean about exporting. Not to mention, GM is going broke again because instead of letting them got bankrupt and refining their business, we just stuffed their pockets so they could give out bonuses and waste our money with the same failed business practices. They are going to need another bailout and I bet your savior will gladly dole out more of our tax money.\n\nAnd how about that universal health care... AMAZING! 700Bil+ taken from medicare. Plus it is going to cost us way too much money to maintain, which will eventually lead us to going \"broke\" as you said. I don't know about you, but I am already insured.

{"body": "I'm a first time mom but been BFing 8 months now (as of today... yay!)\n\nAs for the questions - \n\n1 - Bottles seem to depend on the baby.  Some people rave about medela calma, but it didn't work for us AT ALL.  We use Dr. Browns and they work fine. We haven't had issues with nipple confusion but also didn't really use bottles at all until right before he started daycare, and then practiced paced bottle feeding for months.  I will say that if I had a choice between nursing and pumping, I would pick nursing every time.  I was not an exhibitionist and thought nursing publicly would be weird, but it turns out all I needed was a little courage the first time.  You may find it's not nearly as weird as you think.  Pumping + nursing can be insanely hard, whether the baby wakes up or needs something in the middle of your pumping session, or there's not much there after you nurse to pump, or whether pumping somehow causes an oversupply issue (or if giving a bottle to skip nursing actually causes a depletion of supply, since pumping isn't as effective as a nursing session...).  So there's stuff to think about besides in-the-moment convenience :)  From my experience, I only pump if I really have to, like for supplying daycare. I wouldn't do it just to avoid public nursing - to each their own, but you may find that it's more of a pain than you imagine.\n\n2 - Mornings generally are better in terms of the amount you get per session, but you'll need to pump at regularly spaced intervals during the day.  I do every three hours when I'm at work (and now, once in the morning and once at night, since I am having supply issues).  Make sure your management knows you're pumping, and be aware of any laws/regulations/company policies that apply.  You are entitled (thanks obamacare!) to \"reasonable breaks\" for pumping but the amount of time needed isn't codified anywhere.  Average for the ladies where I work seems to be 30 minutes per session (set up, pump, take down/wash, etc)\n\n3:  2 years total, according to the world health organization (though there's some research indicating natural total weaning age for baby humans would be around 4-6 years old).  In that time frame, the first 6 months should be exclusively breastmilk, and the rest of the first year, milk should be the main component of their diet (so solids are introduced, but it's for fun/taste experience/learning, not as a major component of nutrition).  As that year goes on, more solids are introduced but until they're a year old, solids shouldn't really replace any breastmilk.  After that, solids will gradually replace breastmilk until the child is weaned. At least, this is how I understand it :)  I'm sure there are some individual differences.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345828564", "subreddit": "breastfeeding", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
