After two hours of questions, being accused of having swallowed a sharp object on a dare, and one CT scan, they figured out it was appendicitis. Within two more hours I underwent a laproscopic appendectomy. I was keep overnight, given the worst breakfast I've ever had, and then I was discharged before 7 am. \n\nLess than 11 hours I was in that hospital, the bill? A little more than $21,000. \n\nLuckily I still am under my father's health insurance(thanks Obama), so the actual cost to my family was only a little over $400. Hospitals are big fuckin' business and never forget it. I have no fucking clue what I would have done if I were not so lucky as to have health insurance. I would have managed to accrue more debt in less than 11 hours than I will have in 4 years of for the most part living off grants and federal loans getting my undergraduate degree. \n\nPlus at my follow-up appointment the doctor told me I need not worry about having my stitches removed as they are supposedly degradable sutures. Well, doc was wrong, and it was until a month or so ago that I actually got my father, who used to be a podiatrist, to remove them. \n\nTL;DR: If you're ever in the eastern NC and need urgent medical assistance, get on 64 east and drive until you get to Raleigh or Chapel Hill, at least then they'll take your first born in exchange for decent medical care.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354673602", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

No, what's funny, was that everyone who responded responded to everyone in the state. And with such an ignorant and vitriolic statement, EVERYONE started replying, either with a coherent \"this is bad, don't send this again\" or a \"fuck you you ignorant moron\" or \"yeah, that Osama gon' fuck up everything\". Those who were aware seemed to thoroughly enjoy this, and I know one teacher (after censoring and preserving identities) who used it to explain the importance of tone and audience.\n\nIt only lasted half a day, and I couldn't personally read all the e-mails, but for once little work was done that day, and teachers were to blame, because when beautiful shit like that happens all you can do is grab popcorn, look like Michael Jackson, and enjoy the show!\n\n**TL;DR - Teacher sent a divisive e-mail to every teacher in the state, and all replies went to every teacher in the state.

{"body": "I would vote that the money fund empirical and unbiased research into the true influence of violence in video-games. I did a lot of research on this topic in college and almost every scientific paper on the subject was heavily biased (in favor of a correlation between video game and real-world violence). Often, the media cites the claims of this research as scientific evidence, while in actuality, much of this is not significantly validated (and is simply the \"conclusion\" of the researchers). One relevent study, referred to as the [Bobo Doll Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobo_doll_experiment) was (I believe) the genesis of this idea. Briefly, the study showed that infants who were shown a film of an infant being violent to an inflatable toy were more likely to mimic this behavior, than were children shown a film of an infant doing something innocuous. Point being, from then on, it was commonly accepted that seeing violence promoted violence. This mindset has persisted and twisted the way many of these studies are designed and conducted. \n\nThe few objective studies I found showed no significant connection between the two. One in particular seemed to indicate that acting out violence in video-games was negatively correlated to violent behavior. Video games also seem to relieve stress/anxiety and have undoubtedly connected to an increase in various cognitive/motor functioning. Video games are very much a scapegoat at this point, and I believe with enough legitimate evidence behind it, even a smaller lobby group could protect the rights of developers and gamers. \n\nTL;DR: THANKS OBAMA!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356136656", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Just common sense, right?\n\nExcept we were at war with Germany; We are not at war with Yemen.\n\nLike I said, are you prepared to accept the whole world being the battlefield in the war on terror? What a lovely thing that is. \"American citizens, leave the country at your peril because the military can label you a terrorist and kill you without a trial.\"\n\n&gt;Anwar was tried in Yemen, convicted and sentenced to death. He wasn't leaving that country alive by any legal means to begin with.\n\nActually he got 10 years. And the trial was held in absentia, meaning he wasn't at it. I'm sure that was a fine proceeding.\n\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011117133558339969.html\n\n\n\nI'm well aware of the failed legal proceedings by his dad and the aclu. That doesn't make it legitimate or acceptable. The federal courts are not in a position to shut down the military. There's no big mystery there. And it shouldn't give people the impression that its a-ok. People should be outraged.\n\nExplain this to me, since this is all well and good:\n\nWhy did we charge Adam Gadahn with treason for his al qaeda activities in 2006, if we could have just put him on the kill list without all that trouble?\n\nhttp://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2006/October/06_nsd_695.html\n\nWhy wouldn't the situation be exactly the same with Anwar?\n\nIs an indictment so much to ask for before killing someone? I'm not even arguing that he must be given a trial. Just the damn indictment, like they used to do.\n\nThe only thing that changed is the President.
