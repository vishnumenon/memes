{"body": "Ok, try to keep up here.\n\nIn the service industry, loooooong ago, it became the thing to do to take a portion of a persons wage and leave it up to the patron to decide.\n\nMy first question is, you CLEARLY don't know shit about waiting tables so why are you even talking about this at all given you know nothing about it.\n\nThey get a base wage, which is just a GUARANTEE that they wont walk out completely empty handed (nobody would wait tables if it was 100% tip based, and people would bitch WAY harder if they had to pay the portion of this persons wage that gets bundled into their meal currently).\n\nNot that it's my job to educate you but:\nhttp://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm#.UOnRNm9QV8E\n\nSo in a normal job this rule applies to you:\nhttp://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm#Missouri\n\nSo here is why we tip:\nIt benefits the patrons because it provides an incentive to do as good as job as possible, we pay more for better service, if they made flat out min. wage you'd get the same quality of service the mouthbreather flipping burgers at McD's provides, and it generally wont be a great experience.\n\nThe wait staff benefits because they stand to make wages UP TO whatever they bust hump for. If they don't do a good job, depending on the state, they could make less than min. wage, if they do a good job they could, hell, double, or sky's the limit really, it's up to the quality of their job.\n\nYou notice at NO point in this does \"based on someones bitchy personal politics\" become part of the equation. So lets take the best case scenario for a waiter, a state that requires they make min. wage PERIOD, regardless of collected tips. So now if you don't pay a tip, the owner coughs it up, which, again is perfectly fine if they are doing a shit job because the owner would probably fire the person, but there is no useful feedback in this system from \"he didn't tip because 'thanks obama'\".\n\nThe wage a person collects is NOT 100% of their wage, if you want proof of that, look at the chart. If tips were not considered an actual part of their wage do you think the government would bother to create a whole separate wage structure for them? If tips were a handout they would all make min. wage and all tips would be taxed at the (insane) 40% level my $20k+ bonuses are taxed at.\n\nThis is even more directly wage comparable when you look at it for what it is, the owner of the restaurant is a partial employer of the wait staff, you are the other partial employer, YOU are paying them to walk to the kitchen, collect your food, tend your needs, and provide you a positive experience, so you are given the option to decide, rather than having it forced on you. Again, in your ignorance you can't even see that tipping is for YOU as much or more than it is for any other party involved, if you don't care about service then stay the hell home and make your own food and serve your own drinks, if you are going out to a dining establishment YOU ARE ASKING SOMEONE TO WAIT ON YOU, and you have been given the opportunity to decide for yourself how much well they performed their job and what they should be compensated.\n\nNobody, and I do mean NOBODY takes a job waiting tables believing minimum wage is the absolute best they can do, and it runs contrary to your own opinions to suggest they should. I don't know if you are from the US or not but there is no shortage of people saying \"work hard and you wont have any problems\" but when it comes to tipping it's \"fuck you freeloader\"...what? They have a lower min. wage because of tips, tips are not taxed or viewed as bonuses, but the time some selfish penny pinching asshole decides he's rather hoard his two bucks fucking fifty it's because of some trumped up bullshit moral reason based on an idea COMPLETELY unsupported by any facts.\n\nAgain. Separate min. wage, tips are taxed like wages not like bonuses, literally everything you need to know is staring you in your face, but lets be honest, there are only two real possibilities here, either you are genuinely not intelligent enough to understand, or you are using bullshit to smokescreen the real reason you don't like tipping...because you'd rather keep that money for yourself, so you found the first semi-feasible argument and hid behind it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357501484", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I once ran into an issue when trying to explain to this friend of a friend how i meant to use the vocabulary, but she didn't really see it my way, which is understandable. It's a very gray area I think. I actually think it's better to just shift the word away from meaning \"gay\". I'm sure back in the day, faggot literally meant to be gay, and being so meaning effeminate, but things have changed. People have realized being gay doesn't make you less of a woman or less of a man. The word however, I think is still perfect for situations where someone is just being slightly timid or whiny or something of the like. \n\nNigger is something that i see as different though. It's a word that I'm not really sure is used by white people to signify black people. it's just a really strange thing. It's ingrained in their culture because it's just something they refer to themselves as. I don't think it should be as big a word as it is, but thats how it is right now. I use it freely in a very humorous tone, almost in the same way you'd say something like \"goddamn jews\" or \"thanks, obama\" in a fake way to blame a problem on something else. But that's a word that they use to refer to themselves or one another, it's a word that was basically just the term they were called to their face as slaves, and i don't think it was meant as anything insulting, it was simply their title at that point. So while calling someone a faggot can be enterpreted as \"you're gay, and thus are less of a man\", calling someone a nigger could be seen as an attempt to completely undermine them and put them on a completely different level beneath them, unless coming from someone of the same race.\n\nidk, i'm in a pretty liberal school, and I literally have a rainbow friendship circle where we just make all sorts of jokes like these.\n\nI don't openly use these words, i tend to wait and see how people will react, but once it gets in, we tend to make a lot of racist/sexist jokes, mostly because they're ridiculous. It's a gray area, i can't justify it. All i can say is that there's absolutely nothing wrong with being something/someone you were born as.

{"body": "You're face is a dumb reason.\n\n* Though it seems people are drifting away from the show, I still enjoy FiM. I don't think I'll ever reach /mlp/'s level of abusive love/hate of the show, and that works just fine for me.\n\n* My best friend I've known since like 4th-5th grade just moved back to the area. When he left I pretty much had no one to hang out with and learned to live with it. I had convinced myself that our friendship wasn't as important to him as it had been to me. Now that he is back we hang out once a week and I realize we are still best friends.\n\n* I can make friends like a fat guy can eat at a buffet, but I'll unconsciously judge the relationship at a very early stage to decide if I want to pursue it or not. Regardless, if I don't talk to you often it doesn't mean I'm not your friend.\n\n* It means I have A.D.D. and can't focus on one thing over another for more then a few moments. I also think too far ahead sometimes causing projects to spin out of control or get too large for me to handle. I have to mentally slow myself down and tell myself it's alright to go slowly.\n\n* I've never been part of a community for more then six months before bailing on it and moving on. Six months seems to always be the cut-off for me, be it a job or an internet community. However, I've been at my current job going on three years and part of this place for over a year, so I think I've broken that cycle finally.\n\n* I will most likely never get a collage degree because I will never pass speech class.\n\n* You notice how no one un-acronyms A.D.D. anymore because everyone already knows what it is? Thanks Obama.\n\n* If I joke during a conversation with you it usually means I'm taking the conversation seriously but don't want the conversation to be boring. If I'm not joking around with you it usually means I don't want to talk to you. If you try to message me during a dota game I put you on steam ignore and leave you there for a while (APPLESNACKS, TWILIGHT_SPARKLES, ATTAINED AND DESTROYED).\n\n* That sidebar really needs to be updated.\n\n* As a bisexual I oppose the idea heterosexual people have that all bisexuals are just sex crazed. However, if I wasn't in a steady relationship I would most likely be having a lot of sex, so I'm not the best example.\n\n* I can fake confidence, which I guess is actual confidence, which is enough to get close to others.\n\n* I don't try to think too far ahead in my life and I don't think about the past at all.\n\n* If something gets me angry I usually stay angry for a very long time or until I sleep it off. I sometimes can't control how angry I get at things, however I know when I am angry and to back off (sometimes).\n\n* I'd rather someone else do something then I do it, but if I have to do it I won't complain, I'll just get it done. Nothing gets me more upset then someone not doing their job or complaining over doing their job. It's a fucking job, you signed up for this, just do your fucking job. It's this mentality that gets many of my co-workers in trouble.\n\n* I don't know if I'm sexist or if women are hard to get along with sometimes, but I have a much easier time with my male co-workers than my female coworkers. It doesn't help that my female coworkers are often lazier or harder to get along with then my male coworkers. I'm not blanket statementing all women, just the ones I've worked with in security. It doesn't help that you can get a security job at 18 without a high school diploma.\n\n* About a year before this place was created and I got into mlp my father and mother got divorced. It put a lot of strain on the family and caused me to move out the night I learned about it. I never felt at home in my home and never felt as close to my family as I thought a person should, so I left. I found that, while my sisters were miffed at first that I just up and bailed, they understood how I felt without me having to explain it to them.\n\n* I haven't had a conversation with my father in two years. I avoid him like the plague. He was always intimidating to me, always the one who was right. I never got good grades in school but when I got B's and tried to show him, he would tell me if I had worked harder I would have gotten A's. He was always working. I find at the end of the day my drive to make great things no matter what I do boils down to wanting my father to tell me he is proud of me. However, since I am no longer talking to him this will most likely never happen. Even if it did, if I has nothing to be proud of it would just feel empty.\n\n* Derram's not taking down my shitty banners or headers anymore, so that's nice.\n\n* I've loaned 1k to my mom, 1k to my sister, 300 bucks to someone here, and donated 100 bucks to someone else here. While I won't spend more then I have to on myself, I throw money at other people at the drop of a hat. It has left me with almost nothing in my savings and I have to constantly starve myself to make ends meet. Still, if someone I know needs money, I would most likely give what I could.\n\n* My relationship with my GF is extremely complicated. We've been dating five years now and met online on Gaia (look it up). She is indian and her family is very old school and don't want her marrying anyone but an indian. A rich indian. Her father is also abusive to her mother, causing her mother to be in a constant state of depression. They live in L.A., which is 500 miles south of me, so when we do eventually move in together I will have to move down there and start over. She also wants to take her mother with her when she moves out to get her out of that. When I think about how complicated it's all going to be and the ramifications that will most likely occur, it brings me down very quickly. It isn't going to be easy in any sense of the word, but it's something I have to do because she is the one I am going to be with forever.\n\n* I never thought I'd find someone I'd be with forever, honestly. When religious people talk about their God and how much they trust and believe in them and would do anything for them, that is how I feel about my GF. I would not be here right now if not for her.\n\n* I'll one day be famous, either for making a great video game or as some crazy psycho on the loose.\n\n* People who think the pony fandom is bad are just riding the bandwagon from the previous \"furrys are bad\" bandwagon. The fandom, as with anything, is only as good or bad as you make it.\n\n* My previous statement does not apply to rape or cancer. Or AIDS. Unless you're into that.\n\n* My deepest fear is dying before I can move my GF out of her current living situation, not because I don't think she can get herself out if she really tried, but because I know that if I died she would kill herself.\n\n* My sister is in the hospital after having a sezsure. She also found out she has a heart valve infection, so she'll need surgery for that. Surgery no one has money to pay for.\n\n* My father is also getting remarried.\n\n* If I stop for a moment, if I let the world catch up to me, I will fall and I don't know if I'll be able to get back up again. I have to keep myself occupied, with work or games or hobbies. I gotta go fast.\n\n* [I don't need to tell you that life isn't fair, it doesn't care, it arbitrarily cuts off your air, and like you I want someone to say its okay, but in the truest parts of our hearts everybody's afraid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVGiiiB7wpY)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358325033", "subreddit": "mylittleandysonic1", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Unfortunately, planting bullets is more like IVF than conventional seedlings.  Each bullet planted only has a 5% chance of ever blossoming, much less reaching its final gun-bearing potential.  This is why the NRA lobbies so hard for multi-round magazines.  By burying a 100-round magazine, you drastically increase your chance for success in each dig.  \n\nIt is a lot of work, but after seeing your first adorable AR-15 look up at you and coo as it releases its safety, I can assure you that it is worth it.

{"body": "Part of serving at a restaurant or bar is \"keeping the peace,\" so to speak. I work at a wine bar, and have, on more than one occasion, asked people to keep it down (or in one instance, leave) because they were voicing rude and offensive opinions in earshot of other customers. As the only person really \"in charge\" of the situation, I could lose sales because of this one bigoted couple, or worse, the other patrons would have had a poor experience and may not come back.\n\nJust to give you a specific example: It was shortly before the election, and I had a general rule of dispelling any talk of politics at the bar itself (I'd jokingly tell them that talking about politics whilst drinking at a wine bar was recently made illegal in Indiana, which usually got a laugh and ended the conversation). One night, a couple came in and started making \"thanks, Obama\" type comments about everything, from tips (here's some cash so Obama can't get his hands on your tip money), to lamenting that \"liberals don't have any sense and just want things for free,\" you know the type. They wouldn't engage in full conversation, and I was usually helping another customer when they would make such a comment; but you could tell that other customers were getting annoyed/offended. They finally spoke to me directly and made the tip comment I mentioned above, and I told my little joke, hoping that would be it. The husband, upon hearing what I said got all serious/concerned and said, \"You're not *really* going to vote for that nigger, are you?\"\n\nI asked them to leave immediately, telling them that they were offending other customers, and that I would not tolerate hate speech at this bar. After they left, I called my boss to tell him what happened, and he thought I made the correct decision. I gave them a friendly warning to not talk about it, and they chose to ignore it. Better to lose those two than to lose several others that had to listen to their ignorant blather. I even got thanked by these older women who wanted to say something to them but didn't want to cause a scene.\n\nI disagree that the waiter \"should have been more tolerant of their ignorance.\" By doing nothing, the waiter/the restaurant would have sent a message to the family of the child, and to everyone else that the money the bigoted family brought in was more important than their own moral standing and/or that they, themselves also feel the same way about special needs children. \n\nIf I were the parent of that child and overheard the conversation between the waiter and those other guests and the waiter catered to them, I would not return, and I would tell others about my family's abhorrent treatment. The family that was asked to leave, now that the story is out, will be hard-pressed to gather much sympathy for being kicked out. From an economic standpoint, this was a better decision as well, though I doubt that was something the waiter considered when this was all happening.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358777956", "subreddit": "offbeat", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Monopolies are desirable, absolutely, for basic necessities. Would you like a private company taking over the Interstate system and charging increasing tolls every year for you to use the roads?\n\nWhy would a private company charge increasing tolls each year?  That would reduce the amount of traffic on their roads as people carpool and go out for fun less.  So at a certain high price, their revenue would start to decrease.\n\nGovernment, on the other hand, forces us to pay them by taxing gasoline.  Government has no incentive to reduce their taxes on gasoline - after all, they make more $ per gallon of gas sold than Exxon and the other oil companies.\n\nSecond, how would a single business possibly have the resources to buy every highway in the nation?  It's simply not possible, in a free market - if you auctioned off the roads, the value of new roads would increase dramatically.  So not even Microsoft and Goldman Sachs could buy every road in the country.  It's like saying someone could buy all the water in the world.\n\n&gt;How about your drinking water and plumbing, would you like to compete for that?\n\nI already compete for it.  The problem is, the monopolists that provide me these goods don't compete for my business.\n\n&gt;How about food prices? Maybe you'd like to start paying $12 for a loaf of bread and $20 for a gallon of milk.\n\nBread and milk are cheap today because they are produced on a (relatively) free market.  Government hasn't monopolized these sectors yet.\n\n&gt;How about your postal service? Let's abolish the USPS and you can pay $4 to mail your letter instead of 50 cents.\n\nSure!  Let's abolish the USPS, because FedEx and UPS can ship first class mail much cheaper than the USPS can.  Unfortunately, the government makes competition with the USPS impossible in that area - they've actually outlawed it!\n\n&gt;And you might still have to drive a hundred miles to pick it up because UPS and FedEx don't deliver to the boonies.\n\nYeah they do.  And as I said above, they are prohibited by law from competing in the first-class mail sector.  They can only deliver packages.\n\n&gt;Look at the cable and phone companies. Look at our banking system.\n\nHeavily regulated and granted local monopolies by governments.  Competition is inhibited by licensure.  In the case of banks, competition is inhibited by \"legal tender laws\", and people aren't allowed to settle their debts in currencies other than the USD.\n\n&gt;They're for-profit and competitive\n\nNope, they're not competitive at all.\n\n&gt;Health care is currently working under those exact principles\n\nNope, it's not.  Healthcare is regulated heavily by the government, which granted the American Medical Association a monopoly on issuing licenses for new medical schools to be able to open and operate - since then, the number of new medical schools per capita (as well as the number of doctors per capita) has collapsed.\n\n&gt;and even if you're covered, an insurance company is going to decide whether it's in their best interest to pay for your care or to let you die.\n\nYep, and the government now forces people to pay these evil insurance companies.  Thanks, Obamacare!  :)\n\n&gt;All your savings, all your retirement funds, your house, your car, everything. You end up alive but destitute, or dead.\n\nThanks to the government intervention in the free market, yes.  There are more regulations in these sectors of the economy than you can count.\n\n&gt;The only reason anyone decides to choose our system is purely out of stupidity.\n\nWhy don't you try to have an actual argument, rather than calling people names?  Nobody chooses this system.  The government forces it on them.\n\n&gt;There just can't be another reason. \"I don't like being told what to do by the government\" is not a good reason. \n\nOne day the government won't be managed by people you like.

The estrogen and progestin hormones are stored inside a flexible plastic ring about two inches across, which you place in your vagina.

At the end of the third week, you remove the ring, wait one week, and put a new one in.  Your period usually arrives some time during the \"off week\".\n\nIt regulates your hormones, but I can't give you any specific information on how it might effect your personal symptoms... you would need a doctor for that!\n\nI would also point out that if you live in the U.S. and have some sort of health care coverage, the Nuvaring is free.

{"body": "This is a good idea -- in fact, this is close to what the original stimulus did. That stimulus granted about $400 million dollars mostly to State governments, to hire all those public service employees (Engineers and private sector professionals were on their own -- thanks, Obama).\n\nBut this idea has issues. Every one of those positions requires support, and support requires more hires.  If you add up all the slivers of support from everyone who is needed, you'd get about five million new jobs -- not one million.  While this is much better, it also costs more money, and the second and third and fourth $100 million dollar chunks are MUCH harder to finance than is the first $100 million dollar chunk.\n\nIt also doesn't do much to help us rebuild our Manufacturing Sector. A healthy middle class relies upon healthy manufacturing and agricultural sectors. This was the greatest mistake Obama's tepid stimulus package made -- he ignored our private sector problems and just applied a temporary patch to public sector finance problem.  We STILL need to do more than we are doing. \n\nThis is still a much better approach than the Republican \"hard money\" approach. It matches what Paul Krugman advocates.  I think we should go beyond this a little, and have the government issue contracts for goods to private companies, provided those companies manufacture ordered goods in this country and hire at least some new employees on board to fill the contracts. Then the Government can turn around and sell those goods in order to recoup some of the expense.  This is how we built our freeways.  We should start rebuilding our national infrastructure the same way.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359672819", "subreddit": "progressive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
