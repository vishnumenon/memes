{"body": "I had slayed dragons,  ridden sleighs, and gotten rid of several debts in order to marry the woman standing in front of me, but to the left of the preacher, and in front of the audience, whose hand was being held by her father, the king of the land that me, the woman, the king, the audience, and the preacher were standing on, at least within seeing distance, and maybe more than that. I'm not actually entirely sure about the size of the kingdom, something I should probably learn if I'm going to rule it one day. I vaguely remember him telling me about mountains and some giant beanstalk being some of the borders, but I was too busy staring at the woman's breasts to really pay attention. Like, she had a seriously nice pair. I'm more of an ass man, usually, but her boobs were definitely worth killing a dragon for. Speaking of that dragon, actually, what was the point of it? It wasn't a particularly hard fight. I just kinda snuck in at night and stabbed its head. And I'm pretty sure I had to cross the border mountain to get to it, so it's not like the dragon was really bothering anyone here. Like, if you're going to make me do some stupid task, why not benefit from it? Have me raid a bandit camp, or slaughter a horde of goblins or aliens, or some shit like that. Killing that dragon was like making the decision between DVRing American Idol or 30 Rock. So easy, a caveman could do it. But I did all that, I guess, so I have won the rights to marry the woman with the firmest melons this side of the Mississippi. I'm not actually sure I even want to marry her, now that I think about it. Her hands feel kind of dead, somehow.\n\n\"Give me your hand.\" I said. \n\n\"My father and I already agreed to do so, you fucking manslut.\"\n\n\"I told you to stop calling me that.\"\n\nI grabbed her hand and pulled, and sure enough, her hands were actually just two hand shaped pieces of Kevlar.\n\n\"Holy bulletproof fake appendages.\" I exclaimed, surprisedly.\n\n\"Wait don't look. Give those back to me, but don't look at me when you do the thing I just said to do.\"\n\nI tried to give her the hands back, but they were really heavy so I dropped them, kinda like what I did with my sword when I basically accidentally killed the dragon.\n\n\"Pick it up you fucking manslut.\"\n\n\"Listen bitch, I have feelings.\"\n\nI opened my eyes and took a good look at her hands. They were like really small, like maybe her whole hand was like the size of my finger. Like, it was smaller than something really small, like a small elephant, or something. I was surprised that she was able to lift the fake appendages though. For a woman with arms as thin as a strand of hair, she is surprisingly strong. Like, I lift, and I have killed dragons before, so it's not like I'm a super pussy or anything, but those gloves were really heavy. And she wears them all the time. I pulled my iPhone out of my chain mail jock strap, and snapped a quick picture of her hands.\n\n\"What are you doing now, you fucking useless degenerate.\"\n\n\"I have a friend with a thing for small hands. He would love you.\"\n\n\"A friend of yours is nothing but dead to me, you boot licking dumpster diver.\"\n\n\"I don't even know what that means, but your hands are like really small, so like, why don't you go and shove your tiny hands up your ass and find that stick that's been up there since like, probably World War One.\"\n\n\"How about I use my hands to reach up your urethra and pull your testicles apart piece by piece so you'll never be able to litter the earth with your filthy stupid ass genes.\"\n\n\"I could just get a vasectomy, slut. Keep your hands out of the inside of my dick.\"\n\n\"Whatever, asshole. Are we getting married?\"\n\n\"No! Your hands are too small and you're mean. You've singlesmall-handedly turned me off of all women, forever. No three-boobed space chicks for me. Nope, you've made me a man ass man.\"\n\n\"Well I only thought you were moderately attractive anyway. I hope you have fun sucking dicks. And I mean that sincerely.\"\n\n\"Thanks Obama.\"\n\nI turned to walk away from the altar. As I started groping some of the audience members, she called my name!\n\n\"Wait, Train_Stapler/2/3! Will I ever see you again?\"\n\n\"I turned around, dropped my tuxedo, put on my sunglasses and said, 'maybe during a conjugal visit.'\" I said.\n\nI walked out of the theater and into the hot Texas sun, where the only thing standing in my way were Paul Newman and an overplayed Top 40 radio single.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359704771", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

This information is not available publicly, even though this study was funded with US taxpayer dollars.\n\nTIL; beer causes breast cancer. *Or something.*\n\nEdit: Thanks to a commenter below, we have their specious methodology.\n\n&gt;Unlike health conditions 100% related to alcohol use (e.g., alcohol psychosis), only a portion of deaths from specific types of cancer can be attributed to alcohol. Thus, we used population-attributable fractions (PAFs) to estimate the percentage and number of alcohol-related cancer deaths and YPLL. We used the following formula to estimate the proportion of deaths and YPLL attributable to alcohol use for each cancer type.\n\nTL;dr ... It's a wild-ass fucking guess. *Correlation does not equal causation.*\n\nFinally ... the government is funding studies today to lay the groundwork for eliminating anything ([soccer playing](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324432004578306092029472924.html), [football](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/football-head-injuries-increasing-bigger-faster-players/story?id=18183735), beer, etc.) that increases the health care costs the government is now required to pay for.\n\nSee ... since the government is paying now ... the government must regulate out of existence any freedom you have to do anything that might lead to an injury the government must fix.\n\nSoccer will eventually be banned ([due to 1.6 million pediatric soccer injuries in the last 14 years](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/62318.php)). If you're against the ban, then you must be a supporter of hurting children. You're FOR Soccer? Why you child abuser you! You need to be jailed.\n\nBeer? Out. Football? Gone Cars.

{"body": "As a white dude dating a black dude, I think your answers about race are pretty interesting.\n\nAround my friends, who know who I am and what I am doing, I make jokes mocking bigotry. These often take the form of playing a bigoted character in a disparaging light. We both find it ridiculous that people have seriously used words like \"nignog\" and \"jiggaboo\" to disparage other human beings. My gay friends and I will jokingly call each other \"faggot\", because for us the irony of slighting somebody based on being homosexual is delicious. It's an extension of the joke anybody makes when they angrily declare \"THANKS, OBAMA!\" at something that is patently not Obama's fault.\n\nI'm pretty sure this was what Dave Chappelle was trying to do with his racial humor in The Chappelle Show. I'm also pretty sure he stopped doing The Chappelle Show because it sort of devolved into an audience of giggling white guys saying \"Look, no, the black guy says it's okay for me to say \"nigger\"!\" So, I dunno, I've told racist jokes before, in the context that it's 2013 and why ISN'T racism only delegated to the land of absurd performance art, why is it a thing people actually do? And I don't loudly shout \"HAHA JUST KIDDING RACISM IS WRONG\" after, which is why I don't do this around just everybody, and well if I had to distill my feelings here into a little drop-down box then I would probably just shut down my computer and run away flailing.\n\nMy feelings about the \"dating your own race\" question are, thankfully for everybody here, a lot simpler. Like I said - I'm white; my boyfriend is black. I also have a SUPER huge crush on Filipinos. Like, insta-swoon. I don't think this is a particularly problematic situation. But, if instead of white, I myself was Filipino, then I'd be ticking \"yes\" to that question. If the question was instead phrased as \"Would you be comfortable dating somebody outside your own racial background?\" then yeah that's fairly damning to answer \"no\" to.

Everybody has become convinced that the other side is playing to an agenda regardless of what they say.\n\nAs for the racism, I agree that little of it is overtly racist. I do think that there's a real undercurrent of hidden racism, though. I don't think that many of the Obama haters are inherently racist, I just think it gives them some twisted rationale to hate him, though.

It seems that those mongols, all FIVE MILLION of them, decided to...just, I don't know how, swear fealty to my vassals. This means that all counts and dukes got 50k or so persistent stacks of mongols...and the bad news was that *I* did not get any!\n\nWhich means...it's time for civil war!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129724899\n\nHere is the first civil war I won...barely. (The loyal vassals and the rebellious vassals ground their OP doomstacks to dust while I was gleefully rubbing my hands.)\n\nIn hindsight, I suppose I should have left the Crown Authority at High rather than absolute, and let my vassals conquer the world! But, well, they disrespected my AUTOHRITAH, so I kept fighting civil wars...on average, one every 5 years. Miraculously, I won all of them, despite the factions having a relative power of 400%-500% to me.\n\nThe main reason for winning was that, since vassals liked me a whole lot, the rebels were often alone, and their doomstacks were grinded down by loyal vassal doomstacks.\n\nIn a few years, I got my vassals under control...then the Golden Horde invaded! Resigned sigh, mental eyeroll, and another screenshot.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129724924\n\nAgain with the civil wars, and now everyone and their mother is having 150k+ stacks.\n\nIn this screenshot, we see a very nice stack overflow, in which a negative number of mongols in combat with a rebelling vassal. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129724939\n\nThen the Aztecs invaded. Thankfully, they did not grant my vassals any more troops, but this literally made my game crawl.\n\nHere is the last screenshot I took, when the game became so sluggish. I guess there is an upper limit on just how many millions of troops a the game can contain.
