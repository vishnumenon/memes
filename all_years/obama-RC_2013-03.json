The intent was to secure the commitment of both sides to future negotiation by means of an enforcement mechanism that would be unpalatable to Republicans and Democrats alike. President Obama agreed to the plan. House Speaker John Boehner expressed reservations, but also agreed.\"\n\nSo there you have it.  Blame rests on both parties, and was never meant to actually occur.  \n\nAn analogy would be a mother telling her child \"I'll make a deal, if you do not complete your homework by 9 PM tonight, I am going to cancel our fun vacation trip we had planned\".  Child agrees, but screws up and neglects homework anyway. Both child and mother suffer.

{"body": "Rioters often go into quite a lot of detail about what they're trying to achieve with changes in long trails of red posts on the forums. To date, every (notable) change that seemed dumb and counter-intuitive to me at first has had an explanation I found more than satisfactory by Xypherous or one of the other many Rioters that talk about stuff like this.\n\nI don't know how much you've read about that sort of stuff and what Riot's general \"fun\" philosophy is, but to take 2 of your points:\n\n&gt; Rengar\n\nRiot has stated that if they believe that something is definitely overpowered and hurting the game, they would rather **over-nerf** that champion and then slowly build them back up to \"balanced.\" A Rengar going around killing everything and never dying isn't fun to have in the game. A Rengar that is nerfed to being UP is *less* of an issue than CrazyRegnar™. Even in the most recent case of Blade of the Ruined King, Xypherous said (before the hotfix went out) that he wanted to **over-nerf** it and then again, bring it up to \"balanced.\" (Whether what's out now is supposed to be slightly below par or not, I'm not sure. Stuff changes of course)\n\n&gt; \"BC too strong\" -&gt; \"WA too strong\" -&gt; \"BOTRK too strong\"\n\nXypherous went into some detail about this over multiple posts in the recent discussion threads about BOTRK. Ideally, they want to have a cycle of soft counters in WA (HP) -&gt; LW/BC (Armo(u)r negation) -&gt; RO/FH (Armo(u)r) -&gt; BOTRK/Scary Mask (anti-HP) -&gt; WA (HP). As evidenced by the state of the game in both solo queue and competitive play, HP was making the cycle get kind of stuck because the counterplay build wasn't sufficiently good at counterplaying the HP (but specifically BOTRK, not sure about his thoughts on Scary Mask).\n\nTaking multiple factors into account, he made the decision to buff and tweak Blade of SliceThroughHP™ henceforth known as hotfixed blade. Most of the math done when that change came around indicated that it was \"WTF RIOT!?!?!?!?\". It became Jax's weapon. It became Caitlyn's cupcake.^^^nom It became Irelia's blades. It became Tristana's explosion. **Everyone and their support wanted a piece of this hotfixed blade.**\n\nSo right now you might be thinking \"GG Riot can't math because they meth instead wtf...\" This is where Xypherous comes in and explains what he had hoped to achieve and why the item needed to be released strong on paper (which it is still quite strong on paper currently) but then acknowledged it definitely got out of hand. He over-compensated for a few factors. Such as:\n\n&gt; Fundamentally, any item built off of current health will always look overpowered when it works. This is because the optimal case for current health damage never actually happens in game.\n\n&gt; For example, let's say that BoRK breaks even with BT at 1700 health for the target. What this actually means is that BoRK breaks even with BT at 1700 health for the target assuming there is no other damage sources affected the target at all. \n\n&gt; Given that almost every character has base damage on their skills and the like - the balance of numbers shifts terribly - For example, if your mage deals 600 AoE damage to the enemy team - BoRK needs to be extra-efficient to still be a valid HP counter at this point.\n\n&gt; This is also why the active is as strong as it is - The use of the active nerfs the passive damage of the item.\n\nSo you now see a cost efficient item + what looks like a really strong passive just for non-counter cases (counter being where that 4k HP Olaf/[insert tanky bruiser here] is being mean to you and you build hotfixed blade) The nidalee that threw a spear at Olaf for 500 damage just made your hotfixed blade's passive less effective. You decide you want to use the active to run the heck away from the now-very-angry-Olaf (who has a spear in his left eye I might add) and hotfixed blade's passive get worse. Your friendly junglourhood Jarvan decides to hit that angry Olaf with some damage, including his ult (helping you by trapping you in so you can commence some friendly diplomatic negotiations for a truce right?) and slaps that Olaf for 500 more damage with his passive + Q+E+R. Olaf's right shoulder is now missing, thanks to that friendly junglourhood Jarvan. You can thank him later. This is the part where your support Sona plays music for Olaf. This rips out both his ear drums for another 200 damage. You are now hitting a 2.5k HP Olaf (who is deaf, half blind, can't throw his Q without bleeding to death and more than slightly angry btw) before you even AA him. Thanks Obama.\n\nWhile what was released to live was certainly compensated too far as noted previously (and by Xypherous) the soft counter to HP needed to look really strong on paper just to do its job in reality.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362512264", "subreddit": "summoners", "score": 73, "controversiality": 0}

Most of the things that you blame Obama for are actually the fault of Congress, which you undoubtedly understand is the legislative branch of government.   The president does not have the power to unilaterally lower unemployment, nor does he have the unilateral power to end the war on marijuana.  If he did exercise such power, people like you would (rightly so) be calling him a dictator/tyrant/fascist for usurping the proper role of Congress. Congress *did*  temporarily reduce taxes on the middle class as part of the Stimulus, which you of course hate.  He has removed troops from Afghanistan; whereas Romney said he would have kept them there \"until the job was done\", whatever the fuck that means.  And there is no way he could have \"brought the political parties together for the common good\" because of people like you who will reflexively hate Obama (and his wife, WTF kind of sick shit is that?) regardless of what he says or does.  He could try to pass GOP-friendly legislation all day long, and you'd still find a reason to hate him (\"Weed's still illegal?? THANKS OBAMA!!)   I'll admit that Obama is for the most part a crappy president.  But he is also 100x better than Bush Jr., and undoubtedly better than Mitt Romney, who was a failed governor who ran his campaign half asleep when he wasn't saying something astonishingly tone deaf.   If you really gave a shit about unemployment, you would be attacking the House GOP for failing to pass a single meaningful jobs bill.   But you don't care.  You're posturing.

He danced around those issues in debates with Romney and continued his usual \"Here are some inspiring words instead of detail.\" answers. I wasn't fan of his empty words such as \"hope\" and \"change\" in '08 and I'm not a fan of it now. His use of solar power businesses is a joke. Him signing the NDAA would make every liberal go nuts if a Republican even mentioned such an act.\n\nI was not quiet during Bush going into Iraq and I'm not going to be quiet because a man with a blue tie is behind the podium now. If Bush carpet bomb Libya and used drones the way Obama has and still is, then every liberal news site would yell for his impeachment. It took too long for Obama to get heat about these drones and US' involvement with Libya hasn't nearly got the attention it deserves.\n\nHis crack down on marijuana legalization is nothing to joke about either. The Obama Administration labeled marijuana a level-1 drug, the same as heroin. He pushed federal legalization backwards. It's no mystery now why he was so quiet about the topic in his '08 campaign. Getting tired of people using the \"Thanks Obama\" meme as sarcastic responses to the same issues they blamed Bush for. I'm getting tired of the anti-war left that was so strong during Bush trying to justify Obama's actions.\n\nI can go on forever about this, especially his use of government-owned businesses, but I just wanted to say that I voted for the man behind the microphone, not the desk.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363320342", "subreddit": "news", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

I even gave her a bunch of extra quarters to try her friend using the payphone. \n\nI come out, she's gone. I drive home, reach for my phone, and it's gone. Fuck. I call it, she picks up. She was high - on meth I assumed.

{"body": "My mother is a pediatrician who built her own private practice from the ground up. In the last 4 years she basically had to stop practicing because of a combination of litigious patients, and insane insurance companies.  The reality facing a doctor owning a private practice is that in order to provide the best level of care for your patients, you want to run tests and keep vaccines and other medicines on hand.  However, if the patient has insurance, you have to justify to these companies every test you run and every vaccines you administer. Because they are paying for it, they want every red cent accounted for. As a result, they wil second guess your decisions about tests and medicine etc. Eventually they audit you, requiring detailed records for many patients over years of service.  Inevitably they end up claiming all kinds of tests were pointless and they request large sums of money. My mom is not a big fancy corporate executive, she was in her office 6 days a week for 20 years with 2 secretaries, and one other doctor working under her. Fighting the insurance company in court is basically impossible for someone like my mom.  Ultimately doctors are forced to end up settling for an exorbitant amount of money. \n\nYou may ask, why is it so hard to make sure that you don't run unnecessary tests? Well here is why: Shitty patients. Obviously, as a doctor you want to provide the best level of care, but you also want to prevent yourself from being exposed to malpractice lawsuits, which are insanely common. Suppose you run a battery of tests, but you dont run every possible test because your expertise tells you that the cost of running the extra tests isn't offset byt the likelihood of having positive outcomes for the patient...and you dont want to piss off the insurance company.  Well, turns out Sally has cancer, and the test you didn't run could have caught her cancer in an early stage. Guess who can be sued for malpractice? You guessed it.  So, to avoid this whole scenario, if you even get a slight inkling that something is amiss, you run that fucking test.  \n\nThis is the rock and hard place that has my mom by the ...balls so to speak. There is no escaping this dynamic. The US is not willing or ready for single payer or even a serious public option, let alone reforming the laws to change how malpractice lawsuits are handled.

{"body": "&gt; Actually, I wouldn't be able to do what Kubo does considering I cannot draw worth a shit. So, from my understanding, drawing is now considered \"physical labor\"? Its not. Not in my opinion. Construction, film, development, and any other job that requires you to stand up for/more than 8 hours is physical labor. Sitting on you're ass isn't. Which is what Kubo does. He sits on his ass in a comfortable chair, and draws.\n\nexactly. you *wouldn't* be able to do what kubo does because you do seem to realize that illustrating a manga takes a good deal of time, effort and talent. i don't see why you are having a difficult time grasping this. with all your claims of being in pre/post production and being a developer, i would think you of all people would have a better handle on what goes into developing a story line and illustrating it. apparently you don't. developing a manga requires more than simply being good at drawing. you have to think hard and long about *what* to draw (developing a story line without introducing holes in it, illustrating many characters and making sure you develop some sort of cliff hanger to build upon for next week). you as a *developer* should know at least that much. this isn't just inane drawing on a piece of paper. no one reads bleach just for how pretty kubo makes all the characters look...some of us actually care about where the story is going and that takes some level of thought. \n\nnow, as for the *physical labor* part, i don't see how much more blatant this can be. he DRAWS for a living, day in, day out. drawing is the clearest form of manual dexterity. it is no different from painting, sculpting, etc. you consider those not physical labor as well? so the only thing differentiating what kubo does from what you do - in terms of being called physical labor - is that he sits in a comfy chair when he draws? son, are you out of your mind? all the programmers, commercial drivers and airline pilots of the world must be close to welfare queens then...right? since all they do is sit around all day and oh...i don't know...get shit done. and look at those lazy ass NASA astronauts...all they do is float around in space all day. GOVERNMENT WASTE! THANKS OBAMA!   \n\n&gt; Actually, i do know what I'm talking about.\n\nexcellent retort. you totally have me convinced now.\n\n&gt; my schedule is going to work at 5:00am and coming home (if I even remotely get to) at 11:00-12:00 at night, 7 days a week; if its a major project I spend the night at work, working. I rarely get a day off, and even when I do, I still have to work. So, yeah, you're right about me not being able to do Kubo's job, because like I said before, stick figures are my forte. But coming up with the \"I'm sick\" excuse multiple times a year, is bullshit; and if you disagree with me there, you've apparently never worked a job that requires you to work more than 8 hour days. I've been sick maybe twice in the past two years. \n\noh boo hoo! mister waste tree works so many hours daily. that is your choosing then. i too worked two full-time jobs at one point but then i decided that life matters a bit more to me. don't compare your choice for a crappy work schedule with kubo's or mine. *you* chose it. as for whether kubo is actually sick or not, who the hell really knows? i know plenty of people that get sick frequently and i also know plenty of people that rarely get sick. why the hell are we sitting here trying to guess whether kubo is actually sick or not? did he even claim that he was sick? maybe he has family obligations. maybe his dog died. maybe his wife's amazing bj skills are keeping him from drawing. the bottom line is, no matter how much you are i may not like having a break week in the manga, it is kubo's manga. *he* built this following from scratch. whatever his reasons may be, he is not exactly obligated to share his personal life's details with you or i.

{"body": "&gt;exactly. you *wouldn't* be able to do what kubo does because you do seem to realize that illustrating a manga takes a good deal of time, effort and talent. i don't see why you are having a difficult time grasping this. with all your claims of being in pre/post production and being a developer, i would think you of all people would have a better handle on what goes into developing a story line and illustrating it. apparently you don't. developing a manga requires more than simply being good at drawing. you have to think hard and long about *what* to draw (developing a story line without introducing holes in it, illustrating many characters and making sure you develop some sort of cliff hanger to build upon for next week). you as a *developer* should know at least that much. this isn't just inane drawing on a piece of paper. no one reads bleach just for how pretty kubo makes all the characters look...some of us actually care about where the story is going and that takes some level of thought. \n\nNo shit manga takes time to think about, story, dialog, and drawing. How do you think it is when writing a script for a TV/movie, drawing storyboards, constructing set pieces, directing actors who are uncooperative, and combining what you shot, which usually ends up being a complete fucking mess, in a editing suite such as Avid or Final Cut Pro? Its almost the same as what Kubo does, except when you work in the film industry, or even game development its a lot harder. People call in and say they're sick consistently from working in either of these industries have a high probability of loosing their job regardless if they're the executive producer, or even a grip. If Spielberg was working on a major motion picture and was sick 3-4 times a month, or even 3-4 times a year, the company that is paying him the money for his film would drop him and find someone else to take over. Do you see him say \"I'm sick, so I'm not going to come in and direct today\"? No, he fucking works through it, unlike Kubo.\n\n&gt;now, as for the *physical labor* part, i don't see how much more blatant this can be. he DRAWS for a living, day in, day out. drawing is the clearest form of manual dexterity. it is no different from painting, sculpting, etc. you consider those not physical labor as well? so the only thing differentiating what kubo does from what you do - in terms of being called physical labor - is that he sits in a comfy chair when he draws? son, are you out of your mind? all the programmers, commercial drivers and airline pilots of the world must be close to welfare queens then...right? since all they do is sit around all day and oh...i don't know...get shit done. and look at those lazy ass NASA astronauts...all they do is float around in space all day. GOVERNMENT WASTE! THANKS OBAMA! \n\nYou clearly do not know what physical labor is. As I said before, *drawing* is not physical labor. Its not a excuse to get sick multiple times a year. If Kubo was drawing storyboards, then maybe it would be a completely different story.\n\n&gt;&gt; my schedule is going to work at 5:00am and coming home (if I even remotely get to) at 11:00-12:00 at night, 7 days a week; if its a major project I spend the night at work, working. I rarely get a day off, and even when I do, I still have to work. So, yeah, you're right about me not being able to do Kubo's job, because like I said before, stick figures are my forte. But coming up with the \"I'm sick\" excuse multiple times a year, is bullshit; and if you disagree with me there, you've apparently never worked a job that requires you to work more than 8 hour days. I've been sick maybe twice in the past two years. \n\n&gt;oh boo hoo! mister waste tree works so many hours daily. that is your choosing then. i too worked two full-time jobs at one point but then i decided that life matters a bit more to me. don't compare your choice for a crappy work schedule with kubo's or mine. *you* chose it. as for whether kubo is actually sick or not, who the hell really knows? i know plenty of people that get sick frequently and i also know plenty of people that rarely get sick. why the hell are we sitting here trying to guess whether kubo is actually sick or not? did he even claim that he was sick? maybe he has family obligations. maybe his dog died. maybe his wife's amazing bj skills are keeping him from drawing. the bottom line is, no matter how much you are i may not like having a break week in the manga, it is kubo's manga. *he* built this following from scratch. whatever his reasons may be, he is not exactly obligated to share his personal life's details with you or i. \n\nGood for you for working two full time jobs; you dont have to be a prick about it. But it seems you still don't understand, or fuck, maybe your employers don't give two shits how many times you call in a week/month/year. Bottom line, like I said before, if Kubo was working for someone else (which technically, he is under the employment of his publisher) and called in sick like he's doing right now or even previously, they would have gotten fed up with his shit and terminated him. They aren't going to because both the publisher and Kubo like money, but guaranteed, if he was some shit manga writer, the publisher would have dropped him. \n\nLike I said before, *my opinion* which seems to be bothering the fuck out of you so much that you're borderline up Kubo's ass, is that Kubo is sick borderline 10 or more times a year, more than any person should be regardless of what they do for a living and how hard it is on them emotionally. Fuck, surgeons and general er/ICU/trauma doctors have one of the most stressful/hardest/emotional jobs ever, sometimes the surgery doesn't go right and they lose they're patient, someone who they have become emotionally invested in, but they don't say,\"I'm sick because my patient died and I'm emotionally distressed and I've been stressing out\", they deal with it. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364088479", "subreddit": "bleach", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've got a bunch. When I was 12 I won a 7/11 slurpee contest in which you had to collect pictures of half airplanes from the bottom of the cup. If you got two airplanes that matched you won the prize to the listed destination. I won a trip to Buenos Aires Argentina. When my parents contacted the main corporate office of 7/11 in Houston TX, the people there didn't know what to do because they never assumed they would have a winner. Eventually, I was awarded the prize, although after taxes were estimated my parents decided against the trip (Thanks, Obama) My other against the odds stories are a little bit more macabre. On my 27th birthday I was traveling in excess of 85 mph in the back seat of a Chevy cavalier. I am a big guy, 6'3” 230, but somehow managed to be launched out of the sunroof, landing at the base of a tree some 75 yards from where the car landed. I sustained massive trauma, an acetabular hip fracture, dislocated hip, fractured pelvis, 5 compression fractures, torn acl in my left knee, torn meniscus in my right knee. I am lucky though. The backseat of the car crumpled like an accordion and I would have died in the car if not for escaping through the sun roof. The last one I will share happened two years after my first car accident. Let me preface this with saying that since I was a small child my enlarged spleen gave doctors a lot of caution. I remember getting a huge needle in my back when I was 4 or 5 because they thought I had some type of cancer. Fast forward to a snowy night in northern Michigan. I am in the front seat of you guessed it a Chevy cavalier. My friend has been drinking and takes a corner too fast. We slam into a snowbank. I slam into the dashboard. Break three ribs. Puncture my spleen. I was drunk and didn't really know that I was injured. We went back to the house a had left from. I managed to pull a three way that night. Wake up the next morning. My back really really hurt. I tell the girls to call an ambulance. The EMS get there and rush me to the hospital. They said that If I would delayed any longer I would have died from the blood\t pooling in my back. They removed my spleen just to find another functioning spleen behind it. Those are mine. Anyone that has read this far feel free to add a tl;Dr I think someone elses take would be funnier than mine.

{"body": "Your approach to the \"solution\" IS what USA is trying to achieve, and is the reason why North Korea is acting this way. North Korea has no outlet other than threatening due to embargos and isolation USA put on to them.\n\nJust like a child who throws a tantrum to rebel against a stuck up parent.\n\nIt is also true that just simply listening to North Korea's demand could be a foolish thing to do, but I think it would definitely be a better approach than what USA is currently doing.\n\nAn example of this is in the past, when South Korea actually supported NK to financially help the NK people, most of it (because it is obvious that some would have been hidden for funding other things) was used to actually support the NK people. However, under the new president's (and previous one president Lee) attitude of \"Fuck you NK we aint helping shit and blaming everything on you\" (basically same as \"Thanks Obama\", but people take it waaaaaaaay seriously),  and how USA isolates NK, NK's only outlet is to throw a tantrum and make threats. NK people probably knows the gist of how strong the US military is (illegal sources of media [intercepting Satellite signals and viewing them], spies [they have many spies and assassins in South Korea], and Embassies [They have a few in former communist countries like Czech Republic or just allies like Japan and still do student exchange programs in those countries]) and probably knows that actually using a missile would be equal to suicide but they are trying to get the world's attention by doing this.\n\nThis was my perspective as a Korean person living outside Korea both reading the Korean News and international News for +10 years.\n\nPS, During the Bush Administration, Bush who knew his war loving image was hurting him, actually planned to do a serious 3 way talk with NK, SK, and USA to do a serious peace treaty. Even though this did not go through fully because of changes in SK government, then US government then NK government, one of the things that was talked about was to actually end the Armistice Agreement, and officially declare the war to have ended, but it did not go through fully. During this period of time North Korea was not that much of a treat to the extent that SK people were allowed to tour certain parts of NK, and formed the Kaesong Industrial Region to allow cheaper labor and give jobs to the NK people.\n\nThis obviously contrasts from what is happening now, and I think most of this is due to how other countries are treating NK.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364528151", "subreddit": "explainlikeIAmA", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
