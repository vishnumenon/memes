{"body": "Good question! Okay, so you look out in space, and you see stuff like [the Sombrero Galaxy](http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/28/image/a/format/large_web/), or [this cool artist's conception](http://d1jqu7g1y74ds1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/solarnebula.jpg) of what the birth of our Solar System might have looked like, or even [Saturn's rings](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Saturn_eclipse_exaggerated.jpg), and you start to think to yourself, \"Hey, there's a hell of a lot of *flat* spinning things out there!\"\n\nWhy does this happen? Why does stuff like stars in a galaxy, or planets around a star, or moons/rings around a planet have to be in the same plane as everything around 'em? Seriously, why *can't* we have awesome planets and galaxies that [orbit stuff like this incorrect model of an atom](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Atom_diagram.png)? (you tried, Bohr and Rutherford. You *tried*)\n\nAngular momentum.\n\nStuff in space is never really still, and how can it be? What point are you measuring from, any way? Plus there's always stuff like supernovae popping off and stars and galaxies whizzing by, so there's all sorts of forces--subtle and not--being transferred about in a variety of mediums.\n\nThe point is that in space it's really easy to get stuff spinning, even if it's just a *slight* spin. So let's take a nebula that will be hit by the radiation pressure from a nearby starbirth. All the particles in this nebula are wanting to expand and dissipate while the overall gravity of the nebula wants to collapse it to the *center of mass*.\n\nIf waiting for Duke Nukem Forever were still a valid joke, I would say that there'd be enough time to actually go out there and measure the velocity of each and every particle in that nebula. (remember that velocity is a measurement of both speed *and* direction) What you'd find in *this* particular nebula is that the particles seem to share a common property: Averaged over *all* the velocities, there seems to be one dominant axis the particles favor orbiting around--and this dominance doesn't have to be a landslide, either. In this case it's very slight, perhaps a few tens of a kilometer per second, which seems fast compared to Kenyans, but you gotta keep in mind that space is **big**.\n\nSo now our nebula has just received a face full of radiation from its newborn friend not but a few light-years away (thanks, Obama), and this causes a shock wave to pass through the nebula, much like how clapping your hands in a cloud of flour not only creates a cavity, but also briefly forms denser clumps of flourstuffs at the edge of that cavity (that's the shockwave).\n\nThis is the proverbial pigeon perching on the proverbial hood of the proverbial car as it pendulously dangles over the proverbial edge of a very real and scary space cliff: the nebula starts to collapse under its own gravity, and as the particles of gas and other atoms that will form future Creationists rush toward the center of mass, there's still a vector of their velocity they must obey. To be more specific, there is something of their momentum that must be *conserved*.\n\nYou see, this momentum stuff is pretty serious business in the Universe. Momentum can't simply *vanish* on a whim, no matter how much we'd like it to sometimes. Cosmic accountants are keeping tally of where all this stuff goes, and when a cloud of dust and gas begins to collapse, the bean counters take notice and wag their disapproving fingers at the totally inanimate clump of gas: \"Hold on there a second,\" they say, \"our books say you have this much angular momentum owed to our Cosmic Bank. If you're going to be clever and take up less space, you're going to have to spin faster to compensate so our books stay balanced. Who do you think you are? [Alan Greenspan](http://www.rdwarf.com/users/kioh/)??\"\n\nHaving nothing else to do next Tuesday, the cloud agrees and spins faster, and that orbital axis that has a tiny, tiny advantage over all the other directions the particles can orbit? It hits puberty and gets magnified, big time.\n\nBut why doesn't this just create a spinning **cylinder** of gas and dust? Gravity is still at play, so particles are still falling inward, and the flattening nebula takes on the property of a gyroscope, *resisting changes to orbital motion along the plane, but not perpendicular to it.*\n\nAnother effect comes into play that is more akin to billiard balls on a pool table. If you roll a ball across a pool table and your friend rolls a ball at your ball so it'll broadside it, the new direction those balls will take will be the sum of their two directions. So &gt; plus ^ equals / (roughly). It's for this reason that we don't see orbits like in those wacky diagrams of atoms we see above, because if one's coming up like / and the other is going down like \\ and they hit, their new direction is going to be --&gt; this. So over the timespan of Half Life Episode 3 being released, gravity, angular momentum, and particle collisions will conspire to create delicious, crêpe-like structures in space.\n\nFrom there you get stuff like poles that spin, are magnetic, or are invaded by Germans.\n\nWhew! Hope you stuck through that. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna get a shower and eat ~~breakfast~~lunch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364839517", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok. the health issue. Let's talk about that. Insurance used to be offered to individuals through a market system. It made sense, many people paid a lot of money for CATASTROPHIC emergencies. Then FDR said that there was a salary cap; you know where you could not pay somebody more than another person even if they were better. So in order to attract better people, corporations offered health insurance. They then went to the government and demanded that it be tax deductible; but only if it was offered through a corporation. That is a government fuck up, not a corporation fuck up. \n\nSo now we only can get tax free health insurance through a corp we work for, thanks to the government.\n\nBUT then states started having different requirements for insurance, which precludes new insurance companies from COMPETING in those markets. (Just so you know, competition increases customer service, and reduces prices).\n\nSo, if you are in a position where you cannot get health insurance due to STATE GOVERNMENT interference in the market, or owe a lot of money to a hospital, then blame your government. \n\nWhen the government has power, it can sell that power. Lobbyists are not to blame, because if the government didn't have the power to sell then the corporations wouldn't bother going to the government.\n\nNow I do sympathies with people who have outrageous medical bills, caused by government intervention (and with more government intervention it will undoubtedly rise more, THANKS OBAMA [especially as seen by the 30% increase in insurance costs in the next year]). But not everyone should live forever. That is a sad fact, but still a fact. Your lifestyle choice will determine how long you live. And trying to prolong people's lives through legislation of their behavior simply does not work and just further puts more power into a select number of people that we (mostly) hate.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365034053", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There have only been 15 cases with 4 deaths, so the sample size is small. \namong those who have died one was 27 years old and the rest were 50+. So far it doesn't appear to be much worse than SARS, which seemed scarier than it actually was do such a cool sounding name.\n\nWorst case this scenario this particular strain flu wave will probably top out at less than 1000 deaths. Pretty insignificant. Hell, even fantastical doomsday imaginings of &gt;1mil deaths wouldn't be so bad given the intensely skewed distribution toward the elderly(deadweight, sad I know).\n\nPretty nifty fix toward China's aging demographic. Much better than 50mil+ starving to death(evenly distributed across age) during the Great Leap Forward.\n\nFrankly, I'm surprised at how unenthusiastically people react toward natural cullings of 'troublesome' demographics. Should I bemoan the prevalence of HIVs among black innate populations whose barbatic sexual habits, ignorance, and general disregard for their own and each others well-being rewards them with incredible rates of infection? Let me provide some context:\n\nAfrican Americans account for 44% of new HIV cases despite representing only 12% of the general population. HIV is roughly 4 times prevalent in US prisons than in the general population - among black inmates, about 7 times more prevalent. This is due in part to prior infections, but also the fact that 11% of inmates are raped according to only reported cases - naturally the real proportion is much higher. The rates of prison rape by race vary significantly by race.\n\n[http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report4.html#_1_27](http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report4.html#_1_27)\n\n&gt;Past studies have documented the prevalence of black on white sexual aggression in prison.(213) These findings are further confirmed by Human Rights Watch's own research. Overall, our correspondence and interviews with white, black, and Hispanic inmates convince us that white inmates are disproportionately targeted for abuse.(214) Although many whites reported being raped by white inmates, black on white abuse appears to be more common. To a much lesser extent, non-Hispanic whites also reported being victimized by Hispanic inmates.\n\n&gt;prison rape victims are ten times more likely to contract a deadly disease\n\nAs an aside, I offer my sympathies for all the statistically disproportionate number of unfortunate white inmates who are infected by black(maybe hispanic) inmates forcing HIV+ semen into their bleeding anuses (aside from prison rape being naturally violent [Sexual Characteristic by Race](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092656687900389)). \n\nIronically, the Eight Amendment obligates US prisons to provide comprehensive medical care for innates. Adherence to this rule varies by institution, but a large and non-trivial proportion of HIV+ inmates are provided with expensive anti-viral medication outside the price range for many unincarcerated citizens who are infected.\n\nIn short, save for the victims of prison rape, I don't understand why so many Americans aren't willing simply to let the disproportionately HIV+ black rapists die at the behest of nature. \n\nI am of course joking about all this. The statistics are real, but the rest merely black humour. But black humour tends to reflect some uncomfortable truth.\n\n**TLDR:\nThanks, Obama.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365477899", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": -3, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "All girls school here.\n\nLikes:\n\n- Just being able to slap on a uniform and brush your hair.  No one was disgusting, but it was definitely very relaxed and not a lot of stress/time getting ready in the morning.\n\n- Our sports teams were the only sports teams and didn't have to compete for attention with traditionally popular boys' sports.  They were consequently taken seriously.\n\n- Being all girls meant people had to at least try to be amicable with other girls or you'd have zero friends.  Sure, there was some gossip and teasing and so forth - it is high school - but it was a lot less catty than when folks were vying for male attention.  Being able to *goof-off.*\n\n- Girls being generally active class discussions.  Being less reluctant, myself, to participate.  Being a known as 'smart' or 'opinionated' was not seen as a social handicap since everyone was expected to offer volunteer thoughts.  I also thought social stratification was a lot less of an issue, but that could likely be attributed to a number of factors including same-sex (ex. uniforms.)\n\n- Having to acquire the skill of meeting boys outside of my school pool and learning to ask boys out.\n\nDislikes:\n\n- Dealing with the usual critiques by people who never attended, looking at me like I just said I was a felon when I said I attended an all girls school.  \"Oh, so you're all lesbians and/or bitches?\"  Also; \"I could never go to an all girls/boys school.  I would die.\"  Do people in opposite-sex schools just have so much sex during the school day that they would genuinely suffer for lack of interaction all of 7 hours?\n\n- Having class with boys in college was an adjustment.  I never considered myself at all boy-shy, but I was definitely more accustomed to seeing them during particular times of the day, not throughout.\n\n- Periods syncing and resyncing every break and every year.  Thanks, Obama.\n\nEdit:\n\n- I think I might be \"weird\" in some ways.  For example, I tend to be pretty animated and like to joke around; I'm simply comfortable doing that and it's a part of my personality that was primarily fostered in high school. I might be reading this wrong, but I've noticed most women conform to a certain notion to who they think they should be (ex. quiet, passive), and I think *that* is also fostered around the same time.  I personally prefer my way, but some might list it as a negative.  It was more of an anomaly when I first left high school and less so now as most parties have gotten older, but it's still there.  Nothin' wrong with being quiet, of course, but that's my observation.\n\nMost of the cons at my school were administrative and not related to the same-sex status, honestly.  It's a pretty good deal, imo.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365484536", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The glowing yellow lights flickered lazily off and on as the short, stubby man walked down the grey hall flanked by his two guards. He laughed softly to himself, not even here at the centre of his power could they keep the grid fully powered. As they reached a heavy wooden door one of his guards brushed passed him and pushed it open, crossing the barrier cautiously. The other guard maneuvered himself in front of the stubby man as if to protect him from any threats beyond the door. Within seconds the first guard withdrew and gave a curt nod. The stubby man thanked them as they took up a place either side of the door, \"Our pleasure, Dear Leader\" came the reply as he closed the door gently behind him.\n\nOnce he was alone he gave a soft sigh as he glanced around his private quarters. This room was in stark contrast to the palace it lay in, although quite large it held few items; a cot, a simple chair and an old bedside table which had belonged to his mother. Beside the cot lay a few scattered books and a box of cigarettes, his only vice. \n\nIt was only here in this room where he could truly be himself, a place he could get away from the intrigue and plotting of his Generals. He rubbed sleep from his eyes roughly, although it was late and he was tired he still had some work to do. He walked to his cot and sat down, picking up his diary from among the books and opened it to a free page. Removing the pen from the sleeve of the leather bindings he hunched down in order to begin writing.\n\nHe knew just hours from now his men, loyal to the death, would shoot a rocket into their sibling-nation to the South. It was aimed at an insignificant village and he gave a silent prayer to any gods that would listen that it would not kill many. He had the signed the order himself and in doing so had signed his own doom. Retribution would be swift he knew, within minutes the US and South Korean would retaliate with missiles of their own, within hours his land would be overrun with forces they simply not defend against for long.\n\nThis had been the plan after all, started years ago by removing his brother as heir and later poisoning his father to make it look like a heart attack. He wasn't blind, he could see his people dying in their millions. They had little food left and their land could not sustain much farming. He knew this was the only way, for he truly loved his people. He could see his country was rotten to the core and he could no longer watch his people suffer. \n\nAs he finished the last line of his diary he thought of a place to hide it as soon as he could. He knew that the world thought of him as a ruthless dictator but within the small leather tome lay the truth. Perhaps one day it would fall into the right hands. His last act would be to try ensure that happened.\n\nHe closed the diary, placing on the ground beside his cot and lay back. His mind raced, thinking of the future, of what would happen. He knew many good men and women would die in a fruitless attempt to protect their country but it was for the best, many more of his people would finally live in true peace and freedom. As he shut his eyes and tried to sleep he considered his own mortality. He was a dead man now, whether it came tomorrow, next week or in a month he knew it would happen. He knew it would probably be a United States bullet or bomb that did it and strangely that gave him comfort. He smiled as he drifted off to sleep, his last thought \"Thanks, Obama\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365773401", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "(I didn't downvote you btw, you make interesting points, even if I disagree on some)\n\nThe musical chairs jobs game varies by geography, I agree there. There isn't enough talk (let alone action) about the inequality of jobs-geography, and how people who get screwed in the jobs game due to the intersection of geography and recession end up damaged in a way that they just can't simply jump back into the workforce, and that has yet to be addressed in an honest way (Thanks Obama :P.) \n\nOn the trades, all I have off the top of my head is anecdotal, but in the last 7 years or so, the plumber, heating/ac guy, and auto techs I've dealt with were all guys in their 20s. The last time I dealt with a trades/repair guy who was over 40 was around 2004 or so; they're surely out there, but given what the odds are of having the tradesman/repair-guy being in his 20s every time since 2006, it seems to say something about the proportions of age demographics in those jobs around here. FWIW. \n\nI also agree about the necessity of having the political will to fix problems, although my hope/fear is that it will work itself out one way or the other. Thankfully it doesn't take a degree to understand inequality and exploitation, rather it only takes getting screwed. The only wrench in it is propaganda from those profiting from the inequality and exploitation; when they're good at it, they redirect the rightful outrage towards the wrong targets. This is timeless, unfortunately. The historical trend of what makes for a successful vs unsuccessful revolution is support of the professional class. Peasant revolts have poor outcomes. Thus to really solve the employment crisis, we un- and under-employed peasants need skilled professionals to get screwed. Lower wages in STEM is a necessary step in having successful reforms. It's not polite to say it like that, but it's an unpleasant reality. \n\nThe wooden-headedness on the part of many STEM students (future rich folks in their mind's eye) and professionals is IMO similar to the same wooden-headedness on the part of a significant piece of the baby boomer generation; people living in great economic conditions are callous to problems they don't personally experience.  Their best answer is \"just do what I did\" as if it's a one-size-fits-all, and it amounts to the same as Oprah's \"The Secret\" philosophy of \"if you want it, you can get it\" and Bieber's \"I am proof that prayers come true, you just have to pray for it\". [Wealth lowers empathy](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-wealth-reduces-compassion). Deficiency of liberal arts and humanities education was likely part of how they turned out that way, but the daily socio-economic reality of their lives IMO is the biggest part of how they turned out the way they did. \n\nI agree that laying on the humanities and liberal arts a little thicker in K-12 and college would be a good thing, but having a massive underclass of underskilled people making $20K or less with poor job prospects who understand inequality and exploitation... that isn't going to end well. In a funny way, for all the 'humanities' education in our generation, I could see many of us resorting to the 21st century version of the guillotine if the opportunity arises; surprise poverty and the letdown after a lifetime of buildup brutalizes the soul. Of course, we need a STEM to design it :D\n\nKids need the best shot at getting living-wage work that is possible, and I just don't see many good options these days beyond trades and STEM. In the medium and long term there are more options of paths to pursue in addressing the jobs problem, but in the short term the new *Grapes of Wrath* style \"California or Bust\" path in life is STEM.

{"body": "No, they aren't. And here's why. \n\nIn America, The CEO'S wage is 470 times the average employee (not the minimum wage janitor, the average employee). To put that in some raw numbers lets pretend the average worker there makes 10 bucks an hour. That means they're(the ceo) making roughly 10 million per year( $9,776,000 to be exact).\n\nThere is no excuse for this. It is positively asinine. You say the corporation's position demands the wage, I disagree. What makes a CEO in an american company so special as to demand wage so outrageous? If it truely were the position (and not lax worker protections) then why is it CEOs in other countries tend to make at most 10x-50x the average worker pay, not 470x? \n\nI'm not dumb, and I don't think that the CEO position could be handled by paul from accounting. The CEO position does, in fact, require more specialized skills, and thus rightfully deserves a higher pay. But not to the obscene levels they are now.\n\nConsider the following: If workers were protected better in a general sense, and minimum wage were a living wage, and health insurance was to be provided by all employers to all employees..... I.E. the workers are being bare-minimum taken care of (living wage doesn't mean lavish living) then the remaining budget for the Management and executives would be lower for ALL companies. The position would be in demand, yes, and would still probably pull in a million or so a year, but it would no longer be the fat leech it is now.\n\nThat said,  instead of it working like that, the CEOs see that worker compensation is being forcefully increased and instead of going \"Huh, 25% of our companies income is devoted solely to upper management and executive pay, benefits, and so on... maybe we ought to scale that back some\" they say \"WAAH THIS CUTS INTO OUR PROFITS! THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE THIS MONEY CAN COME FROM! WHAT? THIS MONEY? NO THIS IS MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE! AND THIS CORPORATE JET AND THIS CORPORATE BANK ACCOUNT FOR EXPENSIVE LUNCHEONS AND THIS EXECUTIVE GYM! IT'S MIIINE. So yeah, the money must come from profits but that makes our SHAREHOLDERS angry! So the only answer is to raise the price of our goods. THANKS OBAMA!\"\n\nIt's asinine. This ignored the golden parachute and golden revolving door syndrome that is corrupt as all hell too. \n\nYou claim they demand this position because of their immense skill. What of the CEOs who run their company into the ground, then \"oh I suck I'm resigining\" with their HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE severance package the size of their yearly salary. The company is already failing and they bear no consequence. They make away with what's left of the companies money and the company is left to fail - but not the CEO. \n\nAs for the revolving door - It's no surprise - people who are top of industry X often leave their positions to accept government positions regulating X. Who when they lave their post there, go right back to top positions of that industry. There is no independent check and balance, it's the same people, with a conflict of interests, deciding how best to \"Regulate\" them.\n\nIt's corrupt to it's rotten core and nobody seems to want to do a damn thing about it but sit here and wonder why the economy is recovering so slow and why they can't get a job worth a damn anymore.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365984001", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; TL;DR \"THANKS OBAMA!\"\n\nMy, aren't we just *so* witty and original.\n\n&gt; detailed explanation on how exactly Lord Obama could shut down Gitmo tomorrow\n\nI never said it'd be shut down in a day, and I see no legal barrier to him ordering the prisoners be freed in a timely manner. Neither do I see any such barrier to his simply ordering that the detention facility portion of the base subsequently go unused, nor to his ordering that these prisoners be given spare seats on already-scheduled flights out of Gitmo (to the US initially and, contingent on an acquittal, lack of prosecution or a sentence of time served, eventually to wherever they want to go). \n\nI'm no lawyer, of course, but if you are, or if you simply happen to know that there's something in the Constitution which supersedes Article 2 Section 2 in such a manner that this would be illegal for him to do, would you please cite it for me?\n\n&gt; how is a Middle Eastern POW is supposed to get a job in America\n\nLike I said, I'm pretty sure ICE more or less falls under the jurisdiction of the executive branch. I'd imagine it wouldn't be impossible or even terribly difficult for him to see any acquitted/pardoned/time-served former prisoners be granted permanent resident status, and IIRC being allowed to pursue employment generally accompanies such status.\n\nAs to your little \"when some Americans can't even find work\" clause, that is false as written: if you change it to \"decent work,\" by whatever reasonable standard you wish to go by, I will *easily* concede that, but \"work (of any kind)\" is just plain false. There is no shortage of part-time minimum wage jobs, and speaking as someone who knows what it's like living on the mid-four-to-low-five-figure income such a level of employment will get you, you'd be surprised how easy it would be to save up a grand or two for airfare by living frugally.

{"body": "Nice. I especially like the Feynman reference you threw in (he's my favorite physicist, is that cliché? Idk, oh well). Anyways, I was in the boat the OP is in, I wanted an equation tattoo for a while around when I was graduating with my physics degree. I eventually realized much of what you said here and agree. I never got one, although I might still eventually because I think it can be alright as long as you make it something that shows how you appreciate and are passionate about your field, not just cool looking or makes you seem \"deep.\" It kind of bugs me how people automatically think I'm super smart or whatever when I tell them I'm a physics major (although they usually come down a few pegs when I say I want to be a high school teacher, that's not smart obviously lol). I know that's a bit pompous sounding, but I know I'm not the genius they think I am when they hear that. My field of interest just has more association with being smart, whereas the truth is there are plenty of others in fields that don't have similar sentiments that are way smarter than me. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is: I don't need to have a tattoo to show how \"deep\" I am to other people (it's probably going to set them up for a letdown on that front too, lol). Tattoos are supposed to be meaningful to you, that's it. If you start wanting it because of what impression it is giving other people of you then you are probably going to regret it eventually. They are supposed to represent you to a degree, of course. However, not to the point where they carry a message to others that they need to get for you to like them or are a conversation starter so you can boast your \"talents.\" \n\nTL;DR - It turned into a rant, sorry. You probably don't want/need to read it. I agree with the comment I responded to. Tattoos are meaningful, and when people get them to seem \"deep\" it makes everyone with them look like bigger douches. Thanks Obama!

So how does it protect privacy? I'm seeing a lot of vagaries on why the PATRIOT act is bad, but not a lot of specifics on why CISPA is good. I'm a little creeped out by such dialog, honestly. Why do we need an immunity bill? Isn't that what FISA was anyway? (Thanks Obama!)\n\nThe US government has violated civil liberties like it's eating popcorn. Don't pay devils advocate for one piece of legislation. The bigger problem is that people need to establish an expectation of privacy and enforce it, not just watch as their rights are slowly eroded. You said it yourself that the Patriot Act doesn't make clear how it's going to stop terrorists, and then you defend this bill and don't explain how it's going to help security by giving up privacy. I really don't care what checks and balances there are. There is a big fucking data center being built to store EVERYTHING. There has been an optical splitter running off AT&amp;T's trunk into an NSA building for years. It's well documented.

{"body": "There is something fishy about this article. This Lori Handrahan person cites her own articles for the most startling claims:\n\n&gt;There is a national crisis of **federal employees engaged in the child porn industry** and a related epidemic at the state level.  I’ve documented two states, Vermont and Maine, that appear to be running state protected child trafficking rings with evidence of cops, judges, lawyers, clergy and government employees covering for each other. This kind of racketeering creates powerful, and extremely profitable, pedophile rings.\n\nThe first bolded phrase links to [an article Handrahan wrote for frontpagemag.com](http://frontpagemag.com/2012/lori-handrahan/the-justice-departments-child-porn-problem/) in which she repeats her accusations without offering any actual proof. She makes the unfounded *guess* that a Maine prostitution ring involved child abuse, then blames Eric Holder for not investigating. She keeps taking what seem like a handful of cases of police officers and government officials who have been caught looking at CP and making it seem like an epidemic of government-sponsored pedophilia and corruption. In this article she states:\n\n&gt;Across America police officers appear to be engaging in the child porn industry in epic numbers. I’ve written about the national crisis of federal employees doing child porn on work computers.\n\nFor proof, she links to [yet another article she wrote](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/10/executive-branch-porn-problem/) as evidence that this claim is true. Notice that this article is published in the ultra right-wing *Washington Times* and is in the editorial section. In it, Handrahan misleadingly discusses cases of federal employees accessing porn at work right next to cases of federal employees being investigated for pedo shit.\n\nSo she correctly points out that in 2006, the deputy press secretary for the DHS was arrested for soliciting someone he thought was a teenage girl. Then she follows that up with \"Four years later, the Securities and Exchange Commission found that 17 of 31 employees caught accessing porn at work since 2008 — one for up to eight hours a day — were senior staff.\" She doesn't specify whether the porn was CP or not. The articles I've read about the case don't mention CP, so it was probably just regular porn.\n\nShe states that \"in 2010, the Boston Globe reported that senior Pentagon staff were downloading child porn.\" I looked this up and found [this CBS article](http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3480_162-6709350.html), which says:\n\n&gt; A major federal investigation has found that dozens of military officials and defense contractors, including some with top-level security clearances, allegedly bought and downloaded child pornography on private or government computers.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;Several suspects were convicted and sentenced to prison terms of up to about five years and ordered to pay hefty fines - including one of $150,000. But several suspects identified by investigators were never prosecuted.\n\n[This Guardian article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/24/pentagon-us-staff-downloaded-child-pornography) points out that \"an internal report from the defence criminal investigative service in 2009...says that...the number found to be involved is small compared with the number employed by the defence department and related organisations\". The article states that a couple of cases weren't prosecuted because the images did not seem to be abusive or the ages of the subjects in the pornography couldn't be determined. \n\nHandrahan also omits to mention that [the Pentagon reopened their investigation back in 2010.](http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/09/15/pentagon.child.porn/index.html) and that the initial review had been shut down due to lack of resources. Not because Eric Holder &lt;3s pedophiles. Yet Handrahan makes it sound like the Pentagon is run by pedophiles who manage to look at CP on government computers and get away with it because Eric Holder is the worst man in the world.\n\nShe also brings up the case of a [government lawyer who had porn and CP on his work computer, but wasn't prosecuted.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/08/child-porn-will-get-you-into-legal-hot-water-unless-you-work-for-the-feds/). The lawyer admitted to spending hours at work viewing porn on his compute. One image of alleged child porn was found on his computer but we don't know if this was indeed CP or not. So saying that \"Holder even refused to prosecute his own Assistant United States Attorney caught doing child porn on DOJ computers\" is editorializing, to say the least. Yet Handrahan acts like it was definitely CP and Eric Holder refused to prosecute because he's a pedo-lover or something. We just don't know.\n\nHandrahan also keeps treating porn as thought it's the same thing as child porn in all of the articles she wrote about this. This allows her to conflate several separate scandals into one giant pedo scandal:\n\n&gt;I said the Colombian scandal exposed a national security problem, the epidemic of U.S. government employees viewing porn — child porn — on government networks.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;The latest revelation of missile-defense staff using porn should have America extremely alarmed. It is not yet confirmed if child porn was involved.\n\nWhat cements the fishiness of these articles is that she ultimately pins the blame on Obama (thanks Obama):\n\n&gt;How does this relate to President Obama’s leadership problem?\n\n&gt;The Colombia scandal was the president’s wake-up call. The White House needed to order an in-depth and urgent investigation into porn, child porn and prostitution in all government agencies. Mr. Obama did no such thing. Now America’s Missile Defense Agency may be exposing the core of our national security. So grave and unpatriotic is this violation, it might border on treason. Yet Mr. Obama remains unconcerned.\n\nThat's funny since the child porn linked to the Pentagon employees was found after a decade-long investigation. Meaning they started the investigation while George W. Bush was president. The deputy press secretary who was caught soliciting a minor was an appointee under Bush as well.\n\nYet she still manages to bring Obamacare into it:\n\n&gt;The IRS wants 4,000 new agents and a $300 million budget to enforce ObamaCare. Instead, these resources should be allocated, entirely, for an IRS Child Exploitation &amp; Trafficking Unit.\n\nThe events she cites all happened.

PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS FOR THE TRANSFER OR RELEASE OF INDIVIDUALS DETAINED AT UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA.**\n\n&gt;None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act for fiscal year 2013 may be used to transfer, release, or assist in the transfer or release to or within the United States, its territories, or possessions of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or any other detainee who— \n\n&gt;(1) is not a United States citizen or a member of the Armed Forces of the United States; and \n\n&gt;(2) is or was held on or after January 20, 2009, at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, by the Department of Defense\n\n##Ok, so how about shipping them off to a foreign country?##\n\n&gt;**SEC. 1028. REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATIONS RELATING TO THE TRANSFER OF DETAINEES AT UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND OTHER FOREIGN ENTITIES.**\n\n&gt;(a) CERTIFICATION REQUIRED PRIOR TO TRANSFER.— \n\n&gt;(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subsection (d), the Secretary of Defense may not use any \namounts authorized to be appropriated or otherwise available to the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2013 to transfer \nany individual detained at Guantanamo to the custody or control of the individual’s country of origin, any other foreign \ncountry, or any other foreign entity unless the Secretary submits to Congress the certification described in subsection (b) \nnot later than 30 days before the transfer of the individual. \n\n##Ok, what about those exceptions?##\n\n&gt;(1) the government of the foreign country or the recognized leadership of the foreign entity to which the individual detained \nat Guantanamo is to be transferred— \n\n&gt;(A) is not a designated state sponsor of terrorism or a designated foreign terrorist organization; \n\n&gt;(B) maintains control over each detention facility in which the individual is to be detained if the individual is to be housed in a detention facility; \n\n&gt;(C) is not, as of the date of the certification, facing a threat that is likely to substantially affect its ability to exercise control over the individual; \n\n&gt;(D) has taken or agreed to take effective actions to ensure that the individual cannot take action to threaten the United States, its citizens, or its allies in the future; \n\n&gt;(E) has taken or agreed to take such actions as the Secretary of Defense determines are necessary to ensure that the individual cannot engage or reengage in any terrorist activity; and \n\n&gt;(F) has agreed to share with the United States any information that— \n\n&gt;(i) is related to the individual or any associates of the individual; and \n\n&gt;(ii) could affect the security of the United States, its citizens, or its allies; \n\nOk. So we can't ship them to the US. \n\nAll we have to do is find a country that both (a) agrees to take the prisoners and (b) can prove *to congress's satisfaction* that they can meet all of the obligations laid out in the exceptions....\n\n...and we're good to go.\n\n##But still, it's Obama's fault.##\n\nThanks, Obama!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367341163", "subreddit": "news", "score": 44, "controversiality": 0}
