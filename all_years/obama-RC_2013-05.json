This was money already allocated for exactly this purpose:\n\n&gt;President Obama and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan (a Democrat, of course) set out an ambitious effort intended to spur dramatic improvement among persistently low-performing schoolss by infusing over $3.5 billion into the School Improvement Grant (SIG) program.

{"body": "Good morning My fellow Holders and Amarrian citizens. Today I want to update and inform you on the wonders that are Fweddit Fweight and your logistocal team.\n\nI would like to first thank our holy Fweddit leadership for appointing me as Fweddit Fweight \"Bottom Bitch\". I was going to come up with a better title but for now this seems accurate. Any creative nerds feel free to post any better ideas. I probably wont read them but someone might. Fweddit fweight would not be what it is today without those that have been so cruicial to its creation and development. Please thank space chikun, rina, pinky and mr turing for their dedicated work in not only the ingame but their out of game meta work. That being please do not send me mails or private convos as I am probably busy. I encourage posts to fweddit fweight forums so everypony (yes i did that. F*** you haters) can see or grab me in comms for immediate help.\n\nSecond I would like to notify the public that there are some changes coming soon to fweddit fweight. To insure your shipping saftey we are pushing towards more jump frieghter use and less \"your doing what in a what?\" This will insure that your package arrives secure and intact to your final destination. Unfortunately this also has an effect on cost since fuel is not free (thanks obama). I am currently doing the math but we will be increasing shipping costs. Nothing extravagant and will still be faster and cheaper then any frogs.\n\nThat being said speed is my next topic. I will be posting something on forums (copy paste this post probably) and will be attempting to get actual numbers of who has what, how often they can move, destinations willing to travel etc. With actual numbers I plan on being able to speed up fweight services even faster. As many have noticed shipments from jita are being performed 1-2 times per day. Many are being done overnight ensuring you have your ships for slave allocation. \n\nI am gone this weekend traveling but I should have numbers crunched for the forum post pricing etc. Lastly I want to encourage pilots to use fweddit fweight for all their shipping needs. Please stock up on 1-2 fits of each doctrine and anything else you might need. We are getting faster but we cant nake stuff appear right at op time.\n\nAmarr victor", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367596157", "subreddit": "fweddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This info is on the [suboxone.come](http://www.suboxone.com) site. Your prices might vary from what I've seen around here. \n\nAlso, if you're fine with methadone, and you're good, then thats what works for you! Some people try years and years to feel like that. Others never feel like that. \n\nI think you should do some reading on the suboxone website though, and just know that if really the only reason is money, that you can get all your suboxone shit for free. I'll help you figure it all out if you need, pm me.\n\nYou can even work to figuring a suboxone program out while you're on methadone. But you WILL have to wait 1-4 days longer as methadone stays in your system longer. You will get \"precipitated w.d\" if you dose the suboxone too quickly.

Other give-aways are words or phrases such as \"wrestled with my sister\" or \"thanks obama\".

{"body": "\"The R-Virus claims its first victim.\" I glance at the title, briefly considering clicking it before I pass over it. There will probably be a recap of the whole thing on the front page once it blows over in a few days anyway. Instead I click the link below, an askreddit post titled \"Reddit, what little things do you hate the most?\". Reading and chuckling to myself, time seems to fly by into the small hours of the night, munching on some chips, only the flickering light of the screen lighting my dark room.\n\nI wake up with a jerk, launching my cat hissing into the air. She was sitting on my chest, pawing at my face, trying to wake me up. She must be hungry. I shake some chip crumbs from my shirt onto the floor and she gives me a dirty look before digging in to the salty snacks. I close the blinds, shielding my tired eyes from the morning light trickling in through the window before I turn back to my computer. I'm should probably get something to eat, but then again... I'm already here. I might aswell just check the front page, it won't take long.\n\n\"Omg, what is happening?!\" How did that shitty title make the front page? And there's more like it. Cries for help, people asking for information or trying to figure out what is going on. I click a post at random and start reading.\n\n*They're all dead. My friends, my family, my entire city. Corpses are littering the streets. What is going on, reddit?!\" The top comment is \"Anne frankly I did nazi that coming!\", I chuckle, upvote and move on. Below it are hundreds of posts and comments, all saying the same thing. They are all dead.\n\nSkeptical, I glance out the window. Nothing there, just a normal parking lot, just like any other day, but just when I turn back I notice something strange. There are people in the cars, just sitting there. And the cars are not in the right places, half off them are in the middle of the parking lot or crashed into other cars. Upon closer inspection I find more strange things. A woman just lying on her back on the pavement and the silence. The world is completely silent and empty, not a soul moving in the streets.\n\nI grab my phone and feverishly tap the numbers in.\n\n\"Come on, mom. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up!\" Finally, the gravity of the situation sinks in.\n\n~\n\n\"Woah, this is like, totally unreal\" -SmokeErryDay420\n\n\"How can there still be 20k people on askreddit alone with so many dead? This is weird as fuck.\" -BobTheBuilder\n\n\"My son is not breathing! Is anyone a doctor?! Please, I'm in Chicago.\" -SuperStar\n\n\"LOL, gl finding a doctor in Chicago now, I'm surprised you're not shot yet. Sorry about your son, bro.\" -Derpinator\n\n\"We need to stick together if we're gonna survive this, guys. I think everyone should go to their capital or the nearest big city, maybe we can rebuild if we stick together.\" -I_MOLEST_SMALL_CHILDREN\n\n\"Hey guys, I made a new subreddit, /r/virussurvivors so we can get organised and shit.\" -TywinIsTheMan\n\nIt's too much. This is all too much. I need some air. The door barely opens an inch before being pushed back shut. Strange. I give it another shove and with a great heave I manage to open it, pushing something out of the way. I stumble out into the light and a repugnant smell fills my nostrils like venom. The thing I pushed out of the way was the slack body of my cat loving neighbor, Selma, whose body is decomposing before my very eyes. I crawl back into the apartment and shut the door behind me, bile rising in my throat.\n\n\"Shit. Shit!\" I hiss to myself. \"Pull yourself together.\" I check the fridge and find I have a few leftovers, but it won't last me long. Sooner or later I'm going to have to head out there to get food.\n\n~\n\nThe buzz of my phone startles me at first, but I pick it up.\n\n\"Hey, man, you're alive? Have you heard from mom?\" My brothers voice is ragged, as if he had been running a marathon.\n\n\"Uh, yeah, I'm fine, Nick. I tried calling mom, but she didn't pick up. Do you know what's going on? I just woke up and I see this post on reddit and they're just dead, you know? This is too much.\" He pauses for a second, breathing heavily into the phone.\n\n\"Wait, you're a redditor? That is so weird, I never knew. So am I?\n\n\"Really? What's your username?\" He coughs nervously and mumbles something inaudible.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"X_420YoloSwagJesus_X\" There is an awkward silence while I try to think of something clever to say, something to brush it off.\n\n\"Oh... right.\" Is all I come up with.\n\n\"Anyway, I'm gonna go to mom's, see if she's okay. I'll call when I get there.\"\n\n~\n\nNick is a redditor, I never would have guessed. And he's alive. And there were so many people online on reddit... maybe there is a connection? No, that's crazy, and yet I find myself tapping another number into my phone.\n\n\"Hey, Marcus, are you alive? Listen, man, I know this is going to sound stupid, but are you a redditor?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess. Why would you even ask that? Everyone is dead, havn't you heard?\"\n\n\"I know, thanks. Gotta go, bye.\" I immediately enter the next number. No answer. And the next.\n\n\"Hey, Sarah, it's Paul. I know we havn't talked in a long time, but I just need to know, are you a redditor?\"\n\n\"What? Are you high? I have more important things on my mind right now. There is a corpse in my garden, you know.\"\n\n\"Just answer the question and I'll be out of your hair, please.\"\n\n\"Okay, yes, I'm a redditor.\"\n\n~\n\n\"I think the virus killed everyone who wasn't a redditor. I know it sounds insane, but I have called everyone I know. Every single survivor has been a redditor.\" Five minutes after the most was made, it had almost four thousand upvotes. I knew it didn't matter. I knew there were more important things at hand than karma, but I couldn't help but smile to myself. Comment after comment confirmed the same thing.\n\n\"But what does it mean? There is no way a natural virus could do this. Someone must have done this on purpose.\" -OpIsAFagget\n\n\"[Congratulations!](http://clatl.com/binary/1953/1367496144-golf-clap.gif) I must say I'm impressed by how quickly you figured it out, but then again, you are redditors, the world's greatest minds. Yes, it's true, I created the virus and spread it across the world to kill everyone who was not a redditor. Our world was plagued by overpopulation, over consumtion of resources and starvation. With one move I not only solved the world's greatest problems. Humanity will be better off for it.\" -ManOfMystery\n\n\"What the fuck is wrong with you!?\" -HungryButNotHungryHungry\n\n\"Don't you see, I did it for us! With only the most intelligent people left, humanity will flourish into a new age of technology and equal rights, without religion or racism, except when it's really, really funny, we will thrive!\" - ManOfMystery\n\n\"I hope you die in a fire.\" -AKDEHDN24\n\n\"You broke reddit.\" I refresh and refresh, but it's no use, it's gone. Suddenly my phone rings.\n\n\"Mom is dead, man. Jodie is fucking dead.\"\n\n~\n\n\"Someone did this.\" I sob into the phone. \"Someone did this on purpose, I just saw it on reddit. Some guy made this... this virus and killed all these people on purpose.\"\n\n\"What the fuck are you saying?\" Nick's voice is shaking with tears.\n\n\"I don't know, I just saw it on reddit. Some guy claimed he did this to 'make a better world'. He said it was for the good of mankind.\"\n\n\"The good of mankind? He just killed our fucking mom.\" He lets out a crazed burst of laughter. \"Do you know anything about this guy, anything at all?\"\n\n\"No... I don't know. The site went down soon after he posted, all I got was his username.\"\n\n\"Alright, that's enough, I think. Listen, Paul, I need you to go to the store and I need you to get whatever food and supplies you can. Only take the stuff that will last. I'll meet you there in like an hour, I just need to take care of a few things first, alright?\"\n\n\"Alright. I love you.\" There is a pause where all I can hear is slow, shaky breaths.\n\n\"I love you too, brother.\"\n\n~\n\nI take a few deep breaths before I cover my face with a cloth and push the door open, trying not to look at the old lady lying sprawled on the ground next to me. I hurry past her into the streets. The sun is shining and the birds are twittering happily. If it weren't for the foul smell penetrating the cloth, it might have been just another day. I make my way through the streets, trying not to look at the people strew across the pavements, as if they all dropped dead in an instant without a scratch on them. \n\nThis is insane, last night all I worried about was how I was going to get my cat to do a backflip for karma. I make it to the store without incident, the double doors sliding open with a welcoming sound, letting out a cool breeze of air.\n\n~\n\nThe bag slung across my shoulder is almost full, rows of canned food and drinks stacked high, when a knife slide up to my throat.\n\n\"Drog the bag.\" A cold voice whispers in my ear. \"Drop the bag and I might let you live. You see, this stuff, all this you're trying to take, it's mine. I don't like people who take what's mine.\"\n\n\"B, but, it's not yours. It's the stores. I, I have as much right to it as you.\" I stammer, my adam's apple scrapping against the knife when I swallow.\n\n\"I don't see no store owner round here, do you? The way I see it, things belong to those who take 'em, and I took all this, so it's mine.\"\n\n\"Alright! Just take it!\" I slide the bag off my shoulder, letting it hit the floor with a dull *thud*.\n\n\"That's it, see how much easier everything is when you do what I say? Now, I know I said I'd let you live, but I'm thinking your body would look mighty fine hanging above the entrence. A warning. A messege, of sorts.\" He whispers in my ear\n\n\"Please. I have a cat.\" I sob, standing there with my eyes shut tight, bracing for the sharp pain as he cuts my throat or stabs me in the back. Instead, I hear a roar and dull *thud*. I open my eyes and turn around to see Nick standing there, a frozen ham spattered with blood flopping from his hand.\n\n~\n\n\"Fuck, I am so not prepared for this.\" I mumble, looking over at Nick, sitting on the floor with my back against a cooler. \"I'm just... a redditor. You just killed that guy with a ham.\"\n\n\"Paul, listen to me, I know it sucks. You didn't want this, I didn't want this. That's why we need to do something about it. Look around you, there's noone else left. This city, this whole planet is going to be like this if we don't do something real soon.\"\n\n\"You just... you just killed him. With a ham.\"\n\n\"I know, but what choice did I have? He was going to kill you!\" Nick sighs deeply. \"You need to pull yourself together, I can't do this alone.\"\n\n\"Do what alone?\"\n\n\"We need to organize. We need to plan ahead and we need to work together. We need to rebuild and we need to do everything we can to help each other... but first, we need to kill the man who started all of this.\"\n\n~\n\n\"Where are we going?\" I open the door and take a seat in Nick's car.\n\n\"I know a guy. Hacker guy, really knows his stuff. Maybe he can help us find this guy.\" Five minutes later we skid to a halt infront of an apartment in the outskirts of town and hastily knock on the door.\n\n\"Nick.\" He rolls his eyes and waves a greeting at us.\n\n\"Listen, man, I need your help. I know you're really good with computers and stuff, so I figured maybe you could help us find someone. All we have to go on is a reddit username though.\" The man in the doorway takes off his glasses with a sigh before looking back up at Nick.\n\n\"Nick... how do I explain this in terms you can understand? I designed a website for you once in Dreamweaver. I'm not a hacker, I don't know much of anything about computers, and I most certainly can't find a person based on their reddit username alone.\"\n\n\"But... I thought you were good with that stuff...?\" Nick asks hesitantly.\n\n\"Not really.\" He puts his glasses back on, but averts his gaze from Nick, as if he can't face that much stupidity head on when seeing clearly. \"Who is this guy anyway and why do you need to find him?\"\n\n\"The guy who made the virus. We are going to stop him. We just need to find him first.\" The man with the glasses look from the chips crumbs and grease stains still on my shirt, to the bag of canned food dangling from my shoulder, to the look of nervous excitement on Nick's face, with a scornful smile.\n\n\"You two are going to take down the guy who killed the majority of the world's population in an instant?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Alright then. I admire your ambition, I'll give you that. I might actually know a guy who can help you, a guy who *actually* knows this stuff.\"\n\n~\n\nAfter another brief, but bumpy car ride, having to zig-zag across the road to avoid running over the dead bodies, we arrive at our destination, another apartment. This time, there's only a shuffling off feet from inside when we knock.\n\n\"HackMaster360, are you there?\"\n\n\"Who's there? What do you want?\" The voice is barely audible through the thick door.\n\n\"We're friends and we need your help.\"\n\n\"Help with what?\"\n\n\"Can you just let us in?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\" He scoffs. \"State your business or get out of here.\"\n\n\"We need your help to find someone. Please, it's important.\"\n\n\"Give me one good reason to help you.\"\n\n\"We're trying to stop the man who did this, the one responsible for all these deaths.\"\n\n\"You're going after him? Just the two of you?\" Muffled laughter comes through the door. \"And what do you need my help for?\"\n\n\"We need to find him, we heard you could help us.\"\n\n\"Find him? That won't be hard, it's all over the internet already. It's the president.\" There is a moment of stunned silence.\n\n\"The president?\"\n\n\"The president.\"\n\n\"So, not much of a... ManOfMystery, anymore then?\" I grin at my own pun.\n\n\"I guess not. Some say he got fed up with all the \"Thanks, Obama\" posts, others say his taste of karma after his AMA was too much, that all those upvotes and all that gold drove him over the edge. If you ask me, I think the power went to his head. He wanted to make a better world, he just went about it in all the wrong ways.\" The atmosphere suddenly serious again, I decide to break the silence that followed.\n\n\"Thank you for your help. We will be on our way then.\"\n\n\"Wait! I'll come with you! If you are going to take him down, you need someone with you who knows what they are doing.\" Several locks and bolts click as they are opened and the door swings ajar, revealing the HackMaster360 himself. He is a short, skinny boy with thick glasses. He looks no more than fourteen or fifteen.\n\n\"You're... just a kid.\"\n\n\"I'm not a kid, I can take care of myself.\" He snarls, staring daggers at me. \"You are going to need my help, wether you like it or not.\" I glance at Nick and we share a reluctant nod.\n\n\"Fine. Get in the car, we're going to the White House.\"\n\n~\n\n\"So... what are we going to do when we get there?\" HackMaster360, whose real name, as it turns out, is Arnold, asks for the hundredth time.\n\n\"I told you, I don't know, we'll figure it out when we get there.\" Nick snaps at the kid. Arnold slouches into his car seat and takes out his phone, angrily tapping away at the screen.\n\n\"Fine, but that's stupid. You're stupid. He's the president. He probably has alarms and lasers and ninjas with lightsabers protecting him.\"\n\n\"I'm not stupid, you're stupid! You're just a kid! Besides, lightsabers aren't real.\" Nick retorts while driving through the country side, swerving to avoid a car just sitting there in the middle of the road.\n\n\"I'm not a kid, I'm a man! You're the one who tried to get a webdesigner to find someone based on their reddit name, stupid!\" I lurch forward as the car suddenly screeches to a halt and Nick turns around to face Arnold.\n\n\"I killed a man with a ham less than three hours ago. Don't tempt me to do it again.\" Before Arnold can snarl back his response I cut in and Nick resumes his driving.\n\n\"Guys, guys, can we all just relax and stop fighting? It's going to take us atleast two days to reach D.C., the least we can do is try to come up with a plan before we get there.\" They both grudgingly agree.\n\n\"Alright, so what do we know? Has anyone ever been to the White House? Do we even know he's there?\"\n\n\"No, but I can tell you one thing, he's not alone. Posts urging people to rally together to stop him pop up all the time, but they are taken down in minutes. Several of those who have spoken up against him have mysteriously stopped posting all together. It looks like he is rooting out the resistance one by one.\" With another lurch, the car splutters to a halt. Nick curses and slams his fists on the steering wheel.\n\n\"I was hoping we would make it to the next town before running out of gas.\" He sighs. \"Oh well, nothing to do about it now. Grab your stuff and follow me.\" Nick takes the lead, walking down the road and peering in to the cars as he passes them.\n\n\"This one. We'll take this one.\" He beckons us over to a grey volkswagen with a woman lying on the ground next to it, a car key in her outstretched hand and a surprised look on her face.\n\n\"What, you're just gonna take her car?\" I wonder aloud.\n\n\"Doubt she will be needing it anymore.\"\n\n~\n\nHours later the sun is long gone and we're rolling through a small town. I see Nick lolling to the side, as if he's about to fall asleep at the wheel.\n\n\"Maybe we should stop, try to find somewhere to sleep?\"\n\n\"No, we have to keep going.\" Nick slurs sleepily.\n\n\"Come on, you need some sleep.\" After some persuasion he finally agrees. We park the car and step into the chilly night air, but we barely make it five steps from the car before a voice rings through the air.\n\n\"Well, well, well, what do we have here? You folks just stepped out of your car and whadda ya know? You're surrounded by men with guns.\" The big man with a nasty grin and a mustache waves his hand, making several others appear from the shadows, all with weapons in hand. \"Talk about Bad Luck Brian, eh fellas?\"\n\n\"Please, we can't spare any food, we need everything we have.\"\n\n\"Don't you worry about that, little man, we don't want your food.\" He chuckles and stares me straight in the eyes before continuing. \"We want your karma.\" He grins nastily at us.\n\n\"Well... I have an account with five thousand comment karma. You can have it, just let us go, please.\" I respond.\n\n\"Five thousand? I shit more karma than that! Literally, I post on /r/poop every day. I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better than that.\"\n\n\"I... I have fourhundred thousand comment karma. It's all yours if you let us go.\" Nick answers, silent tears running down his face.\n\n\"Now that's what I'm talking about! What's the username and password then?\"\n\n\"X_420YoloSwagJesus_X.\" He says, his voice shaking with tears, Arnold watching the scene unfold in silence.\n\n\"And the password, what's the password?\"\n\n\"It's... it's password123.\" Nick bursts out crying, but one of the mans goons approaches him and whispers something in his ear.\n\n\"Wait, did you say X_420YoloSwagJesus_X?\"\n\n\"Y, yes.\" Nick stammers.\n\n\"THE X_420YoloSwagJesus_X?\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess I am.\" Nick looks at me confused.\n\n\"And you are HackMaster360 and CatLover69 then?\" The man nods at me and Arnold in turn.\n\n\"Uh, yes, that's right.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry. This was all a big misunderstanding. We had no idea who you were, of course, how could we? You must forgive us.\" The men surrounding us all fall to their knees and apologize profusely.\n\n\"I don't understand, how do you know us?\"\n\n\"We have heard tell of your noble quest, your mission to slay the devil who did this to us. Whispers on the web travel fast. Everyone has heard by now. Heard of the noble trio journeying across the country to slay Obama, the Oppressor.\n\n~\n\nA surprisingly nice bounch of lads with a weakness for memes, who would have thought. I watch the guys wave us off through the mirror as we're leaving the next morning and wave back, glad to be back on track.\n\n\"They weren't so bad, once you got to know them, right?\" Nick asks, having cheered up considerably since he found out they would allow him to keep his account.\n\n\"He wouldn't stop talking about his poop. He just wouldn't stop.\" Arnold says, his eyes staring out the window without blinking or seeing.\n\n\"Ah, you'll get over it. I think. I can't help but wonder how they heard of us though.\" Arnold seems to snap back to reality and squirms in his seat.\n\n\"Spit it out, what do you know?\" I glare at him imperiously.\n\n\"I may have mentioned that three heroes are rising to defend the world on reddit.\" He looks up guiltily.\n\n\"Now why in the actual FUCK would you do that? You just completely ruined our element of surprise!\" Nick bursts out, his air of happiness and relief blown away in an instant.\n\n\"You don't understand, the post got 23 months of reddit gold!\"\n\n\"23 months!?\" Nick and I burst out in unison. \"And... how many upvotes?\n\n\"You don't want to know.\" He says, wearing a smug smile. \"Besides, it worked out fine, didn't it?\"\n\n\"I... guess it did.\"\n\n~\n\nAfter many long hours of driving, we can finally see the city in the distance, the sun setting behind the tall buildings. Capital of the United States, land of the free, home of the monster responsible for billions of deaths. We make it into the outskirts of the city without incident. We decide to dump the car to avoid attracting attention and continue on foot. Eventually we find a building close to the White House where we hole up and get some sleep.\n\nOver the next few days we watch and we wait. Observing the ground, trying to figure out a plan. We study the patterns of the guards patrolling the perimiter and we scheme. We only have one shot, the future of the planet is in our hands, so we better get it right.\n\n~\n\n\"Ready?\" Nick asks, pulling a skimask over his face, his breath misting in the cold morning air.\n\n\"Ready.\" I nod at Nick, pulling my own mask down over my face.\n\n\"Ready.\" Arnold pulls his own mask, too large for his small face, down and struggles to fit the eye holes to his eyes. The tension is almost palpable in the air before we set out.\n\n\"If we don't make it out of this... Nick, you know I love you... Arnold... It's been good to have you with us. Godspeed.\" I take my position in the bushes and look up towards our destination, the huge white building looming over us on the other side of a plain grass field, two guards chatting infront of the entrence.\n\n\"Come on, come on.\" I mumble, looking at the seconds slowly ticking away on my clock. \"Leave already.\" As if to answer my prayer the two guards turn around and head in through the enormous double doors. \"Go!\" We sprint across the open field together, not stopping until we reach the doors, ragged breath catching in our throats.\n\n\"You have 40 seconds.\" I nod at Arnold who already has his phone out, tapping furiously at the screen, his lips moving soundlessly.\n\n\"Done!\" We swing the doors open and we hurry inside. We all freeze when we see a yellow light on the side of the door, blinking once, twice, three times. And then it turns green.\n\n\"I told you it was done!\" Arnold says, with more than a hint of relief in his voice.\n\n\"In here, fast!\" I hiss, pulling the others through a door to the side and closing it behind us. Barely ten seconds later we hear the two guards passing by, still chatting away without a care in the world, sipping from their coffee cups.\n\n\"Go!\" I hiss again, as soon as the guards exit through the front door. We shuffle out through the door and quietly make our way through the building, all the while looking at my clock, each step measure and executed perfectly, until we reach the final corridor, only two guards and a door seperating us from our final destination.\n\n\"This is it.\" Arnold says with a shaky laugh.\n\n\"Do it.\" I nod at him. He takes out his phone once again and with a few rapid clicks it start playing a Nickleback soon. Covering his ears he throws it as far as he can down the hallway, before we slink back into the shadows.\n\n\"Argh! Make it stop, make it stop!\" The two guards fumble down the hallway, looking for the source of the terrible noise while we slip through quiet as shadows.\n\n~\n\nA tall back chair looms over us from the other side of the room, and a familiar voice calls out from behind it.\n\n\"I'm impressed, I did not think you would make it this far.\" The chair swings around to reveal the president sitting there, his hands clasped infront of him with two fingers thoughtfully stroking his lips. \"Have you come to kill me? I must say-. Wait, what are you doing?\" Nick strides across the room and reaches into his jacket. *Smack*, the thawed piece of meat hits the president in the face, knocking the air and smug superiority right out of him, leaving a mark of greese across his battered face.\n\n\"The only thing you have to say is why. Why you do it?\"\n\n\"For the good of mankind. Is this not why you elected me? To make the hard decisions for the greater good, so you don't have to.\"\n\n\"I didn't vote, I was at home rewatching Firefly, crying myself to sleep that day!\" Nick throws another blow at the presidents face with the ham.\n\n\"But don't you understand, with almost no elderly or children left to take care of, no world hunger or even pollution problems threatening to wipe us all out, we can all focus on what really matters, like making another season of Firefly!\"\n\n\"Don't listen to him, Nick, he's trying to trick you!\" I shout, but it was not necessary.\n\n\"It just wouldn't be the same without Wash, anyway!\" He sobs and whack the president with the ham again.\n\n\"You, boy, you're a smart boy, aren't you? With me in charge, you'll never be talked down to again! People will be judged for their intelligence and their contributions to society, not their age or appearance. Help me and you will have reddit gold for life!\" Arnold approaches slowly, seeming to think it over.\n\n\"I am not a boy, I am a man!\" He says, kicking the president hard in the shins.\n\n\"What about you? Surely, you can see how much better things will be now?\" He says, turning to me. \"You love cats, don't you? With the majority of the population dead, there's almost 20 times as many cats left as there are people. You could be swimming in cats! Think of the cuddliness, not to mention the upvotes you would get!\" He shrieks in a last desperate attempt to save his life.\n\n\"You killed my mother. No amount of cats can ever mend that wound.\" My fist hits his cheekbone with a satisfying crunch, but when he looks up, blood trickling from his mouth, he is laughing.\n\n\"Don't say I didn't give you a chance... Hanz! Kill these intruders! A man with black clothing and blonde hair jumps out of the shadows, landing soft as a cat on the floor. He smiles menacingly, revealing two large front teeth before he presses a button on the small object in his hand. With a painfully familiar sound, a ray of solid light emerges from the handle in his hand.\n\n\"I fucking told you.\" Arnold whispers, without joy in his voice, looking at the ninja approaching rapidly, lightsaber held high above his head. He swings it viciously at Nick who bring up his ham to block the blow, but the saber cuts right through it, narrowly missing Nick's arm. He throws the remain piece of meat at his attacker's face, buying us a couple of seconds to run.\n\n\"There's nowhere to run!\" Obama laughs manically from his chair.\n\n\"You're right. We're not going to run. Hanz, look at what you are doing! Do you really think this was the right thing to do? Surely you lost someone too? Friends, family, co-workers. They're all dead because of him!\" I point an accusing finger at Barrack and Hanz suddenly stops his charge, hesitating for a minute.\n\n\"Do it! Finish them! Give in to your anger!\" He hisses angrily. \"Kill them! Kill them all!\" Hanz looks back and forth in confusion before swinging his sword in a huge arc, falling on Arnold, splitting his hand from his body. Arnold lets out a gut wrenching cry and slumps to the ground, clutching the stump of his hand. Hanz lets the saber retreat back into its handle, staring numbling at the carnage he caused while Nick rushes to hold Arnold.\n\n\"You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be fine.\" Nick sobs.\n\n\"Tell my father... I love him.\" Nick screws up his face in concentration before responding in a contorted voice.\n\n\"No, I AM your father! Sorry... I just had to.\"\n\nI'm glad... you said it.\" Arnold coughs up blood before passing out. With a feral roar, Nick turns around and grabs the lightsaber from Hanz' limp hand, pressing the button and letting it unfold while swinging through the air, cutting the chair and the president alike in half with a single, slightly tiled cut. The upper body and the tall back of the chair spin away, thudding to the ground in a bloody mess.\n\n\"Let's go home.\" I say, putting a hand on Nick's shoulder.\n\n~\n\nIt felt unreal, coming home after such a long journey. It felt like I was a diffrent man than when I last set foot in my apartment. A better man. The lessons I learned would never be forgotten for as long as I live, but I still had one shock left before life could go on. When I stepped through the door, the first thing I see is my cat, stiff as a board on the ground.\n\n\"No, no, no! Not you too! Meowsie, wake up! You have to wake up!\" I shake the tiny ball of fur, but she is not moving. \n\n\"It's my fault. It's all my fault! I just got so caught up in everything and I forgot to feed you and I'm sorry! I'm so sorry Meowsie!\"\n\nThat night we had three funerals, just me and Nick, mourning the death of Arnold, mom and Meowsie. Silently sharing the night together, thinking about the days that had passed, before we head into the future, the unknown.\n\nThe upvotes were beyond count when we finally posted what we had done. We were hailed as heroes. The entire front page was memes about us, posts mourning the death of Arnold and countless AMA requests. We took the opportunity to tell the people of reddit about dream. A dream of a better world, not too diffrent from the late president's world, come to think of it. A world of peace and cooperation, a world where everyone can lead a long and happy life.\n\nIt took hard work. Many long years and hard work, but I am pleased to say we made it. Despite all the greed and the hatred and the chaos, our will to make this planet a place worth living in, our will to help others and our will to survive triumph, and together we rebuilt and reinvented, creating a better world for tomorrow. \n\nTogether, we prevailed.\n\n~\n\n[Done!

{"body": "You are so freakin' ignorant about the realities of birth control. I'll lay out some basics:\n\n1.) Getting birth control can be difficult without insurance. For example, if I hadn't had insurance, my IUD would have been $800. Before I had an IUD, I used oral contraceptives which were $10/month with insurance. Unfortunately, I had a reaction to the $10/month kind and I had to switch to a $60/month kind. So often it's not an issue of \"embarrassment\" but rather an issue of access and it can be expensive even with insurance (although Obama's healthcare act is changing this- Thanks Obama!). Also, I would think that an abortion would be much more traumatic than asking your doctor for a prescription.\n\n2.) Even when a women is using birth control perfectly, accidents happen. Most forms of birth control only have pregnancy prevention rates in the 90%'s with perfect use (eg. not missing a pill ever and taking it at the same time every day).  \n\nhttp://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-effectiveness-chart-22710.htm\n\n3.) Abortions are often very expensive (several hundred dollars at least) and most women don't think of them as \"a simple out patient procedure\" but take them very seriously. I think you're insulting our humanity and intelligence when you state that this is the way that women view the procedure. Terminating a life that's growing inside of you is an emotional decision that's not taken lightly. \n\n4.) Also, contraceptives don't prevent STDs unless they're barriers such as condoms. You should strike that in your post or be clear about which forms of contraceptives you're referring to. If you're referring to condoms, you certainly don't need to get a breast exam to access those. \n\nAbortion is a really tough issue and I agree with you that it shouldn't be taken lightly but there are circumstances where a women may be doing everything right and taking birth control and she still gets pregnant. Women rarely go around getting abortions out of laziness and they certainly don't do it because it's cheaper or easier.\n\nI know this is a devil's advocate situation but this is a terribly uninformed argument.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368655856", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Let's say a 30% debt increase with a reduced deficit would have made you happy (because you're a reasonable person that actually understands how these things are related).

I'm not aware of any countries with a presidential system in which the head of state and head of government are separate  roles, but such a state could exist; conversely, there are a few countries with a parliamentary system in which the roles are merged.\n\nThe key distinction is the association of the executive and legislative branches. In a presidential system, the executive branch is separately elected and is (mostly) not beholden to the legislative branch. For example, a president is not (legally) involved in legislating except possibly having a veto power, but the legislature cannot remove the president from office (with some exceptions — in the US, Congress can remove the President for criminal behaviour — but not nearly as easily as in parliamentary systems). In a parliamentary system, however, the executive branch is selected by the legislative, and can be easily removed by the same. However, members of the executive branch have the same authority as any other member of the legislative branch to propose and vote on legislation.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369211988", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You didn't read the article closely enough.\n\n&gt; But is it the manufacturers’ fault?\n&gt;\n**A 2012 report by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform places much of the blame on the FDA.** The report says that because the agency ramped up inspections and sent a flurry of warning letters, “four of America’s five largest manufacturers of generic injectable products” simultaneously shut down 30 percent of their manufacturing capacity.\n&gt;\nFDA officials have responded that the increase of warning letters was only a “modest fluctuation” that didn’t correlate with the dramatic increase in shortages.\n&gt;\nValerie Jensen of the FDA says the current nutrient shortages were caused mainly by one manufacturer shutting down. Photograph courtesy of the FDA.\n**But records show that the number of warning letters related to drugs and biologics nearly doubled between 2009 and 2010, from 34 to 60, before falling to 48 the next year. The recent surge in shortages began in 2010.**\n\nThe FDA \"crackdown\" started in 2009 they say?  Thanks Obama!\n\n&gt; The House committee report doesn’t mention the reasons the FDA cautioned the manufacturers. At some facilities, the agency found mold on the walls, open containers of urine, and metal chips in vials—serious problems, to be sure. An examination of FDA inspection letters reveals dozens of additional infractions. But **the report notes that a review of the violations “did not find any instances where the shutdown was associated with reports of drugs harming customers.**”\n&gt;\nA March 2013 committee follow-up letter—which was obtained for this article but has not been made public—directs the FDA to turn over documents and appear for a briefing “in order for the Committee to understand how FDA is managing the drug shortage crisis.”\n&gt;\n**“It appears that FDA failed to properly balance regulatory benefits and regulatory costs when the agency took actions that effectively shut down a significant amount of manufacturing capacity at most of America’s major producers of generic injectable drugs,”** the congressional letter states.\n&gt;\nThe letter echoes an accusation in the original report that **the FDA knew as early as mid-2011 that its enforcement measures might lead to shortages.** That’s when FDA warning letters began to mention shortages, instructing manufacturers to contact the agency before making a decision that would result in a drop-off in production.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369359045", "subreddit": "politics", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Disclaimer: I am highly critical of drone warfare.\n\nAnd this piece did not convince me at all. It starts out with \"Drones are awsome\" and then lists some arguments against them and tries to discredit them. Not very good, IMHO. For example his bottom line for blowback is: \"If we do something there will always be blowback.\" Well, if people are critical of drone strikes and less critical of other means (like SEALs, for example, who shoot guns and not Hellfire missiles), the blowback would be a lot less. Also with a SEAL team you can bring back a suspect, put them on trial and have them defend themselves. In a due process of law. \n\nCivillian casulties aside (proponents of drones are always quick to point out that drones supposedly lead to less civillian casulties), I have moral objections to the process itself. Drones significantly reduced the risk involved for the drone force. Lets pretend for a moment that we would have no civillian casulties at all. Lets go 30 years into the future. We have microdrones that inject a lethal potion. So we have a bureaucratic committee that meets in secret and decides that someone shall live or die. Without any due process whatsoever. This is basically the death penalty without even the chance of a legal defense. Yes, people have it worse than that when the Pakistani military comes in and kills a bunch of people just for sports. So they are used to some brutal methods. But we are not Pakistan. And we should spread democratic ideas. Secret murder committees are the opposite of that. \n\nAnd the low risk involved for the drone side presents a moral dilemma in itself. It is great that no soldiers have to die. Yet removing the risk also removes the pressure on the home front to disengage. And it automatically leads to an expansion of the war. This is organisational / enonomics theory which has been proven again and again. If you have an organisation in place the people part of that organization will find reasons to sustain and extend that organization. By this theory the drone war will go on forever. They will keep finding targets and good reasons for those targets. War is horrible. Now imagine a war where one side has no personal risk, except loosing their job when the war is over. This effect (government organizations always tend to grow) might already be in place, since we have seen such an enlargement of the program. \n\nWhich brings us back to the civillian casulties. After all we are not in the future. We still shoot hellfire missiles. And because the risk to your own troops is so low, there is no counterpressure to extend and extend the program. Which automatically leads to more civillian casulties. More drones strikes, more collateral damage. \n\nThis is what we get as an effort to close Guantanamo. Basically instead of putting people into cells forever, they are simply killed. And again, because it is so much cheaper (not really in money, but in political opposition) to off someone in a remote area than to bring them into a prison and therefore into the limelight, a lot more people are targeted. Not for capture, but for kill. I would say that Guantanamo is bad, but drones are worse.

{"body": "&gt;car crashes can (and do!) happen even when one driver is not at fault.\n\nThey are also avoided by good drivers who drive for everyone around them.  also, if someone hits me, wouldn't their car insurance have to pay my medical expenses...that's how it works right?\n\n&gt;and you can estimate the likelihood of these things happening. an actuary would do a better job than i would, but i would take the average rate of car accidents where you live, and then attempt to adjust for age, eyesight, type of car, your driving history, and other relevant variables.\n\nRight, so when you have all that factored in, get back to me and I will revisit my health care philosophy.  I've already used this information to decide my strategy, but i would be curious to see what you come up with.\n\n&gt;i guess what i'm wondering...if you needed treatment that exceeded your savings, would you refuse that treatment? \n\nDepends on what it was for and a host of other factors.  I do not plan on dying inside a hopsital though..that should give you some insight.\n\n&gt;how do you reconcile your position with the fact that a true single-payer system (european-style) is much cheaper than our private insurance system here in the US (pre-obamacare)?\n\nEasy.  We do not have a true single payer system because Dmeocrats caved to the Insurance industry.  I was of the mind that IF we are going to try this, it HAS to be single payer.  Democrats had a supermajority and not a single republican voted for the affordable healthcare act, not one.  And what happened, we were still sold out to the insurance companies.

{"body": "Golly, an internet stranger thinks you made poor health-related choices. It must be difficult facing such adversity.\n\n&gt;Yet you do have the time and inclination to deride my personal choices\n\nAt no point did I deride your choices.  I derided your intelligence and education.  That is admittedly immature and unnecessarily ad hominem.  I do believe that your insurance decisions were risky, and that even the safest drivers and pedestrians can be struck by uninsured drunk drivers, but I did not deride your particular choice.  To the contrary, I said I was glad with how your situation turned out.  I am not such a monster as to wish you harm simply because we disagree.\n\n&gt;without the research to back up your derision.\n\nThe only \"research\" I didn't do to back up my statements was the actuarial math as to your personal risk factors.  I'll sleep ok.\n\n&gt;That tells me a lot about your character.\n\nIf you must draw conclusions about my character, I can think of no better way than a frivolous debate on a website devoted, in the main, to images of cats.  That, by the way was sarcasm.  I think we both can do better than judge one another's character because of a disagreement over health insurance.\n\n&gt;And it has been invalidated by Obamacare. Thanks Obama!\n\nNo previous choices have been \"invalidated\" by the ACA.  You now just have a different set of considerations when making choices about the future. You have the choice of not insuring, and the further choice of either paying a tax penalty or not paying that tax penalty and risking IRS action.  Your seem fairly risk-seeking, though, given your health-care choices, so that may be your best bet.\n\n&gt;I have several goals for taking these karma hits, and it is very arrogant for you to think you know them.\n\nI am basing my assessment of your goals only on your repeated request that I determine how likely it is that you will suffer an expensive accident in the future.  If you really want to know how likely that is, I recommend seeking insurance quotes from multiple underwriters, as the premiums (less the well-reported and Google-able administrative costs) will be a reasonable approximation of your actuarial risk.  If it is arrogant to read your comment rationally, then I apologize for my transgression.\n\nWe clearly disagree on a policy level about what society's role in health care is.  I appreciate (and applaud) your paying for your own health care when needed, and not abusing the availability of emergency care (which is paid for at great expense to state and federal taxpayers, as well as private donors).  My position is based primarily on our society's unwillingness to turn away the sick from hospitals despite inability to pay.  If everyone were as self-possessed and self-responsible as you, we would probably be in agreement.  Unfortunately, we have discovered that is not the case.  If you believe Forbes (and I will forgive you if not), [uncompensated care costs are up to $41 Billion annually](http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2013/01/07/unpaid-hospital-bills-rise-to-41-billion-annually/).  As of now those costs are borne by taxpayers, private donors, and medical professionals.  I'm not happy about that, and believe it can be handled cheaper through universal insurance (not necessarily through the ACA).  We probably disagree on that.\n\nI guess I had more time than I thought.  Primarily because my flight was canceled.\n\nTo return to the one part of your previous comment I think does bear addressing, I will admit that I unfairly read into your comment that you were advocating all young men forgo insurance, when you were simply stating your own experience.  What I said was not untrue, it simply didn't address your actual point.  Ex post it is very easy for you to say that your strategy was planned and not luck.  For anyone who's spontaneously developed schizophrenia, (treatable) cancer, etc., or who's been struck by a drunk driver despite absolutely cautious and conservative driving and become disabled, however, the hindsight analysis is equally clear.  Ex ante, there is positive risk of health events for everyone, and given that opting out of health insurance does not entail opting out of treatment, we are in a quagmire.  Either we decrease access or increase insurance.  Clearly, we have opposing opinions of which way to go.  And that is where I believe we will have to agree on disagreement.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369428090", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "They're doing something infinitely riskier and more dangerous than your job in the \"best\" interests of their country. When you think about it, what shapes you as a human being can be dumbed down to a few things; your family (mainly parents), friends, and the society in which you live. Our society exists in its current state because people believe in it, and they believe in the country in which they were raised. This only happens because people sign up to defend their country's best interests, whatever they may be. I'm not saying everyone joins the army because of that, and in fact, many do it for free college money, to get out of minor legal trouble, because they don't know what else to do, etc etc; however, I firmly believe that at the core of a majority of our soldiers is a trait of belief in the country they feel helped shape them.\n\nBeing a redditor is, many times, about individualistic thinking. We are the soapboxers, the activists, the game changers --and we yell out our opinions and argumentative comments like god-given rights. A couple hundred years ago, we (I am speaking as an American here) were denied many freedoms that we now take for granted. If \"thanks, King George III\" were bandied about back then like \"thanks Obama\" is today, you could expect federal punishment. If you cared to decry the church like so many redditors do today, you could expect punishment. It took many people who believed in something else, and a new country, with soldiers willing to fight for that country, to enjoy freedoms that are now taken for granted in large part. Though we today live in a vastly different world, a lot of people still care a lot about their country, and that to me means a hell of a lot more than being a day trader, a doctor, a university professor, an athlete, or some bullshit \"administrator of social media\" position. It's risky, and it's worth honoring.\n\nThere are strategic deterrent submarines underwater 365 days a year with a complement of arms that prevent countries like North Korea from dropping nuclear weapons on us because they are aware of the consequences. Knowing that helps many citizens sleep better at night.\nThere are men and women, family members, overseas (my younger sister included) that are inches from potential death every day. They knowingly face the possibility of a bullet or a catastrophic explosion in the execution of their duties, and they face it with solidarity. That's courage.\n\nConversely, you couldn't even face an Internet community without a throwaway account because you were worried about the oh-so-important downvotes. \n\nThat's cowardice.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369666295", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm going to guess that you live in an area where black people aren't a \"problem\"  \n\nModern racism comes through a \"familiarity breeds contempt\" principle. Where I grew up, there was a Mexican \"problem.\" So there was a lot of tension between white and brown. But if you throw a black guy or a jew or whatever in front of these same \"racists,\" they are perfectly fine. The people are nice, but if there is a \"problem\" then generalization starts to happen, and you start to associate \"Mexican\" with \"problem.\" Sometimes you even start to go the reverse, and start blaming all problems on Mexicans. This is where the \"thanks Obama\" mentality comes from.  \n\nIt's very powerful and sneaks up on you. Having grown up in that environment, I still have a knee-jerk reaction when I hear the word \"Mexican\" or see someone I identify as Mexican. The intelligent side of me knows better, but there is part of me that is conditioned, that remembers the thugs I had to grow up with. When 90% of the bad people you encounter in your youth are brown, it has an effect on you. Today I know that bad people come in all colors, and good people too, but that isn't what I saw as a child, and that set the template for how I view others.  \n\nRacism doesn't really happen in the South. It happens in places where there have been problems. Cities where Katrina refugees were sent are becoming increasingly racist. St. Louis is shockingly racist.

It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 69 pack of over 900 420 for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed ALL THE THINGS to the cashier, handed him tree fiddy and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged woman who thanks Obama for health care(I knew these people from Pap Johns, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, \"See that man? He's acting just like u/linkfixerbot wants us to.\" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Kony 2012 shirt, and a fedora, so it must have been a nice sight until she took an arrow to the knee. Very loudly, I said \"HL3 Confirmed!\" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to say Y U NO LIKE HL3, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier.

You acted like a creepy pickup guy trying to score, which is NOT what seduction is about. This is my philosophy, some people here might disagree. Seduction is about building attraction with the scoring part as a bonus at the end. Many people here just enjoy the thrill of the hunt. As my friend Steve would say, \"I'm gonna go make these girls want me\".\r\rSeduction is NOT \"okay, I'm going to do these things and girls will automatically have sex with me\". Some of the most successful guys I know are great empathizers of women, they know and understand women and how they work. That is the first step of seduction, think what makes people attractive to women? In this specific case, doing gamey things when she is already on to your \"pickup guy\" status is like convincing a cop you haven't been drinking by showing how you can stay in your own lane over 50% of the time. The you're a total player and I'm gonna regret coming out with you was a shit test. And the way to handle shit tests is to be so confident they feel bad for even bringing it up. It also sounds you didn't build enough comfort and attraction before kissing. Remember to Kino, Kino, Kino.\r\rIts good to get over AA, but that's just the first step. Remember to lock in your progress but keep improving (well now I can open but women think I'm creepy, time to work on confidence).

{"body": "i wouldn't say you're being punished, i'd say it's more of a trade off where you unfortunately aren't enjoying any of the benefits. Here in the US we have a low barrier to entry for pet ownership. That's pretty cool because we don't have to jump through hoops and pay lots of money to the state to get pets registered. If we tried to do what germany does people would throw a fit and say 'thanks, Obama! Now we live in a fascist state where i can't even have a dog without paying the man!' It would also probably mean that poor people couldn't own pets because they wouldn't have the time or money to go through all those steps. Maybe that's a good thing because they probably couldn't properly care for one anyway, however that's a different story and a slippery slope.\n\n\nThe down side of this freedom is that we have lots of animals that aren't well trained and safe so we have to protect our citizens and create laws against animals in certain places. Since you obviously care for your pet, the freedom part isn't really helping you, so you only get the downside.\n\n\nI think the perfect balance would be to enforce strict standards of behavior and training for all dogs within an urban settings. If you live in a major city and you want a dog, you're going to have to train it. If you live out in the middle of nowhere, feel free to raise your wild dogs and let them do whatever. Then we could allow pets out more in urban settings, which would be good for them anyway since they probably don't have a lot of room to run around.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370035398", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
