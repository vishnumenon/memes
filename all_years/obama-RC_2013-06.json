I still can't center perfectly everyone and I'm quickly coming up on my one year anniversary of throwing with an INSANE number of hours under my belt so far. Some days I center everything like a damn pro and other days I throw my hands in the air and do a lot of \"Thanks Obama!\" meme moments.\n\nThings that help me the most.\n\n1. Patience. I never had it before taking up ceramics. I have a little now, but damn it helps.\n\n2. Breathing. Don't forget to breathe. Practice breathing in and out as you center and throw. Sounds silly but I see people get so focused they start changing colors and then do a massive exhale or inhale and throw everything off. I do this too, don't ask how many times I have felt myself start to sway into a pot because I'm not getting oxygen. &gt;.&gt;\n\n3. It was easier for me to grasp centering with 5+ lbs instead of 1-2lbs. I don't know why but the day my prof saw me frustrated and near tears and told me \"Okay center 10lbs\" after my max before had been 3? Maybe 3.5? it all finally clicked. I had developed habits for handling a small amount of clay, I was forcing it into the center instead of guiding it there. There was NO forcing 10lbs into the center and after a few days(I am stubborn...) of trying I finally started to really look at what my actions were doing to the clay to see how centering works. Slow down, pay attention to the process and watch a ton of YouTube videos on it. Hell watch them AS you are centering if you can.\n\n4. Practice as often as a 12 year old with a pile of pornos.

{"body": "Aside from the drama aspect, this situation is very interesting as it makes many parallels to an actual government. Currently, /r/atheism is controlled by a liberal party of /u/jij who replaced the long time standing conservative party of /u/skeen.\n\nHowever, since this is not a democratic state (ie. you cannot elect moderators), it would have to be considered either a monarchy or dyarchy (depending on /u/tuber's role). This means that the current ruling party has absolute power over everything save for the event of foreign intervention (admins).\n\nGoing back to what defines liberal and conservative in this situation, the liberal party is represented by their pro-moderation stance with having a higher moderated sub. The conservative approach is to implement a virtual Laissez-faire policy of little to no moderation (except for moderation to maintain that policy).\n\nSo far the vocal minority is the conservative party as they are opposed to the increase in liberal agenda that the ruling party is implementing. They would first need to gain enough internal support to become less of a minority and more a equal or majority in terms of supporters for conservatism (whether behind /u/skeen or another candidate) to match against the non-vocal liberals of the sub. They have the advantage as more people will be willing to listen to the vocal minority rather than the non-vocal majority. However, it would then fall upon /u/tuber and /u/jij to either step down (or lower) to the new majority (if it occurs) or add representation for the opposing party. It is doubtful that they will change their views on the subject since they went through the efforts to remove the previous party from office. Taking no action in the course of a conservative majority would run a higher risk of foreign intervention, which is always a wild card possibility in either way.\n\nHowever, /u/skeen is basing his movement on thin ice as his only platform so far is that he is the founder of /r/atheism. He would need a more compelling argument than that to sway the moderates of the sub, because if they do not choose his conservative policy to begin with then that is not a better reason to do so (for most).\n\nAnd that's all the metaphoric comparisons I am going to make for now. This wasted a good portion of my day so thank you for either reading or skipping over this.\n\n**TL;DR - Thanks Obama**\n\n**ALSO: Free karma for anyone who comes up with party names for the Conservatives, Liberals, and Moderates in this situation.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370524886", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "score": 95, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That does presume disposable diapers, and formula use.  Cloth diapers end up being much cheaper.  You'll have an initial outlay of ~$150 or so, but then you're only paying for detergent and the washing machine usage.\n\nI know they sound disgusting and gross but honestly if you breastfeed it's really not that bad at all until the solids really kick in.  Even if you breastfed only for 6 months it's still worth doing for that time frame.\n\nAlso, breastfeeding is way way cheaper than formula.  Your wife will eat more (it's like +500 calories/day to produce milk), but you don't need to do anything special for it, as it's there on demand.  If your wife works, she'll want to get a breast pump, but coverage for breast pumps is mandated by law (thanks Obama), and also by law she must be given time and space (that isn't a bathroom) in which to pump at work.  My wife uses the Hygeia Enjoye and is very happy with it (she works full time, so it gets a lot of use).\n\nSo you can really cut out $160/mo of that out with a single ~$160 outlay in the beginning for the diapers (as long as you have access to a washer and dryer).  You do need to buy more diapers as they get bigger but you can do it in chunks as you need and it really just isn't that bad.\n\nGood luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370608820", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

This is not \"clean\" data. There is a lot of \"noise\" in it. (A simple example: \"Thanks Obama\" -- is this serious, or satirical?)  \n\nRe: predicting sexual orientation. Nope. Here's why.  \n\nData Mining works by predicting, from a (relatively) small number of data points (like age, schooling, place of birth, etc) the value of some other data point (like income). So imagine a HUGE spreadsheet. Each row is a person (or home phone number, or whatever) and each column is one of these data points (age, schooling etc). There would HAVE to be a column of KNOWN sexual orientation for MOST of the rows before you could even begin to predict the values in the UNKNOWN sexual orientation points.   \n\nCaveat: there is a LOT of data out there. It's hard to comprehend the sheer volume of this. Most people will have more than one row in the \"spreadsheet\" since their credit card numbers, home phone numbers, twitter user names, etc cannot be reliably correlated. Big Data and Data Mining are very young technologies and growing rapidly. (In fact, and textbook written on it is out of date before it's published.)

{"body": "First, it's true that publishers get no money from used game sales. However, why should they? The thinking behind this is that after selling you a game, the publisher retains some ownership of the product. \n\nMazda doesn't get a cut if you sell your car. Nissan doesn't get a cut if you give it to your kid. Chevrolet doesn't get a cut when you purchase a second-hand truck. Why is it ok for these publishers to run their companies into the ground and then claim it's all the fault of piracy and used games?\n\nSecond, the used game market provides a huge boost to the industry in general. People who can't afford new games on a regular basis would be completely out of the ecosystem without the second-hand market. These are people who buy the console, the accessories, purchase services and even occasionally a new game, for a special occasion or because they just really want to play it. I think the second hand market extends the life of the console by several years and helps expose great series and studios to the mass market. \n\nThe studios and publishers that succeed are the ones who make games everyone wants to play. The second hand market isn't ruining Rockstar, or Blizzard, or Double Fine. The idea that eliminating this market would somehow boost sales numbers and profits for studios that make mediocre games is bullshit, it's a delusion that these executives have that they are genius power alpha males who can do no wrong, and it's just the weaselly fucking gamers who are ruining their flawless master plan for 200% share price by *GASP* buying used games!

{"body": "Ending consumerism means that the means of production are no longer going to have to run at maximum production all the time. Automobile factories won't have to continue to pump out car after car. We'll build cars that are meant to last a century, not designed to fall apart in a few years. We'll only build as many as we need, not as many as we can sell. The same applies to other heavy industries. We would need far fewer workers in these industries; but there are people who enjoy that labor and they will continue to do so. Instead of workers with nothing else to do, they become hobbyists solving problems. They will produce what we need because they want to show off what they can do.\n\nUnskilled labor isn't something that should be exclusive to a certain profession. These are really jobs that everyone should do all the time. The infamous garbage collector problem: make it a volunteer day (see: Marinaleda, Spain's Red Sundays). People already volunteer to pick up trash on hiking trails and in parks and the side of the road (Adopt-A-Highway). They'll volunteer to ride around in a garbage truck for a couple hours on a Tuesday.\n\nIf you've ever been to one of the few remaining family farms in the U.S., you'll know they generally have a very generous attitude. Kids help bail hay, brand and drive cattle, help harvest, etc., for their neighbors frequently. This would only change by getting rid of the fences (except maybe to keep predators out). Farmers' Markets would operate as free stores, and people from the community would volunteer to work on the farm for a day or two when they're needed. There's no reason we can't all pitch in to make sure we all get to eat.\n\nEventually our need for manual labor will be replaced by robots. Then they'll develop sentient AI and we'll have to liberate them like animals. Then we'll go back to doing manual labor. For our robot overlords.

{"body": "The original mod of /r/atheism was stopping the only 2 other mods from doing modly things, and had been completely inactive for a very long time. (2+months). What are modly things. Responding to mod mail, removing trolls, dealing with people that have questions, pulling posts out of the spam filter, making sure people follow the rules of reddit, like no doxxing ect ect. \n\n\nYou might think, well goodness, if all that happened was the 2 only mods around got control of teh sub then no big deal right? Well when tuber and (other guy who's name i can't remember) got the sub they made a single new rule. It was that there would no longer be direct links to images. You needed to post a link to the image in the body of the post. \n\n\nAnd then the world shit it's pants. Why did it do that? Because it seems like every user ever on /r/atheism wasn't aware that the other rules existed, mostly because the only 2 mods around were so busy doing the little things, like slaving through a billion reports in a gigantic subreddit to be able to enforce any of the community rules. \n\n\nSo what happened was they made it so you had to click twice for memes/images, and thus image macros and facebook screenshots fell off the frontpage. Everyone that used it for easy karma was enraged. \n\n\nokay, now that seems like a silly problem, why would there need to be so much automated moderating? Because everyone who lost thier easy karma fucking lost their shit. Every post was a complaint about 2 step pictures. The entire sub turned into an /r/circlejerk that wasn't self aware and it seemed like no one realized they were being little assholes about something that literally was not a huge change. \n\n\nso they had to make automated bots getting rid of the complainer posts, and some posts would get caught in the bot needlessly. They'd fix it when someone told them. The whole thing was crazy, so they added mods from a bunch of other communities, most of them hailing in some way from /r/circlejerk, because i guess that's where all the cool kids live. This was seen to be a vast illuminati christian fundie islam thanks obama conspiracy. I'm still not sure why. \n\n\nbut the real kicker that is just amazing is that in an effort to make /r/atheism a meme haven again users are citing the will of the creator of the sub as the only word that must ever be considered. A mod that literally did not long in for a solid 2 months or more to do ANYTHING, not even pull posts out of the spam trap. This is your god, a dude who refused to even go through modmail. \n\n\nEDIT: I just finished up the linked article, and apparently skeen hadn't logged into that account for a solid 7 months prior to being removed. man, he was worse than i thought.

It was their classic, Lemon Ice Tea. I pop off of the cap and look under it and it says \"Free Rent for a month!\" I say something a long the lines of \"that's stupid,\" and I chug the bottle and throw it away in the garbage when we get to the place. About two weeks later I was having another and I peel off the label because it was summer and I was off my ADHD meds. On the back of the label it says that the grand prize cap will say \"Free Rent for a month!\" So like ten or eleven year old me threw out a 10,000 dollar grand prize in the trash.

{"body": "The whole last season was strangely sad for me. I'll explain [SPOILERS]:\n\n1. Kara Thrace suffered a lot of things: the removal of her ovary, the fake child, her own death and resurrection without knowing what the fuck, the loss of Sam to a bullet in his head (he ended up becoming a hybrid), never being able to be with Lee, having a bad mother, and finally, just knowing that after arriving to the new Earth, she had to go, because she came back as some sort of black angel to help everyone reach their end, and that's all she was going to do in her second life. Dammit, I just hated all that happened to her.\n\n2. Everybody thought that the prophecies that Laura Roslin was following and guiding, ended when they found the old Earth, but to me, that's not right. Seems that no one noticed that she eventually took them to the best planet they could end up living in (they eventualy called it Earth), while being in peace with the cylons. She died there, although the prophecy said something about she not being able to reach the planet (a Moses like prophecy).\n\n3. Chief Tyrol suffered the saddest destiny of them all: he lost Boomer and he loved her, he then suffered in New Caprica while being under the oppresion of the cylons, he learned that he was a cylon and he even wanted to take his life, his wife Cally thinking she commited suicide, his child was Hot Dog's, and he ended up knowing that Tory killed Cally. In the end, he decided to go as far north as possible (could've been Canada, Greenland, Sweeden, Russia...) where he was certain there would not be any humans or cylons.\n\n4. The admiral Bill Adama lost Laura while taking her for a ride, he knew she was going to die there, and he was decided to live alone, and never see his son again. Lee knew this, he was not going to see his father again. And not only that, Lee was talking to Kara, turned around for a second, and when he turned back to see her, she was gone. Fuck.\n\n5. Oh, Dee killed herself without showing any evidence of suicidal tendencies or reasons to kill herself. Yes, it was sad to find the old Earth all destroyed, but there was no way this could be imagined. Poor Lee.\n\nWhat really bothered me was that Gaius and Caprica 6 were some sort of angels, maybe the gods? I don't know, they showed up in what would be modern Earth, walking in the streets of modern USA, it just didn't make any sense to me. That, and Kara's end, were the two things I really didn't fully like about the end.\n\nGoddammit I really loved and hated the ending at the same time. Sometimes I wish they gave it a slightly different end, maybe less religious and mysterious, even if they keep some sadness in it. Now I'm mad again for remembering it.

I killed the small satyrs, and when the big satyr is about to die, BAM, BH steals it, he goes back to the offlane, gets lvl 2 and starts herrassing me in the woods, so I our rubick support to get sentries (he had money I didn't) come kill him with me (I was level 3 and put 2 points in malefice so we can do it), he doesn't come. I buy sentries, still no help, not from rubick nor puck, and  I said \"ty rubick\".

Because he disclosed a series of documents about a secretive government operation that will likely aid foreign terrorist organizations who will now avoid using the services of U.S. based internet firms abroad who were giving data about their users en masse to the NSA. The US government has the power to prosecute him for espionage (which he is guilty of) regardless of whether anyone thinks they should. If PRISM was successful in the past, it will likely be rendered useless after Snowden's disclosure.

{"body": "Microprinting is some of the best stuff that had saved my butt in loss prevention. If a check says \"MP\" on the signature line, [you'll notice it's not a solid line, but a repeating text of \"Authorized signature only\"](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/35/106853264_50950380ea_z.jpg?zz=1). Nearly all the fake checks I've dealt with include the MP but use a solid line. Thank goodness for microprinting.\n\nNot sure about the new California ID's, but the old ones the seal of California contains a ship. The hull of the ship (bottom line) is not a complete line. It's sort of randomly perforated... I don't know how counterfeiters missed this, but they always did. I've helped to but HUGE theft rings on this fact.\n\nMore mildly interesting facts: Unless the crook is a chump, fake fifties and hundos are rare. 10's and 20's are where it's at. If it were my business I'd train cashiers to examine medium bill and watch for sleight of hand cons with big bills. Most fake ID's fail at the fundamental step of simply choosing the wrong font. Seriously. Collect enough fakes and show your ID checkers that the state owns a proprietary anti-counterfeiting font and to be a font snob, like half of the Internet is already. Fake ID's also usually fail a tolerance test, that is they are thinner or thicker than real ID's. Bend your own ID around a little and try a fakie. Finally most fake bills exhibit a red tint, which sucks, because the most counterfeit bill is a 10-spot, which naturally exhibits a red tint.

{"body": "I was just being sarcastic, and changed my answer to something better.\n\n**SOME OF MY PROBLEMS WITH FINANCIAL ABORTIONS (AKA \"I'M ALL FOR EQUALITY AND THIS ISN'T IT\")**\n\n**1. The existence of the responsibility**\n\nWhen a woman aborts a child, the responsibility completely erases itself. It's done. Forever. No one else needs to worry about the potential child. When a man financially aborts, the responsibility doesn't go away. Instead, it's simply shifted.\n\n**2. The availability**\n\nNot all women can get abortions due to reasons medical and political.\n\nMedical reasons are as follows: If you have a blood clotting disorder, if you have heart problems, liver problems, or kidney problems, if you're taking any medications that should not be combined with the medications used in medication abortion (mifepristone or misoprostol), or if you've had a molar pregnancy.\n\nThe political reasons essentially boil down to uptight legislators in red states coming up with ways to circumvent Roe v. Wade because Jesus said so. These legislators want to make it as difficult as possible for women to get an abortion, while still technically complying with federal law, *and they're successful!* These strategies are (but are not limited to): ridiculous waiting periods (for an abortion. I know, right?), being forced to watch brainwashing anti-choice videos prior to the abortion, different ideas on what constitutes \"pregnant\" (looking at you, Arizona), closing abortion clinics, having a big angry mob outside abortion clinics, and sometimes the nearest abortion clinic is 500 miles away. Also, the US doesn't have universal healthcare, and abortions are expensive. Sure, every woman can get an abortion, if they can afford it.\n\nIf \"financial abortion\" is legislated on a national level, all men would be able to get financial abortions even though not all women can get regular abortions in the first place.\n\n**3. The gender neutrality of child support**\n\nBelieve it or not, child support doesn't pay for everything. It pays for only a fraction of what needs to get paid for. Who pays for the rest? The other parent.\n\nPaying for the child's stuff was never a man's \"thing\" to the same extent as pregnancy is a woman's \"thing\". That's both parents. Both parents are financially responsible for the child. You think single mothers who get child support don't spend their own money on their children, too? The average amount of child support ordered per month in the US towards single mothers is $400 a month. That's about $13 a day, which, in grown-up terms, is a few peanuts and a bottle cap. (Keep in mind, that's how much the courts *order*. The mother might receive even less). There's no way a child can live off of that alone. The rest of the money is coming from the woman's own pocket.\n\n**4. The gender exclusivity of child support**\n\nChild support isn't discrimination against men. If anything, it's discrimination against the person who makes the most money in the relationship (THANKS OBAMA). 10% of child support obligors are women. In other words, *a higher percentage of women pay child support today than men who have, are, or will ever get pregnant*. That's right, sometimes women pay child support! Do women qualify for financial abortions?\n\nIf financial abortion *is* an option for those women, it's a spit in the face to stay-at-home dads, hardly \"levels the playing field\", and can potentially make people even more stratified as far as you're concerned.\n\nOn the other hand, refusing to allow financial abortions to anyone who got pregnant can be seen as discrimination against a certain group of people, in direct violation of the 14th Amendment. Your motive is no longer \"people should have control over their own money/life/rights!\" as much as it is clawing and scratching in vein for a synthetic, male-equivalent to abortion in an attempt at equalizing biology a la Harrison Bergeron. Men can't have abortions, not because they're not allowed to, but because there's a biophysicical incapability for them to get pregnant in the first place. Women, albeit capable, are legally barred from having financial abortions because it's too mean.\n\nIn other words, choose your poison.\n\nIf men were, are, and always will be *exclusively* the ones paying child support, you might have a point. But they're not.\n\n**5. The end result (with government safety nets)**\n\nIf \"financial abortions\" becomes enacted in legislation, and more and more people are freed from paying for their kids, guess who will pay for them? The government. Maybe the father shouldn't be responsible for a kid he didn't want, but he holds a higher responsibility for it than the  taxpayers, that's for sure. The obligee will account for this when they pick up their social security checks, and then the financial burden is transferred from the deadbeat parent to the state. This situation will become commonplace if financial abortions become legislated, thus forcing welfare to get spread thinner and thinner, perhaps forcing committees to allocate resources from somewhere else into social security.\n\nIn other words, with an abortion, only the person who had the abortion is negatively affected. With financial abortion, the obligee, the children, everyone who has ever payed taxes, and everyone who's on welfare are all negatively affected. If this is equality, I'll eat my shirt.\n\n**6. The end result (with no government safety nets)**\n\n*(This talks about kids who don't have enough money, so it sorta violates the \"except that rule!\" rule, but I thought I'd go into what might happen if financial abortion was placed in with the abolition of welfare for the parents.)*\n\nSome people in certain political ideologies wouldn't want any of their taxpayer dollars going to children they didn't father. What would happen in a hypothetical world where none of this was socialized? Supporting \"financial abortion\" without the taxpayers picking up the slack *also* shows a severe lack of forethought.\n\nThe end result of abortion being legal isn't anything that hurts anybody else (If you thinks abortions lead to promiscuity, I said *hurts* anybody else. Too much sex doesn't hurt, unless you're into that sort of thing). However, if men got financial abortions, and welfare for the parents were abolished, there would be an influx of children without the bottles they need, the diapers they need, the blankets they need, the food they need, the clothes they need, the school supplies they need, the college funds they need, etc…\n\nThe mother has a child because she wanted to. Fair enough. However, if single parents are deemed as the only people responsible for their child in a world like this, it can have serious consequences. People are people, and just because parents *think they can* take care of a child on their own doesn't mean they *will*. What if it didn't work out as well as they thought, even though they tried really hard? Are they just stuck with no help at all? Is the deterioration of their child's health and safety due to the lack of resources a \"punishment\" for simply setting your hopes too high? Not in my book.\n\nPeople who pay child support know the stress of finding a job more than anything, but at least they're a phone call away from fixing the problem, albeit temporarily.\n\n**QUESTIONS**\n\nIf you support financial abortions, would you still support it for a couple where no pregnancy was involved? Sometimes couples adopt, get divorced, and the man has to pay child support. Is that unethical? Does simply having custody also mean you have 100% of the responsibility?\n\nWhat about with gay couples? Can the man who would've paid child support financially abort even though his partner didn't get pregnant? Can a woman financially abort if her partner was the one who got pregnant? What if the woman who got pregnant isn't the one with custody? How does this all fit outside heterosexual relationships?\n\nIf you think financial abortions should be enacted only in cases where there is a pregnancy, is the father allowed to leave at any time, or only within the time frame an abortion can take place? What if the woman tried to get an abortion and couldn't? What if abortion clinics aren't available where the couple lives? Should financial abortions only be enacted in areas where abortion clinics are available? What if the woman is physically incapable of getting an abortion? Can a financial abortion be enacted then? Financial abortions might cause an influx of women to get abortions when they wouldn't have had one otherwise. Is that important to you? Why or why not? Financial abortions might also cause mothers to keep their pregnancy a secret from the fathers until it's too late. How would you prevent this from happening?\n\nIf you think men and men only should get financial abortions, what constitutes a \"man\"? Only cismen? Can transgendered men qualify? Are transgendered women barred? How would this all fit outside the gender binary?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372612952", "subreddit": "AskFeminists", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
