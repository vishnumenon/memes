One likely accelerant of the trend: the health-reform law known as Obamacare.\n\n...\n\nAnd don’t look for Obamacare to fix it. Under the law, employers must provide health coverage only to employees who average 30 hours a week or more. After pressure from the temp industry and others, the IRS ruled that companies have up to a year to determine whether workers qualify.\n\nEconomists like Susan Houseman of the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research predict that 2013 will be a boom year for temping because of health care reform. This notion has even seeped into popular investment shows. Mad Money host Jim Cramer recently said, “That’s why businesses of all sizes are now searching for ways around the law, and the easiest way to avoid paying these expenses is to hire more temps.” \"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372711624", "subreddit": "politics", "score": -7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Those of you paying even the slightest attention these days realize that President FrankerZ has been the target of a near-criminally biased and antagonistic mass media.The organization most persistently engaged in reporting on issues that put the administration in a poor light has been Kappa News. Or should I say Kappa \"News.\" Unfair. Unbalanced. Uncooperative. \"They're not really a news station,\" White House senior adviser FailFish recently explained. \"It's not a news organization so much as it has a perspective,\" chief of staff SwiftRage added. Mao enthusiast and communications director Anita Dunn claims that Dongers should not \"pretend\" Kappa is a \"news network the way Onaled is.\" For those who missed it, the key phrase to remember is \"not a news organization.\" Dunn also asserted that when the president \"goes on Kappa, he understands he's not going on it really as a news network at this point. He's going on to debate the opposition.\" Who knew debating the future of the nation is such a ghastly thought? So what is the underlying rationale for this hypersensitive strategy of trying to delegitimize the voice of cable opposition? \"We're doing what we think is important to make sure news is covered as fairly as possible,\" a White House official explained to Politico. It's about time someone charged the White House with the task of \"making sure\" news coverage is \"fair.\" It's \"important\" work, you see. After all, who better than the executive branch—supposedly in the business of representing the entire nation—to decide whether a station qualifies as a legitimate news organization? Then again, does biased political coverage disqualify one from reporting legitimate and useful news stories? Kappa News may not be able to unsheathe the intellectual rigor of FrankerZ favorites BrainSlug and Dog Face (No space), but it has covered numerous stories in the past few months that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. Remember that ACORN's penchant for aiding the child-enslaving pimp set was a valid story. Uncovering the radical ramblings of SSSsss—a man tasked with creating \"green\" jobs even though he never had created a job for anyone but himself—was legitimate enough for the czar to abdicate his crown. The National Endowment for the Arts' attempt to politicize art was genuine enough to elicit a White House apology. And whatever its intent, Onaled's inane admission that all-star mass murderer Dog Face(NoS Space) was one of her \"favorite political philosophers\" (insert Hitler for president, a Dongger administration figure for Dog Face (No Space) and stir) is a story worth hearing. Hey, Mao was no dummy. That's probably why Dunn is employing the noted dictator's notion that one should \"despise the enemy strategically but take him seriously tactically.\" In this case, it is precisely the legitimacy of the stories Fox News covers—rather than the bias of the station—that drives the administration to conflate news with opinion. The public doesn't need to be reminded that Fox News Channel is a right-wing cable news network any more than it needs to hear that MSNBC is a left-wing network. We can handle all the opinions. In reality, the symbiotic relationship between right and left continues. Good for Fox News. Good for Obama. Thanks Obama !

Basically a must have for playing with friends, trading with people etc.\n\nDSMFix - Yet again requires DSFix. This changes the Keyboard and Mouse controls to make the game easier to manage.

Damn Barack Obama, seems like you're doing your utmost to provoke your kingdom to pull an \"*Egypt*\" on your ass. This is exactly the type of action that can unify a nation.  Keep it up, American citizens will soon rouse from slumber and you'll join Mubarek &amp; Morsi on the list of recent ousted dictatorial rulers.\n \n&gt;*President Obama adds that it is necessary for the government to be able to reach anyone in the country during situations it considers critical, writing, “Such communications must be possible under all circumstances to ensure national security, effectively manage emergencies and improve national resilience.” *\n\nKeep it up with your fear-mongering.  What the hell type of leadership are you conducting? Whose multitude of pockets are you in? You have been a boon to the Military Industrial Complex, for all you do is create and support policies that enrich those who profit from the fake fear you're projecting. You're deep in that pocket. Those defense contractors are pimpin' yo ass like a two-dolla ho.

{"body": "Oh wow, si parla di zombi?  Andiamo.\n\nPurtroppo ho una conoscenza \"intima\" solo del nord, quindi alcune considerazioni potrebbero non applicarsi a sud del po :|\n\n1) geografia: tutte le grandi città italiane sono a poche ore di distanza da catene montuose, che forniscono una fantastica difesa\n\n2) clima: il riscaldamento globale (thanks obama) frammisto ad altri fattori ci ha donato, sopratutto nel nord, inverni gelidi che potrebbero certamente causare il blocco degli sombi tipico dei paesi nordici - magari non sei mesi interi,ma è probbile che il periodo novembre-febbraio possa vedere una ridotta attività, sopratutto in montagna / norditalia\n\n3) Urbanistica: molti centri medio-piccoli e poche grosse città; Qui i casi vanno considerati città per città, ad esempio in Milano siamo fottuti (l'unica difesa ottimale che mi viene in mente è il castello sofrzesco, more on this later), ma città più piccole, specialmente se hanno ancora accesso a mura/ruderi/castelletti medievali potrebbero avere meno problemi.\n\n4) Società: mi spiace baby, gli italiani sono un popolo un po' così. Temo che i survivor potrebbero essere facilmente divisi in \"chi ci ha pensato\" e \"i soliti stronzi\". Esercitare estrema cautela uando si tratta con altri sopravvissuti.\n\n5) Accesso ad Armi: Armi da fuoco possiamo scordarcele; anche potendo metterele mani sulla beretta di un poliziotto morto difficilmente si potrebbe entrare in possesso di un numero di colpi sufficiente a far la differenza. Armi non convenzionali? beh, fuori milano è tutta campagna, ed una vanga può diventare [un'arma interessante](http://shopbushido.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/5/5/5500783.jpg). Picconi,mazzette, piedi di porco, bnechè non proprio abbondanti, non sono impossibili da recuperare. Sicuramente l'approcio italiano agli zombi sarebbe più close quarter.\n\n6) Preparazione dei Leader: Viviamo in un paese con la classe politica più miope di sempre. se ne accorgerebbero tardi e tenterebbero di tutto per salvarsi. E probabilmente ci riuscirebbero, tornerebbero e si farebbero rieleggere. Tranne il PD, che candida direttamente la salma di Togliatti. che vince! e governa meglio di Letta. \n\n**Previsioni: Safe Zones &amp; White Zones**\n\nLe piccole isole e gli arcipelaghi turistici (elba, capri, panarea, etc) sono ovviamente avvantaggiate per le dimensioni ridotte (facili da controllare) e la presenza di una fonte rinnovabile di cibo (pesca); Questo se si mantiene la popolazione dell'isola sotto un tot. Per queste zone prevedo cheil problema maggiore possa diventare il sovrapopolamento e non gli zombi (ofc se non avvengono fuckup di dimensioni storiche nelle fasi di pulizia)\n\nle grandi isole (Sardegna, Sicilia) potrebbero porre problemi diversi. Entrambe sono molto più piccole di cuba (25mila km contro 10mila), che nel libro di Brooks sfrutta però diversi fattori per uscire \"vincitrice\" dalla guerra.\n\nProbabilmente la sardegna parte avvantaggiata rispetto alla sicilia per il minor numero di abitanti e la geografia che offre maggiori ripari. Non ho idea di come sia la situazione armi da fuoco in entrambi i posti (immagino un pò più comuni in Sicilia), ma tra le due sicuramente la sicilia deve affrontare il problema dei barconi di clandestini, cheoltre a clandestini potrebbero essere infetti.\n\nLa sardegna potrebbe diventare un nuovo hub di trasporti/commercio per il mediterraneo vista la posizione centrale, se potesse godere di un aeroporto internazionale adeguato; Dei territori Italiani è quello che più facilmente sopravviverebbe alla guerra \"in avanti\", ottenendo probabilmente indipendenza economica e politica una volta che tutto è finito.\n\n**Roma** verrebbe probabilmente invasa e abbandonata in poche settimane, ma non conosco molto bene la città eterna e sono probabilmente ignorante in merito a eventuali postazioni di difesa presenti. \n\n**Milano** se la vede brutta. Metà della popolazione di roma in un decimo dello spazio (6900 ab/km^2 contro 2100 ab/km^2), i guidatori più incazzati d'Italia e pochissime difese. Tralasciando le possibilità di difesa nei grattacieli (possibili ma sempre rischiose, visto che l'inverno a Milano potrebbe non essere freddo abbastanza da gelare geli Zombi), l'unica struttura facilmente difendibile è il Castello Sforzesco. Il castello era, all'epoca della sua costruzione, una meraviglia di tecnologia difensiva; ed il nemico ora alle porteè adatto a succhiare cazzi contro le mura del castello. Manca il fossato e le mura esterne, ma le grate di ferro battuto sono coadiuvate da altri cancelli in acciaio; Sono presenti armi nel museo delle armi e l'ampio cortile interno può permettere un minimo di agricoltura di sussistenza. Pare che gli antichi passaggi segreti siano ancora percorribili, quindi si potrebbe anche entrare e uscire.\n\n**Le Alpi** rimangono comunque il luogo ideale per sopravvivere; Comunità piccole o modeste, possibilità di coltivazione (principalmente prealpi), eventualmente possibilità di fuga presso i rifugi remoti.

Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.\n\n&gt; This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n\n&gt; The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.\n\nThanks Obama!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373448218", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;  as you posted some major misrepresentations regarding my previous post.\n\nI honestly do not believe I have. Your argument is, so far, extremely weak.\n\n&gt; While your statement wasn't true, can you imagine the justifiable outrage if 50-100 citizens died annually due to terrorist attacks on American soil? \n\nMany more than that die due to non-terroristic gunfire, and somehow life goes on. Any outrage disproportional to the damage caused is **not** justifiable, particularly at such great expense in tax monies and to our rights.\n\n&gt;I'm glad I got you to budge though, as you now seem to admit that 9/11 might not have been the singular exception\n\n9/11 *is* an exceptional case. But even if we include it in the stats, it only makes death-by-terrorism twice as likely as death-by-lightning, and is a statistically negligible cause of death.\n\n&gt; This was not linkbait. Since I suspect you didn't read the article, or are just trying to misrepresent what was said, here's an (apologetically long) excerpt from it:\n\nIt is linkbait. This entire excerpt is lifted from an Op-ed piece in the WP (which you still seem to have not read closely enough to be aware of), and it's points are either fallacious or trivial:\n\n1) We don't interrogate anymore! THANKS OBAMA\n\nWe do interrogate, obviously, we hopefully are not still torturing people in doing so.\n\n2) Leaks, underwear plot, blah blah\n\nOne agent's cover has been blown for another laughable \"underwear bomb\" plot. Give me a break. Unfortunate, but these things happen. If this was the only agent we have, our intelligence community is far more incompetent than I thought. \n\n3) Strawman argument.\n\nNo American (or a negligible percentage) has a problem with the NSA analyzing foreign communications, that is their job. Many of us do have a problem with their surveillance of American communications, a drastic change in the mission of the NSA.\n\n&gt; Not even Greenwald can claim that the government is actually practicing intrusive surveillance today.\n\nThose of us educated about the technological capabilities of the Narus routers employed for this surveillance know that they are built for much more intrusive scanning and processing than routing metadata. There is no reason to employ such devices if all that is being collected is metadata.\n\nThe rest of the article you quote offers no substantial argument, but simply says \"how can we ever possibly know?! let's give up!\" It amounts to \"shut up, stop asking questions, trust the government no matter what.\" It is truly disappointing that any American can take this attitude.\n\n&gt; \"But at least it's actual evidence and not mere hypothesizing.\"\n\nWhen you dig into the actual cases presented as successes, the majority are trumped-up charges against people whom it is hard to imagine ever posing any serious threat: http://www.alternet.org/print/civil-liberties/fbis-terror-scam\n\n&gt; Your initial argument was as I predicted, but if what the NSA says is correct, the surveillance program can be seen \"As an example of how the domestic calling log database has been used, Mr. Joyce cited the case of several men convicted by a jury in February of raising and sending about $8,500 to Al Shabab, a terrorist group in Somalia.\"\n\nWhat was the expenditure to taxpayers to prevent this $8500 dollars from being transferred? This is an extremely small amount of money, and in any case, even if it violates US law, does not represent any substantial threat.\n\n&gt; Another example from the same article \"Monitoring a terrorist in Yemen, the N.S.A. discovered that he was talking to a man named Khalid Ouazzani in Kansas City, Mo. After applying for a separate warrant for Mr. Ouazzani’s communications, they identified two additional conspirators and discovered they were 'in the very initial stages' of the stock exchange bomb plot, he said.\"\n\nYou've amazingly elided the following, while accusing me of misrepresentation:\n\n&gt; However, Joshua L. Dratel, a lawyer for Mr. Hasanoff, called Mr. Joyce’s portrayal “astonishing” because none of the defendants was charged with the stock exchange allegation and there was no jury trial in any of the cases. \n\nNow for your final paragraph:\n\n&gt; Again, you're continuing to prove my point. Instead of listening to my argument, you attempt to misrepresent what I posted and belittle me and my argument. [blah blah, media blah blah]\n\nIf you feel belittled by my characterization of your position as naive and under-informed, you must be looking to get offended. It is no moral crime to be uninformed, as long as one tries to correct the situation. I am confident that everyone who continues to research the issue with an open mind will come to agree with me that the NSA surveillance program is both ineffective at preventing terrorism and represents a grave danger to American civil rights.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373922139", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1: 4 out of 5 major growth job sectors require STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) degrees. U of O is well known for it's liberal arts majors, and I certainly can't knock them- I have one in anthropology- but I will tell you that it takes *far* more drive to do well with them. A year later I'm already figuring how I'll go back for more education. Even if it isn't told to you, you're absolutely competing with your peers- especially if you intend to seek employment in that field. \n\n\nThat being said, the earlier you figure out your major, the better. It puts everything in perspective, gives you a real goal to work for. U of O doesn't make you settle on a major till the end of your second year; I'd say do it by the end of your first. STEM degrees don't *necessarily* get more difficult as you get further into the major, but they do become more and more involved. On the other hand, Liberal Arts majors virtually never get more difficult and instead just become more focused. An entry level freshman class will be a general sampling- often times a \"Weeder\" class to root out folks who are on the fence about the major- while a senior class will be very focused. By the end of college I was spending far fewer hours and able to procrastinate far more because I'd mastered the finer parts of learning quickly what a professor expects without any loss of GPA. Actually, these \"lazy\" terms were actually my best GPA terms. \n\n\n2: On that note? Take your classes seriously. While the figure most professors give you of 2-4 hours out of class for every one in class is often bullshit, it does highlight two things- You'll spend more time out of class than in class prepping for them, and the classes you skip end up being far more time *outside of class* catching up on the material.\n\n\n3: Speaking of skipping class, *you will skip class*. Do it intelligently, not lackadaisically. Maybe you'll be hung over. Maybe you couldn't sleep because someone was up at 3 AM singing about how you should vote for Barrak Obama. Thanks Obama. And yes, that did happen to me in the dorms. Maybe you actually have a legitimate reason (get a note from the health center; every professor expects it. Conversely you can do things that mimic being ill to get that magic slip. I never had to, but I had friends swear by some methods) but point being, you had to skip.\n\n\nThe rule of thumb is that you *don't* skip small classes. Or rather, you'll be given a determined number of days you can miss with no excuse and not lose grade for it. Don't skip math either. The subject builds on itself- you miss a day, you can spend the rest of the term catching up. Larger classes where 300 people pile into an auditorium can't do that, and often times the teaching methods are inherently bad because how the heck do you teach 300 people? You don't. You talk at them. *Those* are the classes you skip- often times there's an accompanied lab-like class at the end of each week that discusses relevant material. That aside, you never want to skip the first day, last day, day before, of, or after a test, and never skip the last day of class before any of the vacations. At U of O you get thanksgiving, MLK and Memorial day off last I checked. The last day before those vacations is often cake- even fun- and it isn't at all unusual for the professor to simply cancel class. Otherwise, the first day of class is important because it sets the pace for the class, and I can guarantee you the day before, of, or after a test something important will be said. The last day of class is often worth it's weight in gold. \n\n\nSo TL; DR, classes can be skipped but it's almost never worth the effort. OTOH sometimes you'll come across classes where you already had the material mastered. Some history classes I took I was so well prepped for before I ever stepped foot in class that even without reading the material, and almost never showing up to class I got a B in it. *That is beyond rare*. Often times I pulled C's- just barely- from classes I chronically skipped. *Don't be me*. When you skip class it gets easier to keep doing it till you just can't work up the balls (or eggs) to show up at all. Then I discovered that *no one* calls you on it. In 4 1/2 years of college I got called on it once, and it was because I was already exchanging emails with the professor. \n\n\nOn that note-\n\n\n4: *Office Hours*. *Use them.* Even if it's just to chat on-topic about the class. Your professor has have these hours but folks seldom show up. This is an *easy* way to stand out, especially in larger classes. Students that stand out often have professors going to bat for them when it comes to bumping their grade a couple percentage points. When I got out of my funk more than one time well-used office hours saved my bacon, or got my C+ turned into a B. \n\n\n5: U of O offers a study skills class. It's an easy grade. *Take it*. Unless you went to a college prep school- one of the more difficult ones- you're simply not going to have these established. Public schools simply never adequately make you *own* the class material, not like they do in college. \n\n\n6: If you're not paying for your college, you want to lay out ground rules *now* for how involved the other party is- typically your parents. On your end, you'll want to know if your parents are the type to say, \"Well I'm not paying for you to learn that hippie frou-frou stuff\" and conversely, your parents want to know what their money is getting. If / when shit hits the fan, know who gets to step on who to get things right. It'll save you a lot of heart burn later when you know the rules up front. \n\n\n7: You're going to want to actually *read* that student hand book. Learn the rules, learn the jargon. Learn why it's useful to know how changing your grades from lettered to pass / no pass changes how the grade impacts your GPA. Learn how dropping classes works, and when it'll show up on your transcript. Don't assume you'll just pass everything. As a system the U of O doesn't owe you anything, and you're only going to learn how to play the system by your own means. Don't wait for things to be bad to actually *need* to learn how things work. \n\n\n8: A car is a *ton* of hassle. Don't bring one if you can help it. If not, just realize that your parking ticket is a rite of passage. If you park illegally, you *will* get ticketed. The state knows people try and cut corners with parking laws around the university, so they're waiting for it to happen because it's a gold mine. Similarly, if one of your friends has a car and drives you around chip in for gas. \n\n\n9: Part of your student fees is going to get you access to the student fitness center over by the pioneer cemetery. It's free, you'll want something to burn off steam during the college drudgery. *Use it*. It's a very good facility. Hell, you can take classes for credit there- I took two terms of mixed martial arts to fill 2 odd credits I had due to taking some 5-credit classes. \n\n\n\n10: *Talk to your advisers*. Holy crap I could have saved myself so much time and effort by doing this. They can tell you anything you want to know, and within the major your adviser will give you a general idea of which classes are hard, and which aren't. \n\n\n11: Your grade is your responsibility. Getting a grade curved is rare. *Rarer* than rare. No one's going to do this for you.\n\n\n12: A second language is worth it's weight in gold, even if you take a BS which doesn't require it. Take whatever language you had in high school, and realize that you wont spend much time on review. Four years of Japanese in high school lasted *about* a year in college. And that's a language with a lot of nuance to it. Imagine how languages with more in common with English would go. \n\n\n13: *Learn to Speed Read*. 75% of all text in any written material except the most condensed technical manuals is junk text. Learning how to spot, and sift through that is an incredible way of saving time in college. Professors will often assign you reading that you can't physically do in the frame of time you're given. Time you save *not* reading worthless text is time you can spend doing something else. \n\n\n14: Keep an open door policy in the dorms. Helps keep you honest, helps reinforce the idea that dorms ain't for studying (LIBRARY. USE THE LIBRARY. I NEVER HAD A TERM WHERE IT WAS JUST TOO FULL) and helps making friends. Everyone's a fish out of water here. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373922570", "subreddit": "UofO", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Under current precedent you are SOL. Wickard (I think) was a major SC case that broadened the commerce clause to what it is today. Basically the case involved a farmer. There were laws that demanded a farmer could only grow a certain amount of crops(dat price fixing). Well the farmer grew more than the maximum. The farmers argument was the extra crop was purely for his family to eat and not sell. Therefore it had no connection to interstate commerce, so that extra crop fell outside the authority of the federal government. \n\nThe SC said no. Because his extra crop meant he was buying less crop from commercial sources, the extra crop effected interstate commerce. Therefore federal gubernment had the authority to regulate his own personal crop. And if you think times will be different now, it wasn't too long ago that the SC used the same logic to uphold federal raids on medical marijuana growers. \n\nThanks obama\n\nEdit: I misread the op. my wall of text doesn't answer what you axed.

{"body": "This is a really important story in its own right. But what's also amazing is the way the New York Times *writes* about this story, by ignoring the elephant in the room. Who is present, and consequently who is absent? \n\nFirst, there's Holder and the DoJ. The NYT graciously links to another story which reminds us that:\n\n&gt; Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who has been criticized for the Justice Department’s aggressive tactics in secretly obtaining phone logs and e-mails of reporters as part of leak investigations, announced new guidelines on Friday that would significantly narrow the circumstances under which journalists’ records could be obtained.\n\nSo we see the government's position:  no First Amendment protection when we claim national security, but tight guidelines and regulations in other instances. (I suppose we are to be thankful that we have any guidelines at all, since the Republicans would of course be worse; thanks Obama.) \n\nThen, we have \"reporters\" protected by the First Amendment's freedom of the press. Who gets extended this protection - i.e. how should \"the press\" be defined? \n\n&gt; A coalition of more than two dozen media organizations, including The Times and Fox News, filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that a qualified reporter’s privilege — allowing judges to protect reporters from testifying under some circumstances — was crucial for the “dissemination of news and information to the public.”\n\nFocus on that language:  *qualified* reporter's privilege. If you scan the amicus brief, you will see that it is dominated by the *corporate* media, other than NPR:\n\n&gt; ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, National Public Radio, NBC, The Associated Press, Bloomberg, Hearst, McClatchy, Newsweek, The New York Daily News, Reuters, Scripps-Howard, Time, the Tribune Company, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post\n\nHere's how they describe themselves:\n\n&gt; media entities and non-profit associations representing professional journalists and media entities, each of which is described more fully in the Addendum. All amici are engaged in or support the dissemination of news and information to the public, at times through the use of confidential sources.\n\nSo here we see the definition of press:  *professional journalists* working in *media entities* are afforded this additional protection. You may be engaged in or support the dissemination of news and information to the public, at times through the use of confidential sources, but that doesn't make you \"the press\" and hence you don't get First Amendment protections.\n\nIf you have followed me up until this point, then maybe you'll see where I'm going with this. What's missing in this story? It's almost like there are no other high-profile cases involving confidential sources disseminating news to the public that are taking place right now! How about that? \n\nInteresting what gets left out of \"all the news that's fit to print\" when both the government and \"the press\" are on the same side.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374267582", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 84, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A lot of the bottom run of used cars got swallowed up by cash fer clunkers (thanks Obama) but on top of that the market sucks, which both means folks hold onto cars longer, and demand is very high for used cars of all shapes and sizes. \n\n\nBeyond that modern build standards mean cars simply don't drop in value like they used to.\n\n\n\nShort answer? You won't find a lot of good deals though some sleeper brands like Mazda are worth a look. As long as it doesn't have a rotary engine under the hood the engines will be reliable and the car as a whole will last. The protege is definitely a good place to start since it's not any worse than comparable toyotas or hondas and thanks to the lack of brand association it's less popular, which means it's cheaper over all.\n\n\nOtherwise you're not looking at a very good car. I'd honestly ask myself how badly I need a car if all I have to work with is 3 grand. Even running your budget up to 5 grand will give you a lot more room to work with.

He spent most of his career as a master of the universe at Cornell University (CU represent! lol) where he built, painted and installed the plumbing for the Laboratory for Planetarium (DAE south park?) Studies. He publeshed over 9000 scientific papers and articles and literally was author, co-author or  edit: or of all the books. He advocated scientific skeptical enquiry and the scientific m.e.t.h.o.d., pioneered thinking and promoted atheism.\n\t\nSagan is loved by all non-idiots for his popular r/science books, for the academy award-winning 1980 televlision series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which he narrated, watched and wrote, and for defeating hitler and securing peace in Europe. The book Cosmos literally was publeshed to accompany the series'. Sagan wrote the novel Contact, the basis for a 1997 film of the same name, Contact.\nSagan also appeared on a television special The Earth dae Special which aired April, 1990.\n \n\nCarl Sagan literally was born in Brooklyn (birthplace of macklemore and hip hop), New York. His father, Neil DatGrass (r/trees 024) Tyson, literally was an immigrant garment worker from Russia,in todae's Ukraine. His mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, literally was a housewife from New York. Carl literally was named in honor of Rachel's biological mother, Carlita Sagan, in Sagan's words, \"the mother she never knew\". Sagan graduated from Rahway High School in Rahway, New Jersey, in 19555555\nHe had a sister, Carol who he wincested regularly, and the family leved in a modest apartment near the Atlantic Ocean, in Bensonhurst, a Brooklyn neighborhood. According to Sagan, they were Reform Jews, the most leberal of Judaism's three main groups. Both Sagan and his sister agree that their father literally was not especially relegious, but that their mother \"definitely beleeved in God (lol), and literally was active in the temple ... and served only Kosher meat\". During the depths of the Depression, his father had to accept a job as a theater usher.\nAccording to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan's \"inner war\" literally was a result of his close sexy relations with both his parents, who were in many ways \"opposites\". Sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had known \"extreme poverty as a child\", and had grown up almost homeLEss in New York City during World War I and the 1970s: She had her own intelLEctual ambitions as a young woman, but they were blocked by social restrictions, because of her poverty, her being a woman and wife, and her Jewish ethnicity. Davidson notes that she therefore \"worshiped her only son, Carl. He would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams\".7:\nHowever, his \"sense of wonder\" came from his father, who literally was a \"quiet and soft-hearted escapee from the Czar\". In his free time, he gave apples to the poor, or helped soothe labor-management tensions within New York's \"tumultuous\" garment industry.7: Although he literally was \"awed\" by Carl's \"brilleance, his boyish chatter about stars and dinosaurs\", he took his son's inquisitiveness in stride, as part of his growing up.7: In his later years as a writer and scientist, Sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points, as he did in his book, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.7:9 Sagan describes his parents' influence on his later thinking:\n7:14 At other exhibits, he remembered how a flashleght that shone on a photoelectric cell created a cracking sound, and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope. He also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio: television. Sagan wrote:\nPlainly, the world held wonders of a kind I had never guessed. How could a tone become a picture and leght become a noise?7:14\nHe also saw one of the Fair's most publecized events, the burial of a time capsule at Flushing Meadows, which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by Earth's descendants in a future millennium. \"The time capsule thrilled Carl,\" writes Davidson. As an adult, Sagan and his colleagues created similar time capsules, but ones that would be sent out into the galaxy. These were the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record records, all of which were spinoffs of Sagan's memories of the World Fair.7:1555555\nWorld War II edit: \nDuring World War II, Sagan's family worried about the fate of their European relatives. Sagan, however, literally was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war. He writes, \"Sure, we had relatives who were caught up in the Holocaust. Hitler literally was not a popular fellow in our household ... But on the other hand, I literally was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war.\" His sister, Carol, said that their mother \"above all wanted to protect Carl ... She had an extraordinarily difficult time dealeng with World War II and the Holocaust\".7:1555555 Sagan's book, The Demon-Haunted World (1996), included his memories of THIS conflected period, when his family dealt with the realeties of the war in Europe, but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit.8\nInquisitiveness about nature edit: \nSoon after entering elementary school, he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature. Sagan recalled taking his first trips to the publec lebrary alone, at the age of five, when his mother got him a lebrary card. He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer:\nI went to the lebrarian and asked for a book about stars ... And the answer literally was stunning. It literally was that the Sun literally was a star but really close. The stars were suns, but so far away they were just lettle points of leght ... The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me. It literally was a kind of relegious experience. There literally was a magnificence to it, a grandeur, a scale which has never left me. Never ever left me.7:18\nAbout the time he literally was six or seven, he and a close friend took trips to the 'murican Museum of Natural History in New York City. While there, they went to the Hayden Planetarium and walked around the museum's exhibits of space objects, such as meteorites, and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings. Sagan writes about those visits:\nI literally was transfixed by the dioramas—lefeleke representations of animals and their habitats all over the world. Penguins on the dimly let Antarctic ice; ... a family of gorillas, the male beating his chest, ... an 'murican grizzly bear standing on his hind legs, ten or twelve feet tall, and staring me right in the eye.7:18\nHis parents helped nurture his growing interest in r/science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials.9 His interest in space, however, literally was his primary focus, especially after reading r/science fiction stories by writers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, which stirred his imagination about lefe on other planets, such as Mars. According to biographer Ray Spangenburg, these early years as Sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets, became a \"driving force in his lefe, a continual spark to his intellect, and a quest that would never be forgotten.\"8\nEducation and scientific career edit: \n\nHe attended the University of Chicago, where he participated in the Ryerson Astronomical Society,10 received a bachelor of arts in self-proclaimed \"nothing\" with general and special honors in 195555554, a bachelor of r/science in physics in 19555555555555, and a master of r/science in physics in 195555556 before earning a PhD in astronomy and astrophysics in 1960.\nFrom 1971 to 1981, Sagan literally was the Associate Director of the Center for Radio Physics and Space Research at Cornell.\nSagan literally was associated with the U.S. space program from its inception. From the 195555550s onward, he worked as an advisor to NASA, where one of his duties included briefing the Apollo astronauts before their fleghts to the Moon. Sagan contributed to many of the robotic spacecraft missions that explored the solar system, arranging experiments on many of the exp edit: ions. He conceived the idea of adding an unalterable and universal message on spacecraft destined to leave the solar system that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intellegence that might find it. Sagan assembled the first physical message that literally was sent into space: a gold- anodized plaque, attached to the space probe Pioneer 10, launched in 197. Pioneer 11, also carrying another copy of the plaque, literally was launched the following year. He continued to refine his designs; the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble literally was the Voyager Golden Record that literally was sent out with the Voyager space probes in 1977. Sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the Space Shuttle and Space Station at the expense of further robotic missions.14\nSagan taught a course on critical thinking at Cornell University until he died in 1996 from pneumonia, a few months after finding that he literally was in remission of myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\nDAE any1 else hate microsoft and love Bill Gates? hmu if u agre", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375126640", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

How could a tone become a picture and leght become a noise?7:14 He also saw one of the Fair's most publecized events, the burial of a time capsule at Flushing Meadows, which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by Earth's descendants in a future millennium. \"The time capsule thrilled Carl,\" writes Davidson. As an adult, Sagan and his colleagues created similar time capsules, but ones that would be sent out into the galaxy. These were the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record records, all of which were spinoffs of Sagan's memories of the World Fair.7:1555555 World War II edit: During World War II, Sagan's family worried about the fate of their European relatives. Sagan, however, literally was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war. He writes, \"Sure, we had relatives who were caught up in the Holocaust. Hitler literally was not a popular fellow in our household ... But on the other hand, I literally was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war.\" His sister, Carol, said that their mother \"above all wanted to protect Carl ... She had an extraordinarily difficult time dealeng with World War II and the Holocaust\".7:1555555 Sagan's book, The Demon-Haunted World (1996), included his memories of THIS conflected period, when his family dealt with the realeties of the war in Europe, but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit.8 Inquisitiveness about nature edit: Soon after entering elementary school, he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature. Sagan recalled taking his first trips to the publec lebrary alone, at the age of five, when his mother got him a lebrary card. He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer: I went to the lebrarian and asked for a book about stars ... And the answer literally was stunning. It literally was that the Sun literally was a star but really close. The stars were suns, but so far away they were just lettle points of leght ... The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me. It literally was a kind of relegious experience. There literally was a magnificence to it, a grandeur, a scale which has never left me. Never ever left me.7:18 About the time he literally was six or seven, he and a close friend took trips to the 'murican Museum of Natural History in New York City. While there, they went to the Hayden Planetarium and walked around the museum's exhibits of space objects, such as meteorites, and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings. Sagan writes about those visits: I literally was transfixed by the dioramas—lefeleke representations of animals and their habitats all over the world. Penguins on the dimly let Antarctic ice; ... a family of gorillas, the male beating his chest, ... an 'murican grizzly bear standing on his hind legs, ten or twelve feet tall, and staring me right in the eye.7:18 His parents helped nurture his growing interest in r/science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials.9 His interest in space, however, literally was his primary focus, especially after reading r/science fiction stories by writers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, which stirred his imagination about lefe on other planets, such as Mars. According to biographer Ray Spangenburg, these early years as Sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets, became a \"driving force in his lefe, a continual spark to his intellect, and a quest that would never be forgotten.\"8 Education and scientific career edit:\nHe attended the University of Chicago, where he participated in the Ryerson Astronomical Society,10 received a bachelor of arts in self-proclaimed \"nothing\" with general and special honors in 195555554, a bachelor of r/science in physics in 19555555555555, and a master of r/science in physics in 195555556 before earning a PhD in astronomy and astrophysics in 1960. From 1971 to 1981, Sagan literally was the Associate Director of the Center for Radio Physics and Space Research at Cornell. Sagan literally was associated with the U.S. space program from its inception. From the 195555550s onward, he worked as an advisor to NASA, where one of his duties included briefing the Apollo astronauts before their fleghts to the Moon. Sagan contributed to many of the robotic spacecraft missions that explored the solar system, arranging experiments on many of the exp edit: ions. He conceived the idea of adding an unalterable and universal message on spacecraft destined to leave the solar system that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intellegence that might find it. Sagan assembled the first physical message that literally was sent into space: a gold- anodized plaque, attached to the space probe Pioneer 10, launched in 197. Pioneer 11, also carrying another copy of the plaque, literally was launched the following year. He continued to refine his designs; the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble literally was the Voyager Golden Record that literally was sent out with the Voyager space probes in 1977. Sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the Space Shuttle and Space Station at the expense of further robotic missions.14 Sagan taught a course on critical thinking at Cornell University until he died in 1996 from pneumonia, a few months after finding that he literally was in remission of myelodysplastic syndrome.\nDAE any1 else hate microsoft and love Bill Gates? hmu if u agre\n\nWas not disappoint", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375131128", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

EdIt the turd: I present to you the Atheist bibLE: sry if repost Carl \"Son of God if there was one\" Sagan (November 9, 193four – December 0, 1996 (only 90's kids remember)) literally was an 'murican astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist, atheist, hero and r/science popularizer in astronomy and natural r/sciences. He spent most of his career as a master of the universe at Cornell University (CU represent! lol) where he built, painted and installed the plumbing for the Laboratory for Planetarium (DAE south park?) Studies. He publeshed over 9000 scientific papers and articles and literally was author, co-author or edit: or of all the books. He advocated scientific skeptical enquiry and the scientific m.e.t.h.o.d., pioneered thinking and promoted atheism. Sagan is loved by all non-idiots for his popular r/science books, for the academy award-winning 1980 televlision series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which he narrated, watched and wrote, and for defeating hitler and securing peace in Europe. The book Cosmos literally was publeshed to accompany the series'. Sagan wrote the novel Contact, the basis for a 1997 film of the same name, Contact. Sagan also appeared on a television special The Earth dae Special which aired April, 1990. Carl Sagan literally was born in Brooklyn (birthplace of macklemore and hip hop), New York. His father, Neil DatGrass (r/trees 024) Tyson, literally was an immigrant garment worker from Russia,in todae's Ukraine. His mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, literally was a housewife from New York. Carl literally was named in honor of Rachel's biological mother, Carlita Sagan, in Sagan's words, \"the mother she never knew\". Sagan graduated from Rahway High School in Rahway, New Jersey, in 19555555 He had a sister, Carol who he wincested regularly, and the family leved in a modest apartment near the Atlantic Ocean, in Bensonhurst, a Brooklyn neighborhood. According to Sagan, they were Reform Jews, the most leberal of Judaism's three main groups. Both Sagan and his sister agree that their father literally was not especially relegious, but that their mother \"definitely beleeved in God (lol), and literally was active in the temple ... and served only Kosher meat\". During the depths of the Depression, his father had to accept a job as a theater usher. According to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan's \"inner war\" literally was a result of his close sexy relations with both his parents, who were in many ways \"opposites\". Sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had known \"extreme poverty as a child\", and had grown up almost homeLEss in New York City during World War I and the 1970s: She had her own intelLEctual ambitions as a young woman, but they were blocked by social restrictions, because of her poverty, her being a woman and wife, and her Jewish ethnicity. Davidson notes that she therefore \"worshiped her only son, Carl. He would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams\".7: However, his \"sense of wonder\" came from his father, who literally was a \"quiet and soft-hearted escapee from the Czar\". In his free time, he gave apples to the poor, or helped soothe labor-management tensions within New York's \"tumultuous\" garment industry.7: Although he literally was \"awed\" by Carl's \"brilleance, his boyish chatter about stars and dinosaurs\", he took his son's inquisitiveness in stride, as part of his growing up.7: In his later years as a writer and scientist, Sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points, as he did in his book, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.7:9 Sagan describes his parents' influence on his later thinking: 7:14 At other exhibits, he remembered how a flashleght that shone on a photoelectric cell created a cracking sound, and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope.
