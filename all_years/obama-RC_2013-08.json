{"body": "Oh boy, I wrote a big thing on this forever ago. Here you go!\n\n**Differences between an abortion and a financial abortion:**\n\n**1. The whole freaking idea behind it**\n\nFinancial abortion is based on the premise that if women can \"opt out of parenthood\" via getting abortions, men should be able to \"opt out of parenthood\" too. However, that reason is not *why* abortion is legal.\n\nIt's not because the courts are \"biased against men\", and think only sweet delicate flowers like women can do whatever they want, and big strong men should be a Sisyphean myth. There's no underground conspiracy, so take the tinfoil hats off.\n\nThe reason abortion is legal is because it's her body and she can do what she wants with it (in case you forgot, women get pregnant, not men. Not that I expect MRAs to know much about sex in the first place). Are financial abortions necessary for men to keep their bodily autonomy? Absolutely not. Men have had control over their bodies from the get go. Abortions don't put women ahead, they put women on the same level as men.\n\n**2. The whole freaking impact on the child**\n\nWhen a woman aborts, the child involved is a clump of cells. When a man financially aborts, the child is a living, breathing human.\n\nSome MRAs \"correct\" me by saying the man will make his decision within the time frame in which a woman can get an abortion. And that matters, why? It doesn't matter when you make the decision, because 9 months later we're back to square one, aren't we?\n\nI'll tell you what's going on: The whole reason why MRAs want financial abortion to take place within the time frame an abortion can take place is so they can use their lack of child support as leverage. They're trying to, albeit subtly, bribe women into having abortions when they might not necessarily want one. In case you're an idiot, that's called a \"problem\", and now financial abortion is a perfect catalyst for people to use for blackmail or coercion.\n\n**3. The whole freaking existence of responsibility**\n\nWhen a woman aborts a child, the responsibility completely erases itself. It's done. Forever. No one else needs to worry about the potential child. When a man financially aborts, the responsibility doesn't go away. Instead, all the stuff they could be doing falls into the lap of somebody else.\n\n**4. The whole freaking availability**\n\nNot all women can get abortions due to reasons medical and political.\n\nMedical reasons are as follows: If you have a blood clotting disorder, if you have heart problems, liver problems, or kidney problems, if you're taking any medications that should not be combined with the medications used in medication abortion (mifepristone or misoprostol), or have had known or suspected molar pregnancies.\n\nThe political reasons essentially boil down to uptight legislators in red states coming up with ways to circumvent Roe v. Wade because Jesus said so. These legislators want to make it as difficult as possible for women to get an abortion, while still technically complying with federal law. These strategies are (but are not limited to): ridiculous waiting periods (for an abortion. I know, right?), being forced to watch brainwashing anti-choice videos prior to the abortion, different ideas on what constitutes \"pregnant\" (looking at you, Arizona), closing abortion clinics, having a big angry mob outside abortion clinics, and sometimes the nearest abortion clinic is 500 miles away. Also, the US doesn't have universal healthcare, and abortions are expensive. Sure, every woman can get an abortion, if they can afford it.\n\nIf \"financial abortion\" is legislated on a national level, all men would be able to get financial abortions even though not all women can get regular abortions in the first place.\n\n**5. The whole freaking part of you affected**\n\nA woman's body isn't the same thing as a man's wallet. Writing stuff on a piece of paper once a month is not the same thing as a forced pregnancy.\n\n**6. The whole freaking gender neutrality**\n\nPaying for the kid's stuff isn't a man-only thing, but only women can get pregnant. Paying for the child's stuff was never a man's \"thing\" to the same extent as pregnancy is a woman's \"thing\". That's both parents. Both parents are financially responsible for the child. You think single mothers who get child support don't spend their own money on their children, too? The average amount of child support received per month in the US towards single mothers is $400 a month. That's about $13 a day, which, in grown-up terms, is a few peanuts and a bottle cap. There's no way a child can live off of that alone. The rest of the money is coming from the woman's own pocket.\n\n**7. The whole freaking gender exclusivity.**\n\nChild support isn't discrimination against men. If anything, it's discrimination against the person who makes the most money in the relationship (THANKS OBAMA). 10% of child support obligors are women. In other words, *a higher percentage of women pay child support today than men who have, are, or will ever get pregnant* (provided we keep evolving along the same lines, but I'm sure a \"higher evolved\" form of man would never have to deal with an MRA in the first place). That's right, sometimes women pay child support!\n\nIf financial abortion is an option for those women, it's hardly \"leveling the playing field\" and can potentially make people even more stratified as far as the MRA is concerned.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to deny those women the option of financial abortions because they're women, then your motive isn't as innocent as \"People should have control over their own money!\". Now, your motive is clawing and scratching in vein for a synthetic, male-equivalent to abortion in a Harrison Bergeron-esque attempt at equalizing biology. This violates the 14th Amendment even worse than the contents of the Safe Haven Laws you made up!\n\nIf men were, are, and always will be *exclusively* the ones paying child support, you might have a point. But they're not.\n\n**8. The whole freaking end result (as far as smart people are concerned).**\n\nIf \"financial abortions\" becomes enacted in legislation, and more and more people are freed from paying for their kids, guess who will? The government. The parents without money will account for this when they pick up their social security checks, and then the financial burden is transferred from the deadbeat parent to the state. This situation will become commonplace if financial abortions become a thing, thus forcing welfare to get spread thinner and thinner.\n\nIn other words, with an abortion, only the person who had the abortion is affected. With financial abortion, the obligee, the children, and everyone who's on welfare are all affected. Who isn't affected? The father. SOUNDS EQUAL TO ME.\n\nI wouldn't have as much of a problem with this if the MRM was okay with socializing stuff. Problem is, the majority of MRAs are libertarians, ironic enough. I guess  welfare is only good if it covers your problems.\n\n**9. The whole freaking end result (as far as MRAs are concerned)**\n\nSupporting \"financial abortion\" shows a severe lack of forethought, even if you buy into the MRA's way of thinking.\n\nThe end result of abortion being legal isn't anything that hurts anybody else (If you're an MRA who thinks abortions lead to promiscuity, I said *hurts* anybody else. Too much sex doesn't *hurt*, unless you're into that sort of thing). However, if men got financial abortions, there would be an influx of children without the bottles they need, the diapers they need, the blankets they need, the food they need, the clothes they need, the school supplies they need, the college funds they need, etc…\n\nLike I said before, most MRA's are libertarians. In their ideal world, they wouldn't want any of their taxpayer dollars going to children they didn't father, let alone children they *did* father. And just like that, all safety nets are gone.\n\nThe mother has a child because she wanted to. Fair enough. However, if single parents are deemed as the only people responsible for their child in a world like this, it can have serious consequences. People are people, and just because parents *think* they can take care of a child on their own doesn't mean they *will*. What if it didn't work out as well as they thought, even though they tried really hard? Are they just stuck with no help at all? Is the deterioration of their child's health and safety due to the lack of resources a \"punishment\" for setting your hopes too high? Not in my book.\n\nShit, people who pay child support know the stress of finding a job, but at least they're a phone call away from fixing the problem, albeit temporarily.\n\nBeing a single parent is hard, and people in that position can't always afford everything for their child without help. There's no way this can work without more and more people ending up on welfare, and the Government only has so much money in the bank. Good luck convincing taxpayers that financial abortion is a good idea, commie.\n\nIn short, seems like a good idea in theory, but if you were to watch it all play out, it's just a bunch of false equivalencies put together by men who possibly have womb envy. There's a reason financial abortions have been ruled unconstitutional time and time again.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375494031", "subreddit": "againstmensrights", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Why does everyone say, \"thanks Obama,\" instead of \"thanks market economics?\"  \nI mean, come the fuck on, people.  If your employer cuts your hours because of a progressive national law, then it's not the law-maker who's the asshole, it's the company for not wanting to follow laws, but rather advert them.  Universal healthcare is a must for the 21st century, and if you need to confirm that, then just look at other developed nations across the globe. \nIf you're one of those people who thinks that \"socialized healthcare\" is a bad idea, well, you just don't know anything.  Why is it bad?  Because with this law in place, hospitals won't be able to inflate the costs of everything unnecessarily?  Or is it because the incomes of those who rape the current healthcare industry i.e.; insurers and corporations, will be effected?  \nComing from someone who was born poor, only barely covered by my moms insurance until I was 18, and then went 14 years without insurance before marrying my wife, (who happens to have a decent job) you all sound like fucking morons.  \nCompanies are to blame for any and all cuts.  Not laws.  That's like blaming environmental regulation for economic limitations.  While it might be true in the eyes of market economics, it's not the equitable way to do business.  That's the trick, dummies, economics are just guidelines, and governments exist to instill equity.  It's two completely separate sides of the same coin, but you have to use both in order to run a successful country.  \nTake a look around the world at countries who actually have \"corrupt\" governments and you'll find that what you are bitching about in America, sounds absolutely stupid in comparison to the lack of social equity in the periphery.  \nAmerica wants to assume hegemony, but internally we're fucking babies.  Babies who misunderstand the purpose of limiting economic efficiency in order to instill a minor shred of equity.  The government \"job\" isn't efficiency, it's preventing against the \"failures\" of individuals i.e., corporations.  \nIf we let economic theory run wild there would be absolutely no prices floors such as minimum wage, and no equity for people who are negatively effected by the profiteering of others.  \nThat is the debate folks.  And if you're on the \"egocentric\" side of the debate, you're just not thinking hard enough in my opinion.  Either that, or you're stuck in an adolescent mindset.  No one likes rules, but as you grow older and make \"economic decisions\" you can begin to appreciate the \"rules\" that are in place so that you don't get fucked over at every turn by some asshole looking to make a buck.  \nsource: I study economic geography.  And yes, Americans sound like complete pussies to everyone else in the developed world when it comes to healthcare.

{"body": "**Blogspam Industry Rule No. 4081:  Fuck facts!  Use single word or non-contextual quotations to bolster your opinion!**\n\n&gt; All the coppers have to do is decide that a public gathering or venue is deemed \"sensitive\", and needs to be \"protected from externalities\" and Apple will switch off all its gear.\n\nWow, they quoted 4 whole words and filled in the rest, that sounds really fucking credible.\n\n[Let us see how the actual PATENT used the word \"sensitive.\"](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=2&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=8,254,902&amp;OS=8,254,902&amp;RS=8,254,902).  Cuz ya know, source docs do exist!:\n\n&gt; This policy enforcement capability is useful for a variety of reasons, including for example to disable noise and/or light emanating from wireless devices (such as at a movie theater), for preventing wireless devices from communicating with other wireless devices (such as in academic settings), and for forcing certain electronic devices to enter \"sleep mode\" when entering a **sensitive** area.\n\nDiabolical!!\n\n&gt; As wireless devices such as cellular telephones, pagers, personal media devices and smartphones become ubiquitous, more and more people are carrying these devices in various social and professional settings. The result is that these wireless devices can often annoy, frustrate, and even threaten people in **sensitive** venues. For example, cell phones with loud ringers frequently disrupt meetings, the presentation of movies, religious ceremonies, weddings, funerals, academic lectures, and test-taking environments. \n\nThanks Obama!\n\n&gt; Additionally, the wireless transmission of **sensitive** information to a remote source is one example of a threat to security. This sensitive information could be anything from classified government information to questions or answers to an examination administered in an academic setting.\n\nPolice State in 3,2,1...\n\n&gt; The present invention advantageously lends itself to numerous different applications and uses, including for example in movie theaters, enterprise applications (e.g., business meetings, or to secure **sensitive** data), academic settings (e.g., lectures or exams, so as to prevent interruptions and also surreptitious communications or \"cheating\"), home or residence environments, or even in automobiles (e.g., prevent non-hands free use of cellular telephones when a user is sitting in their car and it is moving). Moreover, the invention lends itself to many different business paradigms and methods.\n\nWow, actual quotations sure aren't as sexy are they!?\n\nHow about \"protected from externalities\"?  It was mentioned once in the following context:\n\n&gt; Despite the foregoing variety of different approaches to wireless device control, none satisfies the salient need of providing an apparatus and methods of automatically disabling, replacing, or modifying the functionality of a wireless device upon the occurrence of a certain condition, such as for instance entering a particular location or venue. Ideally, such apparatus and methods would in one aspect allow certain designated zones or areas to enforce policies regarding wireless device operation, and be **protected from externalities** such as ringing or alarms, display functions, etc. associated with the wireless device. This would also ideally prevent or frustrate the use of wireless devices for inappropriate purposes.\n\nAnd finally, just for peace of mind - let's see what is said of \"police\" (mentioned 2 times) and \"law enforcement\" (mentioned once)\n\n&gt; Covert police or government operations may require complete \"blackout\" conditions. A person's sleep can even be interrupted by a bright flashing or modulating display (such as to indicate an incoming call).\n\nCop's doing surveillance and his phone goes off making the screen flash.\n\n&gt; A device for disabling a vehicle by police, in response to either the predetermined control signal or the selectable control signal, is provided for allowing capture of those assailants seeking to escape by use of a motor vehicle. \n\nDiscussing a different but interrelated patent (see below)\n\n&gt; U.S. Pat. No. 6,897,762 to Howells issued May 24, 2005 and entitled, \"Vehicle immobilization system\" discloses an immobilization system for a vehicle which will assist in law enforcement.\n\nThe other patent.\n\n**TL;DR** More blogspam bullshit, taking an Apple patent and speculating ways it can be used in a dystopian fashion.  Slippery slope logic at its worst.  Furthermore, this article pretends to quote the patent but ignores all context and instead creates its own self-serving narrative.  \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376073896", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think the reason some intelligent people in real-life don't have children, if not more of them, is that they've made a conscious decision earlier in their life that their career is their child, so to speak, and that's their legacy they want to leave behind. Start young, work your way up, nurture your network, and reap the benefits 20-30 years later with a career many would envy to have. I bet it's just as stressful as raising an actual child, because one wrong misstep can mean the difference between getting that big promotion or remaining stuck at a dead-end job, if not becoming outright unemployed and having to start all over.\n\nAnother opinion I have why intelligent people remain childless or draw the line at one or two kids is that, ironically enough, they think through the child-rearing process too much. It's not sex itself that is shunned, but the inevitable strain that having a child will bring to their already hectic life. (E.g., if a female professor becomes pregnant, how will this affect her research and ability to secure grant funding?) Poor people breed like rabbits not just because they have nothing better to do (thanks Obama?) but that they're not concerned about what's gonna happen eighteen years down the road. Even in trying economic times like these, the necessities always seem to take care of themselves.

Obama led the charge against enemies of the republic, culminating in the capture and execution of notable American traitor Benedict Snowden. Although questioned for these policies at the time, people have come to understand the benefits of universal surveillance. Today, thanks to Obama's vision, we can all feel safe in our homes, safe in the knowledge that anyone who attempts to utilize the internet in a potentially criminal way will be immediately and irrevocably removed from access.

However, that was never shown. In the film, we only saw a few medical ships fly towards Earth.\nThus, it could've been that there wasn't nearly enough ships and equipment to heal even a small number of people on Earth. That would easily be justified by the miraculous abilities that pods posess - something like that would cost more than a state of the art western hospital with all its staff and equipment.\nAfter I saw the movie, I assumed that that the only thing the rebels managed to aquire is to destroy the Elysium by ruining its social sturcture and abusing the medical machines.

{"body": "In 2016 America, the Republicans shockingly lose another general election.  With Hilary Clinton president, the southern conservatives begin to seriously consider seceding from the Union in order to \"restore their proper way of life.\"  News of this information leads to Clinton ordering the mobilization of troops and equipment to the northern states to keep it out of the hands of the southern rebels.  Hearing of this mobilization, the South reacts swiftly and departs.  With most troops and equipment in the continental US stationed in the South, the world's most powerful military is in conflict.  Paranoia begins to sweep American military units across the globe as northern born troops are stationed alongside southern born troops.  Soldiers stationed in Afghanistan begin to attack one another, causing war to erupt in the bases in the US and Confederate States.  After 3 years, the North begins to crumble.  DC is lost, the government us nonexistent, and New York is being starved with an embargo.  In a moment of desperation, the northern military officials order the launch of every single nuclear missile in the US arsenal.  The blasts will destroy the planet.  In Earths final minute, every computer screen, every television each displays the same 2 words.  In this last moment, the people of Earth know what really caused this war to end all wars.  Some nod their head at their tv, some shake their fists in rage, and some whisper the powerful finial 2 words they'll ever witness.  \"THANKS OBAMA\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376924241", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

I think phenomena like that are common around here because the site tends to erupt around pet causes, SOPA being one of them, and not notice when they rally behind upstart politicians with whom they agree on that issue but also hold otherwise reprehensible positions that would tend to go against consensus opinion.  This then grants a platform to people who would otherwise be filtered out of the real world by their own stupid ideas that exist alongside the one idea that Reddit likes.  Granted, I tend not to like the term 'hivemind' and recognize there's a fair amount of diversity around the site.

You have to realize that the student loan market is almost exclusively people that have just graduated highschool and had no experience with finance. It also seems as if lenders took advantage of their clients naive understanding of finance as well. There was a lot of smoke and mirrors when it came to the cost of college and differentiation between what is free money (scholarships) and what is a loan.

{"body": "&gt; They do. But stealing from your neighbors to pay for it doesn't make you a better person.\n\nNobody is talking about free education in the United States, so your notion of \"stealing from a neighbor\" because democrats promote less expensive education loans is way off base. That's the whole idea behind a loan. You don't get the money for free. You repay it.  \nIn answer to the question you've now asked twice, however, I don't have a problem with people who want a higher education, so they can be better members of society, getting at the very least the basics, the prerequisites, of that education for \"free\". They will more than pay it back through a lifetime of good citizenship and personal success. \n\n&gt;Care to join me in ending govt intrusion into both!\n\nSurely there are areas we might agree need to be curtailed, but I don't see loans as an intrusion, especially with education. I see it as opportunity to give a countryman a hand up, leading to a better society for all. Even loans for businesses can be acceptable, provided the business' success is of benefit to society at large.  \nAnd, hey! Just because the government is giving out loans at low low rates, doesn't mean the free market can't also offer loans at similar rates. It just means they wouldn't make as much profit.  \nBecause maybe profit shouldn't be the main motivator when things we all know are for the betterment of humanity are considered?\n\n&gt;Led by whom?\n\nWhat do you mean led by whom? How about led by every single human being who came before you? You have access at your fingertips right this very minute, potentially every scrap of accumulated knowledge our entire species has been able to muster, from the dawn of walking upright through NOW, and you have the temerity to ask who will lead you? As if there is something nefarious afoot? It's not about being led by individuals, of being told what to think. This isn't religion, son.  \nIt's about applying critical thinking skills to life. Being exposed to multiple conflicting viewpoints, and being able to discern which one is truthful and which is feeding you a line of bullshit.  \nIt's about being able to deem one's adversaries weak, illustrate repeatedly why this is true, and not getting your ass handed to you again and again by random folk who happen along \n\n&gt;In a free country, you can go to another hospital. But I bet you dont want that freedom, eh! No freedom of association in your world, correct?\n\nI'm all for hospitals publishing prices one can expect to pay, so one can shop around, (Thanks, Obama), but in a lot of places, the only place in town is a religiously affiliated hospital. If that hospital accepts government money in payment for treatment of patients (I.E. Medicaid, Medicare), then that institution ought not be allowed to refuse to host medically necessary procedures based on religious grounds. I'm not saying a doctor should be forced against his will to perform an abortion, but if the doctor is willing to do the procedure then the hospital it's done in should butt out.  \nOr, hire *only* christian doctors who won't do abortions. Although that would probably be discrimination. In fact, yeah, I think it would be.  \nSo, the only answer is to sever the government connection to the religious institution altogether. Treat medicaid / medicare etc patients for free, or not at all. Stop taking my money if you want to force others to abide by your religious \"code\".\n\nNo freedom of association in my world? Where did that come from? You're flailing away with lame ass ad hominems now? You do understand this is a sign of insincerity, of uncertainty in one's position? It's like you know you're full of shit, but don't bother trying to argue your points to prove you're not.

Evict if necessary, have them trashed out, repaired..etc.  Down in SWFL we have a basically a large expanse of drained area that basically used to be the everglades in the 60s and 70s.  Now it's a rural area with tons of newer homes with large acre + lots.  A lot of these are/were foreclosed and over the course of 4-5 years or so I've done a lot of business out there.  \n\nThese are also popular as grow houses.  Can't see your neighbors, tons of already vacant homes.  People will head into a house, plug basically right into the power grid and start growing.  DEA has helicopters flying over with thermal scanners now.  I've gotten a few that were previously grow houses.  some with plants still there.  Obviously they were burned.\n\nAbout a year or so ago I got a house that still had all the lamps and racks setup.  Plants were gone.  The cleanout crews that typically do the work wouldn't touch this one, I'm guessing because of how obvious what the equipment was for.  So my self and a buddy took everything down, threw it in a truck and hauled it out of there.  He wanted to keep the stuff, I said all yours.  So he posts an add on craigslist for the crap, I don't remember how much.  Day or 2 later a bunch of Sheriffs and DEA agents show up at his house (mind your he never posted a phone # in the add and it had that random email thing craigslist does....NSA?  thanks Obama) with a warrant and search his place.  Find all the stuff still sitting in his trunk, start trying to play hardball with him asking where his grow house was and shit like that.  Eventually I get called in, have to tell them where the stuff came from and how the whole backstory.  This is with a lawyer present.

While it is a ridiculous position to take that he is, for example, responsible for the state of the economy or other things that are outside his control, I think it also promotes a culture that suggests we should pass blame and absolve not only Obama but ourselves of responsibility. It seems it is used most by people who believe that Obama has done \"what he can\" or that he is trying his best but is impeded by obstructionists in congress. In my opinion that is the wrong approach, because it is apathetic and suggests that the only potential for change can come from above and we must WAIT for it rather than creating it from below.\n\nSorry to bring seriousness into /r/funny.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377834196", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
