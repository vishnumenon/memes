You take off TV service and your bill drops at least 60%.\n\nTWC is fighting CBS, Verizon was fighting AMC, CBS/FOX/NBC want to show sports so that's why you'll have a \"Sports Surcharge\" on your bill even if you have basic and never tune into ESPN.\n\nIt's really the Networks that are evil, and they don't want us to let you have access to content when you're not home unless you sign in to some archaic app that we have no control over.

{"body": "This view raises more questions than it answers. \n\nWhy would Obama wait 2 years to take action? It makes more sense to go in early and shore up that gas pipeline. \n\nWhy take the side of the rebels? The rebellion is fractured into dozens of groups. Even after Assad falls, it will be years before stability returns to the country, since the rebel groups will turn on each other in attempts to collect power. Any remaining rebel groups will pose a threat to the pipeline. Furthermore, whoever does ultimately come out on top won't be blue jean wearin', Coke drinkin', American lovers. They will likely be at least somewhat hostile to American interests in the region Supporting the rebels is a risky proposition at best. Look at Libya, just this week oil production dropped to [1/10th of normal.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/03/libya-oil-supplies-tripoli) Thanks Obama!\n\nDid Assad side with Russians in 2009 and refuse to build the pipeline? The first mention I can find of it is from this [article.] (http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jhPTvibpnk98IR09Amuc5QzWQsIQ?docId=CNG.c0b07c0fd43690568ae07ab83f87f608.6d1) As far as I know, nowhere else before this article mentions Assad refusing to sign on to the pipeline. Let's say that Assad actually vetoed a pipeline project through Syria. That would mean nobody reported on it for 4 years! In addition to lack of evidence Assad was against the pipeline, these [guys](http://www.ekemeuroenergy.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=219:syrias-energy-future-after-the-upheaval&amp;catid=47:middle-east-a-the-gulf-&amp;Itemid=74) are under the impression that Assad did agree to the pipeline!\n\nEven if Assad did nix the pipeline (he didn't), why not just support Assad? It would be easier to broker a pipeline for weapons/airstrikes/looking the other way on chemical attacks deal than dealing with the rebels. Interesting fact about UN brokered peace deals: they usually fail within five years and lead to longer more drawn conflicts compared to civil wars where the international community just sit backs and lets one side wipe out the other.  So since stability comes from one sided victory, the best choice for President Obama would be to broker an agreement the strongest force (Assad) and help him clean up the rebels. \n\nOil is very important to US foreign policy, no doubt. But, it doesn't run on oil. Look at US-Israel relations. An oil based FP would care fuckall about them since, according to Wikipedia, Israel has 0.00% of the world's oil. In the same way, Syria is more than just about oil. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378534310", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There are differences. I would not underestimate the extent to which a party like rødt and sv on the left side, or frp on the right side could seriously fuck up this country in 4 years.\n\nI mean, FRP would like to abolish \"handlingsregelen\" for example. This could have some horrific ramifications both for Norway, and for the rest of the world, if that happens.\n\nAnd I really dislike the idea of opening up for private companies to get into healthcare and education. I think it's a step in entirely the wrong direction.\n\nPeople like to think that private companies have to compete on the open market, and therefore will provide a better service at a cheaper cost, but often it seems the opposite is true. They make a shittier service at a much higher cost, and it even often costs people jobs, because of the profit/expenditure min/maxing mentality of a company.\n\nI ask myself: What do I have to complain over? Right now I'm on a waiting list for surgery. The waiting list was 3 weeks and it's elective surgery, having my gallbladder removed after recurring gallstones.\n\nHow did these lines develop, and why are they not being solved? I think one has to look at that, rather than just \"oh it's not magically fixed, thanks obama!\"\n\nOur system is pretty much envied in large parts of the world. FRP wants to americanize this country, and I really hate that. I really, really do. Sure they have some few valid points here and there, but I think the bigger things, like privatization and how to handle oil wealth, and social security and so on, vastly outweighs the points I agree with them on. And even if I agree with the problems they point out, I don't know that I necessarily agree with their proposed solutions to these problems. For example, my opinion is that FRP won't get better roads built, at least not effectively. Why? Because the problem with our roads is that they're decided by politicians, and not Vegvesenet.\n\nLeave the actual planning and building of roads to people who know what the fuck they're doing, let the politicians decide a budget for those people to use, that's what I'd do. But no, it's more fun to let politicians have direct control, because then they can use it to get elected, even if they haven't the faintest idea what they're doing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378740392", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My take on all this is that wealth inequality really has to do with the corporate sector owning the government and spending the last 40 years shaping the system to their favour.\n\nForget about the whole left or right thing. That's more of a red herring at this point since both parties are connected via corporate influence and both fall under capitalist dogma.\n\nI tend to look at it like this:\n\nOn one side, you have citizens. On the other side is corporations. In the middle is the government. It's like a teeter totter when it should be a set of scales. You want balance between the public and industry. Over the last few decades however, it's been corporations tipping the scales in their favour.\n\nSo now the public needs to re-balance the scales.\n\nSocialism is treated as an ugly word by Capitalists. This is because their ideological core is built on greed while Socialism is based on sharing.\n\nHow much money does one person need? Do they win a prize for having the most? Does it make them better people?\n\nSince the 80's, I've watched how the rich have gone from being well off to super rich, and how the executive class has absolutely destroyed manufacturing and unions in the US.\n\nAll the cheap shit you guys buy from Wal Mart and practically every other store is made in factories outside of the US. Some are actually inside the US, but it's made by low paid prisoners on work programs.\n\nIn the 50's, at the height of 'The American Dream', people were able to afford to buy all that stuff because the products were made in the US which created jobs, and because of growing labour laws and factory unions, workers were paid a fair wage while execs &amp; CEO's didn't take home the kinds of insane salaries they get now.\n\nSeriously, find me one person who is worth the salary of 200 or 300 employees and I'll show you Superman. Some Ivy League Wall Street connected dick isn't really worth much more than anyone else personally. I've seen janitors that do more to insure the stability of a company than the owners. Restaurants can't run without dishwashers. People seriously undervalue the working class.\n\nIn the 80's, companies discovered they could close factories, kill off unions, and send the jobs to places like China, Taiwan, India, etc and pay less to non unionized, exploited labour. Sweatshops, child workers, 14 hour work days, unsafe conditions.\n\nThese companies killed whole towns by cutting costs and giving themselves raises. Detroit just went bankrupt. A whole fucking city. That's insane, and no one does shit about it, because a by-product of wealth inequality, is social segregation.\n\nThe US media depicts poor people poorly. Socially dysfunctional retards who are either criminals or white trash. It tends to make the middle class unwilling to want to help them.\n\nMost of reddit's demographics is middleclass white kids who have no idea what real poverty is like and think the ghetto is like an Ice Cube movie or The Wire.\n\nChicago is horrible for wealth disparity. thanks Obama's friends.\n\nYou have massive black on black violence which is nationally under-reported, in some of the poorest communities, while just a few blocks away, you have some of the wealthiest people in the city. There's no comfort in that. Chicago is closing 50 inner city schools. There was protests. Again, very little coverage.\n\nThe system itself is rigged on all levels against the public and it's only going to keep getting worse unless you guys actually work together on a public level to fix things.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378843722", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There has been much stated on both sides of enforcing the new policies, with some for and some against the changes. But, in the discussion we overlook one thing, the reputation of this community.\n\n/r/magicskyfairy  has an online reputation that it has built up over the years, and that reputation has drawn many of those questioning their faith to check the place out, where they saw an edgy, exciting, lively place where religion was mocked, debunked, and treated less as a sacred cow and more as a cow in the slaughterhouse.\n\nNow, questioning atheists will come here based on it's reputation, expecting a vibrant community and find what has been since the change a boring, bland, lifeless place full of news you could easily have gotten off any of the hundreds of news sites out there.\n\nChristians have been trying for a long time to get rid of this sub-reddit, and with this background change they've gotten the next best thing. Now, atheism doesn't seem so exciting or interesting and will seem as boring as their religion. They couldn't get rid of the sub-reddit but they could, through their constant whining and complaining about the sub-reddit, get it's hipness neutered. This way, in their view, people checking out the place won't be swayed as easily to the dark side.\n\nThe old /r/magicskyfairy was a vibrant mix of serious and silly, and if you wanted more serious or more silly, there were sub-reddits for those. But now, it's just links to other news sites posts for the most part, and most first time visitors will never know about the other more vibrant atheism sub-reddits.\n\nYes, the place was sometimes like a blood sport with no actual blood, as christian trolls and atheist trolls squared off, but now it's like going to high tea at grandma's.\n\nWill I unsubscribe? No. But, only because I want /r/magicskyfairy to remain a default sub-reddit with it's posts making the front page of Reddit in general. It may be a more boring atheism than it was, but I still want it to get exposure to people, and keep pissing off Christians with it's presence. I just won't be checking it as frequently as I used to.\n\nBut, I think changing the policies was a disservice to those who use the sub-reddit regularly, who weren't even given a chance to have a say in the change, and it is a disservice to the atheism community in general by reducing what was a vital, vibrant hub for atheism online to a limp and flaccid shadow of what it was.\n\nTL;DR **Mods are literally /u/jij and now there's nowhere for brave scientists to spread their faithsmashing truths. Thanks Obama \"Papa John\" Hitler.**\n\n[In all seriousness, I think this is probably a good idea. Every single joke on this subreddit now is about fedoras, neckbeards, and the Dew and it gets old.

{"body": "So yeah, last episode the Gatchamen abandoned their creator in favor of starting up a sweet Youtube channel. Don’t bother asking me what they’re gonna do this week.\n\n**Episode 10**\n\n0:02 - [Nice opening shot.](http://i.imgur.com/TanYAc9.jpg) Kinda sucks for this show’s budgeting that its very premise necessitates lots of busy outdoor crowd scenes in large public places\n\n0:33 - [And our villains finally reveal their evil lair](http://i.imgur.com/fP8z8oI.jpg)\n\n0:52 - [Running into Rui’s own problems extremely quickly](http://i.imgur.com/hkSbp4Q.jpg). You can’t force people thinking in terms of their current world and desires to immediately think in terms of a new world order’s needs. As I’ve said before, Rui’s plan would have required a population of Hajimes, not a population of human beings\n\n1:20 - [If you make it a game, they treat it like one](http://i.imgur.com/IF1yeAv.jpg). Another lovely shot\n\n3:08 - [Yeah, it’s a lot less cryptic when you’ve figured out the axis.](http://i.imgur.com/5KDkkFH.jpg) As I said last week, the antagonist here is falsehood/anonymity, and Hajime’s weapons are open dialogue, honesty, and transparency. And so Berg Katze is doing the exact thing he did with Jou - gleefully mocking her tools\n\n3:25 - [He has fun testing the limits of her philosophy.](http://i.imgur.com/ZM1azyM.jpg) It’s generally considered bad form to have villains that are simply evil for the sake of being evil (because almost everyone believes what they are doing is right from their perspective, and villains you can empathize with are generally much more compelling and worth devoting storytelling resources to), but it really just depends on the goals of the story in question. Gatchaman Crowds contains a number of character arcs, but Hajime herself is static as hell, and more representative of an ideology than a human being. By setting Katze as a Joker-like “watch the world burn” representation of all our worst instincts, Katze is essentially being used to stress-test Hajime’s positive manipulation of open dialogue and social networking\n\n3:29 - [I like how this show’s version of a battle scene is two characters’ cutesy avatars walking in circles while discussing their viewpoints](http://i.imgur.com/iRe3qwF.jpg)\n\n3:58 - [No less on-the-nose than the sun coming out for Rui’s turn](http://i.imgur.com/6LXrnvg.jpg). Which, again, is not a complaint - you shouldn’t intentionally obscure your points, you should just integrate them in a way that makes them exist naturally in the narrative, which can sometimes result in them being overlooked\n\n4:14 - [X is a believer.](http://i.imgur.com/QKyhu4K.jpg) The light/dark metaphor was well-chosen - it also works with the contrast between natural sunlight and the black screen of the internet\n\n4:49 - [Trolls are aimless unless baited](http://i.imgur.com/J72y186.jpg)\n\n5:13 - [Katze also coopting Rui’s use of gamification to get what he wants.](http://i.imgur.com/E1mIaXo.jpg) As Hajime pointed out, his tools are impressive, but they are not good or bad\n\n5:41 - [You can only herd cats by giving them what they want, 26](http://i.imgur.com/EV515dQ.jpg). Now pay attention to your adorable daughter\n\n6:08 - [Great shot](http://i.imgur.com/qi2Byp9.jpg). It’s an intimidating weapon\n\n6:36 - [Finally, ten episodes in, we get our badass hero lineup](http://i.imgur.com/W40Ednn.jpg)\n\n7:33 - [Help us Prime Minister we need orders plz](http://i.imgur.com/B5Y5kK7.jpg)\n\n8:12 - [Oh thank god.](http://i.imgur.com/5JD7axB.jpg) For a second I was worried this show was gonna pull an ‘adults are stupid’ here with the Prime Minister. Nothing invalidates meaning like really dumb characters making really dumb choices\n\n8:46 - [Sugane was born for this](http://i.imgur.com/3IRYqTJ.jpg)\n\n9:29 - [Utsutsu is best](http://i.imgur.com/dR0970T.jpg). Even her battle cry is adorable\n\n9:41 - [Love their design.](http://i.imgur.com/Xy6jMca.jpg) Derpy-looking, mindless-seeming, not that imposing, no face, overwhelming in numbers. Hello internet\n\n10:04 - [Yeah sure no problem coach](http://i.imgur.com/ohYyHBe.jpg)\n\n10:11 - [And it won’t be because of crowdsourcing.](http://i.imgur.com/5bLKIHL.jpg) It’ll be because he, Rui, has established an honest channel with X\n\nThe show really emphasizes the face-to-face nature of these connections, which I guess is necessary for the contrast to be particularly clear, but I wonder what its position is on personal but still utterly net-mediated bonds. Many (most?) people have legitimately honest connections with people on the internet - in reality, the lines are much less clear than honest physical connection versus total crowdsourced anonymity\n\n10:55 - [Sorry, Prime Minister, but your channels have been… *updated*](http://i.imgur.com/PRsdBFa.jpg)\n\n11:25 - [Hate to tell you this, sir,](http://i.imgur.com/nMwk80h.jpg) but we’re receiving reports that we’re actually in a show specifically designed to put everyone on the same level\n\n12:49 - [Wow, Pai found a way to make use of his running-away skills](http://i.imgur.com/Imd4KPx.jpg). Nice work, Pai\n\n13:43 - [As many commenters have said, revolutions like this just don’t work](http://i.imgur.com/72vLkC7.jpg)\n\n13:52 - [Yep.](http://i.imgur.com/AS0kx6z.jpg) The average citizen’s societal awareness generally doesn’t extend beyond “You guys stopped serving breakfast burritos at noon? *Thanks, Obama*…”\n\n14:39 - [This is so great](http://i.imgur.com/wwWBVdr.jpg). Cannot believe how great this is. The Prime Minister isn’t a villain, he’s just one more put-upon bureaucrat trapped in a system designed for stasis\n\n15:03 - [Just when I thought this episode wasn’t getting any better,](http://i.imgur.com/g1rV48G.jpg) we see Hajime sleeping in a dinosaur hoodie. Ermahgerd\n\n16:07 - [*Nobody is! Everybody is! HELP THEM!*](http://i.imgur.com/R5ejKFp.jpg)\n\n17:20 - [Yeah, give the guy his redemption arc.](http://i.imgur.com/p0TsmVD.jpg) I love how they’ve managed to condense his arc to maybe seven or eight total minutes of screen time without losing any of the beats this story has to go through. Most stories are so damn lazy\n\n(I say, even though my favorite show of the season, Uchouten Kazoku, is spreading three or four plot points out across thirteen episodes. Yeah, stories are more complicated than that)\n\n18:00 - [Oh please.](http://i.imgur.com/5kdWnM0.jpg) In any other show, your style of cool would be considered retro-badass\n\n19:36 - [SAVE THOSE KIDS PAI](http://i.imgur.com/4ZcRiKW.jpg). So satisfying. As soon as “In the name of love” kicked in, total fucking high gear. This soundtrack\n\n20:05 - [#1 scene transition](http://i.imgur.com/mI5aMWJ.jpg)\n\n20:35 - [The worst of transgressions.](http://i.imgur.com/zvb3070.jpg) All this show’s most frightening moments are things that happen every day - “I am you” is right, there are [true monsters out there](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/12/4693710/the-end-of-kindness-weev-and-the-cult-of-the-angry-young-man)\n\n21:29 - [“I’m so uncool”](http://i.imgur.com/bGKCLs6.jpg) my ass, you giant ham. That’s some “I only hit them with the flat of my blade” shit right there\n\n**And Done**\n\nMan, that episode was incredibly great, but that sentence for 26 was just so chilling that I don’t even know what to think. I guess that’s a good sign, right? The show’s working. This stuff matters. I don’t know how it’s going to resolve this (although obviously I know the philosophies of the good guys and the bad guys, so), but I’d love to see it have something productive to add to this conversation. This is some heavy, terrible shit.\n\nAnyway. That was pretty gloomy of me, but this episode really was fantastic even as it worked as a character-arc housecleaning episode. Both Pai and Jou’s turns were very satisfying, it wove back in the actual public defenders in a very reasonable way, and Katze’s madness is more and more reflective of a madness we’re already living with. I think the time for Youtube channels is over, but this show isn’t going to resolve by punching Katze in the face - Rui or Hajime need to prove him wrong. I’m eager to see that. The internet is scary, but I want to believe\n\n-old posts are [here](http://wrongeverytime.com/)-", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379118410", "subreddit": "anime", "score": 36, "controversiality": 0}

The customer hadn't yet provided me with any further work to do, so I sat around twiddling my thumbs waiting for work.\n4. Upon tiring myself of that, I went to my boss and asked him if there was anything I could do in the meantime. No, there isn't. Not without opening a can of worms at least.\n5. Finally, work! Except the VPN is occupied... Back to twiddling my thumbs.\n6. Getting the post-lunch sleepies; to the vending machine I go. Well, where did the soda go? Coca Cola is sold out. All they have left is cherry coke and diet. Thanks, Obama.\n7. \"Oh by the way, we have another guy coming to augment with us. He'll be staying with you.\"\n8. I send an email around 2... \"Whoever is using the session please let me know, I have work to do.\" No response. At 3, I was like \"fuck this\" and left. \n9. Taking out trash when I get home (well, recyclables) I notice the bag has a hole and is leaking. Thanks again, Obama.\n10. Making dinner in this company-furnished apartment...

{"body": "You messed up the quote a bit (and apparently I typo'd the word got), apparently you missed an enter key. \n\nOn actually answering that, coming up with a good exact answer to it is incredibly difficult if at all possible, so I didn't think anyone would actually try to answer. While I wanted to raise the question, I don't know for sure which theory is closer to reality. \n\nI suppose if we really wanted to know, the information we'd have to look for is if State level governments in charge of redistricting changed affiliation in response to the President, or in response to the health care law, or were already Republican dominated. \n\nIt's a hard question to answer, and the data is harder to find then the Federal level offices reacting in response to the law. The Affordable Care Act was passed on March 23, 2010, just in time for the midterms to be impacted by the political ramifications of the law, and possibly, State level governments potentially in charge of redistricting. \n\n---\n\nFor example, [in Arizona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party_strength_in_Arizona), the Governor was already shifted to a Republican due to Obama's election (because he appointed her to a Cabinet position, thanks Obama), however she faced and won her seat in the 2010 midterms. Also in the 2010 elections Republicans picked up three seats in the State Senate, and four in the State House, giving them 2/3 super-majorities in both. To add insult to injury, in 2010 the House went from five Democrats and three Republicans to three Democrats, five Republicans, and Raúl Grijalva, one of the more liberal Democrats had a very tough re-election, while Gabrielle Giffords had a close race against someone who wanted to [eliminate the Education Department](http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2010/11/05/20101105arizona-elections-gabrielle-giffords-elected.html?nclick_check=1), and was considered more conservative than Sarah Palin. \n\nArizona picked up a seat via redistricting for the 2012-2020 elections, and the Republicans were most completely in power after 2010, just in time for redistricting. So what happened since then? \n\nWell, the House delegation for Arizona is now made up of five Democrats and four Republicans (and to add insult to injury, while they retained their majorities, both the State Senate and State House lost their super-majorities). \n\nSounds peachy right? But consider that in 2000, Arizona enacted the \"Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission\" [consisting of two Democrats, two Republicans, and an Independent to draw district lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting_in_Arizona). Sounds a little more fair on its face ([although redistricting commissions aren't so peachy either, part of the reasons I favor STV over single member districts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLqs5ohhass_TF9mg-mqLie7Fqq1-FzOQc)), but [if you read about](http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gop-ousts-redistricting-chief/article_64206286-a5cc-5123-8705-cf379ca60836.html) [the fight that took place in 2010](http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/brewer-cuts-legal-funds-for-mathis/article_30aed166-7536-5750-8c85-129d18a498c3.html) [over the redistricting plan](http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/2011/11/02/20111102editorial1103-gop-tramples-redistricting.html), [it starts going back to showing why incumbents shouldn't be in control of redistricting](http://azstarnet.com/news/opinion/editorial/brewer-deals-out-injustice-to-redistrict-panel/article_d3e2b2f1-2057-5dfe-a4db-d3664121f2d1.html). \n\nBasically, the massively Republican dominated State government in Arizona tried its best to get a more Republican favoring redistricting plan going in Arizona, despite it being something supposedly delegated by law to an independent commission. \n\n---\n\nNote that I didn't answer why the Arizona State House and State Senate went more Republican though. That's the question we'd need to answer to verify your theory, but for all the other states that failed to protect their redistricting from the local government's influence.

{"body": "I'm gonna be honest with you, here... they didn't really do all that much. \n\nI'm not a scholar on the great depression by any means, but it seems that largely, we got out of it based on semi-socialist policies (like redistribution of wealth through higher taxes on the rich,) and entry into WWII (which made us even more socialist.) \n\nThe population at that time was smaller, and more concentrated in the northeast. There weren't backwoods fanatics who were still caught up in the fucking red scare (which hadn't happened yet.) It was acceptable to say that some people had too much wealth, and that it didn't matter whether they \"earned\" it or not. \nPolitics were divided, but politicians were still ultimately responsible for the people, not special interests. \n\nThen we got into the war, which actually... made things better, which I think is largely what we have been trying to do with our economy. The government convinced people to give up their luxuries and work together on the war effort. The previously unemployed young men were drafted, and this meant the women at home were the only ones left to work in the factories. People were expected to sacrifice to make things better, and because we were still in the industrial revolution, the war created jobs and companies that were producing new technology more and more efficiently, and when the war came to a close, people ended up having more buying power in homes with two working adults, which allowed them to buy cars and refrigerators, which in turn, expanded the economy, and created jobs to help build the country. \n\nOur involvement in the war wasn't even that important. The Russians were imposing enough a force that the Nazi's didn't have much of a chance. Our involvement was really just a genius idea for us- we had the manufacturing capabilities, and our enemies couldn't realistically overtake us on our own soil, so it was a chance to get ourselves big contracts and make friends abroad. \n\n\nPresently, we are looking at a totally different landscape. We are looking at a weak economy, various unsuccessful wars being waged abroad, a government that is in no way beholden to the people, people that don't hold themselves accountable for the government (thanks, Obama!) impending environmental disasters, and so on, and so on, and none of the advantages \"the greatest generation\" had. In 1930, we were looking up to England, now we're just sitting at the top of the pile looking down. \n\nThe singlemost impressive thing I think they did, that I don't think we would, is actually sacrifice and work together. But that is some gay socialist shit, and this is AMERICA, land of the FREE. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379559987", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I got a letter in the mail yesterday saying that due to health care reform, my plan will no longer be offered.

Health insurance will now make up the second largest portion of my monthly expenses after rent.

{"body": "Oh snap.\n\nI was browsing on AlienBlue, and I only saw the first sentence: \"What? Are you really a Catholic theolegy student? Or are you pulling my leg?\"\n\nLOLFAILME\n\nSo to go back to the rest:\n\n&gt;That literally means that I could murder or rape or steal from somone and then be absolved because in my twisted sense of a concious, and by my anarchist theology, I'm doing the right thing. Are you seriously a Catholic theolgy student? Because if so, the church is headed in a very bad direction.\n\nIt literally means that someone who has an uninformed conscience and follows what he has believed to be the \"right thing to do\", then he is doing the most right thing he can conceivably do. The time tested example of the pagan Aztecs sacrificing human lives to appease the sun god is a great example. Is killing people good? No. But if you don't know that it isn't good to slaughter your slaves to keep the sun from setting permanently, but that doing so is what your god wants, and to not do so would be to disobey your god, then you better do it.\n\nBut the Church places a *huge* emphasis on forming one's conscience: that means understanding the norms of what is and is not right. So if your warped mind thinks raping and pillaging is great, you are obligated to understand why society disagrees and what your religion teaches about that situation.\n\nIf all that still leads the to the conclusion that it is ok, then you should follow your conscience.\n\nIn the end, culpability is a huge issue. You would be less culpable for your actions if you honestly did not know better. How God determines how to handle your culpability is another matter.\n\n&gt;Pfff. If you're not an RN, you're working in a coffeeshop these days...THANKS OBAMA!! lol\n\n:( so sad, so true...at least I am being made manager soon.

{"body": "&gt; However, that is not what Obamacare is obviously,\n\nIt's a covert means to an end. We both know that's what this is designed for.\n\n&gt;A shitty choice is no choice at all.\n\nSo, let's compare today's \"choice\" to your version of \"choice\". Today, an employer with anywhere from 1 to thousands of employees will determine what is best for their group and will usually subsidize their employees' healthcare costs as long as they elect to go with the company's plan. The employer makes decisions on what they will and will not cover, yet employees are free to decline and go with a spouse's plan or seek other plans on the free market. Furthermore, if you decide that the company's benefits aren't sufficient, you're free to move to a different employer with a better benefits package. This is not the best system, but I think it's better than the alternative you want.\n\nYour preference is for the government to dictate every plan in America and what will and will not be covered. Everyone must purchase healthcare dictated by what our government decides must be covered or else they will face a fine. In the prior situation, there was choice. Not complete freedom, but more than a central government dictating the policies. Furthermore, the government is causing the rate hikes we're seeing because they are dictating coverage. Plans that at one point would not cover contraception (something that is relatively cheap) are now forced to provide that \"benefit\" to people even though they might never use the benefit, yet are forced to pay for it. You have no other place to turn because EVERY policy is dictated by the government, thus instead of a mud-covered candy bar you can elect to throw away and find a different one, EVERY candy bar has the same mud, and you're forced to purchase it regardless of your own preferences for how much mud you're willing to put up with.\n\n&gt;These bare bones insurance plans...It's SOMETHING, but it's not great\n\nThese are part-time workers, first and foremost. I know this economy sucks (thanks Obama) and people are being forced to take part-time jobs to get by. In a healthy economy, most people are employed full time and most have the benefit of purchasing a decent health care package from their employer. My preference would be to break that bond, but not through government force. Regardless, what makes you think the government plan is the utopia you're painting? And at what cost? So far, the government's actions have caused EVERY healthcare plan cost to rise, so if affordability is what you're after, you just shot yourself in the foot straight out of the gate.\n\n&gt;Competition spurs that - which is, incidentally, exactly what the insurance exchange is.\n\nActually, if your \"ultimate answer\" is single payer, then you're contradicting yourself here. Single payer is the antithesis of competition. Single payer means the government decides, not individuals. Single payer means you have no choice in the matter. I know some people think that these government bureaucrats make better decisions than the ones they make for themselves, but the vast majority of Americans possess the ability to determine what works best for them and their family. They know their own needs better than a bureaucrat in a far off land. I agree that competition is what's needed in the healthcare market, but your idea of competition is the exact opposite of competition, especially when the government has the ability to dictate your choice, and has the power to tax and subsidize as it chooses. That's not a level playing field at all and it harms the market.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379993831", "subreddit": "conservatives", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You run a small pizza shop. Everyone's minimum wage. Some jerkoff in government sells a song and dance about how he's for the little man, so he claims he's tough on crime (as though *Anyone* wants to be soft) and he's gonna raise minimum wage (which actually cuts jobs- not that most of the chronically poor are *working* for minimum wage to begin with) to win an election. Your 50 employees performing a no / low skill job for minimum wage just got their pay raised from 8 bucks to 10 bucks. Assuming they worked full time your payroll for them was just over 830,000 bucks. Now it's suddenly 1,040,000. So you're either going to cut hours, or cut positions, because you're not a charity.

{"body": "I respectfully disagree that it's just \"Thanks Obama\" spin.  I think a business is supposed to act in its best interest, and when a law makes it in their best interest to drop employee benefits or reduce their working hours, I blame the law.  \n\nNow, where I agree with you is in your example of the $5,000 dollar coverage for an $86,000 dollar surgery.  But, here is where I think you and I may or may not agree.  The price for the surgery itself is what is ludicrous.  There is no reason whatsoever for that procedure to cost that much.  I have several medical professionals in my family that complain all the time about how overpriced hospital services are because of inusrance companies and government mandates.  One example my aunt gave me was a gall bladder surgery.  She said that without insurance it runs around $45,000 dollars, with insurance about $60,000 (depending on insurance, the 60k number is for BCBS in her area while Cigna was 44k), and with Medicare about $12,000.  How does that even make sense?!\n\nThe service is what it is.  It shouldn't cost one person one price and another person another price for the exact same service just because one is backed by a company that CAN pay more.  One big problem I have with the ACA and many other proposals is that they all do nothing whatsoever to address that problem.  I see no reason at all a hospital shouldn't be able to put starting prices (assuming no complications or special circumstances) up for people to see.  Why is it when I ask my doctor how much my procedure is going to cost, he doesn't know and flat won't tell me?  Why does he tell me I'll have to call my insurance company?\n\nSee, my opinion is that the ACA takes a wrong approach to solving healthcare by shuffling people towards insurance companies whose practices, I feel, are part of the problem.  If the hospital can tell Medicare or Cigna how much something costs, it should be able to tell me, too.

A couple of years later - $4 million! Shazzam!\n\nWell, when I got to Cisco I was recalibrated - stocking orders alone, just to put product on distributor shelves and into the stockrooms of our largest customers (who need to keep spares available in multiple spares depots to ensure they can meet service level guarantees) would easily top the total revenues of my company *before we shipped the first box*. All external signs would indicate that Pebble's moved O(100k) watches this year and I don't know of any Pebble App developer who claims to be making a living selling Pebble apps. Meanwhile, Apple claims ***biillions*** of app downloads a year out of a functioning App Store.\n\nWhat really mattered to us back at Cisco was TAM and the synergies any product would have with other product areas in the company (FYI, I worked in the Content Networking Business Unit, which dealt with things like caching, IPTV, content distribution, etc. Cisco liked to boast that we could sell you a \"POP on a palette\" - in other words, CNBU existed basically to ensure there was a growing market for switches and routers and to carry our weight we needed to show we could move multiple millions of dollars worth of the company's other hardware lines. Anything less as noise on the balance sheet and a distraction that diverted resources).\n\nSo, Apple may not need $100 million in revenue from Smart watches to ship one, but they would want to see enough synergy to justify the efforts of probably hundreds of people (tech writers, graphics folks, h/w teams, distribution channel folks, video folks, channel partners, manufacturing partners, etc) that would be needed to get a new Apple product line into the field. All the bitching here is probably signally to Apple that they're not late, so can sit back and keep working on things in the lab while waiting to see how things mature in the coming months.\n\nAll I can say is - \"Thanks Obama!\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380306755", "subreddit": "pebble", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My wife and I combined make about that much, definitely over 400k.  9 years ago I made 24,000 a year and thought if I could just make 50k I would be set until I had kids.  It doesn't really work that way.\n\n  We have a very fun life, but the cost of living is weird.  We talk about how often we feel poor compared to the people around us, and how insane that is.  Here's what I mean:\n  \nWe don't own a house because we live in southern California.  \n\nWe could buy an ok house for a million bucks, but we don't want to spend that much money on something we don't really like.  I have my own business, which means I'm pretty useless for a loan because it's stated income.  We can barely get a loan for our net worth. \n\nAll the nice houses we could consider are bought in cash by wealthy Chinese looking to put their money outside of the China real estate bubble.  So we rent a 2 bedroom apartment and save the money for a potential future down payment.  When we go on vacation we stay in nice places, but besides that we save our money and (hopefully) invest it well.  \n\nTaxes and planning for them are much more confusing than when I was making 50k.  We donate our time and money to a few charities, but that doesn't really help with taxes like it used to.  New laws have reduced that ability before we ever got a chance to benefit from it (this is where a \"thanks obama\" joke would go but I doubt you would read it sarcastically).\n\n**So, while we don't worry much, here's what do we worry about:**\n\n* We worry that her job might move her and I would have to shut down and relocate my business, which would take 4-5 years to get back up and running.  We would take a big financial hit there.  \n* We worry that she will lose her job (she got her job when the two people above her were fired).\n* We know her company isn't going to perform as well this year, so her bonus and stock options take a hit no matter how hard we work.  We can't accurately budget for how much it will be.\n* We worry about what college will cost for our kids, because we won't qualify for aid.\n* We worry about the stock market imploding with interest rate changes and losing 30% of our savings.\n*  We worry about our parents debt and taking care of them.  We may end up buying her parents a place instead of one for us.\n\n\nIt's basically stuff like that.  I've been broke and I've had money, and this is way less stressful.  We aren't worried about paying rent next month, but we definitely aren't set for life.  We don't live like this money is going to be coming in forever, either.  We live knowing that our income could be cut in half or our savings could potentially be cut by 30% at anytime.  It's not living in fear that it will happen any day, it's just an accepted reality.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380400484", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 793, "controversiality": 0}

The fact is, that people are going to be poor in any system, but I can guarantee you that libertarianism would have the least amount of poverty, because it is driven by the economic self interests of the individuals. People are driven for there own success, and people spend there own money more wisely than they will ever spend the money of others. Try governing 300 million people. Yeah thats the answer, tell them all how to live their life, start wars, bailout mega corporations and allow them to become the closest thing to mega monopolies that we have ever seen. What makes you think the poor and disabled wouldn't be given opportunity and welfare in a libertarian economy? What makes you so sure that people wouldn't take care of each other? Before social policies were in place, there were plenty of charitable contributions and not nearly the current amount of poverty. Look what our social programs have done. We place millions of people in small areas and high rises known as \"the projects\", we group them together, and community organize them together.
