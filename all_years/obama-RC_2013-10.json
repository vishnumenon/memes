{"body": "I'm six years into it. It's the most stressful and most rewarding thing in life. Imagine having your best female friend with you at all times. You have a partner in life. You share these incredibly intimate moments. You share love. You have sex. You have someone to share your thoughts with. You have someone to rely on.\n\nThe first year is great and awful. You find that person and you develop feelings. You explore how you feel with each other and discover that you both have affection for each other. That eventually blossoms into love. And you do cool things together. You go on living your life the same way as you did before, as does she. You give each other your space and you hang out occasionally. Occasionally turns to frequently. You see each other once a week and long to see each other twice when your schedules line up. You talk on the phone for hours. You chat during the day on the computer. You get to know the other person. You go out and have fun.\n\nEventually you start to discover some fatal flaws in your ideals and relationships. She wants X this way, you want Y that way. House. Kids. Family. Pets. Career priorities. Vacation priorities. Money. Etc. Not everything lines up. But it's good because you're just two friends having a great time together and also banging like jackrabbits. You're experimenting with every position and every place in the house or apartment or cardboard box with rope lights. Wherever you are, you're banging and banging and banging.\n\nYou start to stay over her place or he stays over your place. You practically live together...until you do. Expectations start to set in. \"I'm hanging out with my buddies on Saturday.\" \"But Saturday's our date night.\" \"Well, I'll take you out Sunday, or you're welcome to join us on Saturday.\" \"I don't want to get in the way of guy's night, plus it's breaking tradition!\" So you compromise on things like that. And you have fights over things like that. \"Sorry I'm not thrilled on our date night. I wanted to see my friends and I see you every day. But I sacrificed for you and don't feel appreciated for it.\" \"I'm sorry you see me as a burden.\" So you get in your first real fights. And they last. And they linger. And sometimes they get resolved. Sometimes they don't. But those fights can take hours. And you sit there and you have to remember not to react or get mad. But you can't just take shit and have to stand up for what you believe. It just sucks. For hours. It just sucks. You want to resolve it and go back to cuddling and watching movies. But she's furious. Or you're furious because she doesn't see what's important to you.\n\nEventually you move in together and really test it out. You love waking up to the other person every morning. You snuggle in your sleep. You get a pet. You get furniture. And then serious things get tested. Your career is the biggest one. Some nights you have to work late. It's just the way the economy is (Thanks, Obama ! :) ). You get a big opportunity at work because that's how work goes. And even though you're spending more time at work and making more money for the household, you're not there for her as much as she wants you to be. You get frustrated and require more space to cool down. Sometimes she gives it to you. Sometimes that space becomes the thing that distances you. You talk about it and work it out. You compromise. And the compromises are never satisfying.\n\nA few years in and you still love each other greatly. You might not snuggle as much while sleeping together. Sometimes you just want to turn to the side and sleep without your arm going numb. Work gets better. Your friends disappear slowly as they get in relationships. You spend more time with her than you do with your friends. Fights about expectations and priorities still happen. Work or relationship? Compromises happen. At this point you've met her family. They have gone from seeing you as the guy who's boning their daughter to the guy who is taking care of her. You spend less time with your family and more time with her. She takes up your time now. She becomes the most important thing in life.\n\nThe next few years are a lot more of the same. And you start to either grow together or grow apart. For me, growing apart happened quite a bit. She found new interests. I stayed the same. She wanted to do new things more and more to keep things interesting. I wanted to save money because living with 8 dudes in a house to two people in a townhouse really changes your expenses. You question your job situation and figure out what's important: stability or career growth. She's losing interest because things stay the same. After all, they're going to when you see each other every day and most nights you don't want to do something new. Back when it was new, that distance brought you together. Now, the closeness pulls you apart. So you spend more money on vacations, nights out, restaurants, and things get renewed. You have to find ways to keep spicing it up.\n\nYear four and five, it really gets tough. You figure out so many ways to keep reminding her of your love. But they're getting old. She's getting bored. The fights drag you down and you're getting weary. The expectations of your salary are higher. She wants to get a house and maybe even kids or marriage. You're not ready because this shit is fucking tough. Accumulation over the years of fights, expectations, priorities, baggage from previous relationships, poor decisions, changes in personality and priorities, all wear you down. You have fewer friends to rely on, and you have trouble telling your best friend in the world some things. An old conversation may have been, \"My boss is a jackass. I'm tired of being shit on at work.\" \"You'll make it, hun. Just have faith.\" That turns to: \"My boss is a jackass.\" \"You should be boss. Why aren't you boss?\" \"Because that requires 4 more hours at work each day and you already say we don't spend enough time together.\" \"Well you should be earning more. Stop selling yourself so short. I don't want to be with a guy with no confidence. \" \"I have confidence but I...\" \"I'm not looking for solutions. I just want to share with you how I feel.\"\n\nFamily strains really come in at this point. Their problems become yours, even more so than ever. And there are tougher times ahead. You have to find new ways to keep reconnecting. You end up watching Sister Wives or whatever shit she wants to watch most of the time. Eventually she gets mad when you do everything she wants to do because guys want to please and women want to be treated like princesses. It grates on you. It burns your soul apart. And love has gone from this sparkle you feel to a double-sided dagger between your hearts that stabs you both each time you hug.\n\nIf you manage to resolve your problems and can work together and maintain your friendship and relationship, maybe you get married. And I can't speak for married folks. For me, I'm at the six year mark. It feels like it's at the end. She finally got a big promotion and spends more time at work and meets so many new people there. They all live exciting lives and are young and single and have money, and by comparison I'm a boring fuck who doesn't come up with new, exciting things to do every week like everyone at work. We come home and see each other and care about each other sooooo much. It's true love. But the little things become big things. And if you're both good at problem solving, you just have to spend the time to work on these. If not, they become deal breakers. But they wear on you. You don't look forward to coming home every day. You see each other so much that you don't just chat on the phone or on the computer all day. And one of you misses that. You never make enough money. You never will. You're never available or too available. Expectations are too high, set by standards you can't possibly ever meet. And what guides you past that point is the strength of your love and your ability to work things out and see life together in the long term. Commitment is inevitable. You grow apart. But can your relationship handle that.\n\nTL;DR: It's fucking awesome and exciting at first. Become best friends. You bang like crazy. Meet parents. Move in. Accumulation of fights wears you down. Eventually you get bored of the day to day with each other. Expectations are high. Life pulls you apart. It becomes very difficult. True love becomes the glue that binds two heavily-cracked hearts together.\n\n*Edit -  I never thought I'd ever say this, but thank you so much to the person who gave me Reddit Gold!

{"body": "I am bored at work so I will bite.\n\nI do not agree with the statement that he is the worst president ever--in my book Hoover could easily take that prize. IIRC he passed a tariff during the Depression that messed up international trade and made the Depression much worse. \n\nObama has made many mistakes in office but the national attention span is that of a fly and most of the problems he has faced were caused by the policies of Bush coupled with the near meltdown of global finance.\n\nMany forget that Bush was the first to offer TARP. They also forget how healthy the economy was when Bush came into office. It is like we have three pilots on deck.\n\nClinton hands over the controls to Bush, the plane is cruising at 35, no turbulence and the souls in the back are enjoying their peanuts and soda. Without warning Bush puts the thing in a spinning nose dive. People fly everywhere overhead bins fling open and carry ons slam into old people and babies. Screams are heard as Obama jumps on he mike.\n\n\"Don't worry folks my name is Obama! I am going to take over and get you out of this nose dive!\" He jumps in and struggles for a long while. People start to get nervous. They can see the ground rushing up to meet them. But slowly he pulls out of the dive. The plane levels and the crew begin to get the cabin back in order. Ever so often there is a batch of turbulence which makes everyone scream and fear the worse. But he regains altitude after half an hour.\n\nBut then he announces that the plane is not in tip top shape. They may have to land early for repairs but they will all be safe and make it to their destination in one piece.\n\nPeople groan. What an inconvenience! What the fuck he said it would all be perfect and the way it was before he took controls. They forgot that Bush took it into a nose dive. And because of that they were facing death. \n\nThen Obama says,\" I am sorry but due to our plunging 15 thousand we have lost a bunch of free soda and you may have to share also the on board av controls broke so our on board entertainment is not available.\"\n\nThe cabin erupts in chaos.\n\n\"Thanks Obama!\" They scream. In the cockpit Obama looks at Bush and Clinton with exasperation.\n\n\"But we were in a nosedive I pulled us out of it I can't help if things aren't as perfect as before!\"\n\nBush smiles,\" Don't worry Berry! If we have to land early for repairs my brothers a pilot and he can meet us at the airport and take over.\"\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380743798", "subreddit": "cringepics", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll answer your above question here, since it relates to /u/wvtarheel's comment. First I think petty partisan politics is holding back the nation's ability to affect change. I said it above, and I don't think this is a position anybody really disagrees with. But, I don't think that \"thanks, corporate America\" is somehow dichotomous to \"thanks, Obama.\" I don't see corporations and Obama as being adversaries and I don't think corporations have any place in our government in the first place. \"Thanks, Obama\" is partisan bullshit, \"thanks, corporations\" is a stance on corporate meddling in politics. \n\nI understand that Citizens United was about constitutionality and that there are a number of legal arguments that support the ruling.

Here's one of them : \n\nDampwaffles11 [-1] 0 points 11 minutes ago* (3|2)\nHe probably didn't shoot earlier because of the left-wing nigger loving White race traitors and mud people who give White police officers endless crap about being racist and too trigger happy. Welp, your surrender to the Red/Brown (communist/non-White) alliance almost caused your death...\nAnd this nigger also probably shot at this White police officer because black people are constantly being bombarded by Leftists with a militantly anti-White and anti-police victimhood complex which claims that White police officers routinely harass innocent black people. That's probably why he was so confrontational over being pulled over for speeding.\nThanks Obama...\nAnd oh yeah, this video is also a great reminder of why the police have to shoot violent criminals 45+ times. Most handgun bullets are underpowered. I've seen and read about numerous examples of people being shot several times in the torso and chest and still being completely functional. So, when you have several officers aiming at one criminal, that's why that criminal will be shot dozens of times. It's not \"police brutality\" and racism, you degenerate morons, it's a tactical reality.\n\nPlus an image to the post : \nhttp://i.imgur.com/jF7RoMX.png", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380861343", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

He was native american so he usually had family that would bring him some fireworks from the reservations whenever 4th of July rolled around. We had been playing with firecrackers and bottle rockets all day having fun and causing trouble. After we exhausted the supply of firecrackers/bottle rockets we decided to switch over to some giant smoke bombs we found in the box. We lit a few and used them to the normal things like stain random objects, chase each other with, and stick them in mole holes. After a while we used up all the giant smokes bombs except for one, and I let him have it since he was the one who brought them over. He lit it and decided to hold on to it and let it burn out. A few seconds went by and I had this urge that he should really get rid of this one and so I told him to throw it. He shrugged and chucked it up into the air and right as it peaked, BAM! it just exploded into smoke and a million little pieces. I'm not sure how much damage it would have actually done to him, but I'm glad I didn't have to find out. \n\nTL;DR Thanks Obama", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381046750", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm from the Netherlands and I'm watching the Eagles at the Giants at the moment. Gamepass is free for us, so I can watch with a delay and just skip all the commercials. I started watching in 2009, I was bored and just came across it on tv. It was a preseason game with a guy I thought was pretty good a throwing the weird ball. Turned out to be called Tom Brady. Keep an eye on him, I think he'll do well. \n\nI started watching more games that season, the Vikings were great to watch, with Favre in his first year there and AD just plowing through heaps of massive men. My favourite player is Jared Allen, he just seems like a great guy and we're the same size, so I can pretend I look like him.\n\nThe game that really made me love football was Patriots at Jets 9-20-2009. The first half was all Patriots and Mark Sanchez had thrown for a total of three yards. Then in the break some smart New York man said, let's try throwing the ball more. And Mark Sanchez did just that. He threw the ball at the people who run with the ball and many points were scored. The Jets ended the game as the winners and I was convinced Mark Sanchez was a genius. \n\nAt the end of the season I had two favourite teams, the Vikings and the Jets. The championship games were incredibly exciting, but both ended dissapointing. If only Favre had tucked that ball and run out of bounds. I always watched the games the day after they were played, without commercials, no problem since no dutch news ever mentions the NFL. They do however, announce the Superbowl winner, so my first one was ruined for me. Thanks Obama.\n\nThese days I watch it more then ever, because I can watch any game at any time. I have no real alliance with any team, but I root for some teams based on their players or tactics and for some teams because I like their uniform better then their opponents'. I like the following teams in no particular order: Patriots(Brady), Vikings(AD, Allen), Jets(Sanchez), Redskins(RGIII), Packers(Rodgers), Broncos(Manning), Cowboys(uniform).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381091046", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Now lets imagine 2 years into the conflict the south is winning, China has taken notice and the way they see it is if the North wins they will have a better market to sell their goods in, so they decide to help the North in the fight.  China then sends thousands of troops and proceeds to drop bombs all over the south.  As a Northerner you may invite this action, but as a southerner or an independent your thoughts would have to be \"What the fuck is China doing here...this isn't their fight!\"\n\nThis is what America does all over the Globe, we butt into other countries business to satisfy our own needs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381156872", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I also agree with abortion for rape, incest, (done ASAP) and severe retardation. \n\nWhat I'm talking about is the VAST MAJORITY of abortions that are performed due to inconvenience. I would quote the census.gov study on this, but the site's down (thanks Obama, but that's another topic). IIRC 90% of abortions are convenience driven while about 5-7% are health of mother, then the awful cases are the other small bit.\n\nSo I can't wrap my head around how a vegan could be pro-life when it comes to animals but pro-death when it comes to humans.\n\nYou're very wrong in your assumption. I'm incredibly interested by all of these replies minus the trolls. What a great conversation! In fact, almost everyone so far here is validating my hypothesis in that I figured vegans would justify it by concluding the person inside the person is not life, therefore, it can be flushed out. It also further validated my hypothesis that vegans are not logical, science-based people (which probably should've been assumed from the beginning). Your (plural) decision to classify one type of life as sacred but another as expendable is based in convenient emotion, not fact.\n\nTherefore, all I can conclude is that vegan = hypocrite. You can't apply one rule to some and another to others.\n\nAnd as you can see, the responses are getting more and more shrill and troll-y. Looks like I better go.

Can you believe how irresponsible it is for these Democrats to shut down the government?  And since they won't negotiate, we have no choice but to sabotage the economy.  Thanks, Obama!\n\nAnd of course the \"negotiations\" that the GOP have offered are nothing but unilateral demands.  Every one of the \"deals\" being discussed include concessions by Democrats to appease Republicans.  What do Dems get out of this \"discussion?\"  Is it supposed to be some gigantic favor to the Democrats to pay federal workers what they are owed, and to maintain the full faith and credit of the U.S. by paying our bills as they become due?\n\nGrinds my gears, indeed.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381794087", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

I've read an account by a survivor of the Pearl Harbour attack who describes how, before jumping off of their destroyed, sinking battleship into water thick burning with fuel oil, the ship's company carefully lined up their shoes in neat rows along the deck.\n\n* As others have pointed out, we don't know what the context of the woman's remarks were. We don't know how MyFox Memphis edited it, and whether or how the YouTuber (or whoever else was along the chain) edited it. We also don't know if she was simply confused, or mis-spoke, or mis-understood a question, or any number of possibilities.\n\n* We don't know that this woman was of sound mind to begin with. Suppose she has the mental age of an 11-year-old; would anyone browbeat an 11-year-old kid for not fully grasping what it means that their cousins have just died horribly? (OK, some of you fucks would, especially if they were black and wore gold chains or some shit. But that'd be wrong too.)\n\nLook, I don't want to browbeat people for having racist stereotypes against black people lying around, cluttering up their mental machinery; most people have that, including most black people, and it's not something that one can control through sheer willpower. But at some point people have to be held responsible for the conclusions that they come up with.\n\nThe failure here is not thinking, \"GRR LAZY WELFARE N----- IRRESPONSIBLE TRASH BREEDING TOO MANY KIDS FOOD STAMPS THANKS OBAMA.\" The failure here is not interrogating and analyzing that reaction.\n\nNothing in this video provides enough real information to allow us to judge this woman.

{"body": "Attempt number three on Arma 3, and nothing seems to have improved.\n\nI was the AT for the infantry squad. Right off the bat we had the issue with the cloned/attached/glitched helicopters. I doubt this is an Arma 3 issue; it probably was just a oversight by the mission maker or user error, but it was a foreboding sign.\nFPS was low for me, and I think it was for a few other people too. It dipped down to unplayable levels often, even with view distance dropped &lt;1000 meters and foliage turned off. After shooting a few mans, and taking the terminal, the FPS issue began improving for some reason. Maybe I was imagining things. \nThat didn't matter much though, as a couple of minutes later I was booted for having a ping of 749 that went as high as 900 while I was waiting to rejoin. After waiting about 5 minutes, I rejoined to find myself back at the NATO FOB, all alone except for some asshole UAVs who decided to blow me up. Thanks Obama!\nAfter respawning and waiting a few more minutes, I made the decision that I was going to go on a sightseeing tour of Altis with a HEMETT repair truck as my tour bus. I was just setting out to see the scenic town of Paros when when a pair of pilots came landed nearby. They were sent to pickup a group of four guys. I guess that's what an AT specialist is worth these days.\nMy squad was having a pow-wow in the back of a tank when I rejoined them. They had completed an objective while I was exiled at the FOB and were moving to the next one. We dismounted after taking small arms fire. After exchanging a few bullets and taking cover in a compound I was kicked for ping again. Luckily I could rejoin right away this time with a nice cosy ping of 107. Unluckily I was kicked for a ping of 800 instantly. I give up.\n\nLet me just clarify that this does not happen to me with Arma 2. My internet is fine.\n\nAs for the mission, it seemed fine. The good guys to bad guys ratio seemed a little off sometimes, but it wasn't much of a problem. My problem with Arma 3 missions at the moment is that they all feel the same. It's like eating vanilla ice cream when there is a bowl of neapolitan on the table beside you. Sure, the neapolitan is a bit melted and warm compared to the crisp and cool vanilla, but it's all about variety! \n\nTLDR: Let's just stick with Arma 2 for just a little longer, at least until we get ACE and MP stability.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382228619", "subreddit": "ClearBackblast", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do a hundred Einsteins, but take it from this old nineties kid, I've spent my entire adult life in the gym, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.\n\n\nIf you only train one part of your body (and that's all a single exercise like Einsteins is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times.\n\n\nIt's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Carl Sagan. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.\nEinsteins basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent, the triceps. What you really want to do is train your entire body, all the major muscle groups (Pope Francis, NDGT, Snowden, legs, thanks obama and arms) at the same time, over the course of a workout. And don't forget your cardiovascular work!\n\n\nI'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three upvotes! Falling in love with getting karma, eating right, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make.\n\n\nBut do it right, okay?\n\n\nMy advice, find a good subreddit, with qualified karma whores who will design your programs for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for mental fitness. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).\n\n\nAnd don't worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into the circlejerk. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.\n\n\nNow get out there and do it! :-)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382296733", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "...okay, so the problem is you don't agree with affirmative action.  Well, guess what.  Cultural attitudes about black folks still persist in society, just like cultural attitudes about men and women!  There was a famous study a few years back that found that the bias against \"black\" names in hiring is such that applicants with the exact same qualifications as their \"white\"-named counterparts were hired drastically less.  In fact, the only whites with the same qualifications they were hired at the same rate as were felons.  A white felon is just as likely to get a job as a black man with a clean record and the same qualifications, welcome to the post-racial America, thanks Obama, etc. etc.\n\nAffirmative action and any program that seeks to benefit a previously disadvantaged group does so because we understand that *disparities are compounded over time*.  The rich get richer, and while the poor might not necessarily get poorer, they get richer much slower.  Giving slaves citizenship but not the means to practice it resigned them to sharecropping on their former owners' plantations, and they died poor and humiliated in a manner similar to what they would have if they'd remained slaves.  When blacks got political equality for a brief period they also got affirmative action and many varieties of assistance, which began to close that gap in the 60s and 70s, but an economic downturn and the Reagan era dismantling of the welfare system meant that the newly employed and self-sufficient black families found themselves jobless and without assistance.  And now the average black person has one tenth the wealth of the average white person and has a harder time finding a job or getting a mortgage/loan.\n\nWe correct these disparities because they are a problem in and of themselves.  Racism creates inequalities, and the crime and poverty resulting from those inequalities creates racism.  It is positive feedback, it will not resolve itself.  It will only *compound* with time.  We need to do something about it, obviously.

The friend would be able to reimbursement relatively soon, just not soon enough for the debt collector. I check my credit balance to find out I am maxed out, they put the whole charge on my card (not $200, all of it). I call and complained and they said there wasn't anything they could do the notes show it was an authorized charge. I spoke with a supervisor who said they listened to the call and it was authorized and they asked 3 times and received a confirmation. I was in the room listening to the call and my friend clearly said $200, weekly, nothing more, nothing less. I wanted to listen to the call myself and I tried with all my might to try to fight the charge because that's a lot of money I don't have.

{"body": "I apologize for not addressing every point completely and individually - it was an attempt to spend less time on this (because frankly, I have other things to do), not an attempt to ignore any valid issues.\n\n&gt; I think it's a sort of astroturfing effect\n\n*Please* tell me you're not subscribing to some conspiracy theory that it's all actually secretly written by liberals trying to discredit conservatives.  We'd have to stop then, because that would change my perception of you to that of someone not worth debating with.\n\n&gt; Why wouldn't they talk it up when a few idiots propagate a dumb rumor?\n\nLet's see: *The BlackSphere*, a conservative FB group that posts this kind of crap multiple times daily: 228K likes.  *Conservative Lady*, another with such gems posted as \"Obama’s BullSh*t Speech On ObamaCare Caused Pregnant Diabetic Woman To Nearly Faint\": 211K likes.  *I Am Conservative,\" another one posting a lot of whoppers: 249K likes.  Sounds like more than \"a few\" idiots.\n\n&gt; Health insurance companies want as much profit as they can get. Whether it's through the pre-ACA system or the ACA system, they'll do what they can to maximize profit. Under the ACA, they're still allowed to get profit margins of up to 20%, and they have increased sales volume. The ACA is specifically the reason that my insurance premiums are going up.\n\nOkay...which do you suppose is higher, a 20% ceiling or no ceiling at all?  If your larger customer base includes people that you're pretty much guaranteed to lose money on, what's the formula for projecting your profit?\n\nTo help me understand what happened in your individual case: did your rates go up, or your current plan is literally no longer available to you - period...and what were you told about it?  As I understand some of the research I've done, costs have gone up for some and down for others.  Mine appears to be going up a bit, too - but I am okay with that.  It also went up (a lot more than it will be now) in 2010, for reasons entirely unrelated to the ACA, so you know...shit happens.  That is no longer my provider.\n\n&gt;  The Obama administration's goal is 500,000 sign-ups by the end of October. As of right now, 476,000 have at least taken the first step towards signing up.\n\nYes, and the web site has apparently temporarily made that impossible.  Are you making the jump to the conclusion that those 476,000 somehow actually didn't want to sign up, or won't sign up as soon as the problems with the site are fixed?  I know they don't really count - yet - but do you think they'll all just forget about it?\n\n&gt; if they'd done it right, it wouldn't have been affected by the shutdown.\n\nYou mean like all the other federal sites, that were completely inaccessible during the shutdown?  I was actually kind of surprised it was up and running at all.\n\n&gt; the NSA leaks specifically portrayed the Obama administration in a bad light\n\nAn attempt has certainly made to do so, yes - but you don't honestly believe all of these NSA policies and inappropriate behavior are less than 5 years old, do you?  Again: what do you think would have happened to Snowden under Bush?\n\nI'm not happy about any of this NSA shit either, but I'm not naive enough to think what they've been doing was conceived or even implemented by the current administration...let's not forget that members of Congress on both sides were in the loop as well.\n\n&gt; This is a roundabout way of answering your question: the downstream result has been good for ensuring that organizations (including, among others, the ACLU) have been able to petition the government on behalf of their members.\n\nOkay, now that you're in the neighborhood: who is better positioned to take advantages of this glorious boon: the ACLU or the oil industry?  What, specifically is the ACLU allowed to do that they were not allowed to do before?\n\nDo you honestly not see any room at all for exploitation here?\n\n&gt; Obama wants to dry up the supply of many common types of firearms and prevent gun owners from easily transferring ownership, in order to reduce the number of guns (and of specific types of guns) owned by American citizens\n\nIs a far, far cry from \"Obama wants to take your guns.\"  Honestly, I think your passion about firearm rights is clouding your vision on this one.  (Not to incite you further on this one, but hey, look at that!  Another school shooting today, this time a middle school in Sparks, Nevada.  2 dead, 2 hospitalized.)\n\n&gt; First of all, look at Libya.\n\nHmmm...no war there that the US has entered.\n\n&gt; look at the expansion of drone strikes, particularly in Yemen and Pakistan\n\nYes, yes...part of the war in Afghanistan, we've covered that one already.\n\n&gt; And again, look at Syria.\n\nI just looked - double checked CNN and everything.  The US is not at war there, either.  Personally I'm glad of that, although I don't like the idea of them gassing their own citizens either.  \n\n&gt; We almost got into another major brawl in the middle east, and why? So that the POTUS wouldn't look bad for reneging on his red line?\n\nAlmost is not the same as did, is it?  You might as well claim that Kennedy got us into a war in the Caribbean for standing up to the Soviets.  \n\nIn fact, instead of a war we seem to have gotten potentially useful concessions that have a chance of saving peoples' lives.\n\nThanks, Obama.\n\nHeck, if it were Bush in office with what's been going on in Syria, there would have no asking Congress anything, that's for sure.  We'd be wishing the troops luck before they ship out to Damascus.\n\n&gt; 'Through viral channels' limits the debate. \n\nThis IS the debate I was talking about.  If you've got a solid, valid platform why would you need to spread so much deliberate misinformation through viral channels?  That doesn't create informed voters (which is what a party that *really* believes it's truly \"right\" should want), it literally creates *mis*informed voters, and it also creates (as was Samurai_light's point) marginalized nutcases...one of whom could, one day, solve the whole problem of a pesky member of the opposition with a bullet or a bomb or an envelope full of virus.  \n\nLet's see...who *else* uses the tactic of filling the not very bright with lies and telling them whose fault their misery is???\n\nWhile we're at it, the same goes for the tactics of gerrymandering and voter ID \"reforms.\"\n\n&gt; Anyway, off the top of my head I can think of another case in which the left pushed consistent misinformation: the Zimmerman trial.\n\nAgreed, that is a valid example.  I still don't think Zimmerman should have gotten off and I expect to hear that he kills someone again eventually, but there was a lot of misinformation flying around at the time.  So that's one good example from three months ago...meanwhile, I see a flood of a dozen or so every single day from conservatives through various channels...sometimes different forms of the same older lies, other times completely new carts of horse shit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382393747", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First, it's very important to understand any special rules your student loans have.  I'm at about 100k debt myself, but take great comfort in the special powers that my student loans come with (thanks Obama). \n\nFor example, my loans are currently in in-school deferment.  That means no payments until 6 months after I take my last class as a part-time or greater student.  Once they leave the 6-month grace period, they enter repayment, but even I can ask the bank for deferment up to 36 times on the payments.  \n\nThat means for 36 months over the life of the loan I can call the bank and tell them they won't be receiving a check this month because I don't feel like it - with no risk to my credit.  \n\nImportant note: The interest keeps accumulating.  Just because I'm not making payments doesn't mean I owe less.  I actually owe more.  However, if you definitely don't have money today, you're better off rolling the dice on tomorrow than getting credit-fucked because you didn't know to call.  \n\nThanks to these two rules I haven't made a single mandatory payment on my loans since originally graduating in 2008.  Instead, I've been 'zapping' entire loans in order of the greatest interest whenever my savings was high enough.  This way I have cash-on-hand when I need it (emergencies etc...) and the banks are still moderately happy. \n\nFix your panic with knowledge.  Call (don't email) your loan providers and work out the worst-case scenarios that are going through your head.  Know exactly how everything will play out and design for it.  \n\nDon't let it dominate your life.  They can't take away your credentials or knowledge.  The real worst case scenario is that you start becoming an expert in foreign [humanities] and skip the country.

It would have landed the Apollo capsule itself on the lunar surface.\n\nWhen Werner von Braun and his team were transferred from the Army to NASA and brought with them the Saturn rockets, two new approaches were considered, the Earth Orbit Rendezvous which entailed sending two Saturn C-3 rockets (larger than the IB, smaller than the V) into orbit to construct a craft which would then follow the direct ascent approach the rest of the way, and the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, which is what was eventually used, with the entire craft launched by a single booster, and a lander decoupling in lunar orbit, going to the surface, and then ascending again to rendezvous with the larger command module. LOR was initally dismissed as being the most complicated and dangerous option, but was eventually chosen since it allowed the spacecraft to travel light.\n\nThe cancelled (Thanks, Obama) Constellation Program would have made use of both Earth Orbit Rendezvous and Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, with the (very big) lander and earth departure stage launched into orbit by an Ares V, and later joined by a command module launched by an Ares I.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382443722", "subreddit": "KerbalSpaceProgram", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I have no choice but to pay the penalty and hope we don't get sick. \n\nEdit: to clarify - this is a private health care plan. I don't receive health coverage from my employer (small business) and I never have. I think they pay me fairly though. This plan is being completely cancelled due to Obamacare (I guess it doesn't meet the coverage requirements). The odd part of course is that the Obamacare plans that I will have to switch to have worse coverage! I will have more out of pocket, higher deductibles, etc. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382578630", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "score": 128, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A partial answer can be found by looking to the digestive system of the chimpanzee. In order to extract as many calories and nutrients as they can from their very meager diets, their guts are twice the size of ours, which is why all chimps appear to have beer bellies. At the end of their colon, they have an appendix-like organ called the cecum, which takes in digested matter and breaks it down a little more in a last ditch effort to squeeze out a few more calories before pooping it out. Unlike the human appendix, the cecum is somewhat large and is a vital organ for survival. Since chimps are extremely closely related to humans, we can reasonably guess that our common ancestor (who lived around the neighborhood of 6 million years ago) also had a cecum. It's very likely that as humans diverged away from chimps and became better and better at getting food, we no longer needed this extra organ, so it got smaller and smaller until we ended up with the shriveled little sac of acid we have today.

{"body": "TL;DR: SOME STUFF IS WRONG. JESUS DOESN'T EVEN GO HERE. I STILL HATE REPUBLICANS. THANKS OBAMA\n\nAnd it was most likely followers of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John that wrote the gospels. Some were written a generation after the death of Jesus. Some more problems:\n\nOn alcohol: The first miracle of Jesus was turning water into wine. I'm not talking a glass of wine either. He turned five barrels of water into wine. That was enough to keep the wedding party going for at least a week! (most weddings lasted three to four weeks at this time). In fact the wine tasted better than the best wine at the party. Not only to Christ condone drinking, he was sipping on patron! He probably wasn't condoning drunkenness, because he was a good Jew. Good Jews don't get drunk in that day, but he didn't see a problem with partying and even having a drink or two. \n\nChrist never said, \"thou shalt not stick coat hangers up thou vaginas\", but he did say \"come to me as children\". He was pro-kids for sure. And he was definitely anti-murder, as seen by the war quote. This one is kind of up to interpretation, If you think abortion is murder, then yes Jesus would lean right in that he would be against it also. \n\nA more accurate interpretation of Jesus' ideas on separation of church and state would be \"Give to Caesar what is owed to Caesar, and give what to God what is owed to God.\" This interpretation doesn't exactly show Christ as a proponent of separation of church and state, and why would he be? If I am starting a religion, I would love for the governing body to back it, but that's just me.\n\nOverall the picture explains the hypocrisy of the republican party, who claim to be governed by a set of Christian based moral values, and I would agree. We all are a little bit hypocritical. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382896202", "subreddit": "PoliticalHumor", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Story time!\n\nSo, I started off in college as a fine arts major at a major midwestern university known for engineering and little else. I love art, I love making art, I figured this was an awesome way to go. I figured wrong. It completely removed me of my desire to be creative. Decided that A) Going through the art program there would be a hellish, soul-killing slog and B) The eventual degree would be less than marketable.\n\nTook a year off and went into a community college studying computer information systems. Did decently well, got my degree, and then the whole economy shit the bed before I could start applying for jobs in earnest.\n\nSo, on the one hand, I got back my desire to make art and I've been putting on exhibitions - even selling some stuff. This is excellent and not something I really considered a possibility when I was in school. On the other hand, I still find myself unable to find a job fixing people's computer woes on anything more than a freelance basis. So I'm about in the same place I figured I'd be with the art degree.\n\nTL;DR: Thanks, Obama!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382927580", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Abortion! Illegal immigration!)\n\n* The collapse of the Babylonian family unit, and ensuing sexual orgies (\"The Roman Republic and Empire passed through the same phase, starting as a strong pro-family civilization, and ending up as an empire of sexual orgies that had openly gay emperors like Caligula and Nero.\")\n\n* Invocation of the \"empires last 200 years\" rule\n\nBonus:\n\n* Posters with uncanny foresight pinpointing the exact moment of America's downfall (Hint: Thanks Obama!)\n\n* \"China and Islam\" trying to conquer America\n\n* Atlantis and hints of ancient astronauts\n\n* Obama literally fiddles while Washington burns, great stuff!\n\nAt least some of it does get called out in the thread. But really, it's like shooting fish in a barrel so I only chose to address one point:\n\n&gt; The first great civilization to collapse was Babylon...When Babylon was at its strongest, the empire was known for strong morals and strong families...Centuries later, family bonds collapsed, and Babylon became famous for sexual orgies and gay relationships.\n\nWhat is meant by “civilization” here? Babylon under the Assyrians? Chaldeans? Persians? Regardless, I'm unaware of any evidence that points to homosexuality, orgies, and the degradation of the family unit as a major factor in its collapse. Removed from historical reality, the perception of Babylon as a den of vice and evil seems colored by Biblical influence...“Whore of Babylon” and all that.\n\nIt's a shame really, and a disservice to the achievement of the ancient peoples who made Babylon the remarkable urban center it was. I don't know what if any sources this person used, but it seems they've confused Babylon the Biblical *symbol* with Babylon the really-real geographical city, and that makes for bad history.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382965915", "subreddit": "badhistory", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

I'd be willing to bet that the candidates were entirely sincere but when Obama got in office and was briefed on the reality of the situation, he suddenly had to backpedal and start breaking promises and re-spinning some of his stances.\n\n- The Congress and the Senate are the biggest legislative fuck ups we've had in a ridiculously long time.  The Repubs are obstructionist and the Dems can't seem to draft sound policy if their lives depended on them.  Obama was dealt a shit legislative hand and has been juggling them as well as can be expected.  \n\n Personally, some of the biggest gaffs of Obama's have been when he writes checks his ass can't cash.  Like saying chem weapons was a red line in Syria, not really expecting Assad to keep using them.  Then he had to punt to Congress to try to take the pressure off of himself for running his mouth.  *That* was a 'thanks Obama' moment, for sure.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382993157", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "THIS IS NON-NEWS GRAND STANDING!\n\nHere is a true story:  My wife is on Texas' High Risk Pool health insurance (run by the state because she has pre-existing conditions and can't get health insurance any place else.  It's Blue Cross/ Blue Shield's High Risk Pool from Texas).  We got a letter about 2 months ago that Texas was going to cancel the High Risk Pool health insurance by December 31, 2012 (2 months from now) because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nAt first, it was 'HUH'? But, then we always knew that we would get a better health plan when the Exchanges went live and we could compare plans.  Also, the reason her insurance was canceled was **because it now did not meet the minimum requirements of the ACA**.  This needs to be repeated!  The Texas High Risk Pool was setup because of my wife's pre-existing conditions.  The ACA has now did away with insurance companies denying her coverage because of her pre-existing conditions.  So, the reason for Texas's High Risk Pool health insurance existence is no longer relevant.\n\nSo, my wife and I got onto healthcare.gov (which took about a week of trying and trying again), but we were able to look at the plans.  **The Gold and Platinum plans are leaps and bounds better than what she had with the Texas High Risk Pool plan.**  We will pay about the same amount in premiums (her and I), and will now have $0 deductibles (whereas we have about $10,000 for deductibles right now) and now only $3,000 out of pocket per year (whereas we now have some ungodly amount now).\n\nSo, THANKS OBAMA!  You gave us the opportunity for BETTER health insurances than what was offered through Texas's High Risk Pool.  And Good Riddance!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI should also note that she has had the Texas High Risk Pool insurance for almost 10 years, and every year like clockwork the premiums would go up, up, and up some more.  When the ACA law passed, I couldn't believe my eyes when we saw the next premium letter say that next year's premium would be lower.  WOW!

(edited last comment)\n\nI guess Netcast is good around here, because they've been consistently at 50/25 (or over) every time I checked, although it is (to my knowledge) a dynamic IP. I use quite a lot of bandwidth for a residential user - don't judge me - and haven't experienced any complaints either.\n\nI did, however, have some serious issues with Temporal Cautioner before I moved a few months back. I was paying for 25/5, was getting 5/0.5, then tried upgrading to 50/10 and was still stuck at 5/0.5. I thought it was a problem on my end (dad insisted on using a switch which had a documented bug in which it would throttle the bandwidth) but after swapping out all of the equipment, no change. I called them, and it took an extra day for them to call back and suddenly the speed was good, but then the instant they hung up, back down to shit. I called again a few months later - same thing happened. Gotta love the cable oligopoly. Thanks Obama.\n\nSo, in the end, the difference is an IP block and dedicated support, depending on your frame of reference. Thanks for the explanation.\n\n(I should point out that during my visit to the Netherlands last year, gigabit fiber was the norm at the 3 houses I stayed at, and there's obviously that fiber experiment that started in Chattanooga *the year after I fucking moved away*.
