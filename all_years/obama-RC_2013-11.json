The city is growing fast and it generally seems like Rochester will continue in the right direction. There are only two downsides for me.

I'm hoping the U of MN campus will expand further and bring in younger folks and shake it up a bit.

{"body": "[ESTP] Here's exactly how I would spin what you just said to complain the same way about N-types.\n\n&gt;when I read about \"N\" descriptions and try to understand their thought processes, I'm put under the impression that they live only in the abstract world without giving too much thought to what reality they live in, and without looking at the practical possibilities. I hate to think this, but I see them as more idealistic individuals who get lost in their own minds and cannot relate to others.\n\nIn the same way I just negatively-stereotyped N-types, you're negatively stereotyping S-types. And I don't believe either is correct.\n\n\nFirst of all, xSTP types tend to be independently-minded and rule-breaking individuals. The combination of Se/Ti or Ti/Se makes us social adapters yet trendsetters or lone wolves when it comes down to it. In other words, no, not all S-types are \"sheep-like individuals\".\n\nSe is a perception function that operates like a hypersensitivity of the environment including body language, verbal cues, social awareness, etc. To me, this includes learning by DOING, learning through hands-on experience, etc., whether it's math problems or learning a new skill. I can't really speak as much to Si.\n\nHere's why N-types are not inherently any smarter, \"deeper\", or \"intellectual\" than their S-type counterparts. The more S/N you are is not a function of intelligence. Just like I know plenty of smart N-types who I respect, I also know not-so-smart N-types. Being an N-type does not limit you from having a simplistic, black-and-white perspective on your opinions. In fact, most people are like this in general.\n\nAnother point is that just because an N-type may be more likely to be making under-the-surface connections, that doesn't mean they're correct. People make dumb connections all the time: \"Price of gas is up? Thanks, Obama!\" \"You're mad at me? Is it because of this irrelevant, arbitrary thing I did 15 minutes ago?\" Not every connection is a good one. The more developed your perception function is with your judging function, perhaps the better connections you can make.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you haven't met enough S-types that might change your perception of their stereotype, but we really do see things differently than N-types. I won't lie that some S-types seem very sheepish or repetitive of authority/established norms. But just because you're being different than that, doesn't mean you're automatically better (again, not all \"understandings/connections\" of things are good ones). In the same way you see S-types as sheepish, I see certain N-types as purposefully unique/individualistic JUST for the sake of setting themselves apart from others (and then claiming moral/intellectual superiority). S-types have plenty of gripes about N-types as well about communicating with N-types, so it all cuts both ways.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383551329", "subreddit": "ENFP", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Teaching them to be able to do basic math quickly in their head and only writing down what they cannot memorize, or forcing them to never learn how to do things quicky and make them write it all down?\n\nI battled teachers and took C's in classes where I was doing A+ work in from elementary to high school knowing I was right, that being able to KNOW the math was more important than memorizing how to write it down. Its not like I was getting C's because I had the wrong answers. I was doing everything right, but automatic C because of no work shown and because I use pen and hate writing with pencils. Then the teacher would contact my mother, my mom would get pissed at me since the teacher had to call her and take my gamecube, meanwhile I'd show her at conferences that I'm not doing anything wrong as far as getting the answer. \n\nLow and behold after 12 years in the K-12 system and 3 years into college I am in a Business Stats class where the professor assumes you not only remember everything from your algebra and calc classes but you can do things in your head. So where as in every other class a quiz will be the only thing you do that day, he'll delegate 10 minutes of class towards the quiz because \"You should be able to do it this fast\", meanwhile 10 minutes is obviously not enough time to write it all in the calculator let alone show your work.\n\nIf I would have been allowed to internalize how to quickly look at formulas and do them without having to write them down (like how I was able to learn how to go through a book and get the important information and the main point without having to read it, or being able to read sheet music and play first chair cello by ear, or by learning how to draw by watching someone better than me draw, etc) I'd be in a much better spot.\n\n\nBut no\n\nTHANKS OBAMA", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383568067", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Again, I agree with u/flor501 completely.  You'll be able to get insurance in a month [thanks Obama] but I have a few recommendations.  First, set up an appointment with a neurologist that works out of a hospital.  Two reasons: sometimes it takes weeks to get an appointment and also because of charity care.  Hospitals have a charity care program that it sounds like you qualify for.  That will make your visit and the subsequent tests free, or at least affordable for a year.  Next, check for contraindications with topamax.  For example, eating grapefruit interferes with a lot of anticonvulsants.  Also, no more alcohol.  Get plenty of sleep and try to remove yourself from stress as much as possible.  I'm in grad school with two kids so I know de-stressing may be impossible but give it a shot.  Last, and this is unconventional due to your lack of insurance at present, but small amounts of pot may help.  I don't partake, myself but some research indicate that it may help preventing seizures.  I suspect that it is not acting as an anticonvulsant but rather tends to lessen general anxiety and lower stress.  Epilepsy sucks and I'm sorry this happened but know that plenty of us are living with it.  With the proper treatment it won't even change your life expectancy.  I won't lie though.  Adjusting to the meds and to having the condition is going to be tough.  Just keep at it and don't give up.  Getting angry at it works for me.

According to Lil B:\n\n&gt;Based means being yourself. Not being scared of what people think about you. Not being afraid to do what you wanna do. Being positive. When I was younger, based was a negative term that meant like dopehead, or basehead. People used to make fun of me. They was like, ‘You’re based.’ They’d use it as a negative. And what I did was turn that negative into a positive. I started embracing it like, ‘Yeah, I’m based.’ I made it mine. I embedded it in my head. Based is positive.\n\nWhen his followers want to thank him for something specific he has gifted them with or just celebrate they will often exclaim \"thank you Based God\" to the point in which it's evolved into a greater overall declaration of sentiment. Kind of like how the \"Thanks Obama\" meme is used to sarcastically or not to point out frustration, \"Thank you Based God\" is sort of the same thing dynamic but a different emotion, as a meme it expresses genuine gratefulness towards the world manifested in the form of Lil B.\n\nLike if I got a good grade on a test, or if it was sunny outside, I might say \"Thank you based god\".\n\nNow it's become a \"thank you based _______\" to signify whatever entity is being based.

So not only was Dr. Bowers close, but my insurance was only willing to cover a surgeon in-state and Dr. Bowers just happened to be in San Mateo. So I was incredibly lucky to have a world-class surgeon be super close to me. \n\nWhile it is true that the thai surgeons usually create more aesthetically \"nice-looking\" vaginas, the thing is vaginas come in many shapes, sizes, and forms in cis-land. What other surgeons go for is more so the vagina that's emphasized in Western Beauty Standards (beauty capitalism based on European standards basically). That said, mine looks great, and works pretty great too! I have seen Suporn, Brassard, McGinn, and other Bowers patients and I have to say I did not witness one post op vagina that wasn't beautiful -- everyone I saw has gorgeous work done on them. The pictures on surgeons websites are very bad representations of the work that is possible. You have to know a post-op girl in person to really see just how incredible the results actually are. \n\nBowers, like other American surgeons does emphasize function over looks, but again, most people I slept with can't tell the difference. Even my gyno didn't until I outed myself. There are lots of suture in the beginning but those degrade over time. I do have scars on the labial tissue but other girls have thinner scars then me. In fact Dr. Bowers is doing some corrective work on me to cover up the scars more.

{"body": "&gt;Why would any man want to be with a woman who is shallow enough to consider an uncut dick a deal breaker? \n\nNo offence, but I'm fairly surprised someone with a handle \"XOXOGurlGamerXOXO\" hasn't considered that some (famous cliché is that **all**) men would like some meaningless sex now and again. \n\nThere's a fair deal [many men would glance over to get laid.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQlIhraqL7o&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=114) Particularly horny teenagers.\n\n&gt;If my boyfriend were uncircumcised, I wouldn't love him any less.\n\n&gt;The solution to this problem is not to keep cutting dicks, but to encourage people to be less ~~shallow~~ insecure. \n\nThe reason I altered the above, is that IMO you miss a rather big, though separate point. You probably wouldn't ditch a guy that sometimes has a problem getting it up. Maybe you prefer quickies to 2 hour sessions. But you need to realize that there's an incredible pressure on men to perform, and while the world as we know it would possibly be better without that pressure being there... well it is. We have to perform. We have to make you come before we can. We have to leave you in awe, or it undermines something very important in our identity. Which leads me to adressing the following:\n\n&gt;If less and less men were circumcised, cut dicks would be less and less expected. \n\nThere's certain ideals we should strive to accomplish, but we cannot afford to ignore the reality around us as we do it. OP states that circumcision is _always_, unquestionably, for any reason, in any time - past, present and future - wrong. In future, if we get back from a different status quo, perhaps. But in present time in NA, I'd say it's quite inconsequential, and with pro's to be considered in favour of early circumcision.\n\nedit: god fucking dammit, fucking YT changes strike again -_- I was linking to 1:55 into the video. *Thanks Obama.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384363959", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": " ^EDIT: ^I ^put ^the ^problem ^descriptions ^in **^bold** ^to ^separate ^them ^from ^my ^bullshit.   \n(***PS3***)    \n\n1. **Game tends to freeze during some Obliteration matches. Happens randomly, but usually on large maps with transport helicopters, yet does so inconsistently.** Sure, the game freezes in other matches, too, but freezing rarely occurs for me, yet I can always count on it happening during an extended play session of Obliteration games. If I was still an adolescent being required to share the controller with my little brother, this is the mode I would make him play with the stipulation of \"we'll take turns and trade off when a match ends, *no matter what*\" because I love him but, you know what?—fuck him, *I'm older*.  \n\n1. **You often deploy and have to wait between two and five seconds before you equip your weapon**. I really need my weapon in this game. Needs to be fixed pronto (I thought I read it was fixed for PC, but holy shit I'm not sure what's being fixed and broken and fixed and re-broken there anymore), or the ability to bull-rush and disarm others needs to be added, because that's what I wind up doing when this happens and I have to bring my face to a gun fight.  \n\n1. **When you try to pick up the weapons scattered around some maps by holding Triangle, you often grab them (Triangle being held) then immediately discard them (Triangle released, or sometimes still held, it's pretty inconsistent).** Context menu issues, man... Why can't you just dedicate *one button* for doing *stuff*? I'm tired of standing in the middle of the open appearing to test the weight of a weapon because I have delicate hands and they bruise easily, gotta make sure this rocket launcher isn't gonna ruin my modeling career for Zales, and since my hands now hurt, I'm sure my back soon will, too, as I probably just pulled landscaping duty.\n * On that same note, **placing gadgets like mines (weapons, so hold Triangle to pick up) or Radio Beacons (an item, so hold Square to pick up) next to vehicles screws up the context detection of entering a vehicle or picking your stuff up, depending on what you're wanting to do**. But somehow fate dictates that it's always what you're *not* wanting to do for which the context menu prompts you. You wind up running around the vehicle like an idiot looking for a way in because the driver-side door is locked by an almost-impossible-to-retrieve-due-to-context-detection EOD bot and there's a bollard control near the other side, and On-Star is unreachable due to Commanders spamming EMP UAVs, and I can't call Triple A because I have AT&amp;T as my service provider, nevermind the EMP, that's the least of this fucking phone's problems.  \n\n1. **The first tier of specializations often isn't active, blatantly observable with specs whose first tier provides more of something, such as Grenadier (no extra grenades) and Anti-Tank (no extra mines).** Some people have complained about this before here and users have been telling them that you have to score points to unlock tiers, which is true, but the first tier is always active by default, just want to put that out there for anyone reading. And similarly, *all* tiers of specializations, when you reach them in a match, sometimes don't activate. My sniper kindly requests a fix for his lack of steady aim duration, and regrets that he was a heavy smoker in his youth, as he grew up in a rough neighborhood with no role models, and wants you to know that your vindictive mind will get its moment of schadenfreude once he dies when his stage 3 lung cancer progresses, as his history as a part-time chimney precludes him from any transplant lists (part-time usually means no health insurance, too, *THANKS OBAMA*, but he's a Russian national, he's not even eligible for Obamacare), but then again, he has a few bricks of C4 in his pocket, so maybe he'll light up *just one last* smoke and dive off this building onto that tank below...\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384548448", "subreddit": "battlefield_4", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Your free game.\n\nLet's look at some statistics, \"In July 2013 minimum wages in EU Member States ranged from EUR 159 to EUR 1 874 per month.\" I get there are a vast range of countries. But let's look at a few of the main ones.\n\nEngland: For 21 and Over(I'm not going to consider the other stats since there's too many variables there and many people over here work below minimum for other things as well) Is £6.31. That's about $8.50 US. France and Ireland both have higher wages than that.\n\nThe United States is $7.25.  So you're making more. On top of that, what your taxes pay for, ours don't.. So don't take our Tax \"breaks\" as a benefit as though we automatically have more to spend. We don't. It just allows us more freedom with our money, yet we still spend it *on the exact same things*.\n\nAfter that's all said and done, we're roughly on equal footing. You're getting an extra $60 game with your console. Others are not. The $60 game was to bring it closer to the value of the PS4. Yet we still see the same difference here in the U.S.\n\n&gt; Thanks obama! They took ughr jobs! Why can't I hold all these cheap products! \n\nDon't resort to childish behavior.\n\nEdit: Your items cost more, again, because of the taxes. It's your country that allows it. You live in a democracy. No where am I complaining that I don't get a $60 game for free. Please, point to where I said that I hate/dislike that we don't get a free game.\n\nI only said, \"Doesn't mean they should get free stuff for creating their own issue.\" That doesn't mean I don't think you or me shoudln't get a free game.

{"body": "Shit, I completely forgot about one of my favorite F1 cars ever, the Lotus 88. The car was designed by Lotus for 1981 at the height of the ground effect era, and featured an incredibly clever design. The car featured two chassis. The usual chassis from that era were generally very stiff to maximize ground effect from the side skirts and fucking huge venturi tunnels, so drivers were very worn out and uncomfortable in the cockpit because of the cornering forces. Often times, teams would use switches in the cockpit to lower the ride height of the car once the driver left the pitlane - this way, they would pass minimum ride height tests when in the lane, but still have the cars absolutely slammed on the track in race trim. \n\nThe guys at Lotus designed the 88 with a stiff outer chassis to maximize the car's ground effects and handling, but the car's second chassis was built within the primary outer one, and was softly sprung and contained the cockpit. This kept the drivers relatively comfortable for the race distance but still maximized handling capabilities. It was also just the second F1 car to primarily use carbon fiber. Unfortunately, many of the F1 teams argued that the second chassis was a moveable aerodynamic device, and Lotus never managed to race the car even though it practiced. I feel like at this rate, you could argue that pretty much everything on the car is a moveable aero device, but whatever.

The broken website doesn't prove that universal healthcare is a bad idea in theory. No one is arguing that, as it's obviously untrue. The broken website proves that the ACA, specifically, as implemented by the bloated Federal Government, is a bad idea.\n\nThe law you were sold is a farce. Healthcare prices aren't going down. Mine didn't at work. They had to change providers because of the ACA. It stayed about the same except that my deductible went up and now I have to carry two insurance cards instead of one. And I got off easy. Thanks Obama.\n\nYes, healthcare in US is fucked. It's too expensive. But that's because non profit hospitals are allowed to charge whatever they want for supplies and procedures while their executives bring home millions, sometimes billions, of dollars. The ACA does nothing to address that. The ACA is just a way to get more people buying insurance, sold to you as \"homeless people should have health insurance shouldn't they?\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384971776", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This reply is way above and beyond anything I was expecting!!\n\nI want to share some of my thoughts. Warning, here be rambling.\n\n&gt;I personally don't have experience with the other parts of Canada, but compared to SF, California goes on \"at-will\" employment, which means your relationship with the employer can be terminated at anytime (and initiated by either of you). Comparatively, this will mean that Vancouver is more cautious with hires as we do not have the same laws.\n\nIs that such a bad thing? Do you know how many horror stories I've heard on Reddit regarding at-will employment in the states? You have zero recourse. I thank my lucky stars every day that we have the Employment Standards Branch. BC is more friendly to workers than other provinces, from my unscientific research.\n\n&gt; Pay here is definitely lower compared to California, and (I believe) our tax rates are higher. Also note that in SF, a small 1 bedroom suite can set you back ~3k.\n\nI fully admit I've drunk the socialist NDP Kool-aid here, but I'm fine with the higher taxes. They help support our higher overall standard of living compared to the US. The inequality is jaw dropping--just compare West Oakland to Los Gatos or Palo Alto. If you're a contractor or self-employed in Canada, you won't be financially wiped out by a sudden illness.\n\n&gt; Here in Vancouver (despite the ridiculous house prices), you can get a comparable unit in Yaletown for ~1400.\n\nSan Francisco is a big, well established city. Vancouver is a small backwater town that has been betting the farm on resource bubbles for decades. I mean, it's come out alright, but its economic base could use some reinforcing. When people think about Vancouver being expensive, they probably think about home ownership, but rents reflect how much less people make in Vancouver compared to the Bay Area. Metro Vancouver also has the blessing of being relatively compact, at least north of the Fraser. You can find suites that are close to SkyTrain for between $500-700 (if you want that for some reason), and rooms within the downtown core for $700-1000. Even out in the Peninsula or South Bay, a good 1br will run you $1500-2000. And, going back to the inequality thing, cheap rents usually mean high crime in the Bay Area, but there are exceptions to every rule.\n\n&gt; I've worked at SAP previously, the pay is fairly low, especially compared to companies like Amazon and Facebook, but with most teams on Amazon, they have notoriously poor work-life balance, and virtually no benefits (I have seen offers by both Amazon Seattle and Vancouver so I know the numbers).\n\nI've heard bad things about SAP. Basically, it's boring enterprise stuff that will confuse you, but it pays well. Reddit's main demographic skews towards the trendy, like Ruby on Rails. You mentioned \"hip\"/new technologies further down in your post.\n\n&gt; At the same time, there's more of a diverse demographic in Vancouver, where developers are more of the minority, so you can get a lot of new ideas from different domains; SF is more or less a \"group-think\" (don't be mistaken, lots of intellectuals, it's just a byproduct of a less diverse demographic).\n\nThat's very interesting and something I've never heard before. I know from researching Vancouver's game industry that it's very inbred, and assumed the rest of the tech industry was the same. I guess I was right, but I never thought SF would be group thinky. In fact, I thought SF would be even more fast paced and innovative because of the VC pouring in, the boatload of whip smart students (Cal, Stanford, to a lesser extent SJ State--really UBC and SFU can't compare). Could you expand on this group think?\n\n&gt; One thing I'd like to point out since you mentioned Hootsuite. I wouldn't recommend anymore to work there unless they know what they're getting into. \n\nI will check out the article and tell you what I think.\n\n&gt; A few big companies you missed out in your list (you might already know of them but I'll add them), Microsoft's subsidiaries (places like BigPark studio), Vision Critical, Facebook (though the hires are from all over the world, people who are unable to get visas to the U.S this year, so they leave them close to the border temporarily), and Twitter (I'm not sure if they're actually here yet, been a lot of word about them coming a few months ago, but I don't think they're here).\n\nI'm not surprised about this--it's the Big Tech companies' ways to deal with America's 9/11 hysteria-induced closing of the borders. So misguided. Thanks, Obama! /s\n\nPixar closed up shop but that was more design than programming, I guess. But I can't believe I forgot about Vision Critical. I thought Microsoft subsidiaries in Vancouver were meant as transition points to Redmond. One thing I forgot to mention was Amazon buying 91000sf in the Telus Garden (new Telus HQ downtown). Speaking of Telus/Shaw, you didn't mention them much--do you not know anyone who works at the big telcos? I would assume there is a large amount of C#/Java legacy code you were talking about. I'm not experienced enough to hate on legacy code yet, so classify me as indifferent to it.\n\nOh yeah--there needs to be more office space in Vancouver! Too many condos being approved, but the condo developers bankroll all the local political parties so there's no stopping it. But [Vancouver does have 1Gbit internet in downtown](http://onegigabit.ca/residential.shtml), and I hear home internet in the Bay Area sucks.\n\nWhew.\n\n---\n\nThere is another thing Canada has going for it--you can import foreign cars as long as they're 15 years old, which means in just over a month, [these (well not these, this is the Nur which is a 2002 model, but I couldn't find a photo of an untuned one)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Nissan_Skyline_R34_GT-R_N%C3%BCr_001.jpg) will be legal to drive on our roads. They are illegal to import into the US and routinely get seized by ICE--there have been several WH petitions aganst this practice.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385691161", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
