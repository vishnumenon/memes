Any individual or family which earns less than 4x the federal poverty limit (about 92k now, if I recall correctly) is eligible to receive a subsidy, paid directly to the insurer, to help with premiums.\n\nFinally, you might also ask your insurer why they increased premiums twice over.

{"body": "First, if a rape victim looked me in the face and told me they had PTSD and asked me to stop saying the word rape, I would probably do it (and mentally tell them to get over it, because I no longer believe non-soldiers when they tell me they have PTSD - thanks Obama).\n\nBut we aren't talking about someone coming to me and saying \n\n\"please stop using the word rape as a metaphor\" \n\nWe are talking about some random guy on the internet trying to tone police an entire community by saying \n\n\"Guise! Guise, someone somewhere might be offended by what you guys are saying. Pls stahp. Can't you think of the feeeelz you are crushing?!\"\n\nAnd no, alcoholism/drug addiction is not sooo different from rape. They both have the ability to destroy lives, if the victim allows it. They both require a huge amount of personal reflection and growth to overcome. And please, please tell me that alcoholics deserve it, or brought it on themselves or something like that. Please, display a profound lack of empathy while you cry for empathy for rape victims.\n\nWith that said, I can't believe you unironically compared the word rape to the word nigger or faggot. You have got to be fucking kidding me. This is SJW next level new meta shit right here. I like how one is associated with burning people at the stake, another is associated with hundreds of years of slavery, and the third is an act experienced by people of all colors, genders, sexes, socio-economic leves and handedness. You see, nigger and faggot both target very specific groups of people, while rape... isn't even an insult. At all. I just... wow.\n\nAlso, since when are we obligated to make every environment friendly and welcoming? Where is it written that having one's fee fees protected by everyone else is some kind of fucking human right? We don't need to attract non college age white people (also funny that you assume that all dota players are white... why would you do that?). If they want to play, let them come. I got no fucking problem with that. Just don't ask me to police my tone in *my fucking space*. Dota is my off time. I don't give a fuck about your fee fees on my off time. It's *MY FUCKING TIME*. Don't like it? Go play Animal Crossing. Also, I am not college age, nor am I middle-to-upper class. Nor am I an internet scumbag. So obviously the game is not inaccessible to people who don't fit your description.\n\nI don't use the word nigger, faggot, spic (or any related latino slur), any slurs for Russians, Filipinos, Brazilians, etc. I don't flame people for using Spanish, Russian, or Portuguese. I compliment people when they work well with the team, *especially* when they don't speak the language. I don't flame the women I play with, when they are brave enough to use voice chat as a woman. (I also don't go out of my way to compliment them for teamwork, because being a woman doesn't make teamwork harder - not speaking the same language does). \n\nI'm just god damned tired of people claiming nothing in life is worse that rape, and that rape is literally Hitler, and everyone who is raped, or might be raped, or *feels* like they might be raped deserves to be treated like a porcelain doll, like they might shatter at any moment. And that rape is so different from everything else in life that it is in a category of evil all on its own, and comparing anything to it is sacrilegious and bad, and whoever does it should feel bad.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386082738", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Are you taking a contract position with a company, or are you planning on starting your own consulting firm?\n\nIf you're taking a position with a company, you can just be a sole proprietorship, and if you feel it's necessary, get liability insurance for yourself. This will make your tax situation easier: you just fill out a separate form once a year, instead of filling taxes every quarter. Do some quick google searching and you'll find that sole proprietorship is almost always better, unless there's a risk that you can really fuck up something (hint: in consulting, this rarely happens).\n\nIn Oregon there's a relatively straightforward process to start a business, the state provides complete walk through guides. I've only founded non-profits corporations, and that was simple, it just takes time (for a non-profit, up to a 1.5 years to get state+federal recognition), if you need it in a hurry just call over and over again. Some counties and most cities require you file with them too (i.e., The People's Socialist Republic of Multnomah County).\n\nIf you have an LLC you'll be filling taxes separately for that organization on top of filing your own income taxes, I don't know it's going to compare to a sole proprietorship's tax in hard numbers. I can almost guarantee you'll have an easier time with taxes having a sole proprietorship than an LLC. \n\nI've had people help me with taxes in the past, and I've done them on my own. The most important thing is just to track expenses for your business using accounting software like Quickbooks. I learned quickbooks/accounting from Youtube, if you are unwilling/unable to do that, then hire an accountant. Quickbooks used properly will likely make it possible for you to do it all yourself. You'll track transactions like, supposing, a laptop as part of your business, but you probably won't have much business equity since you're doing consulting services. A big question to ask yourself: do you plan on purchasing things for your business, like expensive servers, or will you be working on client's equipment? Can you work in a virtualized environment instead, like AWS/Azure, and keep your costs to do business lower?\n\nNo idea about healthcare. Thanks, Obama.\n\nYou'll need to provide a client a W9. This is a standard form, and your client will send you a copy to fill out. You write your tax-ID (SSN or EIN), check the box for what type of company you are, and sign at the bottom. That's it. You'll likely need business insurance as well, at least $2 million dollar liability depending upon your clients (this is fairly cheap for IT consulting). \n\n--------\n\nInstead of asking Reddit, I'd recommend going down to any of the 50+ entrepreneurial/start-up groups in Portland. Be prepared to be disillusioned. In my experience, half of the small business owners in Portland don't even try to seem legit, their books are in horrible order, they barely and only apathetically comply with the law, and many of them are not complying with taxes or otherwise embezzling money from their business. Talk to some college kid with a business management degree if you want the real answers. \n\nIf you don't want to do a start up, PM me, I'd like to know more about technologies you work with.

{"body": "If you're looking for a shorty, pithy answer, skip to the bottom. \n\nWe're being driven into this place of anger by politicians who don't have anything better to offer. Without solutions, they use blame and code words to suggest to you that everything wrong in your life is the fault of someone else, all in the hope that you overlook their own failures and elect them just one more time. \n\nThe there's the media. Personally, I'm right of center and have never voted the democratic ticket in my life and even I can't stand listening to the talking heads on Fox. I'm not big on MSNBC either, but I've found that as insufferable as they can be, they aren't quite as flexible with the truth as are Fox and Limbaugh and Beck. I mostly listen to CNN just so I don't have to endure the constant baiting and button pushing. \n\nThese \"news outlets\" and talking heads have, by and large, given up on honesty and journalistic integrity in favor of the ratings they get by having an agenda that incites anger through misrepresentation if not outright lying (Bengazi anyone?). When was the last time you got a dose of news that didn't include some snarky commentary designed to piss you off at someone? \n\nTo add insult to injury, we've been lied to for years by everyone we're supposed to trust - our government agencies (NSA scandal), our law enforcement (Operation Fast and Furious), our news agencies and our financial institutions - **and there's never any real accountability.** \n\nTalk to anyone on the street and you'll hear the same refrain. Consequences only apply if you're not important enough or connected enough or rich enough to get away with it. \n\nHow many bankers have paid for mishandling our financial crisis? Too big to fail apparently also meant too big to prosecute. \n\nAnd how many people think Haliburton or BP will be responsible enough to pay for the full restoration or clean up of the gulf?\n\nOn the other hand, the average American doesn't get a pass for screwups or mistakes. Instead, every institution we deal with today is designed to nickel and dime you to death for the benefit of someone higher up. (Airlines charge for bags and toilets, banks charge have eliminated free checking, and every time you turn around, the banks are adding another fee or penalty for something that's never really explained without reading fine print that requires an MBA to understand.) \n\nThe worst part is that we've been chewed up and ground down, lied to and abused so much, we've started looked for scapegoats and reasons to release our pent up anger. Our common sense and rational selves disappear in a flash the moment any of our internal buttons are pushed. It's gotten to the point where we've been conditioned to violent disagreement rather than rational discourse. Try reading the comments section of anything anymore. News articles, sports stories, just about anything that invites opinion always turns into people pushing other people's buttons just to see if they can get a rise out of someone. So, \"thanks, Obama,...\" \n\n**TL/DR: We're the animal inside the tiny zoo cage, poked and prodded, lied to and abused. We're ground down by fees and penalties, beaten up by our protectors and lied to by the people we're supposed to trust while at the same time, no one \"higher up\" is made to pay any real consequences for wrongdoing. To add insult to injury, social media itself is mostly designed to push our buttons.

{"body": "I didn’t want to bring up some painful memories for OP but since you started it here it goes.\n\n\n\"So growing up I had almost zero structure.  My dad was always away on business and we never really connected since he was gone all the time and I don’t even want to talk about my mom. I mean it is just me and my sister, us against the world.  I did my best for us, but I was a bitter love/attention depraved kid, no one ever taught me how to be a man and I made a lot of bad choices because of it.  So I'm about the graduate and my dad sends me and my sister to live on the other side on the country with my Aunt Tammy.\n\nAunt Tammy was pretty ok, but it's obvious that she likes my sister better than me. Sure I got into pot and alcohol but as an 18 year-old high school senior, does that make me evil!?  And what kid without an involved parent figure doesn't get into some trouble now and then.  My sister (the perfect one) got good grades and did well in sports and everything I did was never good enough for Aunt Tammy. I tried out for band, but was not accepted as I was competing against people who had be encouraged and practiced their whole lives. I tried out for sports but I was never much of an athlete (hey, you never have a dad to play catch with and you see how good at baseball you turn out to be), I went for drama but you don’t go far unless you're part of the Drama clique, so ultimately I failed at everything I tried BUT DAMMIT I TRIED, I tried my best and did I get a pat on the back?, did I get a \"hey you'll find that thing you're great at one day?\" when I came home devastated by another failure did I get a hug?  No, I got \"why can't you be more like your sister!\"\n\nDo you know what a lifetime of always being compared to sibling that you can never compete with does to a person? Do you know what failure after failure does to an 18 year old? I became super bitter and the only way I could get any attention was by acting out.\n\nSo I meet this guy named Steve.  Steve was the first person I've met in a long time who didn't judge me, sure he lacked hygiene, morals, and a filter but he accepted me for who I was and wasn't always looking down on me.  Aunt Tammy forbade Steve to come over which made me even more resentful towards my family.  I mean the one person in my life who doesn't make me feel like I'm worthless and my Aunt says he's not allowed to visit me.  Looking back I know she didn't mean it, but when I was 18 it felt like she was just trying to hurt me.   So at this point I'm just like F#$@-it, no one loves me, I've been told all my life I'm a failure and will never do anything with my life that’s worthwhile so I just accept it.  I get hard into partying and to punish my Aunt for never loving me they way I should have been, (and I know I was in the wrong here, but again, I was mad and 18) I steal some of her stuff and pawn it for drug money.\n\nI get caught (like I planned) and get the attention I've been craving.  My dad flips out we talk like people for the first time in years, not just \"hi how's it going?\" and non-conversation stuff like that but he can't ignore me now and he has to deal with me man-to-man.   \n \nSo I end up getting kicked out (big shocker I know) drop out of school and go 100% into a party lifestyle.  Desperate for some money and food I try get into Aunt Tammy's house for some grub and hit my sister up for some cash.  I mean, I am no-kidding starving for the first time in my life and my perfect sister won't even give me some cash to buy some food!  And how does my perfect brilliant amazing sister act? Does she see how poor and wrenched her brother has turned out and at least try to reach out to me and buy me some food?  Does she tell Aunt Tammy or Dad \"hey we need try at least one more time to save my brother! He needs counseling and a 12 step program I don’t know but we just can't give up on him!\"   No! She ignores me and gets Steve suspended from school for some crap that she should have talked to me about first. (cause people in HS never are mean to each-other! Steve deserves to be expelled for saying something hurtful) Yea, I know Steve went too far but he was doing it because he knew and mad I was at her. (Once again, we're 18/19 and mad and never had much parental involvement in our lives. We did wrong but would you have been any better in our situations?)  I could have told him to stop it if I had known he was harassing her.  I mean she got my Aunt to say she going to go media and say the school sheltered sexual-harassers if the school didn't expel Steve.  My little sis, the one I used to hold when she was a kid and rock her to sleep, the one I used to protect from bullies, the only person I really ever cared about... Now she's just sitting there with a big sh$#%-eating \"I told you so\" grin on her face as Steve gets expelled and his life and college dreams are over. \n\nSo Steve and I ended up leaving town just to try to start over and get our lives on track.  Dad ended up getting remarried and really not talking to me anymore, (his new wife was a real piece of work anyways so I didn't mind)\n\nOne day, I heard Aunt Tammy had passed away, I know we never saw eye-to-eye but I did really like her and now a few years older and wiser I could see that she didn't really want to hurt me but felt she could never save me and better to give all her attention to my sis.  What I was really mad about was no told me she had passed!  Later I would find out it was because \"no one could reach me\" yea, I bet if I had won 100 million dollars or my sis needed a kidney, someone damn sure would have found me.  I think the real reason was that they thought I would try to ruin the funeral!  (Keep in mind to this point in my life I have ruined exactly zero funerals)  my god, it's like me taking someone to the bank and telling them wait in the car because I'm  afraid they would rob it. How would you feel if this happened to you?\n\nSo my sis gets the house and a little spending money.  After a few years of working various jobs around the country Steve ends up getting diagnosed with cancer.  He really can't pay for treatments (thanks Obama) but we work and scrape everything we got to get some treatment drugs for him and we decide to head back to his hometown so he can say his goodbyes.   I stop by to see my sister and she's not home.  Being family, I try to use my old key to get in and eat some grub while she's out (we are still family after all) I mean if I was going to rob her I would have busted in a window, not given up after the key didn’t fit.  I came by a few times after that (once I knew she was home) and turns out she had been hiding from me. CAN YOU F-ING BELIEVE IT!  My sis treating me like I'm a criminal cause I did some pot in my life and had an awkward friend.\n\nI guess Steve had bumped into my sis while she was at work she told her co-workers to toss my dying friend out on the street.  He was a cancer-riddled man in his mid-20's, who just wanted to apologize for his bad choices in high school and my sister has a guy escort her to his car because she's afraid of a guy who was kind-of a jerk to her many years ago.   He told me later he just stood there and cried for an hour.\n\nWhile visiting some of Steve's relatives, we get a call from his doctor.. the drugs aren't working.. the cancer will be fatal.  I start crying for my best friend but Steve says.... no Jim... one last party just like the old times...\n\nSo we get hear from another guy about girl we kinda knew from high-school named Veronica was having a wedding party.  We decide to go but not tell anyone about Steve so not to ruin Veronica's day.  Veronica answers the door and gets all snotty like she's better than us since her new husband makes a ton of money.  Steve wants to go, but I'm like \"no buddy, one last time...\" It was pretty fun, beer, drinking games, pizza.. it was just like old times, but who should I see there, my sister and she is messed up drunk.  I ignore her since my mind focused on Steve but Veronica keeps bitching and bitching and finally her husband has enough of it and asks me to leave so his new wife will shut up. To this point, I had thought I could come home a man now, that years of maturity and a hardlife would warrant another chance or at least some forgiveness but sitting on the back porch.. it all came rushing back to me, the wind almost speaking to me though the tress reminding me of all my mistakes in life and how the only person who really cared about me is going to die and and.. the only thing I could do was cry...\n\nI later found out Steve approached my sister again to ask her forgiveness before the end, but she was so drunk and on the defensive that she got in the fight with him over some stupid joke he made to some random dude about her being is girlfriend.  (yea he's a nice guy but no filter)\n   \nSteve lights up some (not legal) medical marijuana (outside on the porch) as it's the only real pain medication that still works on him and some pregnant bitch from INSIDE THE HOUSE (yes, you read that right) gets upset that the smoke is bad for her baby.  Some guy goes out and tried to impress his girl by pushing Steve over the porch railing.\n\nMy sister calls cops on us and has us arrested, later I would hear my sister had said that us being in jail was the \"best time of her life.\"   We leave town after that.  I try hitting up every family member I can for cash to find other cancer cures outside U.S. medicine for Steve. (long shot I know but I would do anything save my friend)\n\nSo thanks to my sister, now we have arrest records (good luck finding work!) My sis gets married and moves to New York, Steve and I think hey, we could stay in my Aunt's old house while she's gone.  (I know, but then again whose fault is it we can't find work) \n\nWe stay in the attic living off of soda bottle returns and begging,  Steve is not doing well, I go out beg so I can buy him some food.  I get back to the house and I see Steve being led away by police for trespassing.  I turn and run... it was the last time I saw him alive.  Later I would find out he was making a scrap book of me and my sister from our days as kids...the only time I was ever happy in life.\"\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386713762", "subreddit": "LetsNotMeet", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

My most recent kick, I started in a community college after being laid off from a high-stress fast-paced low- paying job that was particularly well-suited to my then- undiagnosed ADD. \n\nI'm now both a senior overall and a Junior -by program- in Chemical Engineering at a highly-ranked and selective technical school. I was diagnosed with ADD recently. It is possible to function without my meds and I made it this far without via various coping mechanisms. But I'm on the 6- year bachelor program, and it takes me 2-3x as long to complete my assignments as my peers, and I don't do so well on exams. \n\nWith my meds, I function about on par with the average at my school, +/- depending on various externalities, but always within one standard deviation of the mean. \n\nThat's a big improvement. I still have my coping mechanisms in place, which you, at a similar age, have likely developed, and they still help. But **medical treatment has changed my life for the better.** even outside of academic performance, I don't have as many half- finished projects around the house, I'm a better and more focused father, husband, person in general. \n\nI'm uncomfortable with the idea of taking stimulants for the rest of my life, but for now they're far more helpful than they are harmful. \n\nGet insurance-- it's the law now anyway (thanks Obama!) Go see a doctor. Talk to them about what you're experiencing. They, like us reADDitors, want to help. Don't self-diagnose, it could be something else. A lot of ADD symptoms are common to other disorders, and a lot of disorders are comorbid to ADD. I myself have general anxiety comorbid to ADD. \n\nGood luck, wish you the best.

{"body": "This was originally a Tumblr post. Tumblr is home to a number of radical feminists, people who spout nothing but hatred such as blaming men (\"the Patriarchy\") for everything that goes wrong. There were some posts a while back explaining why these radical feminists needed feminism, and many of them were just blaming things on men that had nothing to do with them at all. Think the \"Thanks Obama\" meme, but replace \"Obama\" with \"Men\" and add way more hatred.\n\nTumblr's radical feminists are well-known for their quite frankly enraging posts such as [this one, teaching us the true definition of rape](http://misandrymolly.tumblr.com/post/67474898113/so-just-to-be-clear-if-a-male-rapes-a-female-but), or [this one, about how the Patriarachy invented PIV sex about 6000 years ago after watching their farm animals do it](http://askaradfem.tumblr.com/post/69739237103/how-do-you-feel-about-the-relation-of-evolution-and-piv). This post is missing some context here on Reddit and seems a bit confusing, but it fits in perfectly on Tumblr.\n\nAnd if those posts made you want to curl up and weep for humanity, you can find them and many, many more at /r/TumblrInAction!\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I have no problem with actual feminists. Y'know, the people who believe in equal rights for men and women. On Tumblr, \"Feminist\" automatically means \"Radical Feminist\", which helps to clear up some confusion about the post.

{"body": "You seem to be missing my post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1sv51l/chinese_spacecraft_successfully_lands_on_the_moon/ce1kwmg?context=3) which says that \"we\" means nothing of the sort to \"America\", but in fact means \"the greater space exploration community\" (cool assumptions, bro). We've done numerous experiments in space, taken numerous soil samples from the moon, etc. and the greater scientific community determined that the impact of knowledge of the moon was of little importance compared to the exploration of other planetary bodies. Seriously read your egregious copy/pasting and actually see how little these experiments that they propose actually benefit humanity compared to the existed soil experiments *we've already done*. \n\nYour point that \"every scientific step is a step for humanity\" is so fucking pedantic. Yes, every time someone acquires *any* additional knowledge it contributes to the greater knowledge of the human race, but we fucking weigh these things to their relevance. Does every Ph.D thesis warrant saying \"BEHOLD, A STEP TAKEN FOR HUMANITY, ALL HAIL &lt;Student 11,534&gt; THIS YEAR THAT HAS COMPLETED THEIR PH.D\"? No.\n\nMy entire point is that we reserve statements such as \"a step taken in humanity\" for monumental progress and **pioneered** ventures such as flight, space travel, the invention of penicillin, wireless transmission, etc. The Wright Brothers created the first human flight with a bi-wing airplane...would you really tell me that if a country in modern times made *new discoveries* in the technology of bi-wing airplanes that you would defend their every right to say that they have made \"a step forward in the good of humanity\" simply because they provided ***some*** amount of increased knowledge into something that...the majority of the world has abandoned as irrelevant?\n\nI made my original post because I was insulted by the notion that:\n\n1. a country treading old ground in science/technology is somehow a venture worthy of *shaming* an existing space program that *didn't* make this pursuit (y'know, because it was **scientifically determined irrelevance**)\n\nbut moreso \n\n2. the fact that someone would have to be **racist** to not care about this particular development. \n\nThat is the fucking problem here. The fact that someone decided that anyone who doesn't want to throw around the phrase \"step forward for humanity\" in regards to 40 year old technology is somehow a fucking **racist**? How about people who are well enough informed to know that there was a reason moon research was abandon in the pursuit of other ventures? Or the people who can see that while this program has *worth* and is certainly provided increased knowledge to us, that doesn't make it a fucking erection-inducing human triumph to the point that we somehow have to shame existing space programs because \"oh no, despite the fact that we're on **fucking Mars** now, it's such a shame that we haven't been on the moon in 30 years!! wow, THANKS OBAMA!\"\n\nHow about the fact that maybe we haven't been on the Moon in so long is because it doesn't fuck matter, and there are hundreds of scientists and engineers for the past few decades who haven't had the slightest inclination to go back there because they were busy thinking about Mars and Europa? But no, all about the Top Post train which cries crocodile tears about the fact that NASA doesn't go to the moon when China does...maybe because NASA is fucking busy with establishing research to put a human colony on another fucking planet.\n\nThis technological development is a wonderful triumph to the **Chinese people**. It is a great step forward for **China**. But it is not a god damn breakthrough, oscar-worthy, screeplay-currently-being-written, fucking \"step forward for humanity\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387046435", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

Coming from a family that was well off but always broke, this confused me for ages, until i traded. You lock up your money in investments and loss aversion and the fact that it is your income maker and the less of it the less income you get, encourages you to not cash out. you actually are somewhat encourages to reinvest any profits you might make. Combined with teh cost of living where you live, you can actually be very wealthy but feel strapped for money. You'll have a maid and gardeners and a pool guy and all that, but you set up your system to cash out just enough money to cover your major bills and a little bit extra.. and you can find yourself without cash when you go out to get something and feel like you are broke. it is more of a condition than a reality  But understanding that, you can understand where they are coming from when they say insane things, like how poor they are on 200k a year and shit.

{"body": "Heh, I didn't downvote you, for what it's worth; you're as relevant as the next joke...\n\nAs for Ms Coulter's AMA&lt; she couldn't log in b/c the password given her by an Aide was inaccurate, or she forgot it, or something; so in her twitter, she was all \"Can't log on to Reddit, thanks Obamacare\", and then went on to say how she was sticking to her religion and guns, essentially \"there's no way to change my mind on anything, I've closed it off to the possibility I could ever make a mistake\", but thrust-in-your-face-rude style, as is her method.\n\nThe issue comes with how the phrase was used to undermine Obama's platform; it's a consistent effort to take things out of context and spin things negatively - \"Obamacare\" is the Affordable Care Act, we don't call the Patriot Act \"Bush Defense\", ya know? As well, The ACA was essentially the private plan Mitt Romney implemented in Massachusetts, and wasn't what the Dems wanted, but was their *compromise*.\n\nI take it you meant this in a softer light than I took it, mainly in that I don't think you intended it the way it comes across, much like if a southerner wants to fly the Dixie flag, since it doesn't mean \"racism\" to them they assume it's not a symbol which at one point *did* mean those flying it were tolerant of racism and slavery (not every Confederate wanted slaves, the argument *was* about Fed v State rights); \n\nthe problem for me is that what Obama was trying to say is that you can't take 100% credit for a successful business, like no one else participated - you had employees most likely, federal and state roads, utilities provided by companies also regulated by the gov, and so on. He flubbed his context, and the quote was taken *way* off the charts and *just* that sentence was repeated over and over, not the whole part in which he explained *what he meant*.\n\nSo when it's brought up, along with the \"thanks Obamacare\", all I see is the equivalent of government brainwashing, in a non-conspiracy sense; think 1984, getting people to accept the hate speech; if we'd even *imagined* talking about Bush's policies this way, the right would be up in arms about \"why don't you just go along with you commander in chief, how dare you disagree\", but then when they don't like the policy, it's all playground name-calling and De-contextualization of legitimate points. \n\nI'm not saying the Dems are better, because they're not, but it irks me to no end to see the phrase \"You didn't build that\", because the *context* of his speech added the word \"alone\" to the end of the phrase, but since he didn't say it outright, the phrase has become a bit of a witch-hunt style tag-line, much like the phrase \"thanks obamacare\", when for the most part it both had nothing to do with whatever they're complaining about, nor is it even Obama's idea, it's just the only thing the Reps would let through.\n\nI hope that explains my point;\n\n*TL;DR* - it's not that *you* are ignorant or divisive, but that the phrase itself was *designed to be that way*.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387250108", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

The statement wasn't flaky - its presentation to the world was disingenuous; he *said* that he meant the roads and utilities and customers and employees which helped you get to that point, but everyone skips that part.\n\n\nAs well, what happened to the whole \"Stand by the president, no matter what, he's the Commander-in-Chief and we're at war\" that was *so* prevalent for the last years of the Bush era, then all of a sudden this mental hoop-jumping of lack of context?\n\nEven calling it Obamacare is wrong, it's the brainchild of Mitt Romney and the Mass Reps, and was the only compromise the Dems could get between their idea for Social Gov Healthcare (which would drive costs down and quality of care up, like in every other country that does it), and the Reps desire for a solely \"free market\" solution in a non-free regulated market.

{"body": "See, the thing is that there's *legitimate* criticism of him, on many counts, but this nonsense both drowns it out, as well as prevents reasonable discussion about the questionable abuse of power he and the military have taken with drones, for instance. I didn't vote for him because of anything I feel the need to justify - McCain is senile with a wildly pro-military industrial bent, and Mitt Romney is a walking businessman who was the best of the worst, really the only one whose gaffs were just laughable, not sensationalist or scandals. There were far more qualified and respectable Republicans out there, but they wouldn't run due to internal party divisions (largely but not solely Tea Party) and a lack of financial backing (which, needing xx amount of money to run is absurd, and destroys the basic concept of democratic election); Obama wasn't a good choice, but there's something that I have a big problem with -\n\nHe's never been given a *chance* to do things \"his\" way, nor has he been reigned in on the \"questionable\" things he's done; he's been stopped at *almost* every turn with an opposition that staunchly refuses to negotiate then goes into full double-speak with claims that the Dems/Obama won't negotiate (and no, I'm not talking about the \"debt\" issue, this is a hard party line of the Tea Party). It's the definition of double-speak to say that someone's doing a poor job when you won't *let* them do anything.\n\nMy *entire* issue is with people making up *fictional* arguments/criticisms of things that didn't happen (for instance, Obama certainly did not try to say that business owners didn't build their businesses), taking attention away from the real issues (abuse of power, concerns over economy and how healthcare will affect individuals), and skewing the reality of it *both* ways - I have as much criticism for liberal dems as I do for conservative Reps. There's tons of rhetoric on both sides, but the Reps tend to ditch off the path into doublespeak, and that bothers me.\n\nIf the memes are not an argument ad hominem, what are they? What part of legitimate criticism involves \"Thanks, Obama\" when it's Bush that tanked the economy in the first place? What room does harping on him not explaining himself fully in a soundbite-snippet of a full speech, taking it completely out of context and creating a national sensation from it, allow us to ever criticize him for a *legitimate* failure?\n\nTo me, it's become like the kid who cried wolf. We can't effectively criticize this president due to all the false arguments lobbied (now that we're allowed to, which we weren't during Bush's administration in the post 9/11 fervor).\n\nIf that doesn't make sense to you, then I apologize, and will try again.

{"body": "Wow. You are amazing to have that level of clarity. I only recently got that far (36, if you remember me from other convos we might have had) \n\nFirst off - you are doing what I wish I would have done (if I had had my crap together, major kudos to you for that). \n\nUniversities are super open to such things - and it would help you establish your new identity in a fairly welcoming place. (No place is perfect but...)\n\nMake sure your insurance covers what you are going after somehow. Look through the \"Exclusions\" etc... gender anything is very often disallowed... make sure your end goal is possible first! \n\nIt's really easy to try to \"predict\" what people think due to their reactions to things... but sometimes, they might not have been even paying attention to the thing that you were, and as a result we make guesses as to all that. It's hardly exact science. Not saying this is a bad thing for you per se -- it's just that you assume that they \"Get\" all the stuff you get. Maybe they do but that's a lot to assume. \n\nWhen I was a little kid, I remember hearing all sorts of comments like \"people are going to think you are gay if you do X and Y\" like lay my arm over a friends shoulders as a friendly thing, etc. People are people, and we are so tied into all these perceptions that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar (Freud reference, if you don't know him...) \n\nFor instance, I remember the first time that my dad saw an EARLY show on a trans person and he had a negative reaction (I was a teenager). But the info has gotten a lot better and the coverage has improved. \n\nHell, she might be happier with you being female than gay - families are weird things as to what upsets them. There's really no way to predict. Of course, maybe she is okay with it. Maybe she's waiting for something like that to happen with you! Good moms are super perceptive. (Mine will probably be a wreck when I finally drop the news... but that's more because I think she has anxiety she doesn't really want to address in general and any change she can't \"control\" is hard.) I've worked on mine - I know where it came from now, at least. \n\nAre you using family money to go to college, or is it scholarships etc? The uni might be able to help you out with something if that becomes a problem. \n\nIf you can stay in school without that money - uni's often have very inclusive student health plans you can connect with. Yes, probably some $$ - but... it's worth it. \n\nThe telling is a highly personal time. Years ago I sort of came out to my mom, and I botched it hard. I was a mealy mouth pile of blah. I got a hug and a \"I'm sorry you feel this way\" kind of statement. But I know that I was a huge mess, didn't have it together, etc, etc. It's not really anything we talk about right now anymore and I think she's forgotten. \n\nI understand the urge, the need. I wrestle with it right now daily. in Jan I have an appointment (thanks Obamacare!) to look into a gastric surgery which has a six month wait, and people around me are giving me some flak about it (all too common for thin people to say to fat people, like \"if you only did X and Y you wouldn't need this\") but it's just not that simple. Nevertheless, I'm just gonna go through this (I've known a lot of other people who have had it and I've always wanted it but been able to access until now) and those who doubt will learn why I make the choice. \n\nSo, for me, that will be the \"dry run\". I'll change once, then, I'll change again, and it's going to be at least a two year process, probably. I want it to just start NOW... but a lot has to happen first. \n\nBut, whatever you do when you come out do it right, and really, truly, be ready for what comes of it, good or bad. Otherwise it will throw you off track if it's not what you expect. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387482442", "subreddit": "MtF", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Your article there does not dismiss the cost-savings of preventative medicine. It actually shows that there is a lot of savings in preventative medicine, but it shows that prevention is not always the best solution.\n\nIt uses a metric of Proportion of Published Cost-Effectiveness ratios as a y-axis. This in itself is only indicative of the time at which the study was done. That time was the beginning of 2008. Since 2008 we have seen the publishing of the hospital checklists, which have reduced malpractice and unnecessary mistakes significantly. Since then, hospitals now use barcode patient identification with computer verification of medication administration. This has saved countless lives as medicine accidents have been significantly reduced. We are also now starting to see community based prevention systems based in risk management. This is being made possible by the Meaningful Use incentives (thanks Obama) combined with the greater medical access due to the ACA.\n\nThe highlight of the article is that prevention is greatest in savings when risk factors are determined. Using computational tools only available in the last 2-3 years, hospitals have been able to reduce rehospitalization, reduce sepsis, reduce in-hospital injuries, and even reduce death due to heart disease. They do this all by calculating patient risk and then taking action to reduce risk.\n\nThe other thing that the ACA has done to assist in the cost-management of healthcare is that Medicare/Medicaid pays for treatment of a diagnosis rather than for procedures. In the past, a doctor would order 50 tests, to make sure that you don't have an aneurysm or heart problem even if you are at low risk. Now, a hospital can only order these tests if you are at a high enough risk, because the government won't pay for the procedure if it doesn't treat the problem. Now, hospitals also must make sure that patients don't get more sick in the hospital because a hospital acquired infection must be treated for free by the hospital if the patient is on Medicare/Medicaid. This has all resulted in better care quality, believe it or not, and cheaper costs. The doctors and the executives aren't too pleased, but it's hard to switch from the lazy and bloated healthcare system of the past to the new system based in efficiency and improved outcomes.\n\nThe provision where hospitals must release there price book was not passed. It has gotten held up in legislation. It was one of the things fought against the hardest.\n\nThe problem you seem to have with the ACA is that it had to restrategize many times in order to get the public on board with something that was for their own benefit. The public is swayed so easily by fear-mongering against change that the media can convince people that the terrible HMOs of the past were better than today. It was shown that hospital outcomes were getting worse as the costs were increasing. Today, we are seeing the outcomes get significantly better, and although the costs are increasing, they are starting to level out. I would say that that is a success, regardless of how it was sold. We will have to see what the future holds.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387929020", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have not had a 'gaming' capable computer since 2008, when I was in an accident and was in the hospital for a week or two (I say it was a week, but everybody claims I was in for 2 weeks...lies!) When I got home somebody had spilled soda on my desktop! I was able to clean it and it worked but would crash occasionally. Over the next year the board just wouldn't post till it finally died. I had no income for the year after my wreck due to being homebound (unable to leave the bed but for short periods for physical therapy or rest room) finally I was able to sit in a chair. At this point my desktop was useless. Since then, I did not have the spare cash or the time to really play any games. I was given an Xbox 360 by a friend, and the PS3 was broken and I fixed it. I hate consoles though!\n\nThen about 6 months ago I was at the flea market and I saw a motherboard, it was an AM3+ BNIB for $10, I kid you not! I bought it! Then later I bought a Power Supply, and then a CPU off craigslist, then ram off craigslist! Then I sold my PS3 and Xbox and got a Case, and graphics card! Then I sold the ram I got off craigslist and got better ram! I then used an old laptop hard drive I had lying around to finish my computer. Takes me 10 minutes to play BF4, but I can play on near Ultra! Woohoo! I got BF4 on Black Friday for $25, so good deals all around!\n\nI have no headset, nor do I have the cash to get one. I have less than $350 in my computer, including games, and it took me 6 months and some seriously good deals to get it. I am trying to sell an RC car I have spent even longer building, but that is a niche market and I am going to buy my Girlfriend a Wii U with it as it isn't fair for me to have a nice computer and her have nothing. So I can't use that on myself and not feel really guilty about it.\n\nI broke my ankle in three places in my wreck, broke my fibula, and shattered my hip, so I have 6lbs of titanium in my hip and I can't run, heck I cant walk well, can't stand for long, and my ankle turns out now. I am trying to start my own business since I can not really live up to the physical demand of most companies, and even more companies than you would think are biased, and feel I am a legal threat and won't hire me.\n\nI am currently living with my in-laws to save on bills while the business grows, even though slowly, so I can afford the car insurance, gas, phone bills, and internet. All of which are greatly important. I also use my desktop in my business - so luckily it was worth it to build the computer for something other than just games.\n\nIf I were to get the headset I would make sure that the next time I had a good hand in life, and got something extra I would pass it on to the next person that deserves it. As well as pay it back to you for your kindness in this world. Not enough people are selfless enough these days!\n\nNeedless to say, I need surgury, can't afford it. I owe the Medial University of South Carolina $120,000 in medical fees (did I mention I was 300 miles from home when I wrecked, and lost my apartment due to not having a job and needed to move back in with my father).

{"body": "I am saying, people love money more than they hate minorities.\n\n\nLet me explain this to you, since people are too stupid to comprehend my brilliance of their own right:\n\n\nA) People love money.\nB) People (at best) don't care about minorities. They find 1st generation immigrants weird. From a political perspective, they also think, \"If they hadn't fucked up their own country so much, they wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\nNow, I'm sure you noticed that the Democrat party somehow became the \"minority party.\" Latin Americans and African Americans are both like \"Yeahhh! Fuck the rich white guy party, we 'deserve' healthcare! Our shitty countries that we left to come here has it, so we should too!\"\n\n\nNow, I'm pretty sure we can all agree that both political parties are full of shit now and neither one of them are worth what we pay them. So arguing which is the \"best\" is pointless. They're both BLEHHH and neither actually do what they promise, and when they do, they do an absolutely shitty, money-wasting job of it (Obama care, for example).\n\n\nSo here's reality:\n\nBoth parties are fucking you over. YOU will never get any money just because either one is in party. YOU will not get any real benefit. YOU are fucked by them, every chance they get.\n\n\nSo since your vote, for either party, is useless, it comes down to imagine.\n\n\nNow, let's look at the parties from each persons' perspective:\n\n\nMajority view of the Republican party: \"We need to keep what we got, more status quo! The country is great, don't let the democrats fuck it up! Just leave it alone!\"\n\n\nMajority view of the Democratic party: \"God damn freeloader party! Trying to take control away! Also just so happens to be the minority party...the minorities who fucked up their own country so much that they figured they'd come here and fuck it up too. They're so stupid that they are voting for the party that was historically PRO-SLAVERY. We're going to have idiots voting themselves and us into slavery!\"\n\n\nMinority view of the Republican party: \"They're making us wage-slaves! We came here to be free, not to be poor forever! We didn't come here to line some rich white guy's pockets with money! We want to make our own money!\"\n\n\nMajority view of the Democratic party: \"Finally a way to force those rich white majority members to loosen their pockets for the middle-class and let us run a good business! And what is this? They are promising affordable healthcare for everyone?! Yes!! I will be able to provide for my family and finally acquire the American dream!\"\n\n\n\nREALITY: Republicans fuck over smaller business owners because lobbyists for the big companies create unrealistic regulation for smaller companies. Democrats create affordable healthcare laws....that increase the cost of healthcare and drive profitability of smaller businesses down.\n\n\nBOTH PARTIES SUCK. Everyone knows and talks about this. \n\n\nSo making your political party of choice known is about projecting an IMAGE. So, which image do YOU think, as a minority, would make you more popular?\n\n\n\"Keep the country the same! Let business grow!\" - crap Republicans spout.\n\n\n\"Regulation needs to be put into place to give 'the little guy' advantages, too!\" - crap Democrats spout.\n\n\nAlright now, mind you, minorities are called minorities because there aren't as many of them. NO DUH. BUT, I hear a LOT of this: \"Murrica was built off of the backs of minorities! We're the ones who bled and did all the work! NYEHHH!\" \n\n\nWhile that is partially true, they did work a lot, there are a ton of not-rich white people. GASP!!!!! OMFG THE REVELATIONS!!! \"Wait,\" you say after it sinks in, \"You're telling me that a majority OF THE MAJORITY also worked to create MURICA?!?! And that they LIKE IT HERE?! GASP!\" Yes. It's fucking true! The secret is out! BLAM! Sparklers! Bright lights! LASER SHOWS!  Yes. White people with minor (MINORity) assistance created America. White people blood and white people sweat. And I find it rather prejudice that people keep discounting that fact in favor of the more sensational, \"Woe is me! The pain! The minority suffering! We were FORCED to build America all by our lonesome selves, and now they are trying to STEAL any advantages we have\" view that seems to be floating around like some toxic cloud of idiocy.  That attitude is every bit as idiotic and harmful as the white people who blame minorities for all of their problems. \"We have a black president! America is doooooomed! Oh well, it was good while it lasted... Thanks, Obama.\"   Both people are idiots.\n\n\nMoral of the story: You're a pussy if you let either one of these group of idiots affect how you, as a person, live YOUR life. Listen to this bit of an interview ----&gt;[here](http://youtu.be/KENYncj1UZw?t=7m33s)&lt;----.  He makes more sense than all of the whining and bellyaching found around here.\n\n\nBut if you REALLY want to bitch out and \"be accepted,\" just pick the party that the loud, prejudice people associate with. To them it says, \"I love hard work. I love America. I love what the majority (white people) have built.\"  Again, it's not REALITY. Both parties are shit. White people ARE the numerical majority, though, and if you're bitching about feeling prejudice being held against you, just project an image they agree with. You're projecting an image already, even if you don't want to. And to the loud, prejudice people, the Democratic party threatens their self-image. Protecting their own self-image is more important than damaging yours; and again, they can't hate you if you embody everything they CLAIM to love. If so, they'll hate themselves and people will call THEM hypocrites, and no one will do that to themselves.\n\n\nTL;DR \n\nPeople are too stupid to understand my brilliance.\n\n1) Find out what enemy values, specifically what affects their feelings of safety and self-esteem. An easy one is political affiliation; it is almost universal. That's why I said it. Plus the loudest and most prejudiced people identify with the Republican party, not because they necessarily care about either party (both are shit), but because the Democratic part is seen as the \"minority party.\"  Prejudiced people don't like minorities. You're an idiot if you can't figure out that they would flock to the party with the fewest minorities.\n\n2) Project that image on yourself.\n\n3) You will become more successful and experience less prejudice. It works because of human nature; they cannot dislike you if you embody what they enjoy and what makes them feel safe. They will feel like (and publicly be called) hypocrites. Avoidance behavior (avoiding unpleasant feelings) will lead them to accepting you out of necessity (to ease the unpleasant feeling of being a hypocrite).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388390117", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
