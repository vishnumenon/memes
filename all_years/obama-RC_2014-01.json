{"body": "I would say that as far a conservative, it's a little more like the \"Thanks, Obama\". I have a couple of gay friends, and black friends, and for the most part people are very accepting. There is always the occasional asshole, but that's really anywhere.  Ashland is going to be a lot more like living in Portland, very liberal. I have lived in Southern Oregon for the better part of my life now, and I can honestly say I enjoy it. The Pacific Northwest is very pretty. I travel a great deal for work, and I have discovered that although this area is occasionally boring, it's really a beautiful place to live. As far as places to eat, the local fair is a little better in Ashland, but nothing to write home about. You'll find most of the large chain restaurants here. I don't personally rock climb, but I understand that there are a couple of places with a wall, likely Ashland again. The cost of living in Southern Oregon is fairly inexpensive,  Even in a nicer area of town you will find that a studio apartment is going to be in the sub $550 range. I personally would avoid West Medford, there are parts of West Medford that can be nice, but they are further out of town. I know a few people that live closer to the Costco side of town, up off of Coker Butte and they have 2 bedroom townhouses that are less then $650 per month. As for ISP choices, your going to be disappointed. There are basically 2 options currently, you can get DSL from Century Link, or Cable internet from Charter. It depends on were you ultimately settle. I can only really recommend Charter for internet, the quality of service is typically pretty good, and they offer a 30mbps burst for about $30-35 per month. You could get up to 100mbps if you live in the right area and can afford it. Charter's billing and customer service leaves a little to be desired, but it's actually better then some cable providers. PLease feel free to let me know if you have any other questions. I would be happy to give you my honest opinion.

I have a problem with people spreading information as it if were official or verified.  \"R* introduced\"\n\nIs is possible he can't sell his car? \nYes\n\n1.  A duped car won't sell, it will also \"disappear\" when blown up, like his did shortly after posting this.\n\n2. Purchased pre 1.08 cars won't sell.\n\n3. Neither, and he should be able to sell it and can't.\n\nI am not saying his account is wrong, or that he IS messing something up, but a post of \"Hey guys anyone else having this\" would go much much further for the progression of the discussion.\n\nWhy is that?  Other people would have put in their confirmation of one side or another, and we might have figured out why it happened or track it down further.  \n\nInstead, it turns into a division of:\n\n1. Fuck R* (different in volume, and capital letters)\n\n2. Uh, nope you are wrong.\n\nThen he has to defend himself, and might even leave out details in the event that he fucked up (like it was a dupe, etc).  Again I am NOT saying he is doing this, but discussion of this nature often turn into that.\n\nNothing is accomplished that is beneficial.  People take the information that someone put up and echo it out and spread it across others, wrong or unconfirmed information but speak it like they witnessed it.  It doesn't take the majority or even half the people to do that.  1% can turn into hundreds, and thousands of people real fast.\n\nTL;DR  I don't have a problem with people sharing, but introducing satire is ridiculous.

You know who is entirely capable of finding those communications? Obama. He could if he wanted to.\n\nThanks, Obama!\n\n*edit:* Let me explain. Law enforcement agencies with both technical competence and technical resources have heavy caseloads. Organized crime groups, drugs networks, human traffickers, child pornographers, modern bank robbers (sophisticated ATM &amp; finance system thieves,) and of course the huge and ever-expanding category of \"terrorist\" organizations, etc. A bunch of kiddies who use [known botnets](http://www.spamfighter.com/News-18745-Mastermind-of-Notorious-Mariposa-Botnet-Jailed-in-Slovenia.htm) to execute DDOS attacks on game servers don't present the same kinds of ongoing threats as the higher priority crimes. From an intelligence-gathering standpoint, it isn't necessarily desirable to shut down every known attack tool/method. When some crazy person decides to do something really, truly horrible, it's better if they choose already-analyzed methods of hiding their tracks, rather than being forced to seek out new, truly clever means. Given limited budgets and human resources, this approach becomes all the more attractive.\n\nEspecially in a domain where complexity increases monthly, it's much better to face an opponents with tools you already know something about. This might mean leaving things like low-sophistication botnets in place rather than dismantling them. There may be more to be gained by simply sitting and watching low-damage DDOS attacks than by retaliating, both for law enforcement agencies, and for organizations like tier 1 (and other) backbone providers.\n\nI doubt that this spate of DDOS nonsense cost Sony very much money.

{"body": "I'm only 28 so I've only really been cognizant of three Presidents in their entirety (as opposed to learning about them through documentaries, school, etc.).  I'm speaking of Clinton, Bush, and Obama - of course.\n\nI'm ashamed to admit I actually voted for W. Bush twice.  I was young, the internet was young, many of us didn't realize that Fox News was just a propaganda machine, and I bought the line of thinking that we needed to fight terrorists and \"stay the course\" so it wouldn't be a good decision to switch leadership mid-war.  The George W. Bush administration tricked me with fear.\n\nBy the time 2008 rolled around I was completely disillusioned with right wing politics and the republican party.  The wars proved to be based on horrible lies, you need only to watch The Daily Show to see how ridiculous Fox News is, the internet was coming into it's own and I was becoming informed enough to see that trickle-down economics simply doesn't work and that many other countries with more socialistic policies seemed to have better standards of living.  Plus, my understanding of history grew as I got older and more informed and I began to appreciate that all the *progress* that I value in American society came from left-wing *progressive* groups - mainly groups considered to be radical at their time such as the civil rights movement, labor movements, anti-war movements, feminist movements, etc.  When the fresh-faced, young, black, seemingly un-corrupted Obama campaign came around with the promise of \"Hope and Change\", I fell for the trick hook, line, and sinker.  The Obama administration tricked me with hope.\n\nIf I had to describe Obama as a president in one word it would be this: disappointing.\n\nDid he end the wars - no, not really.  We were *hoping* for the *change* to a more sensible foreign policy that doesn't include drone wars, torture, and I'm still a little pissed off that you tried to trick us into a war with Syria (thankfully other Americans are waking up, as I have).\n\nDid he improve healthcare - no, not really.  We were *hoping* for the *change* to a single-payer system.\n\nIs the economy better - no, not really.  We were *hoping* for the *change* to an economic system that values the middle class and lower classes.  Instead, the Federal Reserve is pumping $85 billion a month into the economy directly to big banks to be loaned to giant corporations, not a single person has gone to jail for the crimes committed that led to the financial collapse in 2008, another financial collapse seems likely, there are still far too many people who can't find work and there is virtually no help from the ruling elite to remedy this situation or look long-term at the future to deal with technology related unemployment.  Income and wealth inequality continue to get worse and worse while we debate abortion, gay marriage, and whether or not we should keep the federal government open for business at all.  Oh, and god forbid anyone talks about the TPP.  \n\nIs the environment better - no, not really.  No substantial effort to expand wind or solar energy, no effort to localize food production, no sense of alarm in the face of the biggest threat to our survival as a species in perhaps the history of human kind.  \n\nIs the crackdown on civil rights better - no, not really.  Occupy Wall Street and similar protests were systematically infiltrated and shut down, if the NSA had their way I'd have a homing device shoved up my ass tied to a personal drone that could watch my every single move, marijuana and other psychedelic drugs are still illegal and the massively racist drug war continues, and the entire Bill of Rights seems to be in the process of a systemic dismantling.\n\n\nThere is only one redeeming thing that the Obama administration has done for me, in my opinion: I am now completely disillusioned with left wing politics and the democratic party.  I now see the political shell game for exactly what it is - entertainment.  I'll never vote for a Republican *OR* a Democrat again, **ever**.  I don't know why it took me so long to realize this, but the system we live under is not a representative democracy, it is this:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism\n\nGoldman Sacs, Exxon Mobile, GE, Bank of America, and every other giant corporation contributes and lobbies *both* parties.  We have the illusion of 2 choices.  We have two puppets, and one guy holding them both - as the old Bill Hicks joke goes.  Our system of government is based solely on bribery under the 1984-eque NewSpeak-like terms \"campaign contributions\" and \"lobbying\".  These are just words, and they just mean bribery.  \n\nThe Obama administration has shown me that you can't trust either party - even if they promise hope and change and promote a charismatic young black guy from Hawaii.  It's all for show.  Money talks and bullshit walks, and all you need to do is look at where the campaign money comes from to know who the politician's loyalty belongs to.  The American people are disenfranchised and not represented.  We have a bought President, we have a bought Senate, we have a bought Congress.  This is why the mechanisms for incremental progressive reform are broken.  We need to vote outside the two-party system in an act of non-violent revolution now in order to prevent the burden of a violent revolution for future generations.  The Republicans aren't going to fix things, the Democrats aren't going to fix things, and Hillary Clinton sure as hell isn't going to fix things.   \n\nThe disappointment of the Obama administration has helped me to see this truth.

{"body": "One of my boyfriend's friends is like this. \n\nEx-marine who got discharged early (he says it was \"thanks, Obama\", but other sources say there were \"issues\" involved.) He lives off his checks from the government and uses them to buy *lots* of weed. Has no interest in getting a job. Recently he broke up with his fiancee (reasons unspecified.) I know she told him that she wanted him to either go to school or at least get a job, because she's in a master's degree program with good prospects and, frankly, *he's a loser.* He *can* be a nice guy, but honestly, he often gets so wrapped up in his entitled bullshit that he revers to selfish asshole. So mess guess is she dumped him because he said he wouldn't get a job. He went on a rant while he was over here last which included the following sample gems:\n\n- \"Nothing personal, but I think all women are hard-wired to snap. It's just a question of when. Like, if you have kids, it puts it off, but if you don't, then you go fucking crazy.\"\n\n- \"I hate women. What's the fucking point.\"\n\n- \"I think that's why sex feels good: it's the only reason men would tolerate being around women in the first place. We would have died out as a species otherwise.\"\n\n- \"It's not worth the grief: women are stupid. I'm going to wait for virtual reality wives to become a thing and just get me a programmed one; real women are too fucking worthless.\"\n\n- \"Feminism is woman's excuse to control and subvert men.\"\n\n- \"I like how women get mad if we hit on them, but they're the ones wearing skimpy clothes. Um, bitch, you're asking for it. If you don't want my attention, don't dress that way. It's unfair to put yourself out there like that and then get offended when you receive attention for it. Clearly you wanted the attention; otherwise you wouldn't wear it.\"\n\nHe said *all of this* in a one-on-one conversation with me. I had done absolutely nothing to trigger this; this was all freely offered, albeit under the whole \"no offense\" and \"it's nothing personal\" disclaimers.\n\nHonestly, at this point, we all just smile and nod like we do with some of our more hardcore conservative friends. Uh huh, sure, yep. *Oh, you're absolutely right, us women are just awful creatures. Yep. My only worth is for making you food and bringing you beer; how could I be so misguided? You're absolutely right.* I've learned that arguing with them only leads to more issues. So he sits there spitting off his sexist, entitled drivel, and we all smile and nod until he leaves. Once he does, there's a collective sigh of relief and there's usually a \"wow, really?\" conversation afterwards.\n\nWe laugh at his sexism. I could get offended by it, but honestly, it's not worth the effort. He's butthurt about women and has decided to take the low road; arguing with him will just feed him even more. Why should I waste my breath on someone that clearly doesn't want to listen? We could argue with him all day about how he's being a sexist pig, but that won't change his opinion. This is a person who isn't interested in being \"enlightened\", and attempting to do so will just backfire. So we just let him rant on and on until he realizes that he's the only one actually saying anything and awkwardly shuts up. If he starts saying crap that I just can't handle listening to, I excuse myself to the bathroom, try to change the subject (\"SO, ABOUT THEM YANKEES\" is my go-to line), or find some chore that jolts me out of the conversation. Usually once one person jumps out of the conversation, the rest will follow.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388696805", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "STORY TIME!\n\nI drive a tractor trailer for a living and I used to work for a company out of Wisconsin. I was up there one winter's night and wound up parking a short distance from where I had to drop in the morning, about 50 miles or so south, at a truck stop in Plover, WI.\n\nLike many trucks, mine had a little portable generator called an APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) that ran over night, kept the fluids in the truck running, kept the heat on, etc. It wasn't particularly cold this evening, about 20 or so, and I didn't have the heat up too high, so while I was asleep it reached the temperature I'd set it to, and it cut off to save fuel. Normal operation for it. It kicks back on when the temperature gets 4 degrees below where it's set.\n\nWell, the temperature dropped so fast outside down to -20F that before the generator kicked on because of the interior temperature drop, the fuel in the APU's line froze. It doesn't set off warning bells when there's a problem, it just didn't kick back on, so about 4 hours later I woke up to find it was about 15 degrees in the cab. Also, unlike most small car and truck engines, Diesel Tractor engines take about an hour to warm up from that cold, especially when you're not allowed to move the thing. Had I driven down the road, I would have been warm in 15 minutes, but government regulations had me down for 10 hours.\n\nThat night sucked.

{"body": "You're correct that the bottom two fifths are especially vulnerable. This is why the Cost Share Reduction exists. Basically, the CSR upgrades the silver plan (that has a federally capped maximum out of pocket of ~$12,500 for a family) to a gold or platinum plan. The reason for this is that the subsidy that folks get is not just for their premiums but also for copays and coinsurance towards the deductible and maximum out of pocket. So, for Americans who qualify for the 94% CSR, they only pay 6% of the coinsurance and have an individual MOOP of $2,250 and a family MOOP of $4,500. Yes, those are still troubling numbers for poorer folks. However, getting assistance on the premium, copays, and out of pocket maximums improves the quality of a silver to the quality of a gold or platinum plan, at a price closer to that of a bronze plan.\n\nSO, we are talking, especially for poor people, well less than $20,000 per year. Thanks Obama!\n\nThe real problem with the healthcare law is that it does not have an opt in for people who qualify for medicaid. As such, the healthcare plan that I consult for has to tell people who qualify for Medicaid that they do not qualify for a Cost Share Reduction (CSR) or a premium tax credit (APTC). Since they may not be able to get Medicaid (Thanks Republican governors!) this is a real and very unjust gap due to policy errors on the part of Democrats (Thanks Obama...). That the two sides can't stomach one another sufficiently to resolve this points less to a failure in the parties in power than it does to a general failure of America's system of government. We could use a refresh that mandates that the federal government actually solve problems, other nations have already blazed the way. \n\nTL;DR [This website](http://www.healthreformbeyondthebasics.org/cost-sharing-charges-in-marketplace-health-insurance-plans-part-2/) has a handy breakdown in how the CSR schedules work. The short answer is, if you're poor and qualify for a CSR, buy a silver plan through your state's exchange. And, if you're poor enough to get medicaid by federal but not state standards.

{"body": "Point and Figure Update\n[Note:  All of my charts are based on Bitstamp, 1 day chart, with a 3 box reversal]\n\nhttp://imgur.com/msBcO27\n\nYesterday we continued downward another two boxes to a low of $765.  Throughout the evening and this morning we have reversed into a column of Xs, reaching a high of $848.  This is a tentative reversal and will not be confirmed until the day is over.  If the low drops below $760 throughout the day, the greyed boxes become moot and we fall back to the column of Os.\n\nAll of our trading points remain unchanged at this point.\n\nIf we revert to a column of Xs the following changes occur:\n\nBuy signal would remain at $1,000.\nSell Signal would change to $750, up from $690.\nThe short Bullish Support line will rise to $435.  We would have to fall below that to turn the trend \"bearish.\"\nThe long term trend line is at $134.\n\nSome interesting things to consider:\nA sell signal has not been triggered since the Bitcoin hit 382 on 12/17.  Certainly it has gone up and down a lot, but this confirming the upward trend after the slam down at the beginning of November.  This should give confidence in the longer term trend.\n\nStrategy\nI am sitting out any more trades until the fiat gets put back into my trading account.\nProjected re-entry point would be near the $860 point, which would reverse the current down swing.  I am cautious until we form a new buy signal.\n\nPrediction\nI think a new formation will form around the 780-840 range for a couple of days.  The new buy signal will probably form in the $850 range.  If the new formation creates a triangle over the next few days, i would be very cautious about a bearish breakdown.  I believe that since we have NOT incurred a sell signal in almost a month we would be on the precipice of another sell off.\n\nIf we form a bullish breakout, breaking $1,000 should be in short order.\n\nDisclaimer:  I have to go the Dr today, so I am not in a good mood.  So, feel free to take my advice.  If you like your returns you can keep them.  Period.  If you lose....well, its not my fault.

{"body": "I apologize everyone for the crappy article. What I was trying to get at was, on a grass roots level, certain anti-feminists arguments attract Traditionalists, which I would argue conflicts with many MRMs wanting to change gender roles and expectations for men. Then there is an overlap from Traditionalist to Conservatives, which is fine but then becomes \"Feminism? Thanks, Obama!\" which is somewhat fair given the VAWA and other policies, but somewhat unfair because I don't think even the most Conservative President could have done anything anti-feminist beyond maybe a slight slowdown. And also there would be the baggage of Traditional Gender roles shackling men, who are much more trapped therein. And then the racism overlap comes in. I am definitely NOT saying that Traditionalists=Conservatives=Racists, and am not talking about any leaders of the MRM saying this. What I am saying is that on the layman, commentor level I have seen the degeneration from \"Feminism is bad because it eliminated proper gender roles of the good old days\" to \"The damn liberals can be thanked for that.\" to \"Get the darkie out of the White House and back into the fields, and then we can get the women out of the office and back in the kitchen.\" Obviously these are the nasty chaff that must be separated from the wheat that the MRM attracts, and can be found all over the internet where comments run wild. But it is troubling when I am reading an article that I feel is making an excellent argument for men's rights, and the racists are all saying \"Hell Yeah!\" with me. KRosen333 is quite right to point out that there is a distinct difference between an MRA and a PUA/RedPill Theory, which is also separate from MGTOW. But if you go to Chateau Heartiste or the MGTOW forums, you will find racists. And the MRM and MRAs are so misrepresented and misunderstood and demonized by the public at large. If the author of the article considers himself an MRM, and writes a blog about it no less, confuses MRMs and PUAs, Joe Schmoe Public whose entire knowledge of MRAs is a vague association with a Fedora is going to have no problem lumping the entire \"manosphere\" into a cohesive group. The \"No True Scotsman\" fallacy should be a double edged towards feminism and the MRM. But right now the MRM has the legitimate defense that it is a very young movement with neither the Academic history or political machine of Feminism. NAFALT/NAMRAALT is a sword to feminists who are called out to denounce extremists, but a shield to the MRM because there are no clear leaders that are beyond internet level famous. But we need them. We want the MRM to grow and gain legitimacy in the pubic eye, we want a political voice. I don't want the MRM to forever be whatever the individual MRA defines it for him or herself.\n\nI chose this article (poorly, I know) because I wanted a critique of these matters to come from a MRA voice calling out the community to nip this problem in the bud, rather than a feminist voice writing a slam piece trashing the whole movement, which I found plenty of. Maybe this little nugget can be salvageable from the article.\n\n\"The problem is, the minute one of these walking political Time Bombs starts pushing their agenda, all logic and reason to support mens right’s vanishes… we become irrevocably tied to whatever they are pushing, and simply for their own self-preservation, HUGE blocks of men desert or hate us and we lose all future credibility and popularity.\n\n\nIf you were a black man, would you wish to join a ‘men’s rights’ organization and stand side-by-side with a bunch of dudes in white hoods eyeing your neck speculatively?\n\n\nMen’s rights NEEDS Black american males. we NEED asians, we NEED islamic men, we NEED christians. we need all men to come together for the mutual goal of ensuring that our rights are no longer denied us\"\n\nThis was what I meant when I said the MRM might have a bigger racial problem than the rift between Modern Feminists and WOC. Feminists are criticized for paying lip service to minorities, but when the chips are down, their real BFF is Hugo Schwyzer, no matter how many Black Feminists he throws under the bus.\n\n\"We need all men to come together for (our) mutual goal.\"\n\nHe almost gets it right, I think. But we don't need all men. We need to tell the racists and traditionalists that we don't need friends like them. As the MRM grows in the public eye from a punchline to a respectable cause, we need to watch out for our own inevitable \"Helen\" Schwyzer, and make sure she is the one thrown under the bus. And then back the bus up again to be sure she's really dead.\n\nBecause especially if we want to fight the narrative that the WHITE Male is the Patriarchal Oppressor of all, sitting on his throne of eternal privilege, we can NOT have the KKK showing up uninvited, marching in solidarity with the MRAs. A video of that would makes the Feminists in Toronto look downright genteel.\n\nThe MRM isn't racist, we just have racist groupies.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389289862", "subreddit": "FeMRADebates", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've lived in Medford my entire life so I'll add to this conversation.  As others have said it's pretty much a \"Thanks, Obama\" conservative town with the whole bitch about Obama but not back it up kind of mentality which is why I would say avoid politics unless your into that.  \n\nI've never been to the rock gym but I hear it's great.  I have friends that go there and highly recommend it.  I'd like to go sometime but already have a gym membership and can't afford to go to the rock gym.  There's another gym in town called Superior that has an indoor tread wall which is also a great workout too.    \n\nAs for good places to eat there are not many.  I would say avoid all the mexican food places in Medford as they are awful.  A good place for mexican food is Inti's in Talent their food is delicious and they use local ingredients so you don't feel stuff after eating there.  Another good place is The Grass Shack in phoenix which has excellent Hawaiin food.  Medford isn't really a dangerous city but there are some areas to avoid.  I would recommend not going on the Green way or Hawthorn park at night.  During the day is fine but there are still transients and other seedy types around but they won't typically bother you in the day.  West Medford is the lower income part of town so more crime in that area.  \n\nSome parts of West medford are nice but avoid Hamilton and Union Park as there has been reports of gang activity over there.  But don't be fooled as Gangs in Medford are mostly wannabe's who are not even in the same league as LA,  Detroit, or Oakland gangs.  Also surrounding cities like White City, Eagle point, and Phoenix are pretty trashy as well especially white city that place is plagued with gangs and crime.  Other than that the rest of town is a pretty good place.  \n\nAlso most places in town close around 9pm.  Unless you are into the bar scene there isn't a whole lot of night life in Medford.  Ashland has a little bit better of a night life as its a college town. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389481640", "subreddit": "Medford", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; we need to stop spending the money we do have on consumerist crap\n\nI'd posit that what makes this generation broke isn't the oft stated lust for the newest iPhone or PS 4, but \"unavoidable\" debt.\n\n\"Everyone\" says to high schoolers, \"Go to a good college, get a degree, it almost doesn't matter what it's in\". (Which is both good advice and bad advice, in the current world where you need a 4 year degree to qualify for a secretary job. Sure, some 17 year olds buck the advice of friends, family and every other adult mentor and go to trade school, or community college, or take 6 years to do a 2 year associates program working their way through school, but those are exceptions. And of course it's bad advice when you graduate with a BA in English or even Math or Law and find that jobs in those fields really don't exist.)\n\nBut it's not just a down-payment sized college debt this generation is graduating with. It's the multi-thousand dollar insurance deductible and/or medical charges denied when something bad happens. (ObamaCare makes some of this stuff better)\n\nAnd it's also the high price of housing, no matter where you are. If I need to save $25,000 to $100,000 to afford a 20% down-payment on a house, but our parents were able to do this quickly. I'm not sure why: being able to cover the costs of college with a part time summer job might have helped them. Wages not having flat-lined yet also probably helped, and not having to have 20% downpayment on a house probably also helped.\n\nSure, of course, extravagant spending on credit cards is  bad, but $300 on a new phone or game system is pennies compared to $30K worth of college debt or what-have-you. Getting out of college debt half a month faster, or having 1/2 to 1/10 of a month's more worth of rent in your emergency fund doesn't seem worth it.\n\n*TL; DR*: comparing our consumer habits with consumer habits of the Boomers in the early '70s is comparing apples to oranges on a number of levels. For one, the size of debt we start our working lives with, in addition to the debts we acquire (medical bills being an example), and the expense of some things that were cheaper (or easier to acquire with a \"stronger\" dollar?) 40 years ago (housing, car, heck even gas)... it's a different world. \n\nLeisure over work works great for those near the top of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, but I certainly don't feel near the top of that when $3K of medical bills comes in. Even if I may be in a better life-situation than some of my contemporaries in Generation Screwed.\n\nEdit: To the libertarians: Yes, of course personal responsibility. Yes of course you made the decision to improve your life by going to college, and you make the choice to go to the ER when you had abdominal pain. And of course everyone understands that when you consume services you should pay for them, either individually or collectively (I pay for highways via taxes on gas). But, for example, I just paid $1,000 worth of medical bills this month, and much more last year. I understand and accept how I got into that place, but I wish I could have saved that money - or used it to get our of student loan or credit card debt faster - but thems the breaks. But why I don't have that $1,000 sitting in some savings account is not because of Toys. Thankfully I can set myself up in a better place (switching to better medical insurance, for example. Thanks, Obama!), again personal responsibility, and I'm thankful where I'm in a life-place where this switch / betterment is doable, because I know it's not for a lot of folk ... but seriously? Did my parents have these problems I'm now faced with? I'm pretty sure they didn't.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389631442", "subreddit": "lostgeneration", "score": 30, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; No, worth is not relative. An employee always benefits a business by X amount of dollars per hour. If I own a diner, it costs me (say) $6/hour to use paper and plastic (and throw it out), so when that person I was paying to wash dishes now costs $8/hour, I am going to swap to using paper/plastic and let the dishwasher go.\n\nWhile true, with NO minimum wage, they'll try to work people for $2 and pocket the other 4. You NEED a balance.\n\nAnd with UBI probably allowing some to leave the workforce, I doubt unemployment will be as much of a problem as it is now. As long as unemployment isnt out of control it'll matter little. Keep it as it is. \n\n&gt;Right, so any job you took (even if it were $3/hour) would result in you earning more money than you used to on minimum wage.\n\nNo, your LABOR is worth less then. UBI is meant to be a form of wealth redistribution for me as well, without drastically affecting the labor market. If you've noticed, top quintle shares have gone up at a ridiculous rates while everyone else's purchasing power has declined. UBI is a way to even things out, and removing min wage takes that away.\n\n&gt;But giving someone $10/hour to do something that is only earning $3/hour is welfare. UBI replaces welfare.\n\nNo it's not. That is a horrible argument. Welfare isn't wages.\n\n&gt;I am not talking republican leadership, I am talking republican voters. Any proposal you make that is not even slightly appealing to these people is simply wasted breath.\n\n\"your taxes will go down after you deduct UBI from your new tax rates\"....and the republicans cheer. Except the rich elites. On the other hand, if you eliminate the minimum wage, and the wage structure is depressed, a lot of people will lose their job or take a cut and pay while having higher taxes. \"Thanks Obama\" (or whoever is president when it gets elected).\n\nYou're not offering any argument I haven't heard before. I don't care about business costs beyond how it affects everyone. As I said, if we're gonna talk about the minimum wage, it should be AFTER UBI is implemented, where we have a better idea of what we're doing. To pull min wage out from under people even if we give them a replacement, is a horrible idea.

{"body": "I think you've already figured out all of the hard stuff. You've learned that you need to follow your heart and no amount of denial is ever going to make that want go away. And that right there is so brave and I just wanted to acknowledge you for that.\n\nBut before you do anything else, I think there's a few things you should think about. Only you know your family and can gauge exactly how poorly they will react to this. Having your parents pull a *Don't Ask, Don't Tell* on you is one thing... but having them physically kick you out and cut all contact is quite another. I wish I could say that the latter didn't happen, but unfortunately, it does. So, that's something you really need to think about. If you suspect that your parents are of the worse sort, I don't recommend telling them until you are financially secure without them. \n\nBut maybe they're more of the \"*love the sinner, hate the sin*\" sort. Maybe they're going to look at you as more of a \"problem\" to be fixed than a lost soul. In which case, they might try to send you to one of those \"Christian Therapists.\" Quotation marks to show you how little I respect a therapist that rejects medically proven facts from the American Psychological Association. But you might want to be prepared for that also.\n\nBut if your dad's a pastor, he's probably spoken on the topic of homosexuality. You might be able to discern what his reaction might be based upon what he preaches. After all, whatever happens, the guy is standing before an entire group of people, supposedly setting an example as their leader. Do you guys believe that the sin is the act of homosexuality or are you more like the Catholics and believe that homosexuality is a test from God and the only solution is chastity? The former is preferable here, because really, there's just no good argument against, \"God made you that way as a test from God to suffer through.\" *Thanks, Obama.*\n\nBut okay, say that you've determined your parents won't outright disown you and although it might be really tough, you'll be technically safe if you come out. I would try speaking his language. And by that, I mean going Biblical on his ass. Do you know about the complete mistranslation of malakoi and arsenokoites in I Corinthian 6:9? How the historical evidence actually points to those two words now translated as \"*homosexual*\" actually likely referring to a young male prostitute and his \"John?\" How Jesus never actually spoke on the matter? How out of date Leviticus is? You can ask him why we still condemn homosexuality because of Leviticus, yet eat shellfish and pork and wear polycotton blends. And then when he replies with something along the lines of, \"Because society has advanced to a point where those things no longer need to be prohibited.\" You can ask him why the same isn't true for homosexuality, since we hardly need to populate the earth like crazy anymore. \n\nThe point is, there is a whole lot of information on the internet to refute each and every verse that is used to condemn homosexuality. It requires research, but at one point in my life, I actually found enough evidence to no longer believe the Bible even condemns homosexuality. How could they, anyways? Loving homosexual relationships between consenting adults did not even *exist* to their knowledge. But I know what did exist: homosexual temple worship to false gods, orgies, and homosexual prostitution. Why would we apply the rules against *those* things to that of a loving relationship that absolutely hurts no one, and in all other ways, supports the commandments of the Bible?\n\nSo, my advice is to do some research and be absolutely resolute in your conviction before opening this dialogue. The real problem is going to be whether or not your dad is the type of pastor that follows Jesus with his mind as well as his heart. Maybe you should ask him that. \n\nAnd other than that, seriously good luck with all of this. There are books out there that cover this topic, so you could potentially give one of them to your father if you think he'd be receptive to it. \n\nBut whatever you do, just be happy. I won't claim to wholly relate since I was never a pastor's daughter, but if you had gone to my school, you'd have thought we all were... You're not alone with your struggle.\n\nHere's some links: \n\nhttp://www.gaychristian101.com/Malakoi.html\n\nhttp://www.gaychristian101.com/what-did-paul-mean-when-he-used-the-greek-word-arsenokoitai.html\n\nhttp://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.org/biblical_evidence/no_fems_no_fairies.html\n\nhttp://wordofawoman.com/2012/04/09/homosexuality-and-god-parts-5-and-6-pornoi-arsenokoitai-and-malakoi/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389785250", "subreddit": "actuallesbians", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

Work pays for a monthly T card for me so I don't need to worry about transportation costs (I'm in Boston, so I take the bus/subway or walk)\n\n3. The rent/utilities numbers are coming from my boyfriend, who has given me estimations what he and his roommate pay on the monthly utilities. Will probably be a bit more expensive with 3 (I'm taking the current numbers, so things like cable will be the same but electricity may go up), but this is just preliminary planning to make sure I'm prepared to move out. Will rebudget in a few months and double check the utilities. \n\n4. Okay, I did not realize that. I was planning the 401k with post tax numbers. The $2800/month is post tax, so I was calculating $280 to be 10%. I've gotten 3 paychecks (so I'm sure of the amount) but not set up the 401k yet (waiting on some admin stuff). No benefits will come out though, I'm planning on staying on my parent's plan until 26. THANKS OBAMA.

Valve has always been a huge supporter of modifications of their games, something most AAA studios have moved away from or restricted in recent years.

We have way too much friction in hiring.  All of the mandatory obligations that come with hiring a person should just go.  Maybe replace it with government programs, that sounds reasonable.  Decouple health insurance from employment, and decouple everything else while we're at it.  Keep work simple, and deal with social safety nets in another arena.  I don't care how specifically.

{"body": "*Bryan  Dawson  is seen walking through the backstage of Rogers Arena. Dawson passes by the Canucks locker room and then heads down a hallway aligned with offices and individual locker rooms. A repeated thud is heard, increasing in sound as Dawson continues walking. He stops outside the locker room where the sound is coming from. The sign on the door reads \"The Redneck Warrior\". Dawson pulls out a small notepad and enters the room. Standing across from him, a heavyset man with a mullet repeatedly punching the metal lockers.*\n\nBryan Dawson: Excuse me? Mr. Warrior.\n\n*Redneck Warrior turns around and a large grin cracks across his face.*\n\nBryan Dawson: Bryan Dawson, RWF's backstage interviewer. \n\n*Dawson says as putting his hand out to shake it. Redneck Warrior grabs a towel and wipes off the blood as he begins to speak.*\n\nThe Redneck Warrior: Well how the hell are ya? \n\n*Warrior shakes Dawson's hand.* \n\nThe Redneck Warrior: I tell you what, this cold air gets me bleeding faster than a virgin after her wedding.  \n\n*The Redneck Warrior busts out with a chuckle.*\n\nBryan Dawson: We're glad you took us up on our offer. It's great to have someone with your history joining our roster. \n\nThe Redneck Warrior: Oh you! That was a wrong time ago.\n\n*The Redneck Warrior says as he grins almost shy like.*\n\nBryan Dawson: I've known of your work in Japan since the late 90s. What exactly led to the five year hiatus? \n\nThe Redneck Warrior: Well I don't speak about it much. But it was a Hair VS Mask match against Jushin Liger. The son of bitch whooped my ass. \n\n*Warrior gives out a good laugh.* \n\nThe Redneck Warrior: Afterwards, he slapped me in the face a few times with the mullet.  The embarrassment discouraged me.  I would have stayed retired if it wasn't for mom's rising medical bills, thanks Obama.  So yeah, as they say, I'm here to cash checks, break some necks. \n\nBryan Dawson:  Obviously, your first match, they're testing the waters and have you in the shows opener.  How is that affecting you. \n\nThe Redneck Warrior: Shit, you think it matters to me if I'm opening or closing. I carried big names on my back throughout the last decade. I have nothing to prove here. Tonight, you're getting a match they're gonna call \"The Opener heard around the World\".  I'm gonna go out there, set the tone for all the boys in the back. \n\nBryan Dawson: Do you feel your ring rust will be too much to overcome tonight against Blade Jared.\n\nThe Redneck Warrior: I tell you what, I'm gonna bust this kid up a little, nothing too bad, not his fault they're throwing him in there against the Warrior. Ring rust ain't nothing to me, I started training a little after I got the letter from the RWF office.  I've cut back on the beer, 10 instead of 12, everyday.  I've been drinking green tea and eating Chich-Fil-A every damn day.  Listen, I know I'm coming off, easy going, but I'm no sissy-boy. \n\nBryan Dawson: Of course, nobody is saying you are. It's just been some time. The last time you wrestled Blade Jared was 15 years old. \n\nThe Redneck Warrior: Yeah, I get where you're coming from. But you gotta realize , kicking some ass is like riding a bicycle for me, I ain't ever gonna forget how.  The bad thing is, I have nothing to gain or lose from this match. If I win, I just beat some kid that's just breaking in. If I lose, it's my first match in five years.  The difference is, tonight I'm fighting for momma, I'm bringing home that winner's bonus. I'm going to Wal-Mart, I'm getting a $18 steak, and I'm gonna go to the titty-bar and drop some bills. \n\n*The Redneck Warrior says while laughing.* \n\nThe Redneck Warrior: But in all seriousness, I'd like that top star once again. I'd like to be the face of a company again. I'm sure I've got another 10 years in the tank. When I'm come out of those curtains, riding on my John Deere, Free bird playing in this arena, I'm gonna try to end it, and end it fast. \n\n*Dawson begins to write on his notepad.*\n\nBryan Dawson: So Warrior, any words for Blade Jared? \n\nThe Redneck Warrior: Ha well, good luck mate. \n\n*Warrior tries a British accent but ends up sounding more Australian.*\n\nThe Redneck Warrior: But you know, Blade Jared, I'm going to end you.\n\n*Warrior says this in the most Southern accent, drawing end out excessively.*\n\nBryan Dawson: Alright, I'll let you finish preparing for the match, nice to meet you and as always good luck tonight Warrior. \n\n*Dawson leaves the locker room as The Redneck Warrior begins to punch the lockers again.*\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389980708", "subreddit": "RWF", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

So after I went to my doctor's office and they approved my temporary health insurance I was able to get a treatment the following day. \n\nToday, when I woke up, I felt better than I have in over 3 months without my treatments.\n\n**TL;DR-got kicked off healthcare, got back on it, not dying.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390028616", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Not to my knowledge. You gave as a \"historical\" definition of government \"institutions society creates in an attempt to maintain order and establish justice, but it has always maintained a governmental status\". In other words \"a thing that exists that people call government\". I think religion is more like a system of beliefs dealing with the supernatural and metaphysical.\n\nFine, replace Religion with the Church. The Church had a lot more governing power before and going into the feudal era.\n\n&gt;Agreeing with someone usually works that way.\n\nYou added an exception to the agreement.\n\n&gt;Who is \"the public\"? What does it hold as its interests? A lot of people eat at McDonalds. Is McDonalds publicly funded?\n\nThe public is everyone. It holds self-preservation, the preservation of others and the advancement of itself as interests. McDonalds isn't needed for any of those things. Travel networks, fire prevention/protection and health care, among others, are.\n\n&gt;I think you might need a shorter definition. And this definition of being governed includes being watched, counted, enrolled, preached at, forbidden, punished, and mocked?\n\nYou took the quote out of context. That sentence ends with, \"...by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so.\" When permission is not granted for people to do these things, there is a hierarchy installment that governs.\n\n&gt;Granted, it's a very nice quote and very inspiring, but I think a more systematic political view needs a better definition first. May I suggest \" to be governed is to use aggressive force to control the person and property of others under the pretense of moral legitimacy\"? I think that sums it up, and that also lines up with how I described it before as \"someone just thinking they had the right to aggress against someone else legitimately\".\n\nThat's a legitimate definition of government if you restrict what government can be to political government and ignore any other form of government. The Church governs its parishioners, for instance. Property has historically been a source of government in mutualistic rights/property/government theory, as we've been known to denote with the *droit d'aubaine* or \"right of increase\".\n\n&gt;I disagree of course, but as that's not really a disagreement of morality and we'd both allow the other's system to function ina free society, let's hold off that debate for later.\n\nWell, I'm curious, if people price at cost, even though cost is partially subjective to the individual, how can capitalistic enterprise, which prices at maximum ability, compete? Capitalistic enterprise will have to reduce price to near cost levels just to stay in business, and with an application of ethics of equality and mutuality, I can't imagine them receiving nearly as much business. And if capitalists are forced to price at cost, their laborers are receiving less for their wages than self-employed or co-op laborers are for the same job, since the capitalist controls the wage relationship between himself and his laborers, and needs to be able to extract large amounts of value in order to maintain and eventually expand his business. It's simply not viable.\n\n&gt;So the difference between a charity and a solidarity is that a charity has to face the problems of scarcity while a solidarity does not? If these things aren't scarce, why do people need to organize together to provide it in the first place? For example, there is no solidarity for providing gravity around (at least to my knowledge). What does scarcity even mean for an item that does not need to be economized on? I'd say that's a contradiction in terms.\n\nCharity is something people with excess give to which gives to those with nothing or very little. In an anarchistic society without the problems of severe wealth inequality caused by capitalistic markets, everyone has a *very roughly equal* amount of wealth. There are inequalities, but they wouldn't be severe in most cases due to people working more or less for more or less payment. Everyone is thus able to pay for certain things that everyone can benefit from, and without the financial burden we currently have from the State's taxation and perpetuation of capitalistic markets.\n\nScarcity is artificially imposed by the state-capitalistic system we're in, and prevents any form of solidarity from emerging. Charity is what it replaces it with, along with forced taxation for services we may or may not want/need. *Thanks Obama*.\n\n&gt;How so? In a charitable act, one person gives to another. If I see a beggar on the street asking for money and I decide to give him some, that's a charitable act, but I don't think that implies \"hierarchy\" at all.\n\nYou're looking at charity as \"Oh, you'e in need? Here ya go.\" when I'm looking at the institution of charity itself, not just individual acts of charity. Everything is more than just the sum of its parts.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390354657", "subreddit": "Anarcho_Capitalism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Large upfront cost is the problem with all alternative energy. And those large solar farms would have to take up roughly 22,000 square acres for the same amount of every that a 20 square acre nuclear plant could create. \n\"Other cost\" every different fuel source is going to have problems. One major one for solar panels especially the ones I live next to in Arizona is they get really dirty pretty quickly and are difficult to clean. And if you leave they dirty they are not nearly as effective as they could be. Another smaller problem is the heat. Solar panels get extremely hot. Then you add on the 110-117* F summer days to that and it gets to be a lot of fun in there. On top of that you would like to have it in a secluded sunny place so the dessert is perfect. But the problem is you need people on site to work it and control it. \nSome costs avoided by solar would be storing of the radioactive waste, and clean up in case of disaster. But with a little gov or big business help, those could be solved pretty easily. Pres Obama cut funding to what was going to be the largest store of nuclear waste (thanks Obama) yucca mountain in Nevada. Leaving many plants having to use their temp. Pools of special lead to store the nuclear rods. Which is potentially dangerous. This is a real current issue with nuclear waste. But fortunately there is research going into being able to reuse spend fuel rods into making more energy but that technology is still out of our grasp at this time. \nOn to disaster. Alright nuclear disasters have happened but many can be attributed to either poor constructed plants or engineers being stupid. Chernobyl was the largest accident yet, and it's construction was called \"fundamentally faulty\" by American physicist. Then the actual event was caused by engineers being impatient and ignorant of nuclear physics. The story goes a small team of electrical engineers were going to conduct an experiment with the reactors. Try wanted to see if they could draw energy from a turbine that just tuned off and was idleing down. When they started the experiment they lowered the power levels to quickly. This causes neutron-absorbing fission by products in te reactors core. Instead of waiting 24 hours like protocol said they continued on and then it hit critical and the poorly constructed reactor blew it's several ton concrete lid off. \nIn the case of Fukushima Japan. A major reason for the disaster (after the natural ones) was the sea wall. When it broke it flooded the plant and some one made the mistake of having the backup generators for power on the first floor so when it flooded they no longer worked leaving the plant without power. So it quickly heats up and then later exploding from the build up. \n\nAlright sorry for the wall of text but I like alternate fuel sources. Any other questions let me know!\n\nTlDR: All alternate fuels have problems\nSolar- less effective, large upfront cost\nNuclear- huge upfront cost, radioactive material to deal with, extremely effective\n\nEdit: also let me know if you want sources.

{"body": "*sigh* Why are you entrenching yourself? Anyhoo...\n\n\"If we let the gays marry, what's to stop people from marrying their cats? They took our jerbs! And thanks, Obama!\" Any other conservative talking points you care to bring up? \n\nDisregarding the fact that a slippery slope argument is inherently fallible, I will simply point out the most obvious and common argument against your childish opinion since I'm pressed for time. \n\nThe most applicable comparison to gay marriage is interracial marriage. A person's race (or gender) does not constitute a legal basis to deny or withhold a person's rights. We've already been over this with the whole segregation thing. No matter what race or gender you are, you can drink out of the same water fountain as everyone else because you know, you're a human being. Do you want to bring back white-only water fountains? Oh, wait, do you think that's another false equivalency? Sorry, it's not. It's the same exact thing. By the way, \"Colored's only\" was the historical term used for that. What would be a more appropriate terminology for that along the same lines as marriage isn't an appropriate term for a gay union? The civil rights debate is over, man. Denying the right to marry to a group of people is the same fucking thing as telling a black person they're not good enough to drink out of the same water fountain as you. You're not racist, are you? Yea, I went there. If you're not making a religious argument, which I believe you're not, there are numerous legal cases you can look up in regards to this matter. Start with *Perez v Sharp* and then work your way up to the DOMA ruling and *In RE Marriage cases* via the California Supreme Court. \n\nFurthermore, and on a non-emotional note, it is detrimental to the fiscal interests of the state to deny the marriages of same-sex couples. \n\nYou may be \"only\" hung up on terminology, but it's that exact type of thing that throws a wrench in the gears. \n\nExcuse me, I need to go find a \"whites-only\" water fountain to quench my thirst after that rant. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390658806", "subreddit": "indianapolis", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Cheapest plan for me was $175/mo with a $6k annual deductible and the insurer only covering 60% of remaining costs at most.  That is 100% crap.\n\nLets say I have a problem that requires a $50,000 medical solution.  I have to pay $6k off the bat so that knocks it down to $44,000.  The Insurer only pays at most 60% of what is left assuming they don't attempt to pay even less.  But assuming they pay the full 60% that leaves $17,600 that I have to cover after already dropping $6,000.  And that all for the low low price of $175 a month is bullshit.  \n\nBecause ONLY major medical problems will cost enough to go beyond the deductible it will almost certainly still result in bankruptcy from anything worse than a broken bone.  The plan with the $1,000 deductible and covering like 80% of everything else?  Yeah $350 a month.\n\n\nSo my options are:\n\nBronze plan for $175 a month and hope I don't get hurt.\n\nGold plan for $350 a month and hope I can find a way to afford it and hope I don't get hurt because I've spent all my money on the gold plan I can't even cover the lower deductible and 20%.\n\nNo insurance for $0 a month and hope I don't get hurt.\n\nAnything minor I will have to cover anyway and anything major that requires insurers to pay will likely require that I still pay enough to financially ruin me.\n\nBest financial option is to maintain personal injury protection on my car insurance and hope I don't get hurt outside of a car accident.\n\nAll else fails bankruptcy.\n\nThanks Obama.\n\nI get it.  Someone has to pay more for less so that those with less get something when they had nothing.  It is the way the aca was planned from the start.  Econ 101 and all that.  I have friends that can now get decent insurance when they couldn't and I am happy for them.\n\nDon't sit there and tell me it is better for me when it is obviously not.  It is better for some.  Perhaps many and perhaps even most.  But it is not better for me and it is not better for many like myself.  And excuse us if we have a problem with that.\n\n\n\nedit:  and how fucking expensive is your birth control that now paying triple your previous health insurance costs is cheaper than paying for just the birth control?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390667461", "subreddit": "Seattle", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I think that having a discussion about overly burdensome paperwork is a great thing to have. I also think that having a discussion about the monopoly power of cable companies is a great thing to have.\n\nMost Republicans don't seem to want to have those discussions. They state that there should be no government involvement with cable companies, period, and that no regulations are good, period. At least that's what Republicans seem have evolved into, with a dash of shouting \"markets should be free\" and \"you're a f*cking socialist commie libtard, thanks Obama\" thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe article you linked to is a good example. Someone is trying to rent out their place in Washington DC. They list several bureaucratic hurdles they had to overcome. Instead of offering a \"good government\" solution which would either streamline the process or reevaluate it to see if all the steps were really necessary, they turned the experience into a screed about how anti-business the country is. The implication there, at least as I read it, is that those regulations shouldn't exist. And that was Matt Yglesias, not exactly a Tea Partier. \n\nThe purpose of the laws regulating landlords in DC is a debatable point. Yes, I have a feeling that the laws are enacted as a deliberate burden, a barrier to entry for people, specifically because so-called amateur landlords often underestimate how hard it is to be a landlord, and when they are a bad landlord it affects more than just them - it affects their tenants and their neighbors. \n\nWe can debate just how prevalent such situations are; we can debate if there is another approach to prevent such situations - but the important point is that we debate it, we see if we can agree if there is a problem, and we try to come up with a solution that everyone can live with.\n\nScreaming \"anti-business!\" is not helpful, and is basically meant to short-circuit the entire process.

But seriously, it's *his* return I've been most anticipating I've been most anticipating, not Hikari's. He felt like a ticking pressure-cooker bomb of drama (I just got put on a list for that, I bet. Thanks Obama!) when he got thrown into the sea, and now that he's back and will be probably even *more* stressed, I predict some explosions in the future. I've got *my* popcorn ready, how about you?\n\n One thing that is bothering is how it seems like the writers have forgotten about Manaka. I don't remember any character making even a mention of her, let alone spending some thinking about her still being downstairs in the Aquadome. You'd think Hikari would be torn up a little more about not seeing her, but, well. \n\n*The Pilot's Love Song* - No one saw that coming, huh? :P Nope, not a single person. Nada. Zip.\n\n*Golden Time 16* - Ghost Banri is still a little bitch. Fuck him. However, it was great seeing a really genuine, heartfelt romantic moment between Banri and Kouko...which only further divorces the idea that Banri is internally conflicted over who he loves from reality.\n\n*Nisekoi 3* - Ok, so, apparently Shaft is doing a much better job of adapting this than I thought. I mean, it's still pretty generic harem misunderstandings, but it looks like Shaft has managed to improve the pacing from the manga, making it such that it's actually not even bad. In a rare turn of events, I actually prefer the *anime* to the manga. Weird stuff.\n\n*Sekai Seifuku 3* - It actually took me a bit to realize exactly what happened at the end. I was so distracted by the camp and the ludicrious subject matter to even realize that *Kate was actually, legitimately evil.* Not \"lol evil\" like Team Rocket, no, Zvezda are *legitimately* extremists who ruin humanity. Holy fucking shit. \n\n*Nobunagun 4* - This show still hits a lot of generic shounen beats, but it twists things *just* enough to be interesting. Like before, she had to rely upon her inner Nobunaga to pull out her potential, because she herself was too freaked out to concentrate. That sequence where Nobunaga called for his drum, had Shio dance and then *freaking jumping out of a plane in a hurricane* was balls-to-the-walls awesome. I don't know if this'll be my favorite of the season, but it's gearing up to be one of the best. \n\n*Kill la Kill 15* - I dunno, I'm starting to get a little bored; the status quo has not changed for the better, it's only gotten more stratified. I am really, *really* getting tired of Satsuki's BS, and I'm so ready for someone to take her down a notch. And Nudist Beach was still irrelevant despite showing up in force.

{"body": "When I was a smoker, I was into Drum Halfzware Shag. It was like $8.05 for a whole can of the stuff and had a very pleasurable rich flavor that I very much enjoyed. Well then Obama decided to tax rolling tobacco the same as regular cigarettes. The price went up to almost $30 for the same sized can overnight. Due to the price increase, every store around me stopped carrying it, so I started ordering it off the internet. Well then Obama made it so you can't buy cigarette tobacco from the internet anymore.  After about a month of smoking cigarettes I didn't even like, I bought an electronic cigarette and stopped smoking cigarettes altogether.\n\nThanks Obama!\n\nI've been smoke free since 2010 though I still use my electronic cigarette. I have been slowly tapering the nicotine levels in the e-liquid that I use and hope to one day not use nicotine anymore.\n\nI could be making an assumption here, but my tip for quitting with e-cigs is to get a really good one. The first one I had was the crappy convenience store kind that looks like a cigarette and glows on the end... those things are terrible. Do a little research and find a nice one. Also try to find a flavor you like. It took me a while to figure out, but the tobacco flavors are pretty nasty IMO. I've been using cinnamon lately and really like it! Finally make sure you carry an extra battery, juice, and atomizer in case you need to top off, replace, or recharge.\n\nAlso, stop buying cigarettes... then you'll end up being a bum... and nobody likes a bum.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391128492", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
