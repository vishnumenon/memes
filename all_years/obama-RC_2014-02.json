The winner of the Superbowl is the team which has the greatest organizational skill and teamwork; it relates to each individual's skill and their ability to work together.

Thanks Obama.\n\nBut the Earth overheating? That's something which can be seen in many different lights. It has been proven to be a consequence of our own actions, which means it should also fall under the ceiling of free will, but instead most Americans say that it is *not* a result of our actions. This means they think it's either God doing it, or not something to be worried about. Well, if God's doing it, then it's some form of punishment, which means we do have free will but there are people who are \"abusing\" it...again, thanks Obama.\n\nSo their efforts are focused more on eliminating the source of the problem (gays, abortions, et cetera) despite the fact that they're willing to admit that their logic says free will doesn't exist anyways; God is choosing the winner of the Superbowl, but punishing everyone for the actions of a few.

{"body": "Everyone's going to talk about cancer and emphysema and all the health stuff. Honestly, none of that is going to matter to you for a while. You can still be physically active as a young smoker, the lung deterioration will set in gradually enough that you won't notice, and if you quit by 30ish you won't even have an elevated risk of cancer etc.\n\nHere's what's going to matter to you, right now, as an 18-year-old:\n\n1. Money. You're going to spend a lot of money. If you smoke half a pack a day (that's on the low end of 'regular smoker') you're spending on the order of $150/month. That's $1800 *every year.* That's a brand-new high-end gaming computer. Or a car payment on a nice used car. Or a week-long European vacation or Caribbean cruise. Or $15-19,000 in your conservatively-invested retirement savings account at age 65. If you smoke a pack a day, you can double that.\n\n2. Social life. You're going to smell bad. You're going to spend a lot of time smoking. You're mostly going to limit yourself to activities where you can smoke. It will affect your career and your social life and your dating life. You'll soon find yourself mostly hanging out with other smokers, dating other smokers, working with smokers. The socioeconomic status of your social group will be lower, on average, which will limit your employment and advancement opportunities. Being surrounded by smokers will make it much harder to quit when you decide you want to. Marrying a smoker will make it almost impossible.\n\n3. Food and drink. You're going to lose most of your sense of smell and taste. This will happen quickly, but gradually enough that you won't notice. You'll just start waking up with a horrible fuzzy gunky taste in your mouth. Everything will taste worse. You won't enjoy food as much. Water will taste downright awful, so you'll probably start drinking a lot of soda and juice and energy drinks to cover up the taste in your mouth. You might gain weight right away; even if you don't, you'll probably screw up your diet enough that you'll gain weight later (especially when you try to quit).\n\n4. Teeth. Your teeth will turn yellow. This will happen slowly, but you will notice eventually. Probably in the first year. It'll piss you off. You know what smokers do when they get pissed off? Smoke more.\n\n5. Respiratory infections. After a year or two of smoking, your basic cold or flu won't be a minor thing anymore. It'll be a sinus infection at minimum. Maybe bronchitis. It will fuck you up. You won't recover in a week. Sometimes you won't even finish recovering before you catch another one.\n\n6. Loss of free will. Or the illusion of it that we all have. When you're addicted to a substance, even a 'minor' substance that doesn't seem to have a huge effect on your behaviour, you're no longer making decisions. Your addiction is making decisions for you. Maybe you won't notice right away if you have enough money to support your habit and still live comfortably. But if you ever have to make the choice between food and cigarettes, you will choose cigarettes, and then you will understand.\n\nAll of this stuff will happen. Quickly. Within the first few years. If you manage to get yourself addicted, you will make excuses for it. You will find ways to pretend it's not important. It *is* important, though. Smoking diminishes your quality of life right away. When people advise you not to start smoking, it's not just about the health risks when you're 50+. It's about the shitty things you're putting yourself through *right now* that you won't even realize are shitty until you quit.\n\nI'm not saying that there aren't any benefits to smoking. I know, and actually knew at the time, that I was self-medicating my ADHD. I wouldn't have made it through the military or college without smoking and caffeine. That's why I smoked for 10 years. But if that (or something similar - people with schizophrenia and depression also self-medicate by smoking) applies to you, it's 10000 times better to actually get proper treatment if you can.

{"body": "My Observations:\n\n1. There are very few subreddits where you get a genuine mix of political opinions. Generally speaking, political thought sticks to the subreddits most sympathetic to it. That being said, one of the best mixing pots is /r/AdviceAnimals and one of the worst is /r/politics. /r/PoliticalDiscussion is somewhere in the middle, as it has a tendency to devolve into thread-by-thread circlejerks, flamewars, downvote brigades and \"no-you're-stupid \"debates\" \". \n\n2. Active commenters about politics generally speaking come in two flavors: progressive and libertarian. There are almost no outspoken social conservatives or foreign policy hawks, and even among libertarians, support for the free market is undercut by \"left-libertarians\" who are really just anarcho-socialists. With this being said, its small surprise that most of Reddit identifies as Democrat, and the Republicans are just the worst. \n\n3. Political issues that have strong support in the academic community are the ones most likely to have fervent, almost irrational support, from the liberal crowd. They will pick any of these as a hill to die on, and not accept any criticism or skepticism. By this I mean things like:\n \n -Anthropogenic Global Warming\n \n -Feminism/Affirmative Action\n \n -Externality Theory/Keynesian Economics\n\n -Support for the Welfare State\n\n4. When it comes to Obama and Co., people seem to come in three flavors. Those who were against him from the start, those who are disappointed, and those who are still on board and passing around the Koolaid. \n\n**TLDR:**\n\n*1. Default subs are the best for finding a good mix of political thought.*\n\n*2. The only thing rarer than a sober Irishman is an old school Republican on Reddit.*\n\n*3.

{"body": "This is a long response.  Please keep in mind that I am a pro-gun *liberal* who supports gay marriage and health care reform, believes in climate change, and accepts the legitimacy of government intervention in the marketplace.  I say these things because it is really easy for anti-gun people to dismiss pro-gun arguments as the ravings of a paranoid conservative fringe - I assure you, I am not part of that fringe.  Try to read the data that I present with an open mind, I implore you.  \n\n&gt;Can you argue with a straight face that the right to own a gun--and the gun-loving culture it has fostered--prevents more violence than it facilitates?\n\nFirst, I need to address the (wrongful) assumption that is built into your question: the assumption that the gun culture \"facilitates\" violence.  \n\nRural households are twice as likely to own guns than urban households, and suburban households own more guns than urban households. [See here](http://www.people-press.org/files/2013/03/3-12-13-14.png) (data pulled from a Pew Research Center survey from February 13-18, 2013).  Note: I am only referring to legal gun ownership, because illegal gun owners are not reporting their gun owenrship. \n\nDespite the fact that more guns are owned by rural and suburban households, most gun crimes occur in large cities than in small cities, suburbs, and rural areas.  (Gun crimes, in this context, are murder, robbery, and aggravated assault, as those terms are used by the FBI.)The rates of robberies and aggravated assaults involving firearms are much higher for cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants.  For example, in 2012, for cities with more than 250,000, the average rate of robberies was 129 per 100,000, and the average rate of aggravated assaults was 128.8.  For cities with more than 100,000 but less than 250,000? The rates were 64.4 and 69.1.  That's a huge drop!\n\nFor cities with 50k to 99.9k people, the rates were 36.7 and 41.9.  \n\nFor cities with 25k to 49.9k people, the rates were 28.7 and 33.4.  \n\nFor counties that surround cities, the rates were 25.0 and 35.9, and for rural counties, the rates were 5.3 and 26.3\n\nAll of this data comes from [this chart](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/19tabledatadecpdf)\n\nWhat about murder rates?\n\nI apologize, but the FBI doesn't break out murder data by geographic area *and* by murder weapon together.  So I had to use the CDC's WONDER database.  I did a search for non-accidental firearm-related causes of death from 1999 through 2010, and I grouped the results by \"urbanization\" (which measures population density).  The CDC calls these \"assaults by ____\".  You can access the CDC database yourself [here](http://wonder.cdc.gov). \n\nThe results? The rate of death by intentional firearm is 6.8 for \"Large Central Metro\" areas, and significantly lower for all the other urbanization categories.  [See my results in this screenshot here.](http://i.imgur.com/Gt1UXji.jpg)  \n\nSo we know that gun ownership is more prevalent among rural communities than urban communities, but communities in large cities have much higher rates of gun crimes.  \n\nYou can't argue that gun culture is to blame.  Large cities have been hostile to gun rights for years - many cities have (or had) more restrictive gun ownership policies than the suburban and rural counties that surround them.  I'm looking at you, New York, Detroit, Washington DC, New York, and Chicago.  Gun culture has never been allowed to flourish in the big cities. \n\nGun crimes happen more in big cities than elsewhere, and there are several causes for that - failed drug war policies, underfunded and undersupported public school systems, poor policing strategies, lack of job opportunities, inadequate access to higher education, inadequate access to job training programs, etc.  The violence that occurs in big cities can even be traced to particular \"micro\" hotspots such as particular corners or intersections. [See this article (from the Huffington Post, no less!).](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-m-kennedy/the-story-behind-the-nati_b_4634755.html).  The problem of violence in cities isn't easily traced to gun ownership, and certainly not to the American gun culture.   \n\nFinally, I want to point out that violent crime has been declining for the last two decades.  At the same time, it has become easier and easier for Americans to get a license to conceal carry a firearm - yet there has been no corresponding increase in gun crimes.  Gun sales have hit record highs in the last few years (thanks Obama!) and still the violent crime rates are dropping. This is true in places like [Virginia](http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/va-gun-crime-drops-again-as-firearm-sales-soar/article_a9a3cd36-dc50-5192-9b97-e14258e6168a.html) where gun control laws are weaker, and [California](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-calif-gun-sales-go-up-number-of-gun-casualties-goes-down/) where gun control laws are very strict, but it's also true [nationally](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/gun-homicide-rate-down-49-since-1993-peak-public-unaware/).  If guns and gun culture were \"facilitating\" violence, we would see the opposite happening, and we don't.  \n\nOK, so I think that I have sufficiently shown that gun ownership in America does not facilitate violence.  Does it prevent violence, as you ask?\n\nAbsolutely, every day.  Subscribe to /r/dgu and read it for a month.  Read the stories about mothers defending their children, old ladies defending themselves, etc.  But those are, at best, anecdontes. \n\nThere's at least one study which suggests that there are millions of defensive gun uses every year.  (A \"defensive gun use\" includes situations where the gun owner fires her weapon, but it also includes situations where the gun owner merely displays her weapon and that is sufficient to end the encounter with her attacker.)  This study, by John Lott, is widely cited by pro-gun folks.  I won't link it, and you don't need to read it, because anti-gun folks have torn it apart over the years.  Let's just say that the outer bound of estimated DGUs is in the millions per year. \n\nWhat about the lower bound?  Well, the anti-rights group the Violence Policy Center has a paper that says there were only 235,700 DGUs for the entire five years of 2007 through 2011.  [Page seven of this paper](http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable.pdf).  If we assume that those DGUs occurred in roughly equal amounts each year, that gives us 47,140 DGU per year.\n\nSo on the low end, even the most anti-gun group admits that there are at least 47,140 DGUs per year.  And on the high end, we have 2.5 million.  That's a pretty massive disparity, and unfortunately we just don't have the data to narrow it down.  \n\nPersonally, I think it's reasonable to accept that many DGUs go unreported - there's no reason for a gun owning victim to report a non-shooting DGU if the criminal leaves once the firearm is displayed, and the criminal certainly isn't going to report the encounter, so non-shooting DGUs are almost certainly an underreported behavior.  And DGUs that result in a justified self-defense shooting do not often lead to prosecutions of the self-defending victim, which is why the \"justifiable homicide\" statistic is so low - it only includes cases that were prosecuted and successfully defended against.\n\nOk so let's assume 47,100 DGUs a year.  How many people were murdered with guns? How many people were killed by accidental discharges?\n\nThe FBI tells us that there were 8,855 people who were murdered with a gun in 2012. [See here](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2008-2012.xls).  The CDC gives us a slightly higher number, 11,078, for 2010 (the last year that data is easily available).  [See here, table 10, page 40 of the PDF](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf). \n\nIf we assume the higher number of homicide deaths by gun, 11,078, then we can calculate that there are slightly more than 4 DGUs for every gun homicide.  That’s pretty important, in my opinion, because that number is using the lowest estimate of DGUs and the highest reliable estimate of deaths from intentional gun use. \n\n(And don’t worry too much about accidental discharges – only 606 deaths in 2010 were caused by unintentional discharges of firearms.  See the same CDC chart that I linked above.)  \n\nOk, so I’ve shown that DGUs occur more frequently than gun murders.  That ignores how many people are hurt during assaults involving guns.  Here’s an interesting fact: murder is more likely to involve a firearm than a knife or other weapon ([see here]( http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_7_murder_types_of_weapons_used_percent_distribution_by_region_2012.xls), but you are far more likely to be the victim of a robbery or aggravated assault involving a knife or other weapon ([see here]( http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/19tabledatadecpdf).  In 2012, there were 176,037 robberies and 514,426 aggravated assaults.  It’s tough to parse out the data – perhaps there is some overlap? But it’s pretty clear that most robberies and aggravated assaults occur without a gun.  So it seems to me that guns are not a huge driver of these types of crimes.  \n\nSo, to conclude:  Yes, I think there is a credible argument that gun ownership has a legitimate benefit – self-defense – and does not “facilitate” gun violence. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391727115", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, I make $12k a year. I can support this because I am young without health issues and have stayed on my dad's health plan (under 26, thanks Obama). I don't even have a girlfriend, so that helps matters.\n\nThat being said, I know I'm under the poverty line. I'm not sad from day to day, I live well enough. I'm just vulnerable to risk.

I can't really afford for anything to go wrong. \n\nThat being said, I think this lifestyle is the right one. I want to trade up and make more money to protect myself better against risk using a pool of savings, but I don't think I need more than I have. No car, I sleep on a thin mattress on the floor, I don't have a TV, I barely run the heat or A/C, I buy clothes very very rarely. Basically I only buy food, the odd bus fare, and entertainment so that I can have a social life. Rent is cheap because I live in a tiny place with a roommate. \n\nAll that being said there is nothing wrong with living this way. In fact, I could stand to do with even less, I reckon.

Of course not. I could just get a brick. \n\nAnd so on. I see no reason that many of these things wouldn't be also applicable to families who were of a similar mind. Indeed if my lifestyle were translated to a family of four, it would likely cost even less than 4x what I spend now, because of economies of scale. \n\nThe issue in large degree seems to be that we are just not prepared to do without a number of things that we don't really need. \n\nThis being said I'm not attempting to suggest that poverty and income inequality is a-ok, and we should all just tighten our belts and shut up. We deserve higher pay, for security, as I said. But when the demand for higher pay is really just a demand for a newer car, or more stylish clothes, or a sleeker phone, then honestly I think it's misguided. No one needs more than what a healthy person in poverty has and uses. \n\nExtra disposable income should be used on things to bolster health (healthier food), education, savings, investment, charity, and promoting general welfare like socializing with friends. But even socializing can be done more cheaply than we commonly imagine, such is the power of our consumerist culture. \n\nI know I'm not alone in feeling this way. My friends at /r/anticonsumption would probably largely agree. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391809263", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Does anyone actually read these laws before saying \"thanks Obama\" or some equally ignorant rhetoric? There are enough guns on this planet made before the AWB to arm every man woman and child so I think we can turn off the \"take our guns\" alarm. The industry needs more oversight, sorry libertarians, but it is simply too easy to get guns in this country and it is a major cause of the gun violence prevalent in our society. Making stricter laws doesn't take your guns away that you already own. It just makes it harder to get new ones. People gladly sign up for a government issued license to drive, registration and insurance but when those same ideas are proposed for guns everyone loses their minds and prays to Charlton Heston.

{"body": "Uh...why Cleveland, specifically? You're attending UTC; that's a 45 minute drive just from the exit + the distance of wherever you would live in Cleveland.\n\nCleveland has two nice coffeehouses: \n\n1.) Inman Street doesn't open til 2 in the afternoon - because who drinks coffee in the morning? - and, in keeping with their Salvation Army mission, is stuffed like a clown car with hobos. It's actually a nice place, but hard to find a seat when Sketchy the clown has basically set up the couch as a refugee camp. Not saying \"don't go\", just saying.\n\n2.) Bonlife is the small, swanky place on the opposite end of downtown where the \"glasses without lenses\" crowd hangs out. They really care about coffee and offer an excellent selection of whole beans that they will only serve via slow bar, which means the same thing as \"making coffee\" but costs a dollar more. Due to some ineffable formulae to which I am not privy, a breve costs $7.\n\nAs for bars, there's like one place for the 25% tax bracket and the rest are Skeeter's Hoot 'N Shoot. (I, of course, don't count AppleCharleyMcLoganBee's.) I will be the first to admit that I have probably missed a decent place somewhere; I don't get out as much as I used to because THANKS OBAMA.\n\nThe cost of living is low because so many (didn't say all) of the streets in Cleveland look like a progression of sequels for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Not saying there's nothing good, but you'll probably have to get outside of the city to find one.\n\nThe downtown is a really beautiful place on the main square and nasty on the secondaries and alleys. Packs of wild hobos shuffle slowly down the sidewalks. I swear that it feels sometimes that more houses and people are dilapidated than not.\n\nCleveland is not at all the worst place in the world to live; I've totally seen/lived in worse more than once. They try really hard. I'm just saying that if you're specifically choosing Cleveland over Chattanooga (when you have to drive to Chattanooga like every day), then it's either because you're in Tampa and don't be knowin' or because you're using a different metric than I would. Which is fine. If you're into that.\n\nSource - I live in Chattanooga, but drive a truck to make deliveries to those nasty secondaries and alleys in Cleveland every day.

{"body": "I dropped out of medical school because the school I was at was horribly corrupt and I caught them in a major lie about whether they were working on getting recognized in California and the rest of the U.S. (school was in Italy).  I left behind many friends and my girlfriend to back home to my parents where I had lost touch with many friends in the area who were off doing their own things.\n\nA few days after I get home I get into a car accident.  The driver ran a red light and plowed into my drivers side door.  No one was hurt but the cars were totaled.  I ended up having a bit of PTSD after that and had trouble driving and was plagued with thoughts of death and other existential questions for about a year.  \n\nDuring this year I, for whatever reason, was unable to get a job, even minimum wage ones like at a grocery store.  I couldn't focus enough on getting my teaching credentials and I missed a lot of deadlines because I didn't want to drive to where I had to get certain things. I also fell out of love with the idea of teaching and was directionless.\n\nLater on in the year (this all takes place in 2013) my girlfriend ends up not being able to move on to the next year in the program because a professor lost her exam results and there were no more testing dates for that class.  As a result she fell into huge depression and more or less stopped talking to me as she wanted to focus on getting more disciplined.\n\nI was isolated, alone, and directionless.  But slowly I'm crawling out of that mess of self hate, self pity, and depression.\n\nI saw a psychologist thankfully because I'm still young enough to be on my parents insurance (thanks Obama) and that helped me immensely for getting over my driving problems.  I still have slight bouts of being scared but it is much more manageable. \n\nBased on a reddit thread on what licenses/permits/certificates someone can acquire I decided that since I had no direction I would just try different things.  I started taking classes for real estate and finding myself intrigued by it so I figure I'll start pursuing that once I finish up the classes in March.  I also started to write the book I've been planning for 10 years.\n\nAs for my girlfriend, I guess she needs space so I'm giving it to her and it's good because I find myself busy with trying to figure out how to acquire all these licenses and studying that I can't worry so much about it.\n\nI'm still having some problems with depression every so often and I have trouble sleeping, but I just try to keep myself busy with new things and joining groups and hanging out with the friends still around.  Just keep yourself distracted from problems, have tangible goals, and just take things a day at a time. I know I was lucky that I had a family that understood my problems and some friends, even if they were far away, that I could talk to.\n\nAlso, sorry that this is so long, when I write, I start to ramble and since I'm not seeing a psychologist anymore this is somewhat therapeutic for me. Best of luck to everyone in life.  Life's too damn short to spend it sad.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391999405", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Not surprisingly, her latest film will be about the government’s ever-expanding secret domestic surveillance, NSA treating our nation like a foreign country for spying purposes, and the war on whistleblowers.\n\n\n\n&gt;In yet other examples, for the Espionage Act prosecution of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, the government has subpoenaed New York Times journalist James Risen three times to testify about whether Sterling was his source. The issue is on appeal in the 4th Circuit from a lower court ruling that Risen had a “qualified reporter’s privilege” not to do so. \n\n**Source:** [Obama targets journalists](http://www.salon.com/2012/04/09/journalists_casualties_in_the_war_on_whistleblowers)\n\n&gt;“This is the most closed, control freak administration I’ve ever covered,” wrote New York Times Washington correspondent David Sanger, one of the journalists interviewed for the report.\n\n&gt;At least six government employees and two contractors — including Mr. Snowden — have been subjects of felony criminal prosecutions since 2009, when Mr. Obama came to power.\n\n&gt;Other investigations are under way, and notable instances of White House press crackdowns have included Justice Department subpoenas of reporters’ phone logs and emails; the inspection of Associated Press phone records; the accusation that a Fox News reporter was an “aider, abettor and/or conspirator” of an indicted leak defendant.\n\n&gt;As a result, top journalists now say “officials are reluctant to discuss even unclassified information with them because they fear that leak investigations and government surveillance make it more difficult for reporters to protect them as sources.”\n\n**Source:** [Report: Obama Administration Most Secretive Since Nixon](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/10/report-obama-administration-most-secretive-nixon)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392239339", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

In the near future(5-10 years) it will be a lot more clear, as more states decriminalize and national opinion becomes more accepting. \n\nEssentially, state laws are moving faster than federal laws. An age old debate here is states rights, as in, whose law is the last word? State or federal? Generally, states have a lot of rights to govern themselves. The federal government will pressure states to adhere to federal law by threatening to reduce funding. The drinking age of 21 is a good example. A state could pass a law making the drinking age 18, the federal government won't give them their highway funding anymore(source needed, I could be off). \n\nAnother way to put it, if I lived in Colorado and possess pot, the local and state police will have nothing to charge me with. But a federal agent would be able to arrest and charge me. It's just not worth it for them to bother. \n\nIn the 90s, when CA legalized medical mj, you would hear stories from time to time of the Feds raiding dispensaries.

{"body": "Haha, this whole thing makes perfect sense to me!\n\nI am actually a native of Hampton Roads.  My parents are Filipino and were married in San Diego.  I was born in Portsmouth at the Naval Medical Center.  My dad spent over 20 years in the Navy, but the only time I moved was out of Navy housing in Portsmouth when I was a year old to the house I grew up in in Western Branch (in Chesapeake, which is actually closer to Portsmouth and Suffolk than it is to the rest of Chesapeake).\n\nOut of my whole family, I am the only one to join the Army (National Guard).  Even though I have over 10 years in the Army, I work full time as a Navy contractor in Norfolk (I have always pronounced it Nor’fick).  I refuse to buy an EZ-Pass for the tolls, so I commute all the way to Naval Station Norfolk via the High Rise.\n\nHOV Lanes can kiss my butt...  the Monday after the tunnel tolls came into effect, the HOV signs said open to all traffic.  I had to work at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth that Tuesday, so on Wednesday, I figured that Hampton Roads was being smart about their \"HOV\" lanes and keeping them open to the public to use to offset the increased traffic on 64 due to stubborn drivers that refuse to pay for tolls like me.  I was wrong in following a pack of singly-occupied vehicles being led by a commuter on a motorcycle into HOV lanes.  State Troopers were out in force that Wednesday.  Did any of those vehicles get tickets?  No.  Did I?  Yes.  There is a $100 fine from 6-8 AM &amp; 4-6 PM on Monday - Friday for violators.  Thanks, Obama.\n\nI have been a redditor for over a year, but I don't know too many Norfolk redditors.

{"body": "Try omeprazole (Prilosec)- you can get generic over-the-counter for cheap and it's just as effective. Lansoprazole (Prevacid) is also very good.\n\nNexium is just one enantiomer of omeprazole. Basically, the molecule can exist in two mirror-image orientations, and drug companies have found that they can get a patent on the molecule in general, and then once that expires go and get patents on the individual enantiomers. Sometimes one enantiomer works better or acts differently than the other (such as [citalopram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram)), but other times they just act like it is so that they can extend the life of their patent (see [evergreening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreening)).

I haven't gone to the doctor since I couldn't afford insurance, but due to the new government health policy I qualified for subsidized insurance with affordable payments (Thanks Obama) So i'm going to see a doctor soon.

You people seem to think \"copypastas\" are funny by definition if they're relevant, and you post them even if they're not, hoping others upvote them on sight. Let me tell you that's not how it works. For instance, the fact that you decided to use that copypasta in this situation indicates that you think: a) the situation was complex b) it has been oversimplified c) it adds nothing to the conversation. Well, you see, complexity is subjective, that's the nature of emergence. What's complex for a child like you is often trivial or routine for a scientist like me. Reddit's userbase is quite diverse, although there seems to be evidence of an over-representation of individuals exhibiting childish behaviors. Secondly, do you really think this situation has been has been oversimplified? It's through using \"copypastas\" and other hasty generalizations you try to cram each individual scenario with its particularities into a formulaic mold. I hypothesize you require this simplification because of the state of your mental faculties and reasoning skills. And lastly, most of the time your simplifications do not aid in understanding new facets of the subject matter. Characterizations that might not be 100% accurate can act as useful models for understanding overarching facets of complex inter-dependent systems, but your \"copypastas\" do not facilitate in that endeavor. If even one of these criticisms is valid, your point is moot as it depends unilaterally on all the three premises I've highlighted. The social commentary you wish \"copypastas\" to exhibit might seem sensible, maybe even profound to you, but they're just as bad, if not worse than the additions reactiongifs, pun chains or novelty accounts bring to the table. Please consider this seriously, and don't immediately fall back on your preconceived notions without reexamining their validity, at least in a cursory manner after I've presented you with this new evidence you really should take seriously.\n\nThanks Obama.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392486222", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Exactly. I can hold my own in the air, it's just not my favorite. I've always bounced around between engineer and support. I still can't understand how people bitch about engineers being OP. The lock on shit packs such a little punch. If I want send rockets down range that actually hurt then I have to stay exposed. I think that's a fair trade off. \n\nIf I'm willing to risk it by being a beacon to the  10 odd snipers, other aircraft, tanks etc.. I should be rewarded with the higher possibility of a kill. Risk little, gain little. Risk a lot, gain a lot. I agree with the MAA in the spawn in certain maps (dawn breaker is the first one that comes to mind). But once that MAA leaves spawn, it's very vulnerable to pretty much anything with a minimum amount of fire power. Plus, it's waaaay more fun leaving spawn and using it, I never understood how they could stay in one area just due to boredom. \n\nSame goes with the staff/ sabot controversy.  I could totally go apeshit on other tanks with it but if I don't have a gunner then it's only a matter of time before I'm done-zo. I could run AP/HMG and mow down infantry beautifully but I'll look stupid in most tank fights. If a tank gets the quick one two punch on me with a sabot/staff then I feel way more confident jumping ship and hitting him with the sraw as I feel fairly confident I can avoid most damage. \n\nI feel things are pretty balanced. I'm not real big on air but even I can go on a decent run wen no one wants to take the initiative and bring me down. On the other hand, I've sent out at least 5 messages to a pilot saying \"nice shot dude!\" Or something to that effect when they make me look real stupid in a tank or MAA. \n\nMaybe I just think different. I've had way more fun in the times a really good player ate my lunch and kept driving me to go more and more balls out on him/her each spawn. Some of my favorite matches were against tanks who always seemed to see me first and had infinite AP or the little birds with 2 Engi's always throwing sparks and lighting me up every 5 seconds. It made it way more satisfying to take them out and if I didn't it still made me a better player.  Fuck, sorry for the rambling...\n\n\nTl;dr- THANKS OBAMA.

{"body": "If it makes you feel better, I'm not really impressed with it. I like the game, mechs are great, wall running is great. But neither offered anything new after the first few games. Jumping from wall to wall into windows became common before the beta was even out(alpha). The mechs don't play all that differently based in video I've seen besides speed and amour, so additional mechs don't sell the game for me and neither does wall jumping. By the beta I'd already seen all the animations, physics, explosions and other things people feel are worth recording as something so cool and rare that happens 2-3 times every game. After the first couple hours *there was nothing new*. Weapons look, sound and feel good, but even in the full version (based on the Titanfall art book) there were extremely few. What is going to keep me coming back? Don't say DLC. I haven't bought DLC since the first Black Ops \n\nThe beta offers more, but the burn cards and other additions were just surface level additions that didn't change my experience. Adding creatures is a minor variable in my opinion that also won't change my attitude towards this game.\n\nIt seems so far that the multiplayer campaign is just team deathmatch and capture the flag with story elements mixed in.\n\n**Imagine if it were 2-3 teams of 6 working independently in various levels of coop, each with individual goals and missions, failure from one team meant the other two would have to change to their approach.**\n\nHell, I'd be ok with 3 teams of 4 or 4 teams of 3 if there were graphical restrictions. I'm talking real campaign missions and levels here, not multiplayer maps.\n\nOr even 6v6 where one team has to push through a real level (not a multiplayer map) while the milita is defending (or vice versa) with *real* mission objects, real story driven objectives and not something that feels like team deathmatch with story elements.\n\nUnfortunately it doesn't look like that's the case. \n\nAlso, I'm buying the game, because there's not much out that all my friends have that we can enjoy together.

You say you are twenty, so you should be covered under your parents insurance, which now has to include basic mental health care (thanks, Obama).\n\nFinally, you say he's the only person who knows about everything, and thus the only person you have to talk to about it. Please change this. Having PTSD, and the actions leading to and causing your disorder and nothing to be ashamed of. And sharing this information, will empower you. I know it will be hard, but you need to tell other people whom you trust. Your parents, grand-parents, a teacher or counselor (even one from your old high school), a trusted friend, a grandparent, or maybe a cousin. You need a safety net, not a safety string. \n\nTo finish,\n\"What should I do\" if you have a therapist, you should call them and schedule an appointment to talk this through with them. \n\n\"Did I do something wrong\" No, you didn't. \n\n\"How can I make this better\" Broaden the circle of those you can go to, to talk about your feelings from just your boyfriend to several others.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393086460", "subreddit": "ptsd", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1) Catastrophic coverage, yeah that's great for a monthly gap. But long term. It's that's not going to save costs. PREVENTIVE CARE is the best way to bring costs down. Among other things you get a yearly well-ness check. The goal is to get more people to doctors regularly than just show up with a heart attack or sage 4 cancer. \n\n2) Yeah I don't need to pay for any roads besides what I drive on to or from work either but I do. \nYou're paying for this either way numskull ( likely if you've had an employee plan at any company you've been paying for a females co-workers babies / birth control) You can (partially) pay for birth control or planned baby in a doctor office setting ( with lower costs) or you can pay for a kid  being delivered in the ER or an unplanned pregnancy. There are REAL costs savings there. I don't think you understand how the system is working / not working. This is more fiscally sound then \" fix it after the fact\".\n\n3) So you believe that someone who chooses not to have health insurance can just go to the ER and not pay? This Penalty is to prevent free-loaders. Either pay or pay. I have company health insurance and got a tax BREAK for it ( after doing my taxes).\n\nBut if you want to complain about the tax code I'm sure there's something more substantial like tax breaks on 2nd homes.\n\n4) And those underpayments are from ER visits! Because people aren't seeing doctors regularly. You can pay a little now ( Preventive Care) or a lot later ( Catastrophic / ER Bills). \n\nMedicaid &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No Insurance. How hard is that to understand? And at least someone on Medicaid wont stay broke ( leaving them on medicaid / assistance indefinitely) from medical bills. They might be able to actually get a leg-up and then BUY insurance themselves ( The overall goal).\n\n5) 1) We already have the with exchanges \" Thanks Obama\" 2) I have a HSA so pretty sure they're allowed. And you can get HSA plans on the exchanges, (along with the subsidies if you can't afford them and stay off Medicaid / Medicare)  3) Tort reform isn't a SOLUTION, it could be an improvement. 4) In 5 years we were already going to see increased costs in health care, the goal is to SLOW that growth. And enrolling people in Medicare/caid is actually saves money vs once again paying large ER catastrophic conditions ( Stage 4 Cancer, Heart Disease, Diabetes).\n\nThese all could be nice additions to the law as it plays out, but its not fix nor a replacement. The GOP still doesn't have a plan or at least enough that want a plan to happen ( beside repeal).\n\nIf this fails in 5 years, great at least we made a step forward. The status quo was not the way to go. There are many good parts of this law ( modeled after the Massachusetts Plan by Gov. Romney)  Let them play out and show what works and what doesn't. Just don't say \" it's not going to work, or I don't want it to work\" A least we have a starting point. If anything the GOP can get ahead on the next round of \"fixes\" and OWN THAT. You have to let things play out though before you can do that. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393338615", "subreddit": "Conservative", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You make some good points.\n\nYou're right, data can only move so fast through a pipe. And, with Comcast and Verizon, specifically, \"neighborhoods\" tend to share pipes, so speed is divided up dynamically between heavy users and light users.\n\nMost of my angst towards Verizon, Comcast, and any telcom, really, is that at the end of the 90s, these companies were given roughly $200 million of taxpayer money for the sole purpose of investing in their network so that it could handle \"future needs\" - which could easily be defined as House of Cards season 2 at 1080p starting when everyone gets home from work every day.\n\nInstead, the telcoms just took that money and divided it up between their shareholders. They did absolutely jack shit with it. The telcoms today have the same network they've been working on since the 90s.\n\nAnd yet, when Comcast, for example, gets public scrutiny over their shitty network, they'll swear up and down that they've \"invested in the network\" so they should be immune from criticism. Okay: For one thing, you didn't invest in the network. Not in the slightest. For another thing, even if you DID invest in the network, it wasn't YOU investing in the network, it was the taxpayers.\n\nIf that $200 million had been used for what it was supposed to be used for, we wouldn't have this problem right now. All 320 million people in the US could be streaming Netflix with no issue because we'd have a first world data network.\n\nI'm babbling on incoherently, I know. I'm just pissed at the whole situation. Because these companies are private and only beholden to their shareholders, the consumer loses - every single time.

And I wasn't a hard core democrat or anything either!\n\n  Seeing all the same people that just a year prior and throughout my childhood had called Mormon's despicable cult members, now saying they were such good Christian people (since Mitt was one).  Obama of course, who actually was a Christian more in line with the kinds of Christians they approve of,  was called a filthy stinkin Muslim. No proof of that other than fake internet hoaxey extremist type stuff of course.  \n\nThen allllll the churches in my area (TX) holding prayer circles the night of the election, all the facebook praying posts going on, etc everyone saying pray, PRAY hard!  God's will shall be done!  God will save this country!  \n\nAnd then Obama won and ho-lee crap.  Never seen a bigger collective temper tantrum thrown in my life.  And did a single one say well...we prayed with all our might, God's will has been done.  He must be testing us or trying to tell us something .  Now we must accept and try to understand it and help support the person that God the all knowing and all powerful had win the election yet again. Surely God doesn't make mistakes twice, right?!\n\n No.  Instead they said some of the most mean, ignorant, racist, hateful things I have ever heard or read.  Some even calling for his assassination, some saying that even his daughters won't be safe since it was \"time to take our country back\".   The same people that said we should just accept Bush and his war and support him whether we like it or not because he was elected and that's what true Americans do, don't you know?!\n\nSo yeah, just couldn't take the hate and hypocrisy anymore.  It finally made me throw my hands up and walk away.

{"body": "Well, I would say that \"making very little\" depends A LOT on your current responsibilities, arbitrary boundaries placed on you and where you live.\n\nNot too long ago, I was making $10/hr full time and paying my own rent as a 23 year old. It was hard but I had help. My health insurance was covered through my dad's postal plan, thanks Obama. \n\nMy car is 20 years old so it only cost $200/year to insure it. I'm an auto mechanic, so repair bills are monthly, however are next to nothing. I spend less than $50/month on my car, if anything.\n\nI don't have a smartphone. I share a plan with my parents, maybe $50/month for three phones.\n\nRent was about 45% of my income. Only because these prior financial realities existed, I COULD AFFORD to pay 45% of my income in rent to keep my full time job. In central VA, rent is pretty cheap so any full time job can cover you. \n\nAfter that, I eat PB &amp; J every. single. day. for lunch. READ, PBJ, EVERY GODDAMN DAY. Roughly $40/month for lunch. \n\nI eat a bagel with cream cheese, banana, and green tea EVERY MORNING for breakfast. Roughly $1.50 a day when you buy a dozen bagels from a bakery, supermarket bagels are are rip off.\n\nFor dinner, 3/7 nights a week it's some form of spaghetti. Either with tomato sauce, olive oil, or butter to mix it up. Buying blocks of cheese and grating it myself is a lot cheaper than pre-shredded. This cost about $5/week.\n\nFor another 3/7 nights, I eat a better, albeit more expensive dinner. Wraps are king. Tuna wraps with cheese, tomatoes, avocados, rice. Cheap. Mexi-wraps with Sofrito, beans and rice, and fruits. These cost about $10/week.\n\nFor 1/7 nights a week. I eat out. $10.\n\nSo that's how I do it.
