{"body": "Tagged as 'pro Russian propagandist'. Not surprised by the content.\n\nI do find your style of writing amusing though. You're good at what you do. The use of 'we' constantly when referring to 'the West' is a clever way making this seem like an earnest comment. The thing is: you do that in every thread about Russia which is why I tagged you.\n\n&gt;They assented and let the pro-EU guys run the country.\n\nDo I have to comment on this? It's not Russia's place to decide who runs the Ukraine. That sentence really makes me angry.\n\n&gt;Then the EU tried to make Ukraine make a choice\n\nEvil EU forcing decisions on Ukraine, check\n\n&gt;The Russians offered $15 billion\n\nAfter overcharging Ukraine for political reasons for years. In fact Ukraine was starting to import Russian gas from EU countries. That's how much Russia exploited Ukraine. The 15 billion were also completely conditional on Ukraine being at Putin's whim. Of course you mentioned none of that.\n\n&gt;including releasing the criminal Tymoshenko who is so much worse than Yanukovich ever was. \n\nYes so much worse. Except it was Putin who made the deal with her. The deal that she was pressured to sign because there was the threat of another gas cutoff from Russia. That's what she was imprisoned for. Also at least she didn't order protesters killed. But she is so much worse, we understand. Obvious propaganda is obvious.\n\n&gt;This is all the fault of the arrogance in the West.\n\nArrogance of the West, check.\n\n&gt;This would have never happened if they gave Yanukovich a better deal\n\nRussia's invasion is fault of EU, check.\n\n&gt;instead of trying to force his hand to accepting a shit deal\n\nIf by 'shit deal' you mean an association agreement that gives long-term perspective but demands harsh reforms. Check for the misrepresentation.\n\n&gt;Would have never happened if the US wasn't interfering and encouraging the protestors.\n\nAmerica's fault that Ukrainians protest against shitty leaders, check. Thanks Obama.\n\n&gt;we shouldn't have recognised the coup and call it a revolution\n\nEvery revolution is a coup. That's the point of a revolution.\n\n&gt;If we don't respect democratic instituions\n\nThe protestors didn't behead Yanukovich. He let people be killed, fled, and then his own party realised the situation was lost and bowed to the pressure. That's when the parliament sacked him, which is the right of the parliament btw.\n\n&gt;interfere in other countries just to get the outcome we want. Why should Russia do so?\n\nExcept one side sent foreign ministers to negotiate a deal between government and opposition while the other side sent thousands of soldiers to illegally occupy parts of this country.

{"body": "Below is a translation of the article. In the foreword I would like to add, that kresy.pl (~this means something like \"borderlands\") is not a very reliable source; it is a right wing revisionist website; some connect them with people who would like to get parts of Ukraine/Belarus back, what is debatable.\nOn the polish equivalent of reddit / digg (called www.wykop.pl ) in general any articles from kresy.pl get downvoted to oblivion, but a lot of spammers are working to make this site popular and they even managed to get it on reddit. Also this exact article is not that bad (if you read the translation below), they just try to verify some rumors.\n\n**Anyway the translated article, my comments are in [brackets].**\n\n\nRegroupping of Polish army, due to the Ukrainian crysis? [note the question mark in the title]\n\n\"Yesterday I saw two columns of armored personnel carriers, one went from Kostrzyn near Odra towards Skwierzyny, another one - from the photo - went towards Gorzow\" wrote to kresy.pl our fan Bogdan Gonta. He also attached a photo.\n\n[photo showes few personnel carriers, or whatever is the exact name in English]\n\nAdministrator of a portal called polskiepiekielko.pl [never heard of this website] wrote on their facebook page:\n\n\"On Friday, while going the A1 highway from Katowice to Wrocław I passed columns of military trucks going east. Now the todays picture made in Słupsk:\n\n[picture shows trucks and a jeep transported by rail on the Słupsk train station]\n\nI have sent a question to Polish Ministry of Defense (MON) asking if the Polish Military is preparing somehow for eventual war in Ukraine. I received the foloiwing answer:\n\n\"The role of Ministry of Defense (MON) is not to comment on social changes partaking in other countries, in the current situation, answering such questions that suggest a possibility of civil war in Ukraine is pure speculation. However, we would like to assure you that the Polish Military is realizing the tasks for which it is obliged by law\".\n\n***\n\nPortal NaTemat.pl [pretty controversial portal, mostly political debates] has contacted the General Headquarters. Colonel Tomasz Szulejko calms down everyone who are scared by the regrouping of the military.\n\n\"This absolutely has nothing to do with the situation in Ukraine. Assumption that the recent actions of Polish Army could have anything to do with the recent situations is absolutely unjustified\" - tells the spokesperson of Border Guards [please note, as far as I know the Border Guard has nothing to with the military - it is a separate organization, more like the Police, controlled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, not Ministry of Defense, so the article seems to be a bit inconsistant, or I dont understand something here]\n\n\"The Polish soldiers excercise all the time. They improve their skills on training grounds according to their training schedule and earlier prepared tasks. We do not have any situation here that could be connected with the situation in Ukraine - assures colonel Szulejko.\n\n**The article ends here, but 2 random comments:**\n\n[1st comment under the article]\nWhat army regrouping? In general we dont have an army.\n[which is sort of true, since general conscription has ended and getting a gun in Poland is really really hard, the country is left only with professional soldiers]\n\n[2nd comment]\nThe column showed on the picture is probably moving towards the Drawsk military grounds and has nothing to do with any regrouping.\n\n**comments end here, please note that there is a LOT of discussion on most polish portals, e.g. www.wykop.pl which is like the Polish digg, below some comments by me:**\n\n[here are some more comments by me, not from the article:\nIn general it makes sense to regroup your army when a civil war might happen in another country, since a lot of refugees might try to flood your borders. Also the general role of the army is to defend the country, so they should regroup and it would even be strange if they did NOT regroup, although they dont have to that much, because the general danger can rather come from Russia, not Czech or Germany, so you are a bit prepared.\nWar will not benefit anyone including Russia, they will probably simply try to occupy the Russian-speaking part of the Ukraine. Ukraine is basically bankrupt anyway (especially the western part), so the country can sort of split in two. Russia could crush everyone with atomic weapons, but they are SANE people and they wont do it. A conventional war - impossible; since it's not worth it for anyone.\nBoth Russian and NATO conventional armies are weak.\nPolish people believe that NATO would not help us anyway, since they are a bunch of traitors.\nObama is considered much weaker than Putin when it comes to mind games (it has nothing to do with internal politics / thanks Obama etc.; e.g. Bush was considered an idiot, but not a pushover).\nLatvia is probably very scared, because they have a big Russian speaking population [someone put a potato joke here somewhere]\nOn the other hand it is also believed that Poland will always be safe, because it is too connected economically with Germany.\nPeople are worried that Russians might stop sending gas to Poland / Eastern Europe, what would hurt the economy, but well.. this would also hurt the Russians.]", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393803410", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Are you saying that institutional discrimination and the unconscious sexism of powerful people keeps you from making friends?\n\nYes, though I would have personally phrased it all as “I am saying that institutional discrimination and the unconscious sexism of a large percentage of the population causes making and keeping friends to be uniquely difficult for men.”  The phrase “powerful people” is confusing me a little bit. Do you mean powerful types of people like white people, politicians, wealthy people, people with huge media influence, etc.; or do you mean more like specific persons like a specific judge, president, or CEO? If I had to start drawing circles around specific famous, influential people this comment could become some kind of weird “Bromance is hard; Thanks, Obama.” Anyway, I think the persons of influence who might make things more difficult for men are just following common social memes, and the damages done are usually done in ignorance rather than malice (just like the people who make things more difficult for women.)\n\n&gt;?!?!!!?\n\nWell, before you get too shocked and incredulous about how crazy I am, keep in mind that this dialogue began with an article written by a sociologist who up and said that men base huge portions of their psychology and psychological expression on femmephobia and that it was *the* cause of het-white-male friendlessness.  No “studies show,”  no “it has been theorized,” no “my personal opinion,” and no “at least one cause.”  Is the internet not an institution? The blog-o-sphere?  How about Salon? I can understand if you say no to all three of those things but how about the institution of higher learning? Because Lisa Wade is a profressor, which means that she pushes all that in the name of science under the authority she wields at an accredited college.  I think this kind of bad psychology, advancing notions that men operate primarily or solely out of a fear/hatred/or loathing of women that they instill in themselves, is very detrimental to men’s ability to make friends (among other things.)  \n\nFrom an institutional perspective here are some other things that *may* adversely affect efforts at male bonding-\n\n* Men’s absence from primary/elementary school education and men’s absence from the more hands on and intimate forms of physical and mental healthcare like nursing and therapy.  A lack of nurturing, empathetic male role models who are unrelated to you probably isn’t good for friendship.\n\n* The competitive, violent, or competitive and violent tones of masculine employment (i.e. the business, political, sports, and military institutions) and entertainment.   Prioritizing competition  and victory probably isn’t good for friendship.\n\n* The implicit messages of medically and governmentally approved circumcision that cast the male body as mutable to the whims of people apart from the man who possesses it.   You need to feel empathized for to give empathy; a lack of empathy probably isn’t good for friendship.\n\n* Sentence disparity in the judicial system that reinforces the idea that the negative actions of men are worse than the equivalent negative action made by a woman.  Feeling that a misstep or bad approach from you is extra insidious and villainous is probably bad for initiating friendships.\n\n* The primacy of motherhood in many institutions that casts fatherhood as secondary. Feeling that your love is worth less than the love of a different type of person is probably bad for friendship.\nThose are some of the institutional forms of discrimination that all dip their hands into the till of many men’s psyches, and they probably play some parts in a lot of the problems men face, including friendlessness.   \n\nEDIT: I came across as too bold. So I went italic.\n\nEDIT 2: Misidentified Ms. Wade as sociologist. She is a professor of sociology.

{"body": "I agree completely.  Instead of further politicizing legal gay marriage by forcing the issue himself, Obama's letting the Courts, which are generally respected as less partisan, decide on the basis of constitutionality.  We hate divisive partisan politics, but we love the Constitution -- a Court decision in favor of gay marriage conveys as more legitimate than a flex of political muscle would.  In the mean time, the states overwhelmingly continue to vote to legalize same sex marriage.  17 states have made same-sex marriage legal as opposed to 4 states that have made it illegal.  Those states with legal gay marriage represent 38% of the US population, and those that have illegalized same sex marriage represent only 13% by comparison.  Not preempting the development of legal same sex marriage at the state level allows the American populus to see and acknowledge the level of support gay marriage has from the general electorate. This also serves to disarm small-government types who believe in handling politics on the state level anyways.  It seems to me that Obama's letting gay marriage succeed organically by dissociating himself.

We've been having water restrictions here in Australia. \n\nYes, it is most definitely a habit now. It is something I look forward to every morning (that and my coffee :P). \n\nYes, I think it would feel odd if a day went by without it now. I've actually had a few days now where I wouldn't have time to get my meditation sitting in during the morning and would find myself feeling \"odd\" during the day, then realising I haven't meditated and I would actually get the urge to meditate!\n\nI would say I own the habit in the sense that I now see it as part of my day to day life. I've started reading some books on meditation at the moment and recently put in a significantly large investment (for my budget) into a set of meditation cusions (cosmic cushion + Zabuton). Had to import the cosmic cushion from America to Australia (true blue aussie right here) and the shipping ended up tripling the cost of the pillow (Thanks Obama). \n\nThankyou for the kind words. Although it feels nice to see the 'H' flair next to my name, the byproducts of the meditation and growth in willpower is even better :) \n\nEDIT: In terms of meditation helping my willpower with other areas of my life the simple answer is a definite yes. I'm following a strict diet at the moment and when I find myself reaching for something not on the diet my internal dialogue has shifted from \"MUST EAT NOW!\" to \"Hey bro, that's not on your diet list, look for something else\" or even \"Hey bro, you're not *really* hungry now, drink a glass of water instead\" which is a great change.\n\nAlso I find myself more motivated in general with my other habit cards, in particular I find it useful with my sleep card as I use a sleeping meditation app to help me get to sleep which involves doing a body scan of different body parts from toe to head.

{"body": "We can't tell you exactly what your insurance will cover, as it's usually a deal between your company and your employer.  Generally, it's everything (checkups, surgery, specialists, counseling, etc...) that's not \"hippie naturalistic medicine\", and generally not experimental (unless it's the only option) or hearing.\n\nIf you have the option of choosing what type (HMO, PPO, etc...) almost ALWAYS choose PPO.  They tend to be cheaper and better with services.  Your HR/Benefits people are there so you can navigate this stuff easier.  Trust me, it's confusing at first, but once you see it laid out, it's actually not bad.  The cost to you per month *could* actually be cheaper than your NHS tax in England.  I was talking to someone recently from Canada who paid $175/mo. for their family to their National system, but I paid $145/mo. for my family through my employer and had similar coverage.  My insurance is really good though, so I'm a rare case.\n\nUse a FSA (flexible spending account) if you want. The max you can put in is $2500 (federal limit, down from $5000... thanks Obama), but it's pre-tax.  Use that towards your deductible, or forgo dental insurance and use it for that.  But if you can, save up your deductible+some for extra care, do that instead and put it into a money market or something and ONLY touch it WHEN you need it (this is what we do, it's post-tax, but we earn a piddly interest on it, but never expires).  FSA's expire at the end of a year, so you can lose that money.  People near the end of their FSA expiry for the year used to go out and get new glasses, vitamins, over the counter stuff they will need in the future.\n\nDental insurance *can* almost always be a rip off, but do the math.  For my wife and I, we pay $14/mo. through my employer for it, and it covers everything.  Checkups are around $150 (we pay $0) every six months for each of us, so it pays off.  For most people, dental insurance could be $50/mo.  so it's not really worth it in that case (as long as you take care of your teeth).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394199667", "subreddit": "AskAnAmerican", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

When I say physical rape, I mean using strength to completely overwhelm/force someone to have sex.\n\nPeople will coherece, get people drunk, drug them, lock the room and corner them WHICH IS PHYSCOLOGICAL TORTURE etc etc etc. Some people can't say no, lock up. Well they say no, but they lock up, and can't move. People take that as \"OH THEY ARE SAYING NO BUT NOT RESISTING ME.\" yeah... Sorry I was molested when I was 11 dickhead and have visions flash when another guy touches my dick.\n\nMyself, open relationship and i'm \"bi\" though my past ruined any enjoyment i'll get with men. Women? Fine, but they can make me feel insecure but that's about it. Love the wife, love the GF. But men? Well...\n\nStory time...\n\nSo i'm feeling particularly lonely. Bisexual people will understand what I mean when I say that before someone mentions wife, she was also working 7 days so... Well, lonely, stress etc etc etc... Decided to meet someone.\n\nBecause of what happened... I like to be fully clothed, suck someone off, bottom from behind on my own terms lights off. Don't touch me. Don't rub me. Maybe touch my back, that's about fucking it. Well guy kept asking to see my dick, guy kept trying to reach in pants... Kept repeating it made me uncomfortable...\n\nOH COME ONNNN WHY NOTTTTT LET ME SEEE IT.\n\nNo... I'll leave just stop.\n\n5 to 10 minutes starts again. Annoyed. Finally just pull pants down, waggle it go \"There, also won't get hard for guys sorry to dissapoint\" then went to put pants back up, kinda pushes me over and holds me down a little saying he'd make it hard. Tried to push him off me, once he grabbed/touched it complete freakout/body freezes lay there while someone just does stuff... Relive some nice memories. Worst part was it caused huge fight between me and the wife, she was working 16 hour days(7 days on, 7 off) and this happened 2 days in. So... I never told her. Didn't want her to worry about me but she noticed I was unstable/not talking/sleeping all day but she was at work only seen bits and pieces. Big fight on days off, tell her which made her feel like a monster and wanted to go bash his head in. Hey I care about her, no reason to burden her on working days my emotions can wait. I was getting really upset cause afterwards and the initial shock and 4 showers I just wanted to be held and comforted last week... She works 16 hour days, she was not in mood. Didn't want to trouble her, but she made big deal about me getting close like \"I GOTTA WORK IN 6 HOURS NO\" for 4 days. Then when I let her know... I feel more like an ass cause she feels like a bitch because all I wanted was comfort but was thinking about her feelings and not wanting to inconvenience her even though should of said right away. Didn't want her to call off like 2 days like she would have worrying. Worst part is saying \"Yeah... had fun send me your number ill add you and we can be friends...\" Log into app to see 10 notifications for why I didn't text him yet.\n\nSo... That's why I never did anything with guys for 3 years, and will never do anything with guys again.\n\nThanks obama.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394279984", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

It does not excuse the action, I vehemently disagree with the concept,of a government spying on its own people en masse. ( thanks Obama ).  It is also specifically a violation of our 4th amendment.  The Obama  justice department side stepped the 4th by providing a single wiretap warrant for the entire country and had it rubber stamped by the FISA court.\n\nSecond, the intentions of the people behind the law ( even Obama ) are good.  Their actions are misplaced.  A government cannot have this much power without accountability, it will be abused.\n\nAs far as Snowden, I believe at best he was well meaning but naive and I question the sincerity of his claim to be saving us from tyranny while at the same time threatening to release legitimate intelligence information if he is arrested.  Information that would do the entire country great harm.  While I appreciate knowing my 4th amendment rights are being trampled, Snowdens actions have raised enough doubt that all scenarios must be considered.\n\nIf his problem was the internal spying ( my problem too ) he should not have taken the entire NSA archive, on the other hand, if he had help from a foreign agency, he delivers the goods, and they throw out the 4th amendment violations as chaffe.

{"body": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlrigth lets gather if  you give a fuck. But if you are self employed or private insurance you should sit your ass down and read if you haven't done so already. \n\nObama care was a huge milestone policy potentially as large as the social security act but lets not go into there until we discuss its immediate effects.  First and foremost it is now LAW  to have health insurance, don't be surprised this is widely practiced and it is crucial to tip the balance in insurance companies that will shell out a shit ton of money for you later one explained.  But essentially by insuring around 30m people you are creating a lot of demmand for health care. But this is actually somewhat of a tradeoff really. Because these people will now be insured under certain standards that are actually very convenient for individuals. The plan is that these standards will eventually transfer to the rest of the country. One  **MAJOR** change was the abolition of pre-existing conditions rights to deny service. So if you had something that prevented you from getting coverage, who cares! now nobody can deny you anymore.\n\nNow what is this that we are talking about? By default all insurance plans will cover all of the folowing and more to a reasonable degree: \n\n1.Ambulatory patient services (outpatient care you get without being \nadmitted to a hospital)\n\n2.Emergency services\n\n\n3.Hospitalization (such as surgery)\n\n\n4.Maternity and newborn care (care before and after your baby is born)\nPrescription drugs\n\nSourc: https://www.healthcare.gov/what-does-marketplace-health-insurance-cover/\n\nGoing back to the previous question; how does Affordable Care Act (ACA) affects you? well at first sight. If you didn't have ihnsurance, and now you do, congratulations! you are less likely to bankrupt as medical bills were the leading cause. If you did have insurance, then congratulations! your countries poverty level will be reduced at some degree.\n\n\nIndividually, this bill does 2 things, hopefully it will spark people into supporting further democratization of the healthcare system (first if not second most lobbied political sector). If Americans wanted, they could keep expanding  this bill and hopefully bring order to the shitclusterfuck their healthcare is and pay less for greater benefits, raise health standards etc. \n\nBut now this bill affects non insured the most.  Not only you are obligated by the tax code to Have  health insurance. But also you are recommended to spend a lot of time understanding it and getting a plan that fits you better. Seriously, put a generous amount of time learning what is a deductible, what is a copayment, what plans may offer you services you need. Do you spend on diabetes treatment? Which insurance company offer coverage with the doctors you like. What is HMO, what is PPO? \n\nDemocrats are really clenching their buts hoping people will understand these things, because once you do, you realize how badly people with private insurance were getting ripped. How badly this country was without any kind of change in the health care industry.\n\n\nAnyway, back at how this affects you. The bill... The bill for all of this is of course backed with tax payer dollars and money injected from this huge influx of demand the government created by requiring people to sign in as mentioned above. So ACA is bad for the budget but not nearly as bad as other things like the toxic current standards of medical billing which in turn the bill looks to regulate in the far future.\n\nLastly. What is the most juicy part of the bill: If you don't have insurance, if you earn from $11,500 to (a lot of money), and also depending on the number of dependents, you can get a sweet sweet insurance plan for a low cost. The way it works is that when you do your application you enter some of the data you used in your income tax, and your monthly bill is calculated by granting you a big tax deduction often &gt; 50%...\n\nSo you can pay $100 for an insurance for two which normally would cost $460... Why because there is so many people signing in.\n\nWhy are they doing all of this? Because it is good for you. Plans are understandable, they range very fairly from catastrophic coverage (cheap high deductible, low risk users) to platinum (low deductible high risk users that need lots of specialist and constant care). And they all come in a balance gamut for each individual.\n\nThe government knows this is bad for them, Obama knows this trashed his approval rate. But this really... really is good for you so check it up if you haven't. Why do I say this? and how does it affect you? Well the government without a doubt expanded, took a hit in the budget/debt, attacked a rather lucrative private sector (which affects returns in taxes) and generally did what wasn't lucrative. There is a reason conservatives can't hold their panties. But IMO this is something that had to happen. Health standards for this country are pathetic and people deserve more from their politicians. I have a feeling that just like people hated the social security act, people will grow into the ACA when it becomes standard. People will defend it like they defend SSN, people will know what is better for them with time.

{"body": "\"Democracy mode is now engaged.\"\n\nPraise the Dome! Democracy! It was slow, but it worked. I typed, \"Pass continuing resolution.\"\n\nWe needed to pass the continuing resolution bill to keep non-essential government programs open. That was voted the current objective in the /r/TwitchRunsUSA Live update document, so it looked like most of us were on the same page.\n\n\"Democracy\" was the top voted option this 20 seconds. Damn Lag. Twitch really needs to get better equipment, we are the collective voice of a free nation! I typed \"Wait.\"\n\nThe scary part is, that even though most of us wanted to pass the continuing resolutions bill, when things switched to democracy people would always get upset. A million voices at once would shout into their keyboard \"Anarchy!\" just to make things get going faster.\n\nThe problem with Anarchy mode is that anything can happen. There is no command queue, so the crazies won't always get their say, they have to be the lucky individual whose comment was typed in chat at the precise time. But every once in a while, something like, \"Congress proposes bill to iniatie nuclear war on Canada\" gets through, and then when going through the votes it somehow passes, it gets really scary. Fortunately, we switched to Democracy in time to vote to veto it when it hit the presidents desk. \n\nAnarchy mode has all sorts of hiccups like that. Like when some idiot typed, \"Ted Cruz filibuster\" at the perfect time to try stopping Obamacare... What the hell Twitch? We sat through 21 hours of that. \n\nA bunch of idiots typed \"Wait9\" and it passed. I guess they were trying to beat the lag.\n \"We only need to type \"Wait\" once to beat the Lag guys!\" I typed in chat, but it instantly scrolled out of view.\n\nThis is cutting it a little too close for my tastes. We have to pass the continuing resolutions or we risk government shutdown.\n\nI would always prefer democracy. Truly, the old system was better. The one where we voted for representatives and they voted on our behalf, it just worked better. The 113th congress, the Twitch controlled one, has passed fewer bills than any congress in history, and has a 15% approval rating. And most of those bills were meaningless ones accidentally passed in \"Anarchy mode\"... The only good thing about it was that it really got our youth in Congress. More people were voting than ever before!\n\nAfter waiting some time, on the eve of shutdown, we finally got together and voted on what Congress should do.\n\nYes on continuing resolutions.   39,903,122\nAnarchy                                23,004,996\nThanks Obama                         6,055,607\nStart9                                    3,045,298\n[Collective others]                  59,912,334\n\nYes! We passed it. There will be no government shutdown in 2013! The people have spoken! Whoo-hooo! A small, yet vital win.\n\nDemocracy. As they say, it's a terrible system, but it's the best we have.\n \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394868746", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh man, I wish I had longer to talk to you about this - DO IT NOW. Do it, do it, do it, do it. I put my entire life on hold to do it and I do not regret it one bit. My 'three months' turned into A FULL YEAR - and guess what? I do not regret it one bit. I had good insurance, thru my parent's even being 26 (thanks Obama seriously!)... I am now HCV-. I was in the similar situation, do it now or wait because of the insurance. Do it now! I went to the Mayo Clinic and had literally the most top notch care I could imagine. United Healthcare, with a couple of blips here and there (including one big one, but we can talk about that later), paid for everything after we met my deductible. \n\nThe sickness/weakness is NOTHING like IV heroin wd. NOTHING. I was weak, yes. I had some rashes. I felt overwhelmed, I cried a lot. Some hair fell out. It was no where near the mindfuck of wd, though. What helped me was talking thru my experience with ANYONE who wanted to know or had time to listen. \n\nPlease do it now, insurance is a godsend... I'm not religious, but that's the word. You need that insurance your mom has been paying for FOR YOU - do it for her if you're not willing to do it for yourself. I repeat, DO IT! \n\nEven in it's worst moments, here I am over a year later and I don't regret it one bit. I did my entire treatment on a very low does of Suboxone (like, .5MG daily low). If you do relapse, because of the 'sickness' or whatever (please try to not think of the side effects of HCV treatment as such, cuz it's so different, please!) than you can always get on a VERY low dose of Bupe to finish the treatment. THAT IS HOW IMPORTANT THIS TREATMENT IS. Catch it early, treat it young, you can can walk away from this. PM me anytime, seriously, I have been where you are and I know the choice, while seemingly obvious to others, is not an easy one. \n\nedit* to give you some more insight as to how I felt after the weekly injections -- I'd get a manageable fever, sometimes for a couple days, feel nausea (I smoke pot, not sure your situation, but I believe it helped), and generally just not want to get out of bed because I seriously couldn't.... BUT IT WAS NOTHING, I REPEAT NOTHING...NOTHING.... like heroin wd. Aside from having a general lack of energy, and feeling in general kind of weird (I'd get a spacey, swimming-like headspace going on)... You have to remind yourself that you are badass and literally curing something that most of the world still views as impossible and fatal. You can totally do it. You gotta at least try! Before I did my treatment I was a semi-professional dancer and instructor... I lost almost all my muscle mass being weak and occasionally bedridden while I did this - I still do not regret it and I know I did the right thing. I'm passing a year and a half (finished December 2012) and I have gained back a bunch of weight but am finally starting to lose it (the right way) and get my muscles back.

{"body": "Her Majesty's Government (HMG) is a lot less complex, as are most Parliamentary systems. Because of the speed by which early US colonists were subjected to taxes by the Parliament, the US Government is almost designed specifically to ensure things take a long time to change and to insulate each layer of government further from the people directly. House members are once ever 2 years, Senate is 1/3 of the Senate every 6 years (and used to be by State Legislature only), President is once every 4 years by Electoral College (and also used to be by State Legislature only), and Supreme Court Justice is by Presidential appointment/Senate confirmation. \n\nYou also astutely pointed out how the complexity of the US Government makes it hard to trace who's responsible for what. Everyone says \"thanks Obama\" for everything, when most of the time that's stuff that comes from Congress. Congressional incumbency is protected because the President is both the Head of State AND Head of Government. \n\nMembers of Parliament don't have that nice of a buffer, especially the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is the Head of Government only (Head of State is Her Majesty), but he is also the Leader of his/her party AND has to be an elected Member of Parliament as well. And since almost all the major lawmaking powers are concentrated in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister is almost always directly responsible for whatever laws are passed. It's much harder to hide from political missteps and unpopular policy in a Parliamentary system, so there's added risk for them to stick their necks out. \n\nEDIT: To put the UK Government in US government terms: imagine if the President was not an elected position, but rather a hereditary position - so we would have a President from the Washington family or some other former presidential family still in office. The President does not have any true political power (not even to sign bills), but simply acts as the Head of State in diplomacy. The Senate also doesn't have the ability to truly block legislation, only to delay it. All major political and governmental power is concentrated in the Speaker of the House, who presides over the House of Representatives and is the leader of the majority party in that chamber. I'm simplifying this substantially, but that's generally what the UK structure is like. UK folks, feel free to chime in.

I'm left with about 1k a month for anything else I want to do. And THAT goes into savings because the moment I get into an accident with one of the millions of illegals driving around without insurance, even with health insurance, I'm still going to shit out 10k+ in medical bills. \n\nAnd that's earning 90k a fucking year. I'm not living exorbidantly, california just taxes the living SHIT out of us to pay for all of these people that use the handouts but don't contribute a damn dime. If Obamacare did anything OTHER than drive costs, and health insurance company profits, up, maybe it'd be different. But right now? All I see is that not only did my taxes go up, yet again, so did my premiums and down went my coverage. \n\nThanks Obama. \n\nNow gimme a single payer system where everyone gets a % of their income instead of double dipping on tax increases AND redirecting funds to private companies, with mandatory caps on the costs of medical care? Then we might get somewhere with reducing costs and taxes. Obamacare's just corporate welfare, same as the republicans and the military industries.

The UK and Australia and no doubt, the european union.

All the mines, all the oil, even all the bananas.  fucking everything.  \n\nI'm pretty sure that everything shitty in this world can be traced back to CIA involvement.  Drug problem?  CIA  Middle east problem?  CIA  Stupid pointless wars and fascists killers leading 3rd world countries?  CIA.  All in the name of making money.  The \"enemy\" is either communists or terrorists.  They live in violent countries we created.  We create sanctions against them and then, when they don't thrive, we blame communism.  Cuba is shit because we won't trade with them.  JFK tried to trade with them, but he died. JFK tried to stop the Cold War and wanted to dismantle the CIA and they probably killed him.\n\nEverything shitty in this world was caused by capitalism.

Tax rate in highest bracket ($200k+ / $2.3M adjusted to 2011) was 91%. First bracket for personal taxes today is 10%, and last bracket is 39.6%, at $396k adjusted to 2011.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#History_of_top_rates\n\nCorporate tax rates ranged from 20% to 53% in this time frame, and effective tax rate was almost 50% in 1964. Current effective tax rate for corporations is about 18%. http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/02corate.pdf ---\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Effective_Corporate_Tax_Rate_1947-2011_v2.jpg\n\n* Corporate responsibility by revocation or consenting dismissal of separate legal personality\n\nThis is where a corporation has human rights/privileges/qualities such as: capability to sue, to be sued, to enter contracts, to own liability, to have legal responsibilities, protections, rights to ownership, etc. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_legal_personality\n\nIt seems like a good thing, cause you can sue the corporation and it can be liable for damages it causes, but it's really actually very bad. If the lawsuits for shitty brakes in a car company is estimated to cost 10million, but a recall will cost 20million, then the corporation lets the accidents happen, pays out the lawsuits, and calls it a day. Since no human is responsible, nobody goes to jail. Furthermore, you can be sued by a corporation; this is an entity that is demanding payment from you, but there is no specific person to compensate, leading to weird things like getting sued by a corporation for using art work unlicensed (okay, that's fine to be sued for that), even though the original artist was the one that gave you the copies. Or a band being sued for playing songs on a previous record label (ask John Fogerty / CCR about this).\n\nAlso http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_law_in_the_United_States#History is a worthy read on this subject.\n\nSo I guess that what I'd really like to see trend is that governments start protecting and serving people again.

{"body": "Alas, no. But I did some research and stole some ideas from other people online and came up with a few myself. It's not many, but here are the ones I added to my deck.\n\n* Discard your entire hands and draw 20 new cards. Do not draw a white card again until you are down to 9 cards\n* Every player selects one card from their hand to be put in a pile, the pile is then shuffled and redistributed.\n* Discard a black card immediately \n* Read all the white card submissions in the next round in an accent of your choosing (bonus points is you match the accent to the theme of the card)\n* Pick a white card from the pile. You have 90 seconds to get any player to guess the card. You may say 1 word, so long as it’s no on the white card. Win this card if you’re successful, but if not, lose one black card. \n* You are not allowed to draw a white card until you have played all the ones currently in your hand. \n* Team up! For the next black card choose a Pick 2, then the players and their partner each choose one blank to fill without collaborating \n* Stand up and do a dance! If the group deems your dance worthy, win this card.\n* SWEET REVENGE! Choose a player and steal one of their black cards. \n* Play a single rotation in nothing but whispers. Not whispering results in the loss of a black card.\n* Play a single rotation without any laughter. Laughing results in the loss of a black card.\n* Think you should have won a certain round? If you won second best in any round keep this card as a consolation prize. \nFor the next black card, every player will be allowed two submissions\n* Democracy! The card Czar is allowed to play in the next round, the winner is chosen by vote\n* Blank slate: every player draws 10 black cards. The car Czar draws a white card and picks the black card that best fits. The winner rets both black cards. The remaining black cards are reshuffled into the deck. \n* There’s no such thing as bad cards, only bad players: Trade hands with the worst player in the game.\n* Just drew a card that would have been perfect for that round? This card is a coupon to submit two cards without betting. \nHold on to this card. The next time you are stumped, shuffle through the whole pile until you find a card to play. \n* Discard all your white cards except the one you think is best. Draw 9 more white cards. \n* Choose a white card from the pile – don’t look at it! – stick that card to your forehead and play 20 questions with the group until you can guess what it is. \n* Size matters: choose the card in your hand with the most writing, slap it on the table and measure it against the cards of your peers. The longest card wins. \n* Naiveté: everyone examines their hand, if there is a card they don’t know the meaning of, they put it in the middle. The group decides which card is most common knowledge, the person who submitted that card is publicly shamed. \n* Everyone examines their hand. If there are cards that you have experienced personally, submit them to the center pile, the cards are read aloud, but guesses about who submitted which card are left unasked. \n* Affirmative action: the most marginalized person wins this card (ie: the person who is not a straight, white, middle class, Christian, male) (Tie: respect your elders! They are closer to those who had to fight for the rights you take for granted!)\n* The card Czar makes a new question. (crowd sourcing optional) \n* Mother boy: whoever is able to tell the best story of over-parenting can trade as many white cards as they want in the next round. \n* Threesome! This round, use two black prompts. Players must try to match a white card to both at the same time.\n* Wife swap: everyone chooses three cards to trade with the person across from them.\n* Nose goes! The past person to submit a card for the next round won't be counted as a submission\n* Doldrums: all players discard and redraw between 0-10 new cards. Current card Czar plays the next black card. \n* Troubled childhood: everyone chooses the saddest card in their hand. The winner is voted upon. Ties will be settled by the best ‘dad yelling at mom’ impression. \n* Thanks Obama! The socialist wealth redistribution. Everyone shuffles their hand into a big pile then is dealt 10 cards back. Draw another black card and keep playing. \n* Spelling Bee: everyone chooses a card from their hand that has a hard-to-spell word. The person who can correctly spell the most words wins. \n* Sunday school. Card which is most religiously appalling wins. Tie: whoever knows the most bible verses wins. \n* Don’t mess it up: add a black card to the pot. The winner of the next round wins both. \n* Pictionary: everyone draws a white card from the pile, then they go around in a circle and draw what is on their card.

{"body": "Insurance agent here. I also date a dental school dropout. I can't speak too much about why you need a separate doctor for your teeth but I can tell you why you need different insurance. Insurance is nothing more than a contract. You the consumer pay your premiums and most years, you lose. Unless of course something catastrophic happens. That's where the gamble is. When insurance companies lose, they lose big. I'm talking over a million dollars big in some claims. But that's with health insurance. The human body is complicated, and age and other factors complicate things even more. Your teeth are not as complicated from an insurance standpoint. You don't often rack up millions at the dentist. Most people just want a couple of free cleanings and maybe some help paying for some expensive work if and when they need it. There isn't as big of a difference between a 20 year old's teeth and a 40 year old's teeth as say the difference between their hearts or lungs. Insurance companies take this into consideration thus dental insurance premiums are much much lower than health insurance premiums. Especially now since the advent of the PPACA. Thanks Obama!

It helps that Im obsessed with Harmontown.\n\nWill update as things go on.\n\n\n\n#EDIT 1:\n\n- Awwww Dan's affection for Donald is still at large here. That awesome Donald scene Dan set up seemed amazing in my head.\n\n- This is the most I've heard McKenna talk. I enjoy it very much, Chris.\n\n- Wow, Dan and Chris are real life Troy and Abed.\n\n- AH SHIT, SEARCH FOR SPOCK-ESQUE MOVIE FOR TROY?

Donaldness.\" - Dan Harmon, 2014\n\n- Gillian's facial expressions are means for gif-ing.\n\n- Gillian Britta'd the payday rap\n\n- ...but she nailed the \"chang-sturbation\" move.\n\n- Dan just TORE into Big Bang Theory... DAMN.\n\n- \"Joel McHale, Danny Pudi and the Isle of Amazons!\"\n\n- I want to animate his ENTIRE Harvey Hollywood bit.\n\n- Abed and Shirley making out more in the near future?

Jeff episode preview would be like. For the fans! (The animation on my end'll suck, don't worry.)\n\n- On the plus side, I really kinda wanna check out Veep now. Is Elaine ever gonna get a good show? Is this one it? I mean, Buster Bluth and Joshua the racist trampoline protector are here so the possibilities of it being a hit are endless. This still image is deteriorating my brain...\n\n- So the preview was a PSA? maybe? anyway, the link here confirms it (courtesy of /u/goldenstate5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2N8wLKC7bw&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\n- I've been staring at this photo of the cast of Veep for so long I'm pretty sure that they want to kill me.\n\n#FINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nOverall, I'd say that was a good panel.

Do you realise that you are essentially just telling me they are bad because freedom? If you think so, that's alright. I'll just point you to the extensive economic literature on positive externalities and leave you with that. Maybe also a big book on philosophy before you -again - start spouting your propaganda about how maximum individual freedom in legislature always leads to maximal individual freedom in practise.\n\nTo make this clear to you, again: we actively vote to have social security. But, of course, we are just drones incapable of critical reasoning, unlike a brave son of liberty as you are. Of course we would vote for such things.\n\n&gt;They are also the root cause of the Ukraine's problems just to give one example. \n\nWould you care to elaborate? How exactly lies social security at the heart of the Ukranian crisis, and not, say, energy dependence, disatisfaction with the government and overall political system, plus a weak military/diplomatic position?\n\n&gt;Austerity? God, NOOOO! Wait, the only alternative is to suck harder on the neighbor's dictatorial teet? We don't want that either!\n\nWho in the EU is currently sucking any dictatorial dick? If you want to say Germany, think again. All those deals were agreed upon with the Commissiom and the Council of Europe, who happens to represent the member states.\n\n&gt;Italy. Spain. Greece. France is beginning to falter. And everyone knows that the source of Europe's economic problems is the social welfare state. \n\nYou apparently do. Would you care to cite the enourmous amount of economic literature published on this topic that will unequivocally point me to the true reason of the economic shortcomings of our southern European member states? If this is the case, then why does the UK experience an upturn? Why is Germany doing so well? Ireland is recovering, too.\n\n&gt;And everyone knows that the when attempts are made to reform and scale back these ultimately debilitating programs, the results are riots in the streets and collapsing governments.\n\nWait, you told me those programs were a means for the government to controll and repress the population. Why exactly would a government enforce such measures if this would result in such situations of *not* controlling the population? And why would the government abandon such repressive measures in the first place, in effect losing power? \n\nIn any case, I definitely remember all those riots when the changes were put in place here in Germany, from ~2000-2006. Totally.\n\n&gt;This mess isn't about Europe defending itself. It's about entire populations dependent on unsustainable government programs that are collapsing under their own weight and taking whole societies with them.\n\n1. Shouldn't you be absolutely okay with that, following your unbroken believe in the goodness of individual choice? Why is a society suddenly not allowed to behave in a self-destructive manner? The US doesn't have to be in Europe. \n\n2. We're in a crisis, but not all countries, and we're not really collapsing. I could even buy milk and bread today, as hard as it sounds to you.\n\n&gt;Europe has been treating it's citizens like children for decades and now there's just too many spoiled brats no longer productive enough to sustain the system.\n\nHow long have you lived in Europe to make that claim? In the time you lived here, did you feel you were treated like a child? And why? Or are you again just pulling this bullshit straight out of your arse?\n\nThe population is voluntarily agreeing, by democratic means, to offer certain government services. Just like the US does, but only more or in a different manner. \n\n&gt;And happy news! America is falling for the lies of \"democratic socialism\" and following Europe into the pit of FAIL.\n\nThanks Obama!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395940777", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The battering ram pounded against the gate of the Alamo.  \n\n“Everybody get off the walls!” Lyndon Johnson yelled as the presidents took cover from another barrage of arrows.  “That gate won’t hold much longer!”\n\n“We should retreat into the buildings,” James Buchanan nervously suggested, holding onto his sword with shaking hands.  “We won’t stand a chance in the courtyard.”\n\n“Not an option!” Teddy Roosevelt replied.  The president leaned over the wall and aimed his bow at the enemy army.  Ignoring the projectiles sailing past his head, Roosevelt fired an arrow into the Prime Minister of Kosovo.  “Every building in this fort is engulfed in flames,” Roosevelt continued.  “There’s nowhere for us to run.”  The president turned around and flashed a maniacal grin at his countrymen.  “We have them right where we want them.”\n\n“That’s right!” Ulysses Grant said, sharing Roosevelt’s optimism.  The former general tipped back a bottle of whiskey, swallowed the last drops, and chucked it over the wall.  The glass bottle shattered as it connected with Shinzo Abe’s head.  “It’s time for glory, boys!” Grant said, opening another bottle of whiskey.\n\n“There’s too damn many of them,” Franklin Pierce said through gritted teeth as he held his leg.  An arrow stuck out of his shin.  “I swear we must’ve killed a hundred of them but they keep coming.”\n\n“That’s because there’s 192 of them!” Grant laughed, drunkenly stumbling across the battlements to Pierce’s side.  “Now let’s get that leg amputated and get you back to work, lad!”\n\n“Stay away, you lunatic!” Pierce screamed.  “I don’t even have any more arrows to shoot.  Nixon stole them all.”\n\n“I am not a crook!” Nixon yelled from a few feet away.  “Talk to that swarthy skinned fellow over there.  He’s been hogging all the arrows.  And he stole my last Charleston Chew!”\n\n“Thanks, Obama,” Franklin Pierce said sarcastically.\n\n“Let me be clear,” Obama interjected.  “I took the arrows because Pierce had more than everybody else.  I thought it’d be better for the defense of the fort if we redistributed them more evenly.”\n\n“Don’t start with this crap again!” Nixon yelled, his jowls shaking with rage. \n\n“Why won’t you give up your fair share?” Obama demanded.\n\n“You know, talking like that in my day would’ve gotten you thrown in jail.”\n\n“It was a different time, Richard.”\n\n“No kidding.  I got impeached for wiretapping a couple of phones.  Meanwhile you can get away with the NSA and-”\n\n“Get down!” Johnson interrupted as another barrage of arrows sailed toward the fort.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did not take cover quickly enough and an arrow stuck into his thick chest.\n\n“Roosevelt!” Johnson yelled.\n\n“Don’t worry, Lyndon,” Teddy said as he ripped the arrow from his chest.  “It’ll take more than that to kill a bull moose.”  Roosevelt notched the still-bloody arrow and sent it into the heart of the Prime Minister of Haiti.  \n\nThe gate began to crack under the battering ram’s relentless pounding.\n\nAndrew Jackson stood up and wiped the dust off of his club.  “Nobody kill the Prime Minister of Spain,” he said.  “That man is mine.”\n\n“Everybody to the courtyard!” James Polk yelled to the surviving presidents.  “We make our stand there!  Come on, Pierce!”\n\nPolk grabbed Pierce’s sleeve to help him to his feet.  Polk froze as he realized that another arrow had landed right between Pierce’s eyes.\n\nThere were only nine presidents remaining of the original forty three.  The first casualty was William Henry Harrison, who had contracted pneumonia while the enemy army was on the way and died before the battle started.  \n\nArrows fired during the siege had taken down most of the presidents.  Taft’s corpse looked like a pincushion with all of the arrows sticking out of his enormous belly.\n\nThe international army had managed to place some ladders on the Alamo’s walls and several world leaders successfully reached the top of the wall.  The vicious melee inflicted heavy losses on the Presidents.  Recep Erdogan of Turkey fought like a man possessed.  After stepping off the ladder, he threw a spear through John Adams with so much force that the projectile tore through the president and fatally wounded John Quincy Adams who was standing behind his father.\n\nThe presidents may very well have lost the battle right there had Abraham Lincoln not used his incredible strength to throw the ladders backwards off the wall.\n\nAt last, the Presidents were out of time.  The gate began to crumble as the battering ram punched away.  The surviving Americans formed a line in front of the collapsing gate as the international army poured through.  \n\n“Time to go nukular on this army!” George W Bush yelled, charging forward.  \n\nThe presidents fought for their lives in the courtyard, cutting down leader after leader.  Outnumbered as they were, the remaining Americans were not without advantages.  They still had their two most ferocious fighters, Andrew Jackson and Teddy Roosevelt.  Moreover, their spirits were kept high by the enthusiasm of men like Grant and George W Bush.\n\n“Don’t mess with Texas!” Bush bellowed as he decapitated David Cameron.  \n\nDespite the massive casualties the Americans were inflicting, the international army began to make their presence felt.  Angela Merkel managed to land her sword between Obama’s ribs.  As the President fell to one knee, holding his side, Merkel held her sword above his head.\n\n“This is for reading my e-mail, arschloch,” she said as she decapitated the President.\n\nA few feet away, Mariano Rajoy of Spain and Enrique Nieto of Mexico surrounded Ulysses Grant and cut down the former general.\n\n“Piensas que ellos van a recordar como esto terminó la última vez?” Nieto asked Rajoy.\n\nFrom across the courtyard, George W Bush threw his sword into Nieto’s chest.\n\n“We speak American in this country!” Bush yelled just before Manmohan Singh drove a spear through his throat.\n\nDespite their losses, victory still seemed possible.  But then, disaster struck.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt took aim with his bow and fired a shot into the Prime Minister of Poland.  Suddenly, Roosevelt recognized the figure standing behind the dead Pole.  \n\nIt was Putin.  \n\nThe shirtless Russian had used the Polish Prime Minister as a human shield and now had a bow aimed at Roosevelt.  The bull moose tried to reload as quickly as he could, but it was too late.  Putin’s arrow landed right between Roosevelt’s eyes, shattering his spectacles as it tore through his head.  \n\n“Aroo!” an angry Nixon yelled as he charged Putin.  \n\nPutin drew a sword to parry away Nixon’s attack and launched a devastating kick to the president’s knee, crippling him.  Nixon fell to the ground in pain and James Buchanan attempted to stab Putin in the back.  In one fluid motion, Putin blocked the thrust and drew a mace with his free hand.  The spiked ball swung around and caved in Buchanan’s head.  \n\nThe Russian stood above Nixon, spinning his mace.\n\n“Sock it to me!” Nixon bellowed defiantly.  \n\nPutin obliged him, bringing the mace down on the wounded President.\n\nThe other leaders stopped fighting and gathered around to watch Putin finish off the presidents.  The international army began to chant Putin’s name (except for Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the Ukraine who remained bitterly silent.)\n\nOne at a time, the Presidents fell until, at last, only Jackson remained.  The fatigued President struggled to block Putin’s relentless attacks.  Putin knocked Jackson off his feet and swung down with the mace.  Jackson barely lifted his club in time.  The spiked ball stuck in Jackson’s club and the president attempted to disarm the Russian.  \n\nPutin kicked Jackson in the face and the President fell onto his back.  Without a word, Putin stepped toward the final president.  \n\nJackson had just finished making his peace with God when a miracle happened.  Suddenly, something fell from above and crushed Putin.  Jackson wiped the sweat from his eyes and saw what had killed his enemy.  It was Taft.  \n\nWith a half dozen arrows in him, Taft had summoned the last of his strength, threw himself off the wall, and crushed Vladimir Putin beneath his 300 pound frame.  \n\nWith his dying breath, Taft whispered to Andrew Jackson, “Remember the Alamo.”\n\nJackson rose to his feet and faced the remaining fifty soldiers of the international army.  The final president picked up Putin’s sword and charged with Taft’s last words on his lips.\n\n“Remember the Alamo!” he yelled as he ran towards death.\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1395975142", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 163, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Who said that the Tamarians have always spoken in metaphors? It probably spread and gained dominance in the lexicon before their language began to get dominated by metaphors. As for why they have 'and', 'at', 'his', 'eyes', and 'closed', whose to say any of the species we've seen have those? The UT translates those words. Let's face it, we have absolutely no idea how the UT works. My guess is that it looks for sounds and formating. Obviously the Tamarian language has different formatting but it contained cultural references such as Darmok and Jalad which the UT may have recognized and it may have extrapolated that the use of those words was a reference to \"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra\". From there it fills in the necessary gaps, such as 'and' and from there, it has a full sentence of material and the context of references to an ancient parable to continue converting the constituent words to the English equivalents. However, how is the UT supposed to know that the phrase \" Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra\", is supposed to mean, \"Let's to to the surface of that planet and fight an invisible monster together.\" Why wouldn't the computer have problems with metaphors? They are abstract, the Achilles heal of computers. All it was able to do was recognize the reference, pick up on the **literal** context and use phonetics from the inferred non proper nouns to translate the other non proper nouns. As for the rest, most of their language was proper nouns and many were already known to the Federation. The story of Darmok wasn't native to the Tamarians so many other references may not have been either.\n\nSo, if half the language is proper nouns that the UT already recognizes, it can infer a cultural reference, infer the more standard words, and with the context of cultural references, continue to translate the unknown words while also using phonetics from those already translated. However, since it is translating under the context of a cultural reference, the UT would not realize it was a metaphor. \n\nTo go back to Tugurce's internet comparison, we use \"thanks Obama!\" as an exclamation to express semi jocular dismay at something, even though it usually has very little to do with Obama or the government. So, imagine you are a Chinese person who does not speak English and you are trying to communicate with me. Let's say you are trying to introduce yourself. However, I don't speak Mandarin and exclaim,\" Oh, I don't understand him. Thanks Obama!\" Now Obama is a well known person so you probably recognize his name. You may even know what \"thanks\" means. So using basic prior knowledge and rudimentary deduction, you can figure out that my latter statement was meant 'thanks obama'. So, as a Chinese person who only speaks Mandarin, wouldn't you be confused that I just thanked the non present president? It wouldn't make sense and you don't know it is a metaphor so you are just as confused as Picard when he hears \"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396055458", "subreddit": "DaystromInstitute", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My post doesn't address the weird subtext of your appointment, but speaking strictly on the medical stuff:\n\nAs someone who went through menopause at 16 (premature ovarian failure) and who also doesn't want kids, I would actually suggest getting your hormone profile done just to see where you are, and maybe getting on birth control pills, not for \"you might change your mind!\" reasons but because having low estrogen can lead to osteoporosis, dryness, low libido, hair loss, hot flashes, brain fog, weight gain, and so on. It might not *now*, at 19, but your hormone profile changes as you get older, gradually producing less and less estrogen over time. So where you probably feel fine at 19, you might start experiencing more symptoms at 25, or 29, or 35, and even doing something as simple as being on birth control pills will help your body maintain a more optimal balance of hormone levels (and keep you from experiencing any undesirable reproductive \"miracles\", God forbid).\n\nOf course you don't need to engage in any fertility treatments unless you decide you want to have kids. But I would definitely get your hormones looked at, retake those tests just to make sure those conditions aren't present (I mean, anybody can have something go wrong at any age, it doesn't necessarily have to stem from your current history) and maybe an ultrasound just to make sure your innards are as expected.\n\nJust remember that there's more to your hormones and your health than just making sure you can have kids. You want to feel healthy too, you want your bones to develop fully and maintain good density, you want your sex life to be satisfactory, and this is for the long haul, not just the immediate future. It's a good idea to keep in touch with what's going on. You don't have to run these tests every year, maybe every few years (well, you can run the hormone levels every year along with cholesterol), there's not much to it, and if an issue does develop, then you will know early on.\n\nWhatever you decide, since you don't menstruate, I highly suggest starting a good weight-lifting program to help build and maintain bone density. Starting a good lifestyle habit now will pay off really well as your life goes on. \n\nI was diagnosed at age 20, and have been on birth control pills as HRT for most of that time--I am now 40. (I don't menstruate when I'm off them.) To be honest, I think it had a very positive effect on my health, and considering that my naturally occurring hormone levels are extremely low (they were quite low when I was younger, and now don't even register in a blood test), the risks associated with long-term BC use are pretty low. And now the pills are free! (Thanks Obama.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396190179", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
