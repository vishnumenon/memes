{"body": "Speaking of single payer: As a new beneficiary of the Medicaid expansion (thanks, Obama! [see what I did there?]) I see first-hand why so many Republican states refused to accept the federal money to expand Medicaid. \n\nWhy? *The coverage is phenomenal.* I haven't had health insurance this good since the late 1990s. The negative is that it's HMO-style, but otherwise, wowsers. Almost complete coverage, insanely cheap co-pays (well, I'm glad for that, as this is insurance for poor people). Apparently there is basic vision and decent dental coverage too, through a major plan already accepted by most dental providers — this was a surprise because usually such plans are so limited you have either next to no coverage or the providers are sketchy, but not in this case.\n\nEvery American should have this coverage. I'll be making more money soon, and damn if I won't be sad to have to give up Medicaid when I do.\n\nThe Republicans knew what they were doing. Every person forced to \"shop\" for insurance is going to be looking at their poor folks with jealousy. Unfortunately that will translate not into \"We deserve this too!\" but instead, \"Take it away from them and make them go through what I'm going through!\" \n\nSpeaking of shopping, I was forced to pick one of five \"plans\" even in Medicaid. When I was enrolling on the phone, I asked the advisor why we had to choose when we had virtually no information on the differences between them. He said they had to provide the same coverage and didn't really have a reason for so many. I suspect it was more of the \"Let's simulate a 'free market'\" thinking that confuses people with choices they don't have the information to make rather than simply providing a service. \n\nAnyway, that's my take. Medicaid seems single payer to me, except for that weird \"choose a plan\" part, and its expansion ought to raise its rep now that so many people qualify for it. I hope everyone can have something like it someday soon.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396385028", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

Rightly or wrongly they will blame the ACA for \n\n* higher premiums (even if they can't tell you what they paid last year)\n\n* higher co-pays (even if it went down from last year)\n\n* not being able to see the same doctor (even if they don't remember their doctor)\n\n* going to a different hospital (even if they've never been to the hospital)\n\n* whatever else they can think of (doctor no longer gives out lollipops \"because of ACA\") \n\nMany people will probably make up excuses to complain as well:  *I have a cough but Obama took away my doctor or doesn't cover the meds I need so I'm just going to suffer through*.  Total BS but the cough gives them a chance to bash the ACA.  \n\n\"Success stories\" could be a difficult issue to build a campaign on.

{"body": "Well, as someone who's never been to the USA, my picture of your country from what I see on reddit and the rest of the internets is as follows:\n\n* Everyone sues.\n* Everyone owns and loves guns.\n* The police *will* shoot you if they see you. Avoid at all costs.\n* Everyone thinks they're actually Irish.\n* It is offensive to make a compliment unless you are in a relationship with that person. To call a woman beautiful is borderline rape. \n* Americans don't know the difference between a debate and a discussion.\n* You better stay healthy, or you'll spend your life in debt/jail.\n* Everyone hates the government whatever it does. Thanks, Obama!\n* White people are secretly scared of black people.\n* Black people make the best vines.\n* American women like to shout whenever an opportunity arises. They also wear yoga pants and say \"oh my god\" a lot.\n* Everyone is the 99%, but everyone also thinks 99% of their compatriots are dumb as hell.\n* Half of the country is actually a theocracy.\n* When in the audience for any show, it is good to shout and otherwise express one's emotions. This is to awaken animalistic instincts within other audience members and add to the theatrical experience.\n* Everyone has a bumper sticker. Bumper stickers are little plaques designed to offend the person driving behind you. This is probably to awaken their animalistic instincts and make them threaten you, and thus add to the thrill of the driving experience. If they try anything, everyone sues.\n* Due to a mysterious pandemic most certainly caused by the sinister government, all American children and most American adults now suffer from emphasised spatial variables. /s\n* Americans don't get sarcasm, so they put little /s signs or similar behind sarcastic remarks.\n* Right wing means theocratic dictatorship and war. Left wing means communism. Liberal means communist. The centre is actually half right wing.\n* The Canadians are really nice people, but that makes them pussies and nobody wants to be a pussy. Except when someone who is a pussy is bullied, then they should be proud of being a pussy and make it their chief strength.\n* Nobody knows how to drive on snow.

{"body": "First of all, happy birthday. I wish you all the best, good health, winning the lottery, all those things. Now I know you might not see this birthday as a particular happy one, because of recent events, but actually, you couldn't be more wrong. 24 years ago (or 23, if you're one of those weird people that say that they're already one year older before having their birthday) you were thrown into this life and since then I'm sure you've seen and experienced pretty amazing things. You've learned to speak, read, math and if you're a frequent visitor of reddit you've also learned that there's this guy with two penises. You've seen beautiful sunrises and sunsets, felt the warmth of the sun on your skin and you know how fulfilling a good meal after a long day can be. Now, today you're facing another birth. Truth be told, it won't be as messy as it was 24 years ago and the pain involved is a bit different (plus it's you and not your mom this time) but tomorrow, you will be reborn. In the future, be it tomorrow or next year, you will see more beautiful sunrises and sunsets, possibly even prettier than before. The sun will feel a just a tiny bit warmer (thanks global warming and thanks Obama! ;)) and you will have a meal that will taste like the best meal ever. Prepare yourself for this rebirth. Clean up whatever you still have that remembers you of your life before tomorrow. Put all the stuff in a box and put it in the attic or in the basement. Once you're done with that, take a moment for yourself and cry. Let it all out. Scream if you have to, as loud as you can. Put all the sadness, misery and anger in it, and scream as loud as you can. When you're done with that, stop for a second, dry your tears and count slowly to 10. Those 10 seconds will be the last 10 seconds you will allow yourself to be sad today, because you have to prepare for your rebirth. Tomorrow your new life is going to start.

Give Obamacare a little time to settle in and get the biggest bugs worked out, and then watch the exodus. People *will* start walking away from asshole bosses to start their own businesses or to work somewhere their heart is (but the insurance benefits are not).

This repeats ad nauseum for long enough, until all of these leaders completely hate each other, and when one starts hearing of another planning war, they all start preparing, as well as secretly start spreading propaganda, until eventually, one random person takes it too seriously and pretty much repeats the whole Franz Ferdinand assassination deal, except no one is exactly sure where this guy comes from, so each of these countries blames the one they originally thought farted, and World War III begins. \n\nPlot twist: the guy who actually farted is the one who dies.

{"body": "Even though it seems like the belief in conspiracy theories is on the rise (thanks Obama) I don't believe that the thought process involved is anything knew. The Us vs Them conflict is nothing new. It just gets rebranded generation after generation. Notice how the FDA is labeled as criminals, well \"We\" are never the criminals its always \"Them\". \n\nIt is a simple way of viewing the world. This is bad, that is good, end of story. When you view the world in black in white fact checking doesn't matter. Why would it? After all the greying of things is exactly what \"They\" would do. So McDonalds is the bad guy here and as bad guys they want to do bad things to people or at least they don't care if bad things happen. Of course you are a shill for the bad guys if you want people to think critically about it.  Critical thinking is just another way of greying things up and when you grey things up it only benefits \"Them\", because it allows the \"Them\" to operate in the open. \n\nUltimately this is why you can't argue with people like this. There is no compromising in a black and white world. You are either with us or against us. It reminds me of a conversation I had with an old friend. Basically this women is a Christian who is adamant about the end times, \"they\" are attacking the Christian faith, the world is terrible because of a lack of jesus and so on. The topic came up about voting and I basically stated that our government should not be run by Christians, of course she disagreed. At that moment I became one of \"Them\" to her. I tried to explain that separation of church and state is a way to protect religion. There is no guarantee that the Christians that she wants to run the country would practice their faith the same way as she would. Things could get ugly real fast in that world. None of that matter I was one of \"them\" now, an agent of evil controlled by a demon like an episode of Supernatural.\n\nTL;DR: Drinking beer in middle of the day = wall ranting text", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396985298", "subreddit": "conspiratard", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Compared to an average US-supported puppet dictator in the third world, Gaddafi was a saint.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, Russia and Putin don't want to intervene in Syria where there's 100k+ dead. \n\nThe more dead Islamists, the greater peace on Earth. Personally I'd support the Syrian war going on permanently until Assad forces exterminate every single Islamist left, because Syria seems to be a global focal point for them currently.\n\nAnd Russia does want to intervene in Syria - just not American-style. US wants to bomb all of the govt's military facilities and turn the country into a sectarian shithole mired in perpetual war among tribes along religious lines. Americans want to weaken the centralized state institutions under the pretext of introducing democracy so that the permanent seeds of discord could prevent Syria from ever becoming a relevant regional power.\n\n&gt;Putin write's in an US newspaper about the importance of UN mandated actions. \n\nYes he rubbed the hypocrisy to your face. In the meantime he also grow disillusioned once the US-orchestrated colored revolutions started to happen in his own backyard.\n\n&gt;Then with 0 deaths or any apparent threats invades another country and annexes it. \n\nIt was not an \"annexation\" - there was a referendum. You keep repeating the inapplicable loaded words as if that changes the reality. Invasion and annexation only exists in your MSM-brainwashed mind.\n\n&gt;You can talk all about how US LNG industry benefits but there's only one country that annexed parts another and maybe looking for more.\n\nThere is only one country that has 700 military bases around the globe, that is stealing the wealth of the rest of the world by printing trillions of its gun-backed currency, whose soldiers are exempt from international courts and who never paid and reparation or suffered sanctions for the damage it has caused in its war machinations.

{"body": "I appreciate your response even though I don't agree with most of it.\n\n&gt;Threatening to Yanukovich by sanctions if he used force against \"peaceful protesters\", in fact Nazis that were burning people alive.\n\nHere is a guy that is essentially a puppet of Russia. The country is approaching a deal with the EU and he overturns it in favor of Russia. Last straw for many people. A man that stole hundreds of millions if not billions. Does not step down or offer re-election until way too late. In any reasonable country it would take 1/20 of what had to happen in Ukraine for a president to step down. What is this stuff about burning people? The nationalist uprising is a symptom of the unrest not a cause. \n\nThe US is in Europe because we ask them to. Otherwise Russia will just bully smaller countries using it's military power. Flying into airspaces to tryout response times. Bombing training runs on Swedish islands.  \n\n&gt;Aggressor? And exactly how many people died during the Crimean unification? Where is the outrage in Crimean population?\n\nAggression does not require violence. The lack of all out violence is the reason why things aren't disastorous yet. The majority (but not as high as the election results) of Crimeans supported the move. That however does not make it right or not aggressive. \n\n&gt;It was by HDI and GDP per capita. Now it's a sectarian Islamist shithole with bankster-controlled central bank. Thanks Obama.\n\nYou don't get people to rise against the government unless they are unhappy. It's just the way it is. Relatively wealthy dictatorship.\n\n&gt;The more dead Islamists, the greater peace on Earth. Personally I'd support the Syrian war going on permanently until Assad forces exterminate every single Islamist left, because Syria seems to be a global focal point for them currently.\n\n&gt;And Russia does want to intervene in Syria - just not American-style.

Americans want to weaken the centralized state institutions under the pretext of introducing democracy so that the permanent seeds of discord could prevent Syria from ever becoming a relevant regional power.\n\nAt the start it did not have anything to do with Islam. Now, with inaction, islamists have take hold. Something has to be done. But I don't believe for a second that Russia is interested in the people of Syria. Introduce a solution.\n\n&gt;Yes he rubbed the hypocrisy to your face. In the meantime he also grow disillusioned once the US-orchestrated colored revolutions started to happen in his own backyard.\n\nNow, this is weak. I don't even get it. Rubbing hypocrisy in our face by being a huge hypocrite?\n\n&gt;It was not an \"annexation\" - there was a referendum. You keep repeating the inapplicable loaded words as if that changes the reality. Invasion and annexation only exists in your MSM-brainwashed mind.\n\nSudetenland right? This was a not a referendum. First come the troops. Then comes the vote. All this happens in a couple of weeks. You can't invade first and then claim that the referendum has credibility. \n\n&gt;There is only one country that has 700 military bases around the globe, that is stealing the wealth of the rest of the world by printing trillions of its gun-backed currency, whose soldiers are exempt from international courts and who never paid and reparation or suffered sanctions for the damage it has caused in its war machinations. It is also the only country who's MIC and global strategy is benefiting from this Ukrainian \"crisis\", no matter how it unfolded.\n\nHuge exaggeration and partly but not completely untrue. And I still prefer the US over Russia. What does that tell you? I don't nearly support or approve everything that the US does but it still has certain rules. It's media is free. It's president can't do anything he wants. It has never attacked my country. Just a fraction of the corruption. So even with it's many faults, I still would turn to the US before Russia. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397204884", "subreddit": "russia", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

Altho I have no direct nor first hand knowledge about any of this, I will communicate to you the information I have as faithfully I can. \n\n&gt;Harry Reid, tortoises, Taxes and fees, and whatever else talking points and soundbites has been raised.  \n\nDistraction. Red herrings. . etc. All trees of a forest. The forest is *the situation*. Each individual tress being a \"what this is about\". Simple enough? Just you wait a bit more... \n\n&gt;Are these cattle grazing on public BLM land.     \n\nYes. No. Both. Neither. This is another tree of the forrest. All \"valid\" answers; depending on who you ask.       \n\n&gt;If so, then why not pay the fees like everyone else?  \n\nThis one tree is PROPER politics and PROPER due process. An extract from an account of a local here: ([permalink](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/22ntn8/take_aways_from_the_ongoing_bundyranch_situation/cgoyftl)) I edited for clarity and emboldened the elements of interest: \n\n&gt;Since most of the state is desert, ranchers have always had to use tremendous acreage to feed cattle here. \n\n&gt;**Our state was brought into the union around 1865. Prior to that, and after that, up till 1934 ranchers had legal free reign to graze cattle with no restrictions. This was called forage rights**.\n\n&gt;The ranch in interest, here, was established in 1877. The Bundy family purchased it later, in the 1880's. **But when they did, they had to PAY for the water and forage rights.**\n\n&gt;In the 1930's the **ranchers had arguments between themselves** regarding territories. So a few of the larger ones **got together and ASKED the fed if they could hire them, by paying minimal fees to \"MANAGE\" the land and break it out into sections. This was made into the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934.**\n\n&gt;After the 1934 act they **continued to pay grazing fees and make improvements** (clarification from me: **improvements (fences, waters, etc) made with his own pocket** --NOT taxpayer money) up until the 1990's.\n\n&gt;(Somewhere along the way the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) was created.)\n\n&gt;Around 1990 or so BLM TOLD him that he could no longer graze more than 150 of his 600 or so head of cattle there. (--which is ludicrous to even consider as \"management\" re: the first sentence of this extract in quote)\n\n&gt;Mr. Bundy told them to pound sand and kept paying his fees and grazing his cattle.\n\n&gt;Around 1994 they TOLD him he could only graze them in the summer, fall and winter and said it was **so that the cattle didn't disturb the Desert Tortoise.**\n\n&gt;Mr. Bundy told them that they were **HIRED by the Taylor Grazing act to MANAGE the land for the ranchers. (my addition: Obviously they suck balls at this job! --see ref 1 at button) **So he FIRED them and started paying his fees to to the state of Nevada.** Soon the state of Nevada didn't know where to put the money so **they quit taking payments.**\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, BLM came at him from another angle. When they saw they weren't going to be able to force him off the land the **BLM SOLD the rights to the land to the state of Nevada under the condition that the state RETIRE the grazing rights permanently.** Following that,  **the state left him alone and let him forage all those years.**\n\n&gt;Following that, year after year, Ranchers around the nation began to shut down. Be it from outright buyout or getting shut down by legislature and/or crushed by lawsuits and even downright intimidation under the disguise of a BLM program deemed optional. A program that paid ranchers a lump sum of YOUR taxpayer funds in exchange for quitting ranching. \n\n&gt;A lot of them did. Before that, there were about 50 ranchers in Clark County, Nevada, alone. Now there's only ONE left. From Clark county all the way up the pacific ocean: Cliven Bundy.\n\n\nEnd of quotation.\n\nTL;DR: \n\nApparently, they had tortoise \"problem\". It's \"possible\" a cattle might step on one! The BLM knows what is best! Let's save the tortoises by reducing the herd of cattle! (--and driving Mr. Bundy out of business along the way... how devilishly brilliant!) [However, desert tortoise feed on cattle droppings. The more cattle there is the more food is available to the tortoises.](https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/rangelands/article/viewFile/10776/10049) BAM! That's the problem with false pretences: it's a false pretence. It's a big fucking theatre: the forest.\n\n&gt;Is the BLM buying up ranchers with fee money?\n\nI can't possibly answer that as I don't have first hand knowledge on any of this. If you would be asking my opinion and impression on it, I would say it certainly seem to be the case:\n\n&gt;The “FED” owns nearly 650 million acres of land. (~30%)\n\n&gt;Federal lands are used as military bases or testing grounds, nature parks and reserves and Indian reservations, or are leased to the private sector for commercial exploitation (e.g. forestry, mining, agriculture)\n\n&gt;They are managed by different administrations, such as the \n&gt;Bureau of Land Management, \n&gt;US Forest Service, \n&gt;US Fish and Wildlife Service, \n&gt;National Park Service,\n&gt;Bureau of Indian Affairs,\n&gt;US Department of Defense,\n&gt;US Army Corps of Engineers,\n&gt;US Bureau of Reclamation or the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\n&gt;Notice how most of the federally occupied land is west of the Mississippi where population density is not very high compared to states east of the Mississippi. While each state gets two senators, the House of Representatives is based on population. \n\n&gt;The federal government owns 84.5(?) percent of Nevada. Compare that to New York at less than 1 percent.\n\n&gt;Nevada has three(3) representatives. Compare that to Texas (32), New York (29), and California (53).\n\n\n*Visualize BLM's ownership of land in U.S.A.: http://i.imgur.com/e0SYASa.jpg\n\n*Depict \"The FED's\" ownership of the land in an international perspective: http://i.imgur.com/yyQ2qZc.png\n\nThat takes us to the the Harry Reid angle...what the fuck is this shit, mate?\n\nTo WHOM does Mr. Dundy owes his fees anyway? \n\n1) To the FED they HIRED to manage territorial disputes but sucked at  the job so bad they got FIRED?\n2) To the State of Nevada who couldn't figure out how to use the money so they STOPPED taking payments?\n3) To a private, for profit, interest who wants to TAKE the resources of the land and SELL it back to the very people who PAID fees to the SELLERS to MANAGE the land?\n4) To the Natives who where there long before ANY of this ever happened anyway?\n5) To *me*, perhaps? :)\n\n\nI am quite confused and overwhelmed at the dept of this bag of worm. Federal Overreach? State's sovereignty? \n\nLet's ask \"The fed\". What are we getting *from* those guys? \n1) Public Relation speeches.\n2) Sowing confusion by make this \"all about\" tortoises! \"fess!\" \"illegal aliens!\" \"the Chinese!\" \"freeloader!\" \"Thanks Obama!\" \"Democrats! \"Republicants!\" Your mom so fat!\"\n\n... \nbleh...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397411687", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Its Donald giving physical representation to the questions he's asking about himself. Clapping for the Wrong Reasons is a play on words from the quote in the book. Holden says something along the lines of \"Everyone claps for the wrong reasons.\" Thus Clapping for the Wrong Reasons. The entire album and movie are essentially what Donald Glover has been repeatedly saying over and over again in his interviews and his instagram. He's lost. He's lost like Holden Caulfield. Donald hasn't been acting in the role of The Boy he's been acting as Holden because he needs some purpose. Holden also smoked and drank frequently which is a habit Donald has been picking up. I don't know if any of this makes sense or if this adds more questions, but read Catcher in the Rye then watch Donalds interviews, this movie, and read the script for Because of The Internet.﻿", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397448711", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

First off, even if the NSA is listening in on civilians it's a damn small amount of them. They're too busy doing military business to give a crap about who's looking at porn or texting suspicious texts. My brother is in the USAF, specifically Radio Intelligence which works strongly with the NSA. Where he is, they've got the *cartels* on their hands, meaning they've not the time to listen in on some civilians' phone calls when their main mission is to eliminate a group of people right below us that are beheading the civilians of another country. Second off, it's NSA regulations to disconnect if you find out you are monitoring a civilian phone call. Of course, this doesn't mean that some scumbag isn't going to let it slide, but it shows that the NSA's focus isn't what everyone's thinking.\n\nI'm fine if users provide facts that show some sort of proof that part of the NSA's being slimey, but I fucking hate that so many people are acting like it's 1984 in America.

Pretty tight, but went on there.  It slips on really smooth on a forged lower.\n\n* Tan A2 did NOT work.  It's a tight fit on a forged lower.\n\n* Pink A2 DID work, it's a very tight fit.  It's a tightish fit on a forged lower.\n\n* MOE+ DID work, it's a tight fit, and as you can see, there's a wide gap between the receiver and beavertail.  I have not put this on my forged lower since I'm not made of time.\n\n* MOE K did NOT work, it's in between the Tan A2 and Pink A2 in tightness, did not test on my forged lower.\n\n* Blackhawk Ergo DID work, it's a smooth fit on both the forged and TNA lower.\n\nBased on this information, you can see that PSA and Magpul furniture are a little inconsistent, based on date of manufacture.  I would test fit your grips, or stick to plain MOE and MOE+ grips for the time being.\n\nIf that grip is really tight on a forged lower, chances are that it won't work on the TNA Gen 3.

Verizon sued and the rules were overturned by the courts this year. Right now the FCC is trying to come up with rules that meet the ruling by the courts, but it pretty much guarantees that the ISPs have the right to offer \"fast lane\" service to content providers, and the FCC is trying to do damage control with language like a \"minimum level of service\" that will be guaranteed to all traffic.

{"body": "So, wow. I was in a really shitty mood until I read your post. Seriously, thank you. I literally burst out laughing a few times while intermittently yelling \"THANKS, OBAMA\".  \n\nHere are a few other things that I ranted in my head and then typed up because fuck it - it helps. \n\nThe bit about the economy was just... so over the top. \n\nAnd that she says our relationship was strained from 18.... like there were ZERO problems up until that point. Untrue. \n\nThe fact that she told me she hopes I can laugh this all off? Like I can laugh off her and my dad treating me like a marriage counselor before having a real relationship of my own - no problem. \n\n\"Oh kids, did I ever tell you the story about how your grandma found out I was cutting myself and then followed me around the house while I tried to be alone and then when she overheard me talking on the phone with my boyfriend upset at her she then kicked me out of the house? But don't worry, she texted me 20 minutes later taking it back. Isn't your grandma silly!\"\n\n\nAbout my dad's depression? My dad is stressed. I don't mean to sound like a dick, but I can't imagine a doctor that has ever experienced prolonged depression saying the things that he says to me. Maybe I'm just close-minded, but asking someone why they are still depressed almost every time you spend time with them is not something I would do. Depression doesn't really work like that and reminding me that things still aren't better doesn't really help. At all. \n\nAnd on the topic of therapy, his therapy started with couples therapy but then my mom decided to stop going because she \"didn't like it\". \n\nA few months ago she said to me, \"I'm really proud of your father for not resorting to taking any medication for his depression.\" .... I literally sat there, stunned - Did my mother just say that to me not only when she knows that I have been on antidepressants for over 3 years, but that I had just come back from a therapy session? Yeah, she did. I immediately called her out on it and told her how hurtful that was. She then started on about how her parents feel about mental health... she said something along the lines of \"well in my family, therapy and medication is for crazy people.\"\n\nAnd about the book thing? Nothing really to worry about there. She has been reading the same book since 2012 and she is still raving about it. I checked her place last year and she was like 80 pages into the 300 page book. She'd probably get into the TV show though...\n\nAnd now I've just ranted for about 2000 characters, so I'm sorry for that. But I do want to sincerely thank you for your cynical response. Sometimes I think cynicism is just blunt honesty mixed with sarcasm.\n\nedit: changed nonsensical sentence.

I'm not aware of any research that supports or contradicts the correlation with female sex drive.\n\n2) My wife and I married later (she was 39 and is now 49).  After the first year of NFP, we threw caution to the wind, and we had two biological kids.  We adopted two more. I like to say that being old and exhausted by child-rearing is it's own type of birth control.  Many people are also unaware that breastfeeding significantly lowers your chances conceiving (and thus, you naturally space out your kids).  \n\n3) Getting a good thermometer and plotting your graph points is about as cheap as you're going to get for birth control.  Granted, most artificial birth control is subsidized by Planned Parenthood or the ACA (thanks, Obama) so this changes the cost calculation.  If you take morality out of the equation, I'm sure that some artificial contraception is easier or more convenient in that you just inject it and forget it, but the self discipline required for checking your temp and graphing data points isn't that hard. There are plenty of free worksheets that take the math out of it.\n\n4) I actually know an atheist who has no moral objection to birth control or abortion but chose to use NFP in her long term relationship with a boyfriend because she didn't like the side effects of the birth control she was using before.  NFP was the only way to avoid pregnancy and go all natural.  It is funny in this day and age that people will pay 3 times the price for ice cream without BGH, or will be afraid of food that used GMO's or had been irradiated to kill pests, but don't think twice about swallowing high doses of hormones when taking artificial birth control.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398453739", "subreddit": "Catholicism", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "While I don't expect this to be a popular answer, I do believe it is because of racism. Since he became president, there has so much explicit racism taking place in the U.S., while before, racism was very much hidden behind closed doors. The U.S. was built on white european traditions, has a huge conservative Christian community, and is currently ruled by white elites (also known as the 1%). For a Black man or any minority to become president against these ideologies is breaking tradition, and for some people, a risk to their status over others.\n \nBy Obama becoming president, he is a threat to these white elites because he is taking away their power and giving it to those who were oppressed prior to his presidency. Hence why every time Obama has tried to pass a bill, he is shut down by Republicans. The Republican party are traditionalists and fight for American to stick to their conservative/Christian roots.\n\nIn other words, racism has held back Obama and him progressing in his presidency. \n\nAnd if your question was referring to people saying \"thanks Obama\" to everything that goes wrong to them, it is basically a joke referring to people who have used Obama as a scapegoat for something going wrong in the U.S. government.

It's because they can no longer afford to take the summer classes or the extra semesters needed by others, so a lot of people will just switch to a different degree that they already have the requirements for.\n\nYeah, some people graduate in four years.
