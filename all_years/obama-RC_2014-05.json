{"body": "I don't think it happens in Canada so much. Maybe India, but it's not as widespread as people think. One of the problems is that even when a drug goes off-patent, the FDA decides which companies can produce it, hence why many generic drugs can remain extremely expensive compared to overseas. You can buy pure crystalline methamphetamine from a drug dealer for a small fraction of the cost that you can get it from its pharmaceutical counterpart (Desoxyn). Clearly that's a problem with a lack of competition considering that the illicit meth cook must use extremely inefficient methods to do it and is pricing in 20 years in prison.\n\nAnother example: Advair, which I use, went off patent four years ago, yet in the US, there is still no generic competitor because none have been FDA approved. My insurance stopped covering it this year (thanks Obamacare?), so I had to pay the full $250 for one inhaler. After trying and not liking other inhalers, I ended up ordering a bunch from [an Indian pharmacy](http://www.alldaychemist.com/seroflo-multi-haler-3181.html) for $17 each. It works just as well. That's less than what my copay was before. \n\nInhalers have been out for ages, yet there is not a single generic asthma inhaler available in the US. Why, you say?

{"body": "There are some limited resources, like real estate, precious metals, and electromagnetic spectrum for instance, but the economy goes beyond those resources.\n\n&gt;if you want a nice new 60\" class Samsung HDTV, prepare to shell out $1500 for it \n\nIf you can't afford it now, wait til next year. Not too long ago that was the price of a 40\" TV. When I was a kid, a 20\" color TV cost more than that in inflation-corrected dollars.\n\n&gt;many people still too poor to afford much beyond the basics \n\nThat's the definition of minimum wage. There will always exist those, but the goalposts are shifting. There was a time when a survival wage meant a pint of grub a day. Today a poor person is someone who is obese because he eats too much junk food. There was a time when only a rich man could afford a car, today the poorest people are those who live in their cars.\n\nThe economy is always improving, always offering more to the people. The definition of \"poor\" is relative, a poor person is one who has less than the people around him.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, dollars are literally leaving the US faster than they are coming in (in terms of trade with China). China therefore is getting wealthy by siphoning that wealth from the US. Their gains are our losses.\n\nThanks Obama and his guru Paul Krugman for that. They came up with this idea of \"stimulus spending\", thinking that the economy would magically build itself up if you only gave money to the people. Much to their embarrassment, all that stimulus money went to China.\n\nThe keynesian mantra is all about consuming, but they forget that if someone is consuming someone then else must be producing. If it hadn't been for China supplying cheap consumer items, the inflation in the US would be much higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; Many households have LESS purchasing power than they did 30 years ago. \n\nWhy? Take a look at the trends for the last 30 years. Government spending always goes up, most of the industrial economy growth has been in the defense sector.\n\nIf you want households to get more purchasing power, then you must create incentives for producing consumer items. Create opportunities for industries to compete against Chinese goods. To do that, you must INVEST in production, which means you need more investors than consumers, at least at first. \n\nOnce you have a large production capacity, then you can start to stimulate consumption. To give a stimulus to consumers without having first stimulated investment you will get the current situation of heavy trade deficit on consumer items.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399026498", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

I AM NOT TROLLING. I GENUINELY THINK YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT WITH INCORRECT FACTS WHO IS TOO SELF-INVOLVED TO EVEN CONSIDER HE'S WRONG. YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED ANY OF MY POINTS, AND YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT CONTINUALLY INSIST I WAS FUCKING WITH YOU, WHICH I CLEARLY CLEARLY HAVE NOT.**\n\nmultiple times, i have told you, flat out, i would admit i was wrong if you could do more than just repeat the same insults. all you have done is whine and bitch and insult. you want me to stop, show me where i'm wrong. you obviously can't so all you have left is throwing a hissy fit. \n\ni mean, i was a debate coach for about 5 years. i try never to give personal facts about myself online but i was. i know all the logical fallacies. i know how people try to get out of being DEAD wrong about everything. i've seen all this out of the kids i taught. the \"OF COURSE I'M RIGHT THIS GUY IS A DICK SO I'M JUST GONNA KEEP REPEATING MYSELF LIKE I'M ON FOXNEWS\" you're not winning just because you're\n\nnow, i know that your response to this is gonna be \"just like a troll! using words to respond to me!\" instead of addressing a single point i have made from the beginning. but that's par for the course. you're too important in your own mind to realize what a fucking prick you are. like donald trump, but probably still living in your childhood bedroom\n\nnow i can't wait for you to do exactly what you've been doing. taking the insults i use at you and repeating them back to me with feigned and undeserved outrage while, simultaneously, not responding to a fucking thing, and insisting that you are morally right and superior. you'll fit in to political behind the scenes just fine. you were fucking built for it. typical politician: WAAAAAAAAAAAAH BUT I'M RIGHT WAAAAAAAAAAAH HE USED FACTS ON ME WAAAAAAAAAHH.. next you're going to accuse me of liberal bias, right?

{"body": "This isn't something that just anyone can do, but startup companies are one of the few viable routes you can take if you have a felony conviction.  The good news is, there are a lot of startup companies out there looking to hire, who are small enough to not have HR departments that will automatically throw your application away.  But the bad news is, you'll probably need to move unless you live somewhere where there are a lot of startup companies.  I had to leave the city where I lived and move 9 hours away by train.  I'm also not working for a salary, but I have worked out a deal in which the company I work for pays my rent and food and that sort of thing.  \n\nIt took a while to get to that point though.  For six months I worked for practically free, living in my brother's basement and working remotely, while I taught myself various types of web programming.  A lot of it I was pretty familiar with already, but I had to learn a lot from scratch too.  It certainly wasn't easy, and I wouldn't recommend it for everyone.  But if you don't mind working your ass off in the hope that the equity you're getting in the company makes you rich, it's not a bad way to go.  My friends often seem jealous of me, even the ones that get paid well.  They're working for large companies, but dislike the inertia and the sense of stasis that they get at their jobs.  They sort of envy the control I have over a large fraction of the decisions that our company makes, even though I'm living in the ghetto and on Medicaid. (thanks Obama)\n\nIt was a bit hard to move while on probation, but it wasn't impossible.  I had to get our CEO to write up a formal offer letter, then prove I had somewhere to live at the end.  He was really good about helping me transition, and also is able to work around my occasional bouts of depression, whereas most employers wouldn't. (that's the reason I started using drugs in the first place) I have to provide paystubs to them, which is sort of a joke.  I'm technically self-employed, since I'm working for a company that I own part of, so it's legal.  I'm fortunate in that I never got myself too far into debt with student loans, I don't have any significant financial obligations, and my family helped me out during the period where I was working from home.  I probably worked about 50-60 hours a week, and still do.  We're getting investment though.  Not quite half a million, but close, and we've been turning investors down.  The work is starting to pay off after almost a year now.\n\nIf you're interested in working for a startup company, I found my job though the site http://www.angel.co.  Keep in mind, about 4 out of 5 of these companies have shitty business plans, but the goal is to find the 20% that are commercially viable.  If you're really lucky, you can start up a company that makes the business model obsolete of one of those companies that wouldn't even look at your resume.  I know, revenge is a shitty motivation, but it's not my only one, and I'll take what I can get.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399186750", "subreddit": "TrueAskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

This is because, as described above, in practice many of the Fuke were spies and informers for the government. Practice of the shakuhachi was banned entirely for four years by the Meiji government, after which it was decreed that secular playing was permitted.

This must be the greatest time in history to run a health insurance company, they can get away with murder by blaming Obama.\n\nI worked at General Dynamics and they did the exact same thing, and blamed Obama. They took away my good plan with a $2,000 deductible and blamed Obama. I was working in Texas so most of the people in the audience accepted this answer hook, line and sinker. When pressed for details GD said it was because the old plan was a \"Cadillac\" plan. When pressed further, they admitted it was not a Cadillac plan, but \"it might be someday so we had to nix it.\"\n\nSo 100% voluntary on GD's part to screw employees and lower costs, but the mostly Republican audience left the meeting grumbling about Obama ruining everything.\n\nAnyway, I left that company and work elsewhere, and now my deductible is $1,000, but since my employer pays half my deductible is effectively $500.

I was walking home in Mitino yesterday and a big scary Latvian wearing NATO uniform made me give him my Happy Meal.\n\n2) The same guy produced this incredibly offensive gem, \"I actually I have a lot of respect for you Estonians at least you had the courage to remove that Sovietet remnant \"soldier aloysha\" yet we have to tolerate Soviet nostalgics every 9th may gathering around their \"victory monument \" and I say their because 9th may 1945 isn't victory day for latvians it's just another reminder of Soviet occupation.\" They have to tolerate that, poor things. I guess it hurts to be reminded that you were on the losing side. \n\n3) This one comes from a butthurt Slavic cousin of ours, [This is why people hate Russia. Wherever there are lots of Russians, they try to turn everything they touch into shit. Because shit is what they're used to and what they like the most](http://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24qxlz/xpost_rrussia_large_prorussian_demonstration_in/ch9xdn8)- he truly grasped our national spirit. For some reason he also forgot to add that Russians are subhuman mongrels, I guess it doesn't fly with /r/Europe's moderators. 45 upvotes as of now.\n\nThere's also /r/politota which openly cheers on the deaths of people in Odessa. But I'm not going there anymore, those guys aren't even funny - the whole counter-culture anti-establishment political hipster routine is just...stale. \n\nSometimes I wish a jet black car would come after the ones who are willing to talk the talk online and make them walk the walk in the woods at night. \n\nP.S.\n\nYay I figured out what was wrong with the links - you gotta drop the www thingie and then it works.

{"body": "I most certainly ask why. Then I research it. They have done studies to ask why the gender gap exists. There are several ways to answer that question.\n\n* All men vs all women\n* men vs women in a specific field\n* men vs women with a given set of qualifications\n\netc. All of these factors can be measured, and some of them can be explained by various things. The first category, while interesting (women across the board make 77% of what men make across the board), is not what we should care about (thanks Obama), since that basically compares apples to oranges. Unfortunately there is a focus on that number by many women's rights activists. But if you drill down, you'll still find that there is a sexist bias against women in general.\n\nWhen considering all men vs all women, women chosing lower paying jobs is definitely a reasonable explanation, so I never argue this point, at least not with the 77% number. The US Department of Labor did a [study](http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf) that examined the *why* behind the 77% number. They found that there are several reasons, such as \n\n* More women work part time, which pays less than full time\n* A larger percentage of women leave work for child birth, child care, and elder care than men\n* Women, especially mothers tend to value \"family friendly\" work place poilicies, which tend to occur in lower paying jobs\n\nThese reasons are totally due to women's choices, and can't be attributed to direct sexism, though I'll address this again in a second. After adjusting for these factors though, there is still an unexplained 5-7% gap.\n\nWhen it comes to men vs women in a specific field (or for a specific job) it becomes harder to explain this away as \"choice\" [Studies by the BLS](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat39.pdf) have found that given a man and a woman having the same job, the man is far more likely to get paid more, at least in most industries (the opposite is true in a very few industries). \n\nConsider [blind auditions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_audition). It was found that when the people in charge of selecting the musicians couldn't *see* the musician, and only hear them, a woman's chance of advancing increased by 50%. This has nothing to do with choice, but rather the removal of a social bias against women.\n\nAdditionally, women are less likely to *get* the job they apply for. [In this study](http://www.uwlax.edu/faculty/anderson/Women/Sex%20Discrimination%20in%20Restaurant%20Hiring.pdf) men and women with identical (fake) resumes were sent out to interview for jobs at various restaurants. The women in the study had a 40% less chance of getting an offer, and 35% less chance of getting an interview in the first place.\n\nSo there are several factors that have nothing to do with choice that absolutely affect women. Even childless, highly educated women. But now, back to the choice bit. Socialization can play a big part in what job someone choses. Of course, no one is holding a gun to women's heads making us choose lower paying jobs, however, how girls are raised tends to encourage them to focus more on lower paying jobs. This is something that can't be addressed by laws however, rather a social change is needed.\n\nSo the goals of feminism to address the wage gap, in my opinion should be this:\n\n* Reduce the wage gap between men and women with similar education/experience/etc\n* Encourage young women to get college degrees in equal proportion to young men\n * Discover why there are currently less women in various degrees, for instance, computer science\n* Empower young women to chose work over family without experiencing social discrimination from others\n\nEqual opportunity is far more important than equal outcomes, and that's all I'm trying to accomplish.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399586335", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "fucking stop this shit.\n\ni saw ZERO threads in /r/mensrights made about Boko Haram before the story with the recent kidnapping hit the news. zero. i searched it. i have, however, found [multiple stories like this one](http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/11/29/nigeria-boko-haram-abducts-women-recruits-children) made MONTHS ago about the kidnapping and boys in Nigeria by them. here is one by National Geographic picked up two days ago that went [viral](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140508-nigeria-boko-haram-schoolgirls-shekau-abductions/). tell the truth: the media IS paying attention, human rights activists and reporters have been paying attention, you just don't like how they are reporting it right now and the fact the story focused on over 200 girls being kidnapped, as if it wasn't a win for EVERYONE that this terrorist group is finally being stopped.\n\nso if the media dropped the ball on this one and didn't report the killing and mutilations of young boys quickly enough, i got news for ya, MRA activists: YOU DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS ONE TOO. because MRAs certainly weren't clamoring to bring this issue to light until those poor girls got kidnapped. then suddenly, it mattered. suddenly, it was a men's rights issue to be addressed: not because the boys were suffering before, but because the media addressed it at the wrong time?!\n\nthis is NOT the way to think about this. horrible atrocities happen all the time and don't get adequate coverage. just because someone theoretically gets away with a crime nine times and doesn't get punished until the 10th crime, doesn't mean those other nine crimes don't count. what matters is the perpetrators get caught, people start paying more attention to human rights abuses, and we prevent things like this from happening again. \n\nthere is no media conspiracy or bias to ignore the suffering of young boys in Africa: quite the opposite in fact. the Boko Haram kidnapping got attention because it happened in broad daylight and quite a few girls escaped to bravely tell about what happened. for whatever reason, that was the final push needed to bring the situation to light. not because no one cared about the boys, not because they weren't suffering and no one was paying attention, but because Boko Haram itself staged an attack risky and visible enough that it was impossible to ignore. and it WAS ignored longer than it should have been anyways.\n\nagain i say: if you point the finger at the media for ignoring Boko Haram, you must point that finger back at yourselves. it's a shameful thing to exploit this tragedy to take potshots at the media when you damn sure didn't make a deal about it either, and you damn sure are lying about the media coverage. if you want an apology from the world for not addressing Boko Haram sooner then you'll be waiting: no one else here is exactly happy they got away with it either. it's a human rights tragedy, not a media plot to ignore men and boys. end of story.\n\nnow stop complaining about how we're not focusing on the RIGHT human rights atrocity here, and focus on the bigger issue: stopping human rights abuses, supporting organizations pledged to stopping them, and speaking out when they happen.\n\nby the way: the next time i see /r/mensrights use this as an issue to advertise the sub, you sure as hell should include a link to Amnesty International or the Children's Rights and Rehabilitation Group in Nigeria.  you change things by donating and acting for the groups that work against human rights abuses: not by saying \"gotcha!\" after the fact.\n\nedit: guilded twice, thanks!\nedit 2: downvotes, really?\nedit 2: brigade?! thanks, OBAMA!\nedit 3: NOT ALL MEN\nedit 4: downvotes, really?\nedit 5: this is now a spiderman thread.

{"body": "I've got a solution to your problems, now follow me on this one because it's kind of tricky. \n\nFirst - you need to sell your house and buy one worth at least $200k in a neighborhood with really high property taxes. The reasoning behind this is with higher property taxes you'll be able to lower your AGI (that's Adjusted Gross Income for you n00bs out there) thus lowering your taxable income and yearly taxes owed to the Feds. Thanks Obama!\n\nSecond - now that you have a more expensive home you'll likely have a higher mortgage. This is great news because now you'll be paying more interest each month, and thanks to Obama, you can deduct that from your income as well! Now you've further lowered your taxable income and you living a better life then ever before. \n\nThird- you need to have your wife start popping out babies, those things are like cash machines come tax time. Personally, I don't think one kid will put a big dent in your current situation, so I'd recommend In Vitro Fertilization in order to up your chances of having multiples, maybe you'll even get lucky and have 8 like Octo-Mom! Now that's a cash cow!\n\nFinally - if strongly suggest fining creative ways to increase your wealth, such as investing in exotic and new ideas like a true entrepreneur. My recommendation is DogeCoins, they're a huge money maker right now thanks to NASCAR, and I'll even give you your first coins to help get you started. +/u/dogetipbot 10 doge verify. \n\nGood luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400012282", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Wait guys, I've done all the work to figure this out:\n\n---\n\nSo, Staminus and Intreppid have gone down due to wild fires around San Diego. So, obviously, at least one of the two is based in San Diego. Now if I do my calculations correctly on my brand-new Abacus for Fedoras, and divide it by the year of Adolf Hitler's birth (1889) and add the digits of his month in the hundreds place and his day in the tens and ones place (420), and a bunch of other numbers to the negative 50th power, what do we get? That's right, 666.\n\n666 is the number of the beast, also known as the Devil, Satan, or Lucifer. But what exactly does the Devil rule over? Why, Hell, of course. And what is Hell commonly believed to consist of? Fire. And what is causing all these problems in the first place? Fire! *But wait, there's more!*\n\n... Was a sentence commonly said by what famous infomercial figure? Obviously Billy Mays. Now if we take his age of death (50), and the number of days between his death and the death of Michael Jackson (who died at the same age) before him (3), and multiply it together, we get 150... years old, which was how old sea turtles live according to Crush, who gave this news to none other than Marlin. Marlin... Marilin... Marilyn! Marilyn Monroe! And what was one of her movies? The Seven Year Itch. Seven years, sounds a bit **odd**, doesn't it? It is an **odd** number after all, but the whole thing in itself is fairly **odd**... parents. In The Fairly OddParents, Timmy Turner was 10 years old. The show's pilot first aired in 1998. So if we add the pilot's release year and Timmy's age, we get 2008.\n\nNow what's something that happened in 2008? Barack Obama won the election for President of the United States. When he won the election, his approximate percentage of the vote was 52.9%. Let's round that up to 53. Also, let's not forget that Wisconsin was one of the states in which Obama won. How many electoral college votes does Wisconsin account for? Once again, we get 10. So if we multiply Wisconsin's electoral college value and Obama's percentage of the electoral vote, we get 530.\n\nBut remember what we did with Hitler's birthday earlier? So we shouldn't see it as 530, we should see it as 5/30. May 30th. And what is something that happened on May 30? Saint Juan Diego, known for his miracle with Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico, died on May 30, 1548. But there's something about the name \"Diego\"... one rough translation is \"supplanter; he who replaces\". Saint Juan Diego... Saint ~~Juan~~ Diego... and of course, since we're talking about Mexico here, we should translate \"saint\" into \"san\". San Diego.\n\nNow we're back here. Now what system is having issues in San Diego that seems to be currently affecting the ShotBow Network? Why, of course, that would be Staminus. But if Staminus is in a city whose name is defined as a supplanter, and is also related to Hell, a place filled with fire, not only should Staminus be immune to fire since it's in its own lineage, but it should also be able to supplant, or replace, any damaged servers! They *must* be aware of this ability! And even if they are unable to do all this, Juan Diego is also in their lineage, and what did he perform? A miracle! Which is exactly what Staminus should be able to do for this situation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Staminus should easily be able to recover from this due to fire immunity provided by Satan, recovery provided by its home city's name, and its ability to perform miracles provided by Juan Diego. The fact that they haven't fixed it *immediately* shows that they are too lazy to do so, and we must switch providers.

{"body": "No. I disagree entirely.\n\nPersonally I do not believe that a half hostess/half kitchen runner counts as a tipped position, but I know I am likely on the losing side of that argument **however** all is not lost. *Probably*. \n\nJust to make sure I am correct, you're stating that if the restaurant had 3 waiters/waitresses and this hostess/runner person working, all three waiters/waitresses would be required to give him/her 50% of their total tips each? Despite that person making $2.10 an hour more? So the wait staff takes home 50% of their intended tips and the hostess takes home a combined 150% (roughly). No. That will not pass muster. This is an illegal involuntary tip sharing agreement. This could only be okay if it was voluntary. \n\nOr is it that each member of the staff must contribute half of their tips toward a pool that is then divided by all eligible staff? I.e. Persons A, B, C, and D (hostess) all contribute half of their total tips and if it was $100 each person (including the hostess) would take home $25 from that pool. This is (probably) a legal mandatory tip pool. Except that there is a real argument the runner/hostess doesn't get to partake. Being paid the full minimum wage with no tip credit points to this position not being one that would customarily receive tips, even if they interact with customers part of the time. A legal mandatory tip pool quickly becomes illegal mandatory tip sharing when an employee contributes nothing to the pool. \n\nIf it is the first, that is crazy, is the hostess/runner related to management? She should track every red cent of tips so they can possibly be sued for later. If she is close with her coworkers she might suggest to them that they should do the same. If instead it is the second scenario, 50% seems high to me, but the newest clarifications from the DOL have stopped positioning ~15% as the maximum in favor of ambiguity. Thanks Obama! (/s)\n\nEither way make sure your wife tracks her hours. Because she CANNOT be reduced below the Federal minimum wage of $7.25 by ANY tip pool.

The graphics and physics are similar to soaring. Some glider pilots swear by a program called Condor, but Silent Wings is free for two weeks. \n\nAs for navigation, use [SkyVector](http://skyvector.com/) and plot your flight. My rule of thumb is to divide 5280 by 2\\3rds (some like a half) of the first number in my Lift\\Drag Ratio to see how much altitude I need to have to fly one mile. Ex: My L\\D is 22:1 (Sgs 2-33), so I divide 5280 by 14.74, which means I need 358 of altitude per mile I want to fly. Multiply by the number of miles of distance you wish to fly.\n\nFor thermal prediction, I use blipmaps[](http://www.drjack.info/BLIP/NAM/index.html). The warmer the colors, the better the lift. Although I have had trouble finding good thermals this season. \n\nSource: 15 years of soaring experience, CPL, and soon CFI-G. \n\nGood luck! \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400295738", "subreddit": "Gliding", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;(For those who may think I'm hating on Obama, just look it up, and you'll see \"thanks Obama\" is a meme)\n\nEh, reposting memes, especially in a not particularly clever way, is usually grounds for downvoting in and of itself. The less shitty the subreddit your posting in is, the more you'll get downvoted for it (in the best subreddits, like askhistorians, you'll have your post deleted, be warned, and get banned after multiple violations). And it's just a fact that some meme's get stale really fast. I remember when I first just started here, I heard about this *awesome* meme from my co-workers, something that was briefly popular around 2007-2008, \"C-C-C-C-Combo breaker!\" And, in one of my first posts, well, I saw an opportunity to break a combo of posts, and thus couldn't wait to give my fellow redditors the gift of my witty contextually appropriate meme regurgation. To my dismay, \"C-C-C-Combo breaker!\" got around 40 downvotes, before I deleted it. \n\nAs it turns out, my group of coworkers was sort of a few months/years behind, redditors had, at that point, gone through a period of seeing nearly every combo post predictably get a reply of \"C-C-C-Combo breaker!\" for many months in a row, and eventually just got tired as shit of it. And then some dumbass waltzes back in and tells it again. \n\nAnd look, at this point we've all seen \"Thanks Obama!\" a thousand times, I had a Dark Souls mod that changed my death screen to \"Thanks Obama!\", and gone from laughing every time I saw it, to being kind of meh, to being mildly annoyed at myself for ever having installed it, to not bothering to reinstall when I downloaded the game again later. Let's be honest, meme's are shit, and this meme is just stale shit.

{"body": "I have \"weapons grade\" depression and anxiety. There is rarely a day that goes by that I don't consider ending it all. The irony is I'm too depressed to do it. It's not easy offing yourself. I've been to that threshold so many times it's frankly boring. \n\nIt takes a lot to kill yourself in my experience. There is a great fear of that unknown and of course being steeping in the Christian religion one expects to go immediately to Hell for everlasting fire and torment from our loving God. lol At some point you start to think \"fuck it\" you are already in Hell so why not just get to the real thing and start acclimating to it already. \n\nPeople become something you hate. Their attitude towards you and your depression is really annoying. Everyone is different about it, but they all feel entitled to weigh in on it. It's not your fucking life, fuck you. If I want to end it, who the hell do you think you are to stop me? \n\nI've learned not to talk about it with \"normal\" people, but only with fellow suffers who I know will not snitch me off and get me dragged out of my apartment and thrown in a nutter ward. Putting crazy people in with other crazy people is the damn dumbest thing, the most cruel thing and also one of the most entertaining things I've ever encountered. \n\nI've been in a nutter ward twice, the first time was a nightmare because I had to share a room with the most foul evil child molesting piece of shit to ever walk the Earth. The fucker was the most possessed person I have ever encountered, this guy was pure evil. Thanks Obama! (just kidding) I gamed the system as fast as I could to get out of that hell hole. The only thing I took away from it was \"wow, I'm not THAT fucked up, whew.\" \n\nI don't take their fucking pills anymore. I did for years and I felt like a soulless zombie and wanted to die even more so. How did I survive this long? Why haven't I just wondered out into a blizzard and froze to death like I almost died in the service? Freezing to death, that's the way to go, the Cadillac of suicide in my opinion. \n\nWell a fellow I knew came down with cancer and was so miserable he just wanted to die, so I suggested he try some weed because it classically helps those suffering like that. (Schedule 1 drug with no medical use according to our evil lying ratfuck needs a bullet in the head government) So I scored him some and in trying it out to make sure it was good, I discovered that it nuked my depression shitless. \n\nI found it can take me from \"fuck it all and fuck everyone\" jagged edge of let's end this nightmare to \"what the hell was I thinking?\" in a few puffs. I can actually not only be over whatever was fucking with me but function and enjoy life a little. \n\nAlso, the friend with cancer got over his depression, decided to fight it, continued with the chemo and is doing just fine. He was going to just let it take him, his misery levels were so fucking high he wasn't seeing a reason to keep living. Weed gave him a break from that mindset and helped him find the strength to keep on keeping on. No medical use my ass. Damnable lying filth. \n\nBut guess what? We are both criminals because we chose to use a medicine that WORKS. We haven't been caught, but it's something that looms over not only us, but countless others. I live in one of those puritanical bible belt states where fuckheaded religious people want to dictate how you live. It's also quite the industry for prisons and a great tool to jack people's lives up. Black people that are dumb enough to move here don't dare have it on them, they will go to prison. It's a handy tool to keep those kind of people down and out, them and the white trash. \n\nIf you are of the upper class here, you never worry about it unless you are really stupid with it. The corruption here is sickening in those regards. \n\nSo why don't I move? I've lived here about all my life. A move out of State with my financial ability is an impossibility. I'm on disability and I get monthly to live on what I used to walk around with in my pocket for spending money. I'm thankful for it, because without it I'd probably be knocking rich people in the head for their money and dead or in prison for my efforts. Probably the former because it's not like I have an overly abundant fear of death at this point. \"You'll never take me alive, coppers\" in an old movie voice. \n\nDid I mention anxiety problems? I get to where I can't even go outside my apartment to go get my damn mail in the building. It's either a panic attack if I do, or the fact that I fucking loath being around people. People always want to talk to me and I get tired of deflecting with small talk. It's exhausting. I don't answer the door or phone except for a select few. \n\nSo move to a new State so I can at last get my medicine without fear of being beaten, handcuffed, thrown in a cell and what little life I have ruined? Fuck if I had that much energy, I could probably just off myself and be done with this bullshit existence that I'm sick of. Honestly, I'm scared to move. It's a big unknown that could go horribly wrong and I'd have no place I'd feel safe. \n\nIf I was stronger and capable, I wouldn't feel like this to begin with. I'd be making some damn money and feeling good about myself and wouldn't have a need for weed other than for recreation now and then. \n\nHow does one stop being depressed? First I think environment is HUGE. One needs to change their environment completely. You need to get out of where you are and find a \"happy place\", some place new where everything you see doesn't remind you of something depressing. \n\nWhen I leave this bullshit town I'm in, my depression lifts like a weight. I've been in the back of an ambulance literally dying and felt my depression lift because I was out of this hell hole of a town. As soon as I'm on my way back to it, my depression starts and by the time I'm back in my apartment looking at these same walls, I'm depressed to the bone again. Ponder how jacked up that is, happier dying the back of an ambulance leaving. lol if only they had that in a pill. \n\nHelp? I don't want anyone's help. It's bad enough I get SSI and live in a housing project for poor and old people. I don't even get food stamps because of the stigma of paying for groceries with an EBT card. I used to have some pride, I was a damn \"job provider\" and owned some businesses before the great shit storm hit my life and wrecked my mental health. I'd rather eat a fucking bullet than be shamed anymore. Oh the delicious irony and karma, I was once a staunch Republican asshole who's now just a welfare dirtbag smoking weed. \n\nYou know what I do want? I want some justice. I want to be able to get medicine that works for me and improves my quality of life without being a criminal doing so. I want it to be legal so it's not so fucking expensive that I can't afford to have any life but it. I want it so that I don't have to suffer through \"dry\" periods because the draconian laws make it hard for the poor to get because all the fucking rich are smoking it. \n\nI just want my damn medicine that works so that I can claw my way back to something that resembles the life I once had. I want these crooked inhumane laws and those who perpetuate them to go fuck themselves. I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for the wicked to grow a soul, so I just by tenacity and sheer will and anger hold on. \n\nI feel like I'm an ugly stain on the fabric of this little town, and I will be damned if I give these pieces of shit the satisfaction of just killing myself. If you set by the river long enough, you will see the body of your enemy float by. Every day is a new day and the river keeps flowing. \n\nThat's how you beat depression, a long dirty knife fight within yourself. You cut away things inside you until there is nothing left that hurts you. It's a fight within yourself that obviously many people lose. Some get lucky and the pills help them. Some get lucky and things change for them. Some are just just tough in ways that are hard to measure. \n\nAll I know it's hard when my greatest most deadly enemy in the entire universe is myself. There's no winning, just survival. Think about it, to win I'd have to kill myself and that would be both winning and losing at the same time. I'd at last be free of my own fucked up self, but I'd be toast in the process. \n\nBut I smoke some weed, that all becomes crazy talk and stupid, I've got better things to do with my time.  Again, NO. MEDICAL. USE. lol I'm willing to bet these filthy fucking pharmaceutical companies have known this all along, but can't put it in pills when people can grow it in their garden and have a year's supply. How many have died that could have known relief, but didn't because of their greed and these evil as fuck laws put up by puppet politicians? \n\nI hope there is indeed a Judgement Day, I want to be in the bleachers eating popcorn as these fuckers get theirs for an eternity. \n\nSo I hope you enjoyed my little tour of crazytown. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400716062", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

But even administration allies say the numbers are not real and are being used to make the overall budget picture look better\nfrom: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17117430/ns/politics/t/veterans-face-budget-increase-then-big-cuts/#.U34Hm_ldXTo\n\nfrom 2008: Before Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, documents released by the Department of Veterans Affairs said it expected a maximum of 8,000 cases of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nHowever, according to a study released last year by the RAND Institute, there are more than 320,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghan wars suffering from major depression, PTSD and/or traumatic brain injury. The report found that the VA has been and continues to be ill-equipped to deal with these cases when soldiers return from combat, especially after multiple tours..\n\n\nAs for funding, Bush proposed a 0.5 percent budget increase for the VA for fiscal year 2006, which amounted to a “cruel mockery” of Bush’s promises to do everything to support veterans and soldiers, Rep. Lane Evans, D-Illinois, said at the time.\n\nEvans called Bush’s proposed budget increase for the VA “grossly inadequate,” saying it would force the VA to “ration” healthcare to veterans.\n VA officials had testified in 2005 that the agency needed at least a 13 percent increase to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of war veterans wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan and others who needed long-term mental health care.\n\nIn early 2007, the Washington Post put a spotlight on the human consequences resulting from the combination of Bush’s wars and the budget squeeze.\n\nThe Post published a series of articles documenting the substandard conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which is located only 4.7 miles from the White House.\n\nfrom: http://www.consortiumnews.com/2009/010609b.html\n\n\n\n\nSo yeahhh, thanks OBama!\n\n#facepalm", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400768745", "subreddit": "news", "score": -5, "controversiality": 1}

A is for awesome and F is for failure, and we (I'm dramatizing here) teach that if you don't get an A in every class, you're going to be a bum and a burden to society. We have zero-tolerance bullying policies that do nothing but rub salt, lemon juice, and broken glass in the wound of the victim. We have nearly eliminated the notion of failure as a learning experience, and instead create these hugbox environments where everyone has a place and everyone is a winner. We've standardized the curriculi so that everyone is held to the same standard; the smart ones are held back and the dumb ones are pushed forward. At no point does our educational system account for individual skills, aptitudes, or desires. We assume everyone wants to go to college and get a degree *regardless of whether or not that person can even AFFORD to go to college.* There are no separate schools for those wanting to pursue technical vocations, or alternative career options; we adopt a \"work harder, not smarter\" attitude and think that by cramming standardized tests and pointless homework assignments, we are somehow preparing them for life as a functioning adult. We don't teach them things like how to balance a checkbook, or how to start and invest in a savings account, or other useful skills that are both necessary and relevant for adult life. For fuck's sake, WE STILL HAVE SCHOOLS TEACHING CREATIONISM AND ABSTINENCE-ONLY SEX ED. The NCLB Act has let our government turn our education into nothing more than a bureaucratic farce.

Down many pounds! :D  My scale is fidgety and prone to giving me a few different weights every time I step on it (have to go with a best of 3, which sometimes takes 5-6 tries, ugh) so I decided to dust off my Wii board and see what that says.  After it chided me for not logging in for almost a year, it congratulated me for losing 7.8 pounds since my last check-in!  Amusingly, that was taken right at the end of one of those 10-day juice cleanses. :3   I think I'm going to start doing a weekly weigh-in there for posterity; even if it isn't completely accurate, it at least keeps the inaccuracies consistent.\n+ Work slacks that have been skin-tight in the thighs since I bought them are surprisingly loose.  Took me a minute to notice, but now that I have I'm having a hard time not tugging at them in little fits of glee.\n+ Seborrheic dermatitis around and in my ears (and often along the back of my scalp), bane of my existence, is starting to clear up!  I was resigned to an expensive and unhappy trip to the dermatologist at some point, but I think I'm going to let it be for now and see what happens.  \n+ Five Guys!  Ordered two little bacon cheeseburgers -- one in a leaf wrap and one in the bowl -- to see which I preferred.  Thinking I'm going to go with the leaf wrap next time.  Also those dudes are always so nice, it's always cheery going in there. :&gt;  DH ordered fries, and I remembered what I keep reading about people's tastes changing during keto.  As an, um, experiment, I tried a bite of those gorgeous, golden, salty fries ... and about spat it back out in horror.  All I could taste was peanut oil and the texture was like eating sand, oh my god. :o  A tiny disappointment (because hot damn, fries were my favorite!), and a big mental victory because there's nothing like realizing a favorite actually tastes like cat poo to keep you from wanting it.\n+ I can totally get behind bpc with kerrygold! :D I couldn't find any at my usual grocery, but I picked up a package across town and holy *crap* does it make a difference from the safeway generic unsalted butter.  I've gone from sort of choking it down and hoping I get used to it to actually enjoying it this morning.  Spendy, but pretty worth it imo.\n+ Awful depression when I started, feeling 2000% better by the day.  I'm actually excited to get out of bed in the morning for the first time in about six years, and not entirely sure what to do with that.  I'm not complaining at all!  It's just been an interesting shift for me; I feel sometimes like a completely different person.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Ended up getting Five Guys because I got a little overzealous in the Manager's Special area of the meat department and ended up picking up about 5 lbs of pork and a 4 lbs of chicken wings that were just funky smelling and gross when I went to use them. :&lt; Two meal plans destroyed in one evening, and several dollars wasted.  What a bummer!  Learned a lesson, though, so I guess it isn't a complete loss.  I really want wings now, though. \n- No three day weekend for me.  Thanks, Obama!  WAIT. I mean, thanks, retail!\n- Getting a bit hungrier, but the body's gearing up for shark week, so I ain't even (that) mad.\n~ Yeah, that's about it, really.\n\nThe Ugly:\nx One of my beloved furry children decided to leave me a present on the edge of my side of the bed, in the form of kitty puke. =_=  GROSS, GUYS, GROSSSSSSS.

{"body": "So we like to play games, we dress up, role play, bring our pets into the mix, the works.. One of my favorite games is the rapey, stabby game. (As a man all I ever fantasize about 24/7 is rape, anyway.) So bless my wife for allowing me to play out the most primal male fantasy that every man has had ever, including your father. Anyway when I get back from work she's in the kitchen looking sexy as fuck, my blood boils, and I just HAVE to jump her. I throw my briefcase down and grab the largest butcher knife off the rack. She looks at me confused, and I'm instantly aroused that she's already getting into character. I tell her I'm going to murder her in front of her whole family and I lunge at her just narrowly missing her windpipe with surgical precision. She screams \"WHAT THE FUCK?!!,\" and tries to smash the salad bowl over my head. I take a mere glancing blow and the food has spills all over the floor. Holy shit she's into it today. She looks into my blood crazed eyes and begins to realize the gravity of the situation. Yes. This. Is. Happening. She turns to run, but it's too late. I knew she would try to and I already have her wrapped tightly within my tentacles. She starts weeping fairly realistically and just pleads \"Why?.... Why are you doing this?\" I can't believe how good shes acting. The realness of it all accelerates my boner toward godmode. I can no longer control myself, I punch her in the jaw and send her spiraling toward the ground. She lands on her stomach, so I jump onto her back, breaking her hip in the process. I shred her pants off in a single motion like a basketball player entering the court. Holy shit. Her ass looks amazing. Like a fitter version of my wife, I don't know how I hadn't noticed this before. We've never done anal, but the pristine specimen in front of me was just begging to be defiled. I plunge my cock deep into her asshole, and she screams louder than she ever had. The situation is just too hot, I'm almost at my limit. I try to focus my mind, and I'm overcome with a second wind. I decide to kick it up a notch and I begin choking her. In turn her asshole tightens around my cock, I'm writhing in pleasure as I continue to pound her shitty butt. The tighter my grip becomes, the tighter hers does as well. Almost there, I squeeze every ounce of remaining strength I have left into trying to end her air supply. My... mind... becomes... muddled... vision.. is.. fading... thighs.. trembling... the bass drops. All thought stops, as I float into a sea of ecstasy. Slowly, little by little, I fall back to earth, reality comes back into view, with a dumb look on my face, I finish pumping my seed into her dead lifeless corpse. Just at the moment my wife walks into the room, looks at me, her sister, and the camera I setup to record it all. She pats me on the back as we chuckle and shrug into the camera, thanks Obama.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401321589", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}
