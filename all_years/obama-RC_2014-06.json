{"body": "This is painful to type, but it's about time. About exactly a year ago, I was depressed. I just wasn't satisfied with my life. I was bored. I didn't have anything to do in life, I didn't see a purpose. I was depressed, but I wasn't like sad if that makes sense. I was introvertive so that didn't help either. I wanted to kill myself just to get out of the purgatory of my life. I was on facebook about a week or so I had planned to do it, when I saw someone posting the stupidest shit I've ever god damn seen in my entire life. I laughed. I was friends with this girl on facebook, I'm not entirely sure how we officially met to this day, but she was already on my friends list at this time. I looked through her profile and it was extravagant. She lived a punk rock, go out with friends, do stupid shit, goofy, no regrets, lifestyle. I realized that's something I wanted. I never had true friends and I never any memorable moments. Something I wanted. I saw [this movie](http://vimeo.com/36170225) and I realized I want to be able to have nostalgia. After all, these are the best years of my life. I should mention I'm in high school. Grade doesn't matter. Also I'm a guy as that's relatively important I suppose.\n\nSo I message her. Remember folks, I'm on neck beard status when it comes to social skills at this point, so the conversation basically goes,\n&gt;**Me:** Hi\n\n&gt;**Her:** HEY THERE HI\n\n&gt;**Me:** Why is your life so interesting?\n\n&gt;**Her:** Wut\n\nYeah. That was the first thing I said to her, well the first thing she responded to, after saying hi in 14 different languages using translate hoping for a response, then saying \"Thanks Obama\" when I didn't get an immediate one. Anyways, we talked for a while about getting in trouble with the cops and movies we like and I realized that maybe my life wasn't so boring, but it certainly had some improving to do. Throughout the rest of the year I got into skating, punk rock, and different kinds of cultures through which I become more sociable. Without her that wouldn't have happened otherwise, and I wouldn't have met some of my best local friends. (She lives half way across the country evidently.) We were like siblings. We never got romantic ever and neither of us wanted that. I was talking about visiting her, and I had saved up about $500 dollars, and she was down. \n\nIf things had gone that way, well, I wouldn't be typing this right now, and I'd be halfway across the country at this very moment. \n\nAbout a month ago she blocks me on everything without warning. Just like that. I have no idea what happened. I didn't have the guts to talk about it to mutual friends. They were her friends first anyways. I have no idea what happened, and any attempts of contacts are to no avail.\n\nI still see her comments above mine on mutual friends posts. It's awkward to say the least. She was like family to me...\n\n**TL;DR:** Fuck you, [listen to this and cry with me while you read what I just fucking wrote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QrCFSJyabs&amp;feature=kp)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402035567", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Actually, I checked the picture of the check I took when I got it to show off and say, \"Thanks Obama!\" on the facetubes; it was a total of $861.35. That was honestly a good 100 more than what I expected.\n\nI'll try to extrapolate on the total.\n\nThere is $.53 per mile, my mileage from my house to the court house is like 113ish miles. The first night, I booked a hotel stupidly 30 miles away from the court house. I guess they give you mileage to your house to the hotel you stayed in and then to the court house and back. Second night the hotel was only three miles away which was nice. \n\nI believe they gave like...55 dollars for food and beverage? It was something like that. \n\nForty dollars a day to just show up and be there. \n\nTimes that by two, the amount I first got was about $747 dollars which I was like, fuck yeah! But the check came in and it was a good 120 over and I was like, I don't know how that happened, but fuck yeah! :D\n\nAlso, I live in Idaho and this was FEDERAL, not local. Locally, jury duty sucks dickass and isn't worth it. Mileage is about 30 cents I think and very little, probably 20 to show up. When I got my local jury summons, I accidently tore the side of the summons so that only an inch was hanging on the side and did a shitty job of taping it up, they left me alone. Year later, the feds got me for jury duty and I was so pissed because the fucking court house is 113 miles away from me! \n\nBy the way, I wish I actually did serve on the jury because the case was interesting as fuck and loaded with drama. I was reading today that the case is suspended because one of the FBI prosecutors committed suicide out of nowhere. On the day of jury selections, one of the potential jurors knew a person on the witness list as they serve as a member on their company board. \n\nNot only that, but I did the math and if I did serve on the jury for about seven weeks three times a week, I would have made off close to a whole $3,000 before hotel, gas, and food. My lovely horseless carriage got about 33 miles during the winter when I had my summons. Damn...but that would have been over 3,600 miles put on my car in about two months when I needed to have done a tranny flush, half shaft axles needed replacing, alternator needed replacing, and a coolant flush as well let along the fact I was going to be in Seattle the last expected week of the trial. It was actually a nice experience because I got have a baby vacation and discovered some awesome B tracks from this really great album off of Xbox Music on the drive there;  as well as wearing my sexy leather jacket to show the court people I'm hardcore as fuck. \n\nAnd to top it off, I had to leave work four hours early Super Bowl Sunday to make it there Monday morning safely; I was paid for jury leave at work.

Absolutely not.\n\nThen they announced Austin, TX -- also a huge city that is uniquely full of a young and techy demographic that promises massive conversion rates.\n\nFinally they then announced *nine* massive metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City, San Antonio and San Jose, all of which are large population centers that once again justify the cost.\n\nIn the middle of all this, Provo, Utah individually negotiated a unique deal with Google where the local municipality would sell their existing infrastructure to Google for $1 (yeah, that's *one dollar*) in exchange for Google *updating* this infrastructure and using it to deliver free Gigabit internet to 25 public institutions and offer every resident of the city free 5Mbps service after a massively discounted activation fee ($30 versus $300 in Kansas City).\n\nSo we're not ignoring anything here. The only small municipality that Google is reaching is Provo, and they're only doing that because the city is one of the few in the US that own their own infrastructure (oh look, it's socialism!). They've used it as a bargaining chip to attract Google to their area. It's something that very few cities will be able to do.\n\n&gt;Could it also be that there is only one company giving last mile service in small municipalities because of the way the industry was regulated to begin with?\n\nIf you can find evidence of this, we can start discussing it. Nothing I've seen so far has led me to this conclusion. If anything, we're doing an atrocious job by *not* regulating almost any ISP practices. We used to have some semblance of public oversight right up until a cable company shill was assigned to be the FCC chairman (thanks, Obama!) and started dismantling every little thing that protected Net Neutrality all this time (remember, this wasn't an issue 5-6 years ago).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402084996", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;So when the ACA was passed that forced people to have healthcare against their own will, that was, by definition, in the interest of more liberty?\n\nThis is one of my favorites. It illustrates the amazing ability of fox-fed conservatives to believe 2 contrary notions at the same time.\n\nWhen you refused to get coverage, the rest of us who already paid premiums, paid *for you* when you went to the ER and got treated without coverage, and were obviously unable to pay the whopping bills. \n\nYou also claim that the poor on welfare are \"moochers\" who take and we give.\n\nBut you didnt mind taking when we gave for your ER visits. Then you weren't a moocher. LOL\n\nNow you have to have *personal accountability* -remember that phrase? And now, you don't like it. That's really funny.\n\nAnyway, I have a young friend, probably your age -25. He was so steamed about the evil Obama forcing him to have insurance. Last month he was diagnosed with cancer. He saw the hospital bill he didnt have to pay thanks to that evil Obama and said, \"wow, this time I guess I really mean it when I say 'thanks, Obama.' The bill was over 30,000 dollars.\" \n\n&gt;Hate and division... That is something the democrat party is heavily into. Ever heard of the War on Women?\n\nLike when the republican said when a woman gets pregnant from rape it's God's will or when the republican said women shouldnt be allowed to vote? Or when they forced women to undergo simulated rape with a vaginal wand because they are staunchly pro-life when it comes to abortion (but not when it comes to war and executions)? Is the desire to keep the income lower for women doing the same job or is it the oft-heard rhetoric about proper christian women submitting to their husbands? Which war on women did you mean?\n\n&gt; How about when democrats say we are trying to bring blacks into slavery? \n\nWas this when Biden made this remark or was it when republicans made the remarks about Obama only getting votes because he gives blacks free stuff? Something tells me you tune out half the things said, picking the ones you like. As you see, I hear both sides.\n\n&gt;Even better, how about gay people because we don't believe in widespread enforcement of gay marriage laws that contradict several State Constitutions? \n\nContradicting the laws bigots put into the constitution that goes against the United States constitution? The laws they put in there to *limit other people's freedoms*? Was this that love of liberty you spoke of? \n\n&gt;They pick one group of people, usually industries, demonize them for whatever, then pass laws while the public has hate towards them.\n\nOh yes, demonizing those poor, innocent industries and passing those evil laws that force them not to let their employees die in shitty conditions for pennies? Those laws? Those conditions *the GOP wants to bring back by their own admission?* I think they adequately demonize themselves, my friend.\n\n&gt;Also, if Liberals loved Liberty, why are they so for the restriction of their 2nd Amendment rights?\n\nAre they all so for the restriction of 2nd amendment rights? I think you need to talk to more liberals and you'll find a lot of, me included, are not anti-gun. But yes, some want *some* restrictions. You have noticed all of your freedoms have some restrictions, right? Can you currently own a nuclear bomb? Can you drive you car 120 mph on your neighborhood road legally? You can hunt -but have you heard of hunting limits and why theyre there? Golly, sounds like we don't have total anarchy -we have freedom, but with sensible restrictions.\n\n&gt;Why are they so interested in having national databases on everything?\n\nBoth sides seem bent on that. Like the NSA issue. You havent seen the GOP spend even a fraction of the time on the NSA as they did on Obamacare. In fact, they don't seem to really oppose it at all. I think there are a handful on both sides against it, and the vast majority of both parties are just mum.\n\n&gt;Why are they so interested in targeting Conservative groups and attacking them through the IRS? \n\nThe IRS realized that TEA party groups were getting tax breaks illegally, pretending they were not political groups. It only seems like they were being \"targeted\" because they were the ones doing it. That's like saying \"isnt it unfair how the police target criminals?\" \n\n&gt; How do higher taxes mean more liberty? \n\nDid you ask Bush when he only lowered taxes for the rich?\n\n&gt;It's a good thing that the Republicans have been around to free the slaves and end Jim Crow laws. \n\nAnd then your history book ran out of pages apparently and you missed how the party was taken over by bigots and ex-slave owners.\n\n&gt;You are denying your being a bigot.\n\nYes, because I'm not a bigot. I believe in equal rights for *everyone*. Anyone, of any ethnicity is welcome to marry into my family. No one should be denied work, homes, food, a seat in a restaurant, or anything based on their sex, sexuality, age, ethnicity, etc. Now are you going to tell me the same is true of you? Given the only racism you have ever mentioned was the racism perpetrated against Zimmerman (or more correctly, how the news made his statement seem racist through editing, which is not the same as racism against him) I think that's very telling. You haven't mentioned all of the people who have lost liberty, life and limb in this nation, even in recent history, because they were black or gay -it just burned you that zimmerman was wronged -and he was in that incident wronged. I honestly think that tells me everything right there.\n\n&gt;It's quite clear that you calling me a bigot is supposed to make me cower or something.\n\nNo, I have no need of your cowering. I just want you to be honest for a change instead of spewing these fox news talking points that you ultimately really don't believe in. Be honest. I may not respect racists, but I have some measure of respect for the ones that at least don't pretend they aren't.\n\n&gt;If they don't believe in liberty, they have to be a bigot.\n\nAs always, folks like you use 2 unrelated propositions to fool people. No one said you were a bigot because you don't believe in liberty (and you have made it clear you dont). You are a bigot because you are a racist homophobe. I don't even hate you for being it, unlike you. I'd love it if you'd get educated and drop the emotional baggage you were raised with that makes you hate other people for being different than you but I'm not going to tie you to the back of a pick up and drag you until you die. Oddly, some of the \"christian\" conservatives of the south have done that very thing and things like it to blacks and gays. Now, I'm not saying you're that bad -I really doubt you are. But don't claim that I hate you, as you seem to keep doing, when you clearly don't know what hate is. \n\nI often wonder how you'd feel if we turned all of this on you. You know, did the very things you seek to do to others. Like, remember the Arizona law that was supposed to promote religious freedom by allowing people to ban gays from their stores and services? I bet you think that's freedom. I wonder if we passed a law that allowed us to ban christians would you feel the same? Or charging republicans double for products and services. I think you'd very quickly cry oppression. Funny, we don't do that -and you already think you live under tyranny because you have to pay for health insurance. Imagine if we had the police raid your churches and beat your parishioners and rape them in the churchyard -like was done to gays for decades in the US.\n\nMy friend, you think I'm a liberal drone but all I am hearing from you are standard talking points and you cannot seem to deviate from the script. You can't see it, but the drone is you. And I'd love it if we could talk like human beings and change that, rather than spit epithets at one another. That's something else we are free to do. \n\nI think there is common ground between left and right and in all honesty that division is being widened not by the left, not by the right, but by the billionaires who fund things like FOX and MSNBC because so long as they can keep us in a civil war they can take advantage of us. Consider protecting your freedom from them; they are far more your enemy than I am.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402244952", "subreddit": "Liberal", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "OK, we have to get something straight-- I don't have television. I don't watch Fox news. You have to come to terms that I do not speak for Fox News, nor do they speak for me. I am a conservative. Your bigotry towards me is mind-numbing.\n\n&gt; When you refused to get coverage, the rest of us who already paid premiums, paid for you when you went to the ER and got treated without coverage, and were obviously unable to pay the whopping bills.\n\nSo where do we get the money for the ER visits? Well the hospitals pay for them in exchange for tax-write offs as charity. Most states will pay these visits through cigarette taxes. After the ACA goes into affect, and we all have higher premiums and people have lost their health insurance because of it- or even worse, their jobs, what happens to those funds raised for people who don't have insurance? Well, they have insurance now, so we are double taxing people for something they don't want nor, in most cases, need.\n\nIn addition to the wonderful liberties the liberal party spreads, how about the freedom of religion? Now the ACA is forcing religious institutions to practice medicine they don't believe in as a matter of their religion. That's not spreading liberty, that's spreading misery to them.\n\n&gt; You also claim that the poor on welfare are \"moochers\" who take and we give.\n\nI didn't say that. But now I will. There are thousands of people on welfare who are 2nd and 3rd generation welfare recipients. There are thousands of people who take advantage of the system. It's almost not their fault, because the democrats have taken many of the provisions of welfare away, like the one where you were given a job as per welfare. They don't require that anymore. How horrible it must have been to force people to work for money.\n\nAnyways, about your friend, there are thousands of people who lost their coverage so that your friend could have his insurance. It's not thanks Obama, it's fuck Obama.\n\nYou want to talk about a few republicans, and you're going to ignore Ted Kennedy killing a woman. \n\nWomen's Suffrage was passed by 37 Republican senators joined 19 Democrats to pass the amendment.\n\nSo, it was republicans keeping the women down? hmph. Seems like there were a lot more democrats wanting women not to vote. Bigots.\n\n&gt; Was it Biden...\n\nNo, it wasn't Biden, it was democrats throughout history that have voted for slavery and Jim Crow laws. You seem to be missing that in your history book.\n\nTo your next point about the Constitution giving the right to marry anyone they want to whatsoever... No, you are absolutely wrong about that. However, as I have stated, it is left that way so that the government may respect any state's law passed on their view of marriage. The federal government was only formed so that we could have a stronger union, a single currency, and raise an army. Remember, we were the Confederate States of America before the United States of America. The Constitution was put in place so that we could slow the growth of the government and leave the majority of the laws up to the States. If you were to ask me if I was for a State run healthcare system, I'd say no, but way more for it than a federal one that was passed illegally.\n\nBut furthermore, with the individual mandate, why stop at health insurance? Why was it 1/6th of the economy Obama targeted? Why not go over home owner insurance, fire insurance, life insurance? Health insurance is by far the most intrusive. That's one idea. But with all of the histeria over how many people were uninsured, 13 million, which was a lie when broken down, how many new recipients of healthcare are there? Because it seems they can't get their numbers right. Billions and billions and billions of dollars spent for how many people? Not 13 million new insured, not even fucking close to that. What a shame. What a waste.\n\nSo you're for equality, eh? What about pedophiles that want to marry children under the age of 18 even though they are consenting? What about more than two people? What is the definition of marriage at that point? You're so open and loving- does it mean that any group of adults can create a commune of marriage? Seems like you're for that.\n\nWhat's more pitiful is that you are saying I'm bigoted because I haven't mentioned people of color or sexual orientation who have lost life or limb. Under what circumstances are we talking? War? Tons of people do that. Hate? I won't even mention that. Why? Because there are sick bastards all over the world that target people for any reason. What about all the whites that have been targeted because they were white? Remember the backlash in LA from the Zimmerman trial, all the whites that were targeted. What do we do with them? Why mention or give light to sickness? \n\nAnyways, more to type, but family is calling.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402272401", "subreddit": "Liberal", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First, I dont think there is enough data here to understand why NI did what they did. So the pointless \"Thanks Obama/Thanks Perry\" comments are pretty off base. \n\nSecondly, if you think the decision to expand to Asia is a simple as \"cheap labor\" and anti 'murica, then you really need to educate yourself as to what NI does. Their entire business is set up to support design and manufacturing of products. \n\nDo you know where products come from? They come from Asia. NI is facing exceptional pressure from both international and indigenous Asian competition. Part of the advantage of moving the engineering offices to Asia (if they choose to do that) would be to speed up their time to market and give them much more flexibility and understanding of their customers needs. \n\nFor those of you that have never worked in Asia, I think you would be stunned at what is going on. In the US if you need a sample part from a vendor, you fill out a form, talk to a salesperson wait a few weeks and hopefully the part shows up. \nIf you need a part in China, you call them up, the company will have a driver bring over the part within the hour along with the engineer that designed it so she can answer any questions. [This can happen in cities like Shenzen which have complete manufacturing ecosystems in place] Need a change to a driver board? No problem, the will send over and engineering team the next day along with a finance guy to get a manufacturing proposal together. \n\nDr. T is no fool, he knows he has to balance a lot of factors in this decision. \n\n[No, I am not painting China or South Asia as some Halcyon Rainbow Land, it is super fucked up in a lot of ways I am just highlighting one element]", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402501522", "subreddit": "Austin", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, I like you.  You seem like a level headed reasonable dude so I am going to risk bringing up a point that usually does not go over well.  Lets talk about checks and balances for a second.  In america we have 3 major bodies of federal government because well benevolent dictatorship would be the best form but we cant trust it right?  We have the 4th amendment because while it would be much easier for \"cops to catch robbers\" without it we cant trust they wont abuse that power.  We have the first amendment to make sure when they do overstep their authority we can make other people aware of it before it gets out of hand.  In recent history with the NSA spying, the executive branch declaring \"**WAR** ™\" without congressional approval, whistleblowers being chased out of the country and filming police encounters resulting in beatings, imprisonment and even death these checks and balances have had their value become more and more apparent.  \n\nWe would like to think we have evolved as a species and society to the point where they are unnecessary but history and current events have shown otherwise.  The 2nd amendment is the last vestige of power to prevent all the others being violated.  God save us if/when we need it for its true intended purpose but we will be damned without it.  \n\nI could argue that bb guns are lame (muscle car racing and governed electric go kart racing are not the same), I could argue that disabling collectors items are lame (medieval weapons that have been blunted/peacebonded is silly) but im not.  Im talking about why I and many others really give a shit.  \n\nIt's not about hunting, I personally prefer the challenge of archery when elk or turkey hunting.  Its not about self defense, I personally live in a nice middle class neighborhood and I own dogs and an alarm system.  Its not even about hobby shooting, while fun that shit gets expensive (Thanks Obama..... just kidding).  Its about the fact that I have seen our country and world slowly degrade in the 31 years I have been on the planet.  \n\nThe federal government is overstepping its bounds in every venue and arena it can.  Our economy is in complete turmoil and I am facing the prospect of a very probable complete crash in the future.  Our environment is spiraling out of control causing historical droughts and storms.  We are running out of energy sources faster than we are discovering them.  The world is moving away from the petro dollar (and rightly so) which is the only thing that allows our american way of life (consume consume consume) to exist in its propped up state.\n\nThis will fall apart.  It is unsustainable.  And when it does things are going to get nasty.  People are going to turn on each other.  The government is going to seize control of everything in a last ditch effort to prevent wide spread chaos.  When that happens I want to be damn sure that I can protect myself and my family from others the government included.\n\nThe way I see it there are three possible futures in my lifetime.  Here they are in order of what I see most likely:\n\n1. It happens in a similar fashion to what I described above\n\n2. We somehow manage to kick the can down the road for 1 more generation meaning I am leaving it to my kids to deal with.\n\n3. Aliens.  Fucking romulans come in and violate the prime directive, vaporize all nukes and weapons and provide us with free energy machines. lol.\n\nSorry for the \"crazy\" rant but it would be intellectually dishonest of me to say anything else when backed into the corner we are having this conversation in.

{"body": "-I had never watched an episode of Quantum Leap before this episode, though I had heard about it mostly because if this stupid podcast called Continuecast that nobody listens to.\n\n-Overall I greatly enjoyed this episode, it reminds me of a time when sci-fi series and movies were just becoming popular and there were so many different styles, both colourful/gritty and heart wrenching or thought provoking. Whereas these days most sci-fi needs to be dark and gritty (Thanks Obama and Abrams!).\n\n-Many of the scenes were beautifully shot and subtle from the song playing when he wakes up {\"the future is not ours to see...\"} to the dialogue free scenes when the wives look up and its clear that the writers trust the audience to understand the situation without one of the wives saying \"IM SAD AND WORRIED FOR MY HUSBAND\". Also the show is incredibly subtle with it's sci-fi elements and refrains from blowing its wad too early with pointless CGI and effects, instead relying on the acting and writing to carry it through. {with great effect I might add}.\n\n-Also I found that this episode played with my emotions and did a very good job of conveying the feelings felt by the protagonist throughout, either by the internal monologue or through his own acting. \n\n-Something that I commend this episode greatly for, is that there is NO ANTAGONIST in this episode! There is no villain that needs to be stopped or a plan that needs to be foiled, just a situation in one man's life that needs to be corrected. That combined with the fact that there is comedy, colourful characters and real human emotion sets it leagues ahead of many sci-fi shows already!\n\n-The phone scenes, or where he finds out his name are in my opinion the highlights of this already amazing episode. They invoke real human emotion and feelings in this bizarre situation, which is {in my opinion} what real sci-fi should be about. \n\n-Last point, I feel as though this plot could be a metaphorical allegory to the theme of how many people feel adrift throughout their daily lives and have no idea what to do or how to proceed much like the protagonist. I mean what if today could be a life changing day for you and you don't know it yet, how would you act?\n\n-Did people in the 50's shave in the shower?? Where they that short on time? Also his cheeks were already as smooth as a baby's bottom!\n\n-Fun fact: Captain Tony is played by an actor who's last name is \"Poindexter\"!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402558608", "subreddit": "SyndicationStation", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I can vouch for that in my area, your phone data is safe from the police. This isn't a T.V. show like NCIS or CSI : Miami. The police have tons of nifty tricks up their sleeves, as far as I know, this isn't one of them.\n\nHonestly, the only thing this article is good for in my opinion is another excuse to say \"Thanks Obama\".\n\nOh, and this article links to other ridiculous overdramizations like 'Militarizing the Police'\n\n\"Hey, the crime rate is lowered! That means you can stop using better equipment right?\"\n\nAre you kidding me? The reason why they were able to lower the crime rate was because of this new equipment, taking it away would just help the crime rate come back up. You don't take away something that is working just because you feel safer in the moment, cause then more people will get hurt.\n\nI see these Policemen go through terrible things just so that they can protect the innocent. If you look through most police handbooks, and check out sections pertaining to crime scenes or potential areas of danger, they put higher priority on keeping good people out then bad people caught so that in case something bad happens, good people don't get hurt.

{"body": "&gt;I always dismissed Ron Paul because he's basically a YEC,\n\nI'm not aware of anywhere he said \"I'm basically a YEC.\" But let's assume he did:\n\nThere's still a difference. He had a clear record of separation of church and state, and adhering to the constitution. He was known by his colleagues as \"Dr. No\" because anything that wasn't strictly allowed by the constitution, wasn't allowed--the original intent behind the constitution.\n\nSo if, for example, you were a scientist, or a atheist, Ron Paul was one of the best choices because--unlike most candidates--he has a distinction between his personal views and his political ones. \n\nAs a scientist, his pro stance on stem cell research is welcomed. He can talk about a Young Earth all he wants as long as we can still get funding for our real research. He is also pro-nuclear and anyone with the slightest understanding of chemistry is basically 100% for nuclear power and replacing all these coal plants--my state having the largest [coal slurry spill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_Fossil_Plant_coal_fly_ash_slurry_spill) in the history of the USA.\n\nMoreover, Ron Paul voted against the PATRIOT ACT, the REAL ID act, the NSA massively wire tapping American citizens. He's clearly against an abusive government, and was the ONLY Republician to vote against the Iraq war! Think about that, 12 years later, we're still suffering from the decision to go to war with Iraq.\n\nRon Paul is also against torture. When all the other candidates during the primaries said \"I'm not a military leader, I can't tell you one way or another.\" To which McCain replied, with tears in his eyes, \"I'm telling you. It is, torture.\"\n\nMy point is not that he's an angel sent down from on high, but someone with clear stances who consistently abides by them.\n\nAnd my thought is: Would you rather have someone you know you disagreed with one some issues, or someone who tells you everything you want to hear--but never follows up on any of them?\n\nBecause Obama promised government transparency and then goes and elects the head lobbyist for Cable to the head of the FCC. Thanks Obama.\n\nIn the end Ron Paul failed to gain the presidency, but not because of his stances, so much as his inability to be as charismatic and calm as the other candidates. He would notably get very energetic when confronted with \"bullshit\" from the other candidates, and I've learned in my later years, whoever gets \"worked up\" is the one that seems to lose a debate.\n\n/rant", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403637850", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I don't mind paying taxes when I can see the benefit to Joe Everyman's (that's me) day-to-day life. \n\nWe're the richest, most powerful nation on Earth, and we can't seem to figure out how to teach our kids to read, how to keep one another healthy without the \"bread line communism\" mentality, and how to not charge each other $50 bucks for 5mL of eyedrops and $200 for an aspirin and what not. \n\nThe system is fucked. It's ridiculously complicated. EXCUSES. I'm expected to believe that the nation who put people on the fucking moon in the 60's with a fraction of the computing power in my goddamn phone can't figure out how to spend some of it's trillions of dollars on healthcare and education instead of how to kill people halfway across the world? Fucking please. \n\nWe're America. We can do anything. We just have to stop being so goddamn greedy and spend our money on shit that makes more sense, like being educated and healthy, instead of yet another nuclear sub or aircraft carrier. \n\nSo yes, I'd pay more. A lot more. If there was a tangible, day-to-day benefit. Because right now I'm paying down the mouth and up the ass and I'm getting jack shit for it. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403723428", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;The US government gives away more welfare to corporations and the wealthy than to the poor.\n\nNo, it doesn't, and this argument is tired and needs to be put to bed. The US subsidies some industries. The US gives tax breaks to some industries. But very few industries are only getting by thanks to the government, and never the ones you would think of (oil, Walmart, Koch).\n\n&gt;If you own a pro sports team, we taxpayers will build your stadium for you. \n\nTaxpayers vote on these stadiums. Vote no and get others to vote no next time they appear on the ballot if the issue is that important to you. Just remember that teams come and go, but stadiums are tied to the city they are built in. It's a massive investment to build a stadium, and, considering it's an avoidable investment, why wouldn't an owner at least try the ballot?\n\n&gt; If you want to drill for oil then sell it, not to America but to China, we will give you an oil lease. \n\nWhy does that matter? Is it still an American company? Great, so American workers are being paid. Are they still paying the American government for the lease? Great, so the American government is being paid.\n\n&gt; If the poor or middle class work, they are taxed at regular rates but if you are super rich and make more money in financial markets, you are taxed at a lower rate.\n\nAgain, misleading. Yes, capital gains are capped out at a 15% tax, however,[ the wealthy are still paying a bigger chunk of the taxes than anyone else.](http://taxprof.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4eab53ef014e883cee91970d-500wi)\n\n&gt;We give farm price supports for farmers not to work.\n\n*Thanks, Obama.* In all seriousness, I am completely opposed to farm subsidies. The reason why many American food products have \"High Fructose Corn Syrup\" instead of real sugar is because corn is subsidized to be cheaper than sugar. Get rid of the subsidies (which, by the way, FDR implemented).\n\n&gt;We pay for scientific research then let pharmaceutical companies charge us excessively high rates for the medicines. \n\nTrue for some medicines, not all. I'd love to see some research on this. Pharmaceutical companies have very high entry costs for medicines that are cheap to manufacture. Investing $10 billion into a drug that can made for 5 cents doesn't make sense unless you get a patent on the drug and can charge a lot for it.\n\n&gt;The rich make their money on the backs of the poor.\n\nIt's give and take. Labor is only half of what makes a business work. The other half is capital. The reason that investing is so popular and that capital gain are only taxed at 15% is that the government does not want to discourage investing which is beneficial for companies. The job availability doesn't exist without the rich, but the work isn't done without a worker. That's a pretty gross simplification, but is pretty true.\n\n&gt;The Conservatives in the US will enslave you if they had a chance. \n\nOkay now we're just getting into flat-out attacks. You might not like conservatives but they are not your enemy. People have different views from you. That doesn't mean they want you enslaved.\n\n&gt; You don't have to be poor.\n\nYou're right, but assuming that the GOP is the reason you are poor is absurd. There are a myriad of reasons for the current poor economy. The reason conservatives resent the idea that the government should be helping everyone is that we believe it negates all personal responsibility. The government isn't your mother. If you are disabled or mentally handicapped, you should be able to receive help. But blaming the government or conservatives or the rich when you are not successful is just silly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403865885", "subreddit": "politics", "score": -2, "controversiality": 1}

Next time, I'll be more detailed when I imply that crazy people will be crazy regardless of the reasons you try to pin on them. Individual responsibility and all that. \n\nThat is the core of the analogy. Believing that religious influence must somehow be special is misguided and only tells of your own baggage. We don't go to the government and tell them to ban alcohol because alcoholics hurt people, we blame the drunk for his actions and hold them accountable while others can have their drinks and hurt no one.\n\nAnyway, I thank the heavens for the butter bestowed on my head.
