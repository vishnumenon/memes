{"body": "&gt; If the NATO wouldn't have intervened, Gadhaffi would've levelled Benghazi and its inhabitants. NATO air support was instrumental from the moment they levelled the armour going to Benghazi.\n\nGaddafi had substantial defections from his military, and had to rely on mercenaries from Africa in order to survive, his situation was untenable. Without NATO's help, that war would have likely devolved into what we have in Syria now. Which is to say, he wouldn't have \"leveled\" the rebellion. Regardless of that, [I wouldn't consider Libya a clear success](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/daily-life-in-tripoli-hampered-by-libyas-political-mayhem/2014/06/30/38f5de2c-c07c-4f48-9c19-7decb337d3bc_story.html) to be touted by an American President. \n\n&gt;Pivoting to Asia? I'm not a native English speaker so I don't know what that means. Turning to Asia? Anyway things in Asia are tense with Japan and China, not with the US.\n\n[America's pivot to Asia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_foreign_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration#The_.27Pivot.27) is a term often used to describe the US's re-balancing of military assets from the Middle East to Asia. This is an escalation of militarism in that region, and a clear sign that China-US relations are not better under Obama's tenure but worse. There is a lot of good information in the above link that supports this assertion. \n\n&gt;He ultimately ordered it. Leap of faith, man. It could've gone spectacularly wrong, but it didn't.\n\nAny president would have made the same decision. And it did not really substantially help anything. One could argue that Al Qaeda, who publicly condemned ISIS for their brutality, was a preferable enemy to ISIS, as outrageous as that sounds. Time will tell. \n\n&gt;Well he could've prevented alienating the Sunni tribes. A united Iraq is one that ISIS probably couldn't have penetrated very well.\n\nLike I said, Maliki is a piece of shit. But looking at the other Iraqi politicians likely to replace him after his ouster, none of them are Sunni, and some have even worse sectarian track records than Maliki. Iraq, as defined by Sykes-Picot, cannot overcome their problems alone. I think a likely outcome will involve Iraq's dissolution into multiple states. I have no issue with that outcome on it's face, but if it occurs now, one of those states will be run by ISIS, and another probably a puppet regime for Iran. Thankfully, at least the Kurds will finally have their state, but we could have facilitated that had we been there as well. America should have stayed put to help Iraq's transition. Without us, they will descend into chaos. \n\n&gt;Ukraine wasn't flipflopped by the West, but by its own people. \n\nUkraine's revolution [was largely influenced by NGO's that are funded by the US State Department](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa), who answer directly to Obama. The US influenced the candidates, and would have influenced Ukrainian domestic policy. This was unacceptable to Putin. To many in Russia this was a comparable situation to the Cuban Missile Crisis, in that a Western-oriented Ukraine represents an existential crisis to Russia. Whether this is true or not is moot, whats important is that they feel this way. If the people of the Ukraine wanted to join the EU and even NATO, they should have done it themselves, organically. Our influence in that process precipitated the crisis that exists there now. \n\nI'm not one of these knee-jerk \"Thanks Obama\" haters. I didn't care for Bush at all. I wish that Americans valued educational background and experience over flashy PR campaigns when we consider candidates. I like that Germany has a PHD running their country, I wish we could do the same (not necessarily Merkel, but someone with that type of background). This was a good conversation, btw, and I enjoyed having it with you. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404330417", "subreddit": "cringe", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

I had been on my wife's insurance (I'm a freelancer), but she switched to a much better job that offered no insurance (but promised to eventually do so, and still hasn't).  Made my wife sign her life away promising to never attempt to get me covered if she and the kids were expecting coverage; it was the only way they would cover them.

That's all I have to say.](http://i.imgur.com/znK9aSR.png) \n\nWell that was a lot of stuff in one sitting. Once again, I loved their whole date because we got to see the other side of Lucia. To quote myself, \"Everything about her is just 'dawwwww'\".\n\nWatching Lucia forced away from everything and everyone was just heartbreaking, and it got even worse when she was so blatantly manipulated into killing everyone. The bit with the sunflowers was icing on the cake as they yank the rug out from under you. I just wanted some ice cream!\n\nThe boss fight at the end was great, especially since it was Lucia herself. Once again, Chihaya is such a bro. The dialogue was pretty intense when Kotarou was trying to understand her side of it. Kotarou finally showed off his rewriting when it really mattered and used actions instead of words to get through to her. \n\nOverall, I think Lucia is one of my favorite characters. I'd put her up there with Shizuru. It was nice to focus on someone who didn't get a lot of attention before. Also, I really like her casual outfit.[ Maybe I have a thing for suit jackets, I dunno.](http://i.imgur.com/TcllJSl.jpg) This route had a good mix of feels, romance and action. I do have to wonder how many bittersweet endings we're going to have, though. \n\nAs I suspected, this is one of those games where, by the end of it, I just want to give everyone a hug.\n\n[Bonus wallpaper.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animewallpaper/comments/2ae2i6/lucia_rewrite_1920x1080/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405119030", "subreddit": "vndiscuss", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I can wait on average a month for a specialist appointment, and my insurance isn't bad (parent's til I'm 26 - thanks Obama). ER visits for the insured and uninsured alike can be lengthy and massively expensive. It can cost $500 just for the ambulance trip, not including anything they use on you on the way.\n\nBut because right-winger yell things like \"socialism!\" and \"death panels\", many Americans actually think a better alternative to universal health care is death. Literally, death. People die here - here, in the richest nation in the world by far - because they can't afford to stay alive.\n\nWhat kind of fucked up, inhuman system is that? How can we let that happen? But we do, daily. I've seen homeless men with gangrenes legs on the NYC subway. By all medical logic they should be undergoing an amputation. Instead they are riding the train in a stupor. It's...inhuman is the only word I can think of. We literally let the poor and undesirables die off when we can help them. We choose not to help, as a nation.\n\nAnd it's these kind of things that make me often dream of moving elsewhere. Every nation has their issues but the degree of injustice in America today, in 2014, is...astounding. I'm thinking BC, Canada.

{"body": "&gt;Thanks Obama!\n\nI am just going to say you cant blame Obama for higher gas prices. There are two main factors for higher gas prices: greater international demand and the crisis in the Middle East. \n\n&gt;International demand.\n\nChina and India consume and import a lot of gas, the US sees a market for that so they export gasoline from the US to those countries. If we did not export gasoline we would have a lot more supply and consequently have a price drop. Our current price is a product of US and International demand. \n\n&gt;Middle East\n\nThe conflict in the Middle East in itself causes no gasoline/oil shortage but it does cause the fear that oil production will be disrupted. Say Iraq stops oil production, it doesnt affect US gasoline production since everything is domestic but China depends on oil from Iraq. Since Iraq's supply is no longer available China switches their purchase from Iraq oil to US oil which increases demand and export from the US. This causes a dwindling supply which increases prices. \n\nAnother situation is that investors see a potential of an oil crisis so they buy/hoarde as much oil as they can as insurance until the crisis stabilizes or blows over. The problem with this is that it decreases the amount of oil that could be used for the consumer since these investors will never use the oil they bought.\n\n*The China-Iraq thing is hypothetical ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405409256", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

It sounds like a bad teacher or teachers created an assignment that convinced the dumber kids in a weak school district to deny the Holocaust.

{"body": "In my experience, if they've spoken to you on the phone twice and they want to meet in person you've done very well so far. I don't waste my time with someone I'm on the fence with after the first phone interview, so the fact that you're getting in the door signals they like you as a candidate and they want to see how you fit in.\n\nWhen I do interviews I can easily chew through 30-45 minutes. Be prepared to repeat your stories, and to hear the same things from different people. If they do 1:1 interviews and not as a group it's so that each of them can judge your personality and how you'll work out in the environment. Fortunately or unfortunately, it's basically a drawn out personality test.\n\nWhat's important-\n\nDo not bullshit them. If they ask you a question you don't know the answer to, you are _not_ to make one up on the spot. This might sound crazy and obvious to you, but the number of people I've dismissed immediately in my head because they confidently answered something completely wrong (not just confusion, making something up entirely) is astounding.\n\nBe yourself. Seriously. You're going to want to get to know them and they're going to want to get to know you. If you aren't your (more nervous) self, it's going to be painful. You want to join a team that you gel with well, because it makes even a crappy job so much better.\n\nIf you have any quirks, do your best to keep them at a minimum. I had an interviewee that had some interesting physical habits that were a bit offputting.\n\nIf they offer you a drink, TAKE IT! It's an opportunity to walk around the area a bit, maybe interact with some current employees, and you're absolutely going to need it. Seriously. You're going to be sweating and talking for a long time, and you're going to need to drink. But please don't sip your drink before every answer, and don't slurp it unless it's a local custom.\n\nAsk questions. What do they do for fun? Do they hang out after work? Show interest in joining the culture. If someone says they have a common hobby, talk about it a little. At the very least it's something you're comfortable with and it's something they'll remember about you.\n\nPlease, do not talk politics or religion unless you're interviewing at a religious, politically affiliated equipment company. This should also go without saying, but I had someone make politically motivated comments in an interview and it was really offputting. While you can't be discriminated against for your political or religious beliefs, you can be passed over for having a personality that doesn't fit. Don't do \"thanks Obama\" jokes, don't talk about the Palestine/Israel situation, and don't regale them with stories about being a pastafarian.\n\n\nOther than that, relax. You're almost there! Be early so you can relax a bit before the interview.

{"body": "To be honest, since some half-arsed measures have already been taken by the Obama gov in the last few years, it's probably pushing backs dates already. Since stuff is modified I don't really have a magic crystal ball so... It's probably going to be gradual before blowing up if that happend.\n\nBut there are a few indicators giving a guess on how bad things can be or currently are and signs to look for :\n\n- More and more kids can't afford anything and will live at home with their parents or family. That hidden poverty is the hardest to guess i think, because it doesn't show outside as long as somebody can make up for it.\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-record-number-of-young-adults-living-with-their-parents/\n\n- Unemployment rise, and without external income, so does the lack of income or ressources. So i guess unemployment IS currently an indicator, as long as there is no serious safety net. I don't need to present statistics there, i think.\n\n- Wages depresses too, and collapse unchecked. Whether because they are lowered below actual minimums/the social safety net to \"restart the economy\" at all costs by gaining full unemployment, at the cost of having a lot of it nearly unpaid.\n\nI think everybody knows about minimal wage jobs, here. There has been some progresses thought, due to Obama pressuring to rise minimal wage and some areas waking up/doing something about it.\n\n- The number of people being able to afford serious medical insurance is probably important to guess the state of things too. People who can afford it will, because surviving in one piece is a serious priority for most people who ever caught anything.\n\nOnce again, there has been serious progress here; Thanks Obama Care :) (and i don't intended it in a sarcastic way, for once)\n\n- Outright poverty indexes, gauged on declared ressources and bank account levels\n\nI think i can say we have an entire Gen Y (the post boomers millenials) with little savings.\n\n- How many people are simply living on legal minimums. It's hard to get numbers because i'm not sure economists cares about it. But how many people earn the strict minimum tells you how further employer-controled the job market is, because those people obviously have no bargaining power over their own situation.\n\nI'm too lazy to fish my own posts and statistics pages before, but a lot are living around 15-20K/year if i'm not totally wrong.\n\n- Eviction rates. http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/sf-evictions-keep-rising-latest-report-shows/Content?oid=2732010\n\n- The number of people late on basic bills like the student loans in the next workers generation, and debts levels of the average citizens. Once again, it looks grim there : http://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2014/02/21/1-trillion-student-loan-problem-keeps-getting-worse/\n\n- The average US gov approval. While Obama have low approval, he still have a solid core of loyal supporters. I think a part of the USA pop actually seriously like him. From Europe he's frequently saw as friendly, if a bit powerless on the inner politics. On the other hands, Congress ratings feels underwhelming : http://time.com/2900031/congress-approval-ratings/ And the millenials like them about as much as Comcast or the IRS, and frequently feel unrepresentated by a disconnected political apparatus. Things like Occupy wallstreet also show that people do feel they are getting fucked over in large number, if totally uncoordinated and unsure about how to act.\n\nNow, i'm not going to fan out the flames, i'm not stupid and the collapse of the US would be incredibly bad. A couple of republican economic terrorists running the states is better than thousands, millions running around damaging the whole system. But if they finally go the way of leaders, if one day one occupy or police brutality incident snowball to hell, simply don't expect the EU leaders to stand in their way and risk their neck for the US oligarchy apparatus itself and a few greedy billionaires :-/\n\n- Inequality (yes, i do have to put it somewhere in it, sorry) is rising too. the word \"1%er\" does come to mind. People are starting to feel a bit angry to hear constantly about millionaires and billionaires bankers fucking them over when they sometime have trouble finding 10$ in the wallet for another six pack of beer at the end of the month. And censoring don't remove it all. Words of mouth still go through. Neither i think a KGB-style witchhunt of the revolution's traitor to kill and deport any dissidents on a systematic soviet basis is a good idea.\n\n- Average income pegged to the GDP. If the average citizen earn less on less while the GDP keeps exploding, it means all the money is getting away somewhere, probably by a few.\n\n- Food cost. No, seriously. Look at that chart : http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tD0xhuMj90A/TkwhEB6FZ0I/AAAAAAAAARE/2668fHN7PHE/s1600/food+riots.JPG\n\nSure, credit cards dampen it in the US and they can still sweep it when running out on the account. But i'll let you put both charts (this one and US food costs) next to let you draw conclusions. You know how they say, civ is always 3 meals away from exploding. The day those cards don't sweep anymore and the average murican cant shop at wall mart nor borrow from pop/mom, it'll hit the fan.\n\n- More and more people will have trouble paying the utilities, and if those are cut, it'll cause immense frustration and lack of trust in the state in the general population. People without power or water generally feels totally betrayed by whoever is in charge; even if that guys tell them \"it's not his problem if they are too broke/lazy to get a job/entitled/whatever\". I think Detroit was a wake-up call, there.\n\n- Riot swept under the rug. Riots are one thing, but when the people in power think it's so bad they have to hide the news of riot, it's time to start thinking seriously about what to do.\n\n- Edit : Oh and trust in police forces/justice. As of late, more and more people see them less as the defenders of social peace and justice, and more as enforcer henchmen of the rich&amp;powerfull. It's a worrying trend. I'm talking about no knock warrants, stop&amp;frisk and the fact that everything under the sun WILL be used against you in a trial. Cops aren't there anymore to tell people to play nice with each others and respect their oath to the country (*to protect &amp; serve*), but as the government-backed gang to push people down with fines and violence and disappear 10y kids because they have a smoke smelling funny. \n\nWhen US vs Them means \"the gov VS the citizen\", you're going to have a bad time. Police need to be reformed :/ I'm reminding myself of the UK police, that still have a rather positive PR even if they do fuck up from times to time. They're not viewed as *the enemy* but simply as humans making (*cough* sometimes lots of *cough*) mistakes. Cutting down on the shootings might help. \n\nMaybe training to use tazers first and less guns; or cameras on every cops and video pulled back in case of incidents ? Zero tolerance for cops blatant violence in non justifiable situation (they can quit if they want, anytime; the guy choked to death in NYC while unarmed and undangerous does come to mind too...), etc.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405930573", "subreddit": "Eurosceptics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

They *were* the women and children before the Israeli war crimes.  Also about half of native Americans were peaceful.\n\n&gt;  Can you really cry back claiming this is unfair? Do you not expect the people you are attacking to come after you and try to retaliate?\n\nDo you defend America for the hundred thousand dead civilians in the war on terror?  Al'queda is hiding in civilian areas, so Barack \"thanks Obama\" Obama gets a pass for those drone strikes right?  I mean, according to OCHA more Americans died on 9/11 than Israelis did in the last 15 years, so if Palestine has it coming, Iraq and Afghanistan had it coming right?\n\n&gt; Why must Israel exercise caution when it's enemies do not? \n\nBecause Israel is ten times the size of Palestine with weapons 100 years ahead of Palestine.  And an army, a navy, an air force, an armored division, and maybe biological weapons (we don't know).  Like, how much more of a caricature of a bully can they be?  There are Palestinian children throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.\n\n&gt; what seems fair to you since you claim Israel is in the wrong? \n\nIsrael pays to rebuild and goes back to the original UN sanctioned borders before the invasion and war crimes.\n\n&gt;  Should the habitants of Israel just leave? If so, why?\n\nYes.  How long do I have to live in your home before it becomes my home?  Seriously.  This is a chance to stop the destruction of an entire culture.  Palestine stood for something like 25 centuries, and Israel is wiping them out in one.\n\nYou'd think Jews would be sensitive to that.\n\n&gt;  Why did the palestinian people democratically vote for a terrorist organisation back in 2007? \n\nOne man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.  They have no army, so they're using guerilla warfare.  \n\n&gt;  Should they just take missile after missile up their asses until the other side runs out?\n\nThe Iron Dome seems to swat those down quite nicely.  You say they fired 2,000.  How many got through?\n\n&gt; If you were living in Israel and rockets arrive there every day (even thought it seems Iron Dome is very efficient) would you be fine about going about your day trusting the this technology will never ever fail, because if it does you will most likely be dead?\n\nI as an American face more danger of a murder, statistically, than an Israeli faces from Palestine.\n\nKnow what I wouldn't do?

{"body": "&gt; Those are Palestinian deaths since the 1920 riots.\n\nOh so that number is over the course of almost 100 years and started before Israel was even a country. Why is it that you only blame the israeli people when the country of Israel was only created in 1948? How come Egypt and the surrounding muslim countries are free of guilt when they have also shunned the palestinian community? Did you know there are several palestinian who were successfully incorporated into the israeli community?\n\n&gt; Its not a retaliation though. Israel has been murdering Palestinians at a rate of more than one a day for the last fifteen years.[1]\n\n&gt; This isn't a retaliation. This is just more war. Give peace a chance for more than spring break before you play the victim.\n\nHow is it not retaliation? I am referring to everything that has happened this year because if we start dating back further and further we will never get anywhere. As far as I am aware this all started after 3 israeli kids were kidnapped and killed. I know there were consequences but every time there is an escalation it seems to come from the palestinian side.\nThe facts pertaining the current situation from 2014 as I know are:\n\n1. Kidnapping and killing of 3 israeli kids (civilians as far as I am aware of) with no consequences to the offenders.\n2. A palestinian kid was killed and the offenders jailed by the Israeli government.\n3. Hamas starts firing hundreds of rockets into Israel.\n4. Israel responds with airstrikes into targeted areas.\n5. Israel accepts 3 offered cease-fires, Hamas refuses all of them.\n6. Hamas continues firing rockets indiscriminately. \n7. Israel now started a ground invasion to find an end to the rocket firing.\n\n&gt; Well... They were the women and children before the Israeli war crimes. Also about half of native Americans were peaceful.\n\nBut how far back does this go? The jewish people were there throughout history and I believe they were there earlier in history than the palestinians as well. Several times in history they were oppressed and expelled from the region so why does that not entitle them to historical rights?\n\nFrom [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_history#Ancient_Jewish_history_.28c._1500_BCE_.E2.80.93_63_BCE.29) wikipedia article, more specifically at the start of the muslim religion in the 7th century:\n\n&gt;Professor Moshe Gil documents that at the time of the Arab conquest in the 7th century CE, the majority of the population was Jewish.\n\n-\n&gt; Do you defend America for the hundred thousand dead civilians in the war on terror? Al'queda is hiding in civilian areas, so Barack \"thanks Obama\" Obama gets a pass for those drone strikes right? I mean, according to OCHA more Americans died on 9/11 than Israelis did in the last 15 years, so if Palestine has it coming, Iraq and Afghanistan had it coming right?\n\nUnfortunately I am not educated on American history and politics so I'll leave this one alone.\n\n&gt; Because Israel is ten times the size of Palestine with weapons 100 years ahead of Palestine. And an army, a navy, an air force, an armored division, and maybe biological weapons (we don't know). Like, how much more of a caricature of a bully can they be? There are Palestinian children throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.\n\nHow is this bullying? Hamas is firing rockets and has no intent on stopping why must Israel be responsible for Hamas' actions?\n\nIn my view this is completely backwards, the Israeli people chose to invest in infra structure and education which allowed them to advance technologically and in turn build one of the strongest armies in the world. They did so to protect themselves and this is what they are doing.\n\nThis is how I see it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbdnu_R9G40\n\n&gt; Israel pays to rebuild and goes back to the original UN sanctioned borders before the invasion and war crimes.\n\nWhich invasion and war crimes are you referring to? It seems to me you mean the existence of Israel itself and that is just unrealistic.\n\n&gt; Yes. How long do I have to live in your home before it becomes my home? Seriously. This is a chance to stop the destruction of an entire culture. Palestine stood for something like 25 centuries, and Israel is wiping them out in one. You'd think Jews would be sensitive to that.\n\nWell, jews were there as well throughout history and were expelled from the land too. Why are you not arguing for those families who were kicked out of their homes beforehand too? Furthermore there exists no other jewish state but there are several muslim ones and even they don't accept the palestinians. Why, over and over, must Israel be the one to make concessions? \n\n&gt; One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. They have no army, so they're using guerilla warfare.\n\n\nQuote from their charter: \n&gt; \"The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.\" (related by al-Bukhari and Moslem).\n\nWhen your freedom fighter's charter is to [exterminate all the jews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas_Covenant) they are no freedom fighters anymore, are they? \n\n-\n\n&gt; The Iron Dome seems to swat those down quite nicely. You say they fired 2,000. How many got through?\n\nJust because you defend well doesn't mean you don't feel consequences. How can this be an argument for Palestine? This is a testament to how much Israel values it's citizens and not how inefficient the threats are! What country in the world would allow it's citizens to live under such threat? NONE!\n\n&gt; I as an American face more danger of a murder, statistically, than an Israeli faces from Palestine.\n\nYou are essentially saying Israel is so goods at defending themselves that a freaking MISSILE is no threat? Thats is not how this analysis work. What you have to take into account is that the intent of the missiles is to kill as many Israeli civilians as possible and it would be successful if not for the Iron Dome. The existence of a great defence mechanism does not excuse an attack. \n\nThe logical fallacies are so many in the line of thought presented in this post I have trouble wording my response appropriately! The incompetence of your state to protect it's citizens from crime does not justify crime in other places of the world! You, as an american, have not been threatened by 2000 missiles over the last 14 days. I strongly believe had you been in such situation you would not be trying to ascertain what is proportional force when war is happening, all you would want is for it to stop. NEVER in the history of the world has a country conducted itself like Israel is now, they are sending television warnings, phone calls, pamphlets and warning flares/missiles to allow palestinian citizens in the area to flee. Have you ever heard any other country tell it's enemy where and when the next strike is going to be?!\n\nI also do not see you calling the americans of european decent to leave the US, why do you chose to conveniently ignore that any and every country in the world at some point was at war and a lot of those wars were won by non natives? The place where I am originally from was colonised by the Portuguese and has a big \"non native\" population today. Why is it that they are ok to stay but the \"theoretically\" non native israeli jews are not? You have chosen arbitrary time spans to build your arguments around to victimise palestinians and never once mentioned that the jews where there when the Holy Temple was built since this dates before this nativity bullshit and nullifies your argument.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406036024", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You are so wrong:\n\n**Creation of Haiku**\n\nTraditional haiku in japanese are in a 5/7/5 kana format, this closely resembles the visual outline of a lantern. It is taught to western children that haiku should be written in the same 5/7/5 format, however, the respective numbers being syllables instead of kana (for ease of learning). This poses a problem when attempting to write traditional haiku because syllables and kana are not related in anyway.\n\nTherefore, if not written in kana, haikus should be written in three lines with 17 syllables or less. The 5/7/5 format does not need to be upheld.\n\nThe 5/7/5 syllable format is not incorrect and it has its place, but it would be inaccurate to say that it is the traditional form.\n\nUsually the lines should be short/long/short, but that is not necessary either.\n____\n\n**Other notes**:\n\n1) **Format**: Haiku tend to be written in two parts: A fragment on the first or last line, and then there is the body of the haiku.\n\n____\n\n2) **Format**: Haiku are not written in three fragments, just one fragment and a phrase on two other lines.\n\n____\n\n3) **Time frame**: Haiku is not written in the past and it isn’t longitudinal. It is Zen, in the moment making regular instances amazing and extraordinary.\n\n____\n\n4) **Kigo**:  Haiku tend to be big with seasons because a season never changes. Summer is summer, winter is winter. What changes is the transition from season to season. Leaves falling is changing, snow falling is changing, flowers blooming is changing but seasons just are. Seasons mentioned in haiku are usually the first line, for example:\n\n        blistering summer--\n        sound of a cricket\n        lost in tall meadow\n\n\"Summer\" is known as a kigo. They are not necessary in a haiku, but usually they are used a lot.\n\n____\n\n5) **Be wary of \"twin kigo\"**: Kigos that are redundant, for example:\n  \n        Easter Sunday--\n        my wife hides candy eggs\n        one under the bush\n\nThe twin kigos that are redundant are \"Easter\" and \"hiding candy eggs\". Of course it is Easter if you are hiding eggs! \"Easter\" is not needed in the haiku.\n____\n\n\n6) **Punctuation**: Most haiku do not use capitalization or punctuation. Don’t use periods, periods restrain the haiku. Haiku should be left as if almost unfinished.\n\n____\n\n7) **Avoid “list haiku”**. Don’t make a haiku that is stated simply they are boring.\n\n____\n\n8) **Avoid \"picture haiku\"**: Avoid making haikus that just obsess over a single specific moment with no action.\n\n____\n\n9) **Cause and effect**: Haiku should stray away from c&amp;e (once again due to the essence of zen). If there is cause and effect, try to make sure that it is in the same segment. One line should not affect another line. \n\n____\n\n10) **Play with Juxtapositions!** They are amazing for haikus! Not only are they zen, but they are great for imagery and \"hidden in plain sight\" depth.\n\n____\n\n11)  **Calm and in the moment**: As said before, haikus tend to have a very calm tone, static and in the moment, Zen. Thus it is less concerned with actual emotion, and more so about the moment just existing. That is why:\n  \n         my tortured squee\n         under attacking fingers-- \n         tickle fight\n\nIs a rather bad haiku (traditionally) because 'tortured squee' can be conveyed as expressing emotion and attachment while zen is literally detachment to the world. However, it could also be construed to say that 'tortured squee' is just a description, an observation to the moment and thus follows the haiku pretty well.\n\n____\n\n12) **Haiku vs. Senryu**: Haiku are traditionally supposed to be connected to seasons and nature. Now when I say 'nature' I mean natural nature, rather than stuff like human nature.. Any \"haiku\" with human nature in it (politics for example) are called Senyru. The primary difference between haiku and senryu is that senryu is more attached to human nature. It's still very argued what is and isn't senryu. For example:\n\n        Crying about spilled milk\n        as homeless man walks by. . .\n        thanks obama\n\n____\n\n13) **Literary devices**: Haiku do not use simile, metaphor, personification, etc. It is about the “zen moment” being stated simply (but not too simply a.ka. no “list haiku”). \n\n____\n\n14) **Breaking rules/tips**: Sometimes it is a good idea to break rules of haiku because it adds flavor and individual tone. However, make sure that when you are discarding some rules you are doing so consciously, and not because you don’t know any better.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406108852", "subreddit": "smashbros", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I'm not saying that corporations shouldn't be able to ignore the government guaranteed rights but precedent after precedent has affirmed that they don't need to.\n\nNow, without the double negatives.\n\n&gt;I'm saying that corporations should be able to ignore the government guaranteed rights but precedent after precedent has affirmed they don't need to.\n\nAnd precedent after precedent has affirmed that they do.\n\nThere has not been a ruling in the Supreme Court to establish that private businesses are immune from the law, Constitution and other.  This is as much a boon for the DEA's case as it is for those who disagree with them.  That's part of what makes it so interesting.\n\n&gt;They don't need to protect your free speech. \n\nThey really don't.  But if that extended to the entire Constitution then WalMart would just lock their workers in and stop paying them.\n\n&gt;They can search your email (your employer can do this legally as well as your ISP) without a warrant. \n\nThat is due to an interpretation of a ruling that involves wiretapping.  It also isn't nearly as simple as either one of us is making it out to be.  But let's be clear about something while we're visiting this...\n\n&gt;The question of the scope of the President's constitutional powers, if any, remains judicially unsettled. 156 Congress has acted, however, providing for a special court to hear requests for warrants for electronic surveillance in foreign intelligence situations, and permitting the President to authorize warrantless surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information provided that the communications to be monitored are exclusively between or among foreign powers and there is no substantial likelihood any ''United States person'' will be overheard.\n\nWhich has been disproven.\n\n[Here's a lot more on that topic.](http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment4/annotation05.html)\n\nExtending wiretapping laws to physical packages on the premise that they apply to virtual packets is worse than tenuous.  It's an application of law that is unsettled in a manner suggesting a decision that doesn't exist.\n\n&gt;I can go through my clients accounts that I host on my server without fear of violating civil rights.\n\nAnd you can be sued.  And should be.\n\n&gt;You even point out that 2008 fiasco, as well as several before, that grant corporations some type of special humanity that guarantees them the rights of a person with the privileges or a legally created entity (corporation).\n\nWhich is a precedent that contradicts the DEA's actions in this matter.  Either corporations may be tried as entities or they may not.  What we've seen so far is that corporations are apparently tried as entities if elected officials fear or get their elections bankrolled by them.  \n\n&gt;I was implying that they don't have to protect your rights in the way the government does.\n\nThat does not give them the legal authority to violate your rights.  But worded as you have it here, we are in agreement.  It's our job to safeguard our rights or Washington will take as many as they can.\n\n&gt;If a corporation is a human, then it can't have slaves just as other humans can't, etc.\n\nAgreed wholeheartedly.  \n\nIt seems that we're at a critical juncture here.  I really hope with all my heart that the DEA does bring that case because their very weak legal basis that these services are authorized to search sealed property would make for a great segue to electronic privacy concerns via exactly the bridge that you mention.  And what's at stake?  A tyrannical government composed of businesses with Washington as its puppet city state.\n\nedit: It just hit me.

{"body": "I'm not familiar with Women Against Feminism, but the piece you're quoting touches on many of my personal beefs with the confused, sometimes contradictory ideological soup that is modern western feminism. This bit in particular\n\n&gt;reducing women to helpless victims\n\nis what caused me to resist the label of feminist for many, many years. A huge part of my identity was &amp; still is tied to my independence and my competence, so the suggestion that I might need an extra hand up because of my gender was personally offensive to me.\n\nNowadays I've mellowed out some and although I still struggle occasionally with the above issues I feel like I have a deeper, more nuanced understanding of feminism. I've learned a little about the history of the movement and observed and experienced some of the sexism I was willfully ignorant of as a kid. I've seen people do wonderful, needful work under the banner of feminism. I've also seen how myopic and divisive feminism can sometimes be and noted the various areas where it continues to fall short and in some cases, cause more harm than good; here I'm thinking of men's issues, notably sexual and domestic violence against men. \n\nSo I don't know. I still don't actively identify as a feminist and I dread being asked whether I do because the word encompasses so many different meanings, some of which I fiercely identify with and others that are really frigging frustrating to me. \n\nBasically what I'm trying to say here is THANKS, OBAMA", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406305357", "subreddit": "PurplePillDebate", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Also, these strats apply to any map.\n\nOffense:\n\n1) Make sure somebody picks up the bomb. This is key as you'll have to eventually plant it if you cannot follow through with step 2.\n\n2) Kill the enemy team. This makes it a lot easier for you to plant. In fact, a not so well known glitch is that if you kill the entire enemy team, then you don't even have to plant the bomb!\n\n3) Don't throw grenades to blow up the bombsite. You'd think with the heavy explosives inside that a grenade would make everything go a lot quicker. Unfortunately physics in this game aren't that accurate (thanks Obama) and grenades do nothing but give your enemy an idea of where you're at.\n\n4) If one of your teammates is Mboze, have him throw a random grenade off spawn. He is guaranteed at least a double kill every time (trust me).\n\nDefense:\n\n1) Don't let the enemy team plant. This lets them put pressure on you, forcing you to make a move for the bomb. Which brings me to point 2.\n\n2) Defuse the bomb. This keeps the bomb from blowing up and giving the enemy the win.\n\n3) Kill the enemy team.

{"body": "I read an article about a plan in the late 1980s to prop up the failing banking system. The method? Make government the middle man for healthcare--not to help uninsured people. But, rather, to create a massive billion-dollar slush fund. If the State comes between doctor and patient, and the State collects the cash, it can then invest that cash in stocks and bonds, and make money *on* that money. Think of it as a massive Ponzi scheme, in the most real sense of the term. Of course, all insurance is based on the same Ponzi scheme methodology. But government healthcare is a Ponzi scheme with trillion-dollar consequences (in the long run). The US is now officially $17 trillion in debt. That doesn't even include unfunded liabilities like Obamacare, social security, medicaid, etc. With all those, we're about $200 trillion in debt. That's Weimar Republic level debt.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Obamacare was rammed through *after* the 2008 economic implosion and banker bailout. (It was the government's way of propping up the corporations by transferring the money--via taxes--from the working poor to Wall Street.)\n\nThis is what makes me laugh when hipsters talk about \"free healthcare\".\n\nIt also amuses me that these same young people who backed Obama, when he claimed that he wouldn't tax people making less than $200,000/year, seem to have developed a case of collective amnesia. The President made that pledge and then turned around and stuck the working poor with Obamacare, which is a massive tax. [\"I used to pay $200/month for healthcare. Now it's $900. Thanks, Obamacare.\"] \n\nHere's Forbes magazine busting Obama on his broken promise not to raise taxes on the middle class: http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml\n\nWhat Obama did was promise not to raise taxes on the middle class, and then he hit them with the single largest tax in US history: http://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillmatthews/2012/06/29/is-obamacare-the-largest-tax-increase-in-u-s-history/\n\n* Footnote: Worse than the President's duplicity are the bleak economic circumstances behind it. 1) The Baby Boomers are retiring. In the past, you had to have three working people for every one person drawing on an entitlement program. For the first time in US history, we're going to have more people on entitlements than working. The Baby Boomers represent 70 million Americans (or almost a third of the entire US population). Since that generation dwarfs subsequent generations, you're going to have three people on entitlements for every one person working. That's not economically viable. 2) Right now, there are 17 states in the United States where more people are on welfare than have jobs. 3) Illegal immigrants. Though the government made up the phony 11 million number, it's actually closer to 30 million. If these people bring their families, that's upwards of 100 million new people in America--overnight. Statistically, illegals are different from traditional *legal* immigrants in many respects. Chief of which is the fact that, with low skills and very little education, illegals statistically tend to be dependent. They work under the table and don't pay taxes. Because they have no declared income, they double-dip by signing up for welfare, WIC and other entitlement programs. Obamacare is no exception. An illegal with a bustling construction business can, on paper, claim poverty and sign up for 100% coverage under Obamacare--at the expense of the working poor. I.e., the suckers who follow the rules. Obamacare has even put up Spanish-language websites that have said that if they sign up, their citizenship status won't be checked. . . . So the government itself is encouraging fraud and embezzlement. See here: http://cnsnews.com/news/article/hhs-obamacare-funded-health-centers-migrants-wont-check-immigration-status Throw the retiring Baby Boomers on top of 100 million illegal immigrants, and you can see the implosion of the US economy. This is demographic disaster time. . . . You have more people taking than people producing. That has never happened before in US history, and I don't think the youth understand what that means in the big picture.

Let me begin what I'm about to say, by giving you a little background on the the poor and weak guy. He is only 68, he was an underpaid school principle for over 40 years of his life, and he always paid his health insurance. Before Obamacare when it was made aware that he required immediate lung surgery, they had him immediately taken care of and he had the best doctor possible because he always paid his insurance. Now the third one comes along, just last year and he can no longer use the same doctor (he loved his doctor) and he had to wait 7 months to have the procedure, in which the cancer in his lungs grew and grew. This is probably his last year with me, and I absolutely adore and look up to the man, as well as over 40 years of students that passed through his school (I am crying as I write this). If he would have gotten in right away, as opposed to the 7 months, due to the new legislation, the cancer would more than likely, not have grown as much, and he might have a couple more years as opposed to the one.  So thanks for showing us how great Obamacare is, I'm sure you would have been taken care of better before the law came to be.\n\nThanks Obama!\n\nEdit: I looked through your posting history OP. It appears you take expensive trips around the world and spend lots of money gaming. I bet if Obamacare didn't exist and that the law didn't bump the age of remaining on parents insurance, you could have used all that money to buy your own healthcare plan. I guess young 20 somethings such as myself, would rather game, travel around the world, and spend our money drinking then buying our own insurance because Obama is gonna take care of us with new laws that raise our parents premiums, copays, and time waiting to see a doctor.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406751826", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 3, "controversiality": 1}
