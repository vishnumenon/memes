Either way, I've had them before, they're quite good.\n\nAnyway, I'd just like to point out that co-ops are good for workers who want to be owners.  As an employee for Whole Foods, I have some amount of worker input.  From our open door policy for management, to our public records policy (we can look up anyone's pay) to our capped (ratio) salaries for management, to our voting team members onto our profit-sharing plan, to getting shares of WFM stock and being able to buy more of it at 95% of the market price, I enjoy benefits similar to a co-op employee.\n\nHowever, the only problem I have with Whole Foods is that all of this stuff is good for people who want *careers* with Whole Foods.  I am a college student, and I just want cash.  I've even told my team leaders that I'd rather ditch all the amenities from healthcare (I have my mother's plan still - [thanks Obama!](http://explosm.net/comics/3059/)) to a 401(k) for straight up cash.\n\nThis rambling is to show that co-operatives aren't good for *all workers*.  People have different wants and desires as far as wages and risk taking go.\n\nI don't think co-ops are the business models of the future.  I think laborers who wanted to be owners have ample paths to being their own boss via entrepreneurship.  I've also heard horror stories from my friend who used to work at a co-op which, contrary to what many co-op proponents say, had all the incentive issues pointed out by co-op doubters.  The workers who owned the company were reluctant to bring on new workers, they had a way to hire the kids there without being owners, and it was rather unproductive as a grocery store, in general.\n\nThat all being said, the market decides on this stuff, and so long as the rules of the game are not tilted in other business structures' favor (via the tax code or other laws) then competition will sort out the good firms from the bad.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406945434", "subreddit": "Economics", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A few days ago I walked back into the store from my lunch break, heading for the office to clock back in. A lady in a wheelchair stops me. \n\n \"Excuuuuuse me! Helllllooo!\" She is white trash loud, eyes going in different directions, I can already tell that she is going to be trouble. My work clothes are all black, so without my name badge I look like a customer, so I'm not sure why she flagged me down.\n\n\"What do you need?\" Keep in mind I'm not on the clock yet, if I help her I can get fired (yes, it has happened).\n\n\"I just got out of the hospital and I don't have money for my meds, do you have four dollars?\" \n\n\"What...\" I look at the little pharmacy bag with the receipt stapled to it CLUTCHED IN HER HAND, and said, \"Sorry, I can't help.\"\n\nBack to the office I got to clock in (and now I'm late!), and I start getting suspicious. Normally I don't get panhandled inside a store, and she seemed vaguely familiar, but she wasn't a regular. I try to spot a manager as I head out to my area, but customers are needy, etc.\n\nAs I am ringing two ladies at my register (on the right side of the store, main registers are to the left) I hear a coworker ask, \"Marlboro Reds?\" and out of the corner of my eye I see part of a wheelchair.\n\nI turn to look at the front register, about 20 feet away, and I see her. Without thinking, I blurt out, \"Dammit, that lady just hit me up for prescription money and now she's buying cigarettes?!?\"\n\nShit, now I'm going to be in trouble for cursing in front of customers! I hurriedly scan the rest of their items, avoiding eye contact, when one of them says, \"Wait, she asked us for money, too!\" I look up and they are glaring daggers at wheelchair nicotine addict. \n\nCigarettes triumphantly in hand, wheelchair lady rolls out the door, followed shortly by two older ladies clutching their Maybelline and muttering \"thanks, Obama! Now people are begging for money where we shop!\"\n\nNow my eyes hurt from all the rolling, and I seek out a manager, even though I know there is little use, I just want to vent! I find Keely (not her name), our ASM, and tell her everything. She is incredulous at first, then narrows her eyes and asks what nicotine wheelchair lady looks like. After I give a description she says, \"Do you remember the ambulance call last week?\"\n\nFUCK. I knew she looked familiar! She came in last week, had a screaming, throwing things, full on body-thrashing fit that scared the shit out of the pharmacist and he called an ambulance. This happened right before my shift started, so I came in as wheelchair lady is demanding the EMTs take her to the smoke shop down the street. Turns out she had called them 17 times that day because, \"I neeeeeeeed my smokes! It IS an emergency!\" \n\nApparently, ambulances are also taxis.

{"body": "The thing is that waze (the app Burnie was talking about) is like 700 times more useful than Burnie made it out to be, especially in areas where traffic is weird and unpredictable. The app will tell you exactly how fast traffic is moving in a certain area, if there is an accident/where it is, if there is stuff in the road or abandoned cars on the side, and will redirect you around traffic. I live in virginia and have to commute to DC everyday, and waze has saved my ass on multiple occasions, especially when there's a motorcade or some shit (THANKS OBAMA)  and everything just stops moving. You can use it to speed, sure, but it is also a lifesaver as far as dodging traffic goes. And since it's based on other people's reports, it's normally very up to date as far as major roads are concerned.  For example, there was an accident on my way home yesterday, and I was able to see exactly where the accident was, when it had been reported (which is generally pretty close to when it happened), how many cops were there, and how fast traffic was moving past the accident, so was able to figure out that it was clearing and just chilling in my lane would make more sense than going around through downtown.  \n\nTL;DR Waze is a fucking godsend and not just a speeding app ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407335374", "subreddit": "roosterteeth", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Nowadays everyone creates its own distro by mixing software like they are legos and voila, a new sucky distro is born.\n\nI'm not sure that's true. There are tons of debian and \\*buntu distros which are generally just rehashes, but Debian and Ubuntu are not the linux world. There's Gentoo, Arch, Slackware, Redhat/CentOS, SuSE, Mandriva, and a whole ton of other, unique distributions that came about because somebody had an itch to scratch... Generally it's been trying to build the best package manager. With that regard, I personally feel Arch has won; but it's not what I would call particularly user friendly.\n\n&gt;For example I was on Lubuntu some days ago and while in the first run, in an up-to-date verson of it, I opened a .tar.gz with the application that comes by default (I guess it is the archiver or something) and I drag and drop the file from the archiver to the file manager. The whole frikkin system frozen and I had to reset it.\n\nThis sounds like a hardware problem. Or maybe it was a very big file on a very slow system. Was the HDD light blinking the disk churning?\n\nThe IO scheduler in linux (CFQ) kind of sucks, and I feel like we were better off 5 years ago. If you're technically inclined to install your own kernel, try running a kernel with BFQ. Note that generally CFQ is still the default and you'll have to enable BFQ after bootup, though a switch in grub, etc.\n\n&gt;On the other day I was installing some app in a debian, and I double-click the .deb file that promptly opened the software manager ... Did these guys even test this shit?\n\nYou ... downloaded a \\*.deb file? What were you installing? Just use *apt-get install* and *aptitude search*. The package manager will download and install the package for you.\n\nGenerally \\*.deb files should be opened with `dpkg` on the cli or *gdebi-gtk* if you need a GUI. I'm not a debian user, but *Software Center* sounds like something that would search for and install software, not something that would install a random deb you downloaded. It should be rare that you ever need to download a \\*.deb. We generally don't do that in the linux world; we have package managers to download and install stuff for us.\n\n&gt;Other thing is that 80% of the things we need to install, just give you the tar.gz with a configure, make and make install recipe for you to follow, where most of them fail miserably. In contrast with windows \"next, next, next, finish\" setup alike and the mac drag and drop to install.\n\nYou should try using the package manager, that's what it's there for. On \\*buntu, that's `sudo apt-get install foo`. I rarely download *.tar.gz files unless I really need the source code for some reason.\n\n&gt;We never know where those apps end up being installed and removing all of their traces is a pain in the ass.\n\nSo if you insist on using \\*.tar.gz files to install your software, use 'checkinstall' (apt-get install checkinstall). Now do the following:\n\n     $ tar -xf foo.tar.gz\n     $ cd tar\n     $ ./configure\n     $ make\n     $ checkinstall\n\ncheckinstall uses fakeroot and makes a \\*.deb (or whatever your distro uses) package and then installs it. This is instead of running \"make install\". Now you can just do 'apt-get purge *foo*' to uninstall it.\n\nNote that many \\*.tar.gz bundles also include \"make uninstall\", so even if you do \"make install\", you can still uninstall cleanly.\n\nBut seriously. Stop installing shit from \\*.tar.gz files. Use your package manager!\n\n&gt;Why, in the 21st century do linux nerds still think its fun to waste time in pointless tasks that should be made simple by now just like other OS do?\n\nThe last time I helped a friend with MacOS I wanted to shoot myself in the face. It felt like I was living in the 90s, but with a much prettier interface. Everything took so painfully long to get anything done. To each his own, I guess. You seem to really like your mouse; I'm not so interested in using one if I can avoid it.\n\n**Edit** fixed \\*s that were turning into italics.

Then, I'm comparing those items to other schools/conferences.

No shocker there. What I built the spreadsheet for was trying to figure out how CSU would jump to P5.

I met so many people, and they were all SO nice! The leader of the Knights of Columbus instantly gave me his information so that I could become involved with the men of the parish. They like to do stuff like drink home brews/bible study at the same time, or go to the pistol range and then discuss our Faith over meals. Fun stuff!\n\nOne parishioner even took me out to brunch afterwards! Fr. would have joined us, but he had another Mass to celebrate.\n\nI expressed interest in joining the choir as well as helping out with religious education.

{"body": "&gt;Even for the homosexual thing. I am french canadian. We call them \"homosexuels\", which is the neutral term.\n\nYou mean in the French language, you do that, correct? In most circles in the English language, calling someone \"a homosexual\" is pretty homophobic. I'll give you a pass because English isn't your native language, though. Sorry for that. \n\n&gt;The context makes it worse. Here's a shitty analogy (oxymoron, I know). If I went into the street right now and yelled \"HOMOS ARE DEVIANTS\", the few people there would look at me funny. It's innapropriate, but I'd look like a crazy person. If I go to the gay pride parade and yell that, it's pretty clear my intentions are to shock and insult.\n\nI'm pretty sure you mean to shock either way, to be fair. You said yourself it was a shitty analogy, but I get it. Context is important. That's fair. \n\n&gt;But this was not the case. I was at a nudist beach. This guy was there in order to get some DOGGING done (proof? He was a known fucked up individual. which is a deviant sexual behaviour, pretty antisocial, and if he got caught, he's going on the sex offender list. Park employees patrol the beach and the province police patrols the beach to clamp down on them. Dogging also gives a bad name to nudists there and annoys everyone. Don't know what dogging is? \n\n&gt;It's not about dogging being \"morally wrong\" it's about dogging being illegal NEGATIVELY impacting the good people who go there with friends and family to have a good time.\n\nOkay, I get it. Dogging is a deviant behavior, it's morally wrong and illegal and a generally shitty thing to do. However, I still don't see sufficient proof that he was specifically going to be dogging you. \n\n&gt;So He was 1: Soliciting me for dogging. 2: His comment was solicitation via FLIRTING. FLIRTING is ALWAYS innapropriate to strangers on a NUDIST BEACH. Comments on other people's bodies are ALWAYS innapropriate on a nudist beach. 3: If a girl told me that on the nudist beach, was she dressed or naked, I'd find it innapropriate.\n\n&gt;It had NOTHING to do with his orientation. He was being innapropriate in regard to the setting.\n\nFair enough about all but one thing. That thing being the solicitation; I still don't think he was necessarily soliciting you. He was certainly inappropriate and breaking social codes in light of the setting, yes, but who knows what he was doing really. He might have been soliciting and I can see where you'd think that, but you can't say for sure. He was inappropriate and sounds like a douche, I'll give you that. But whether he was trying to get you to go dogging with him, you don't know for completely sure. So we might as well go with what we know: He's sketchy, and a douche. And yes, I read your other reply. I'm not as educated on nudist beach culture (thanks, Obama), but we still can't say entirely for sure whether or not he was being a dick. Either way, I find your desire to break his jaw inappropriate. \n\nAlso, it's spelled inappropriate. Two p's (technically 3), and only one n. As in: in-appropriate. (I don't mean to come off as rude, by the way! Sorry if I am. I just noticed the repeated spelling there and, hah, that's the grammar Nazi in me) \n\n&gt;You did not read the whole thread, you did not read my below comment. I adressed the women thing too. I explained context had a role to play as well...\n\n&gt;KK? Next time read and understand before you post.\n\nI did read the whole thread. I'm sorry if I hit a few nerves, I went off what I read. And I get that it's frustrating, but I still don't feel like I deserved that rudeness. Rudeness ain't cool, all it does is make you look bad. \n\nEssentially, I think the threat of violence you expressed in your opening post and the lack of context, as well as the language barrier which led to you calling this guy \"a homosexual\" (in addition, calling them \"queers\" is also a pretty homophobic-esque thing to say in the English language / American culture as well) makes it pretty easy for most people to read it as homophobic. I hope you see where people are coming from in that regard. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407804434", "subreddit": "TiADiscussion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

That's akin to downvoting just because you don't agree with someone, or because they don't say it in a way you like.\n\nIt's good to try and improve a community by introducing new rules to deal with issues the community is facing - such as disabling links in game threads to combat the NSFW stuff that the (almost universal) majority doesn't want, or getting rid of some of the new threads that belong as replies to other threads about a topic. It's bad to try and improve the community by introducing rules the community does not want, and that deal with issues the community doesn't consider an issue.

He is actually quite supportive. An IUD is just very strange and risky to him when he sees that the pill has worked fine for me, not to mention his respect for another medical professional's opinion.  He wants me to be safe so any negative opinion will sway him. \n\nI am also still on his insurance (thanks Obama!

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it.

Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh.\n\nSince rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle.

All of these things can be used at different times to try to give the economy a slight nudge, but the reality is that the economy is way too complex to be dependent on any one of those things. The last recession was the result of a housing bubble, for example. If anything, the Fed manipulating interest rates has the largest effect from a government perspective (unless you're spending trillions of dollars that you don't have. Thanks, Obama). \n\nLike I said, Bill Clinton was essentially a fiscal conservative.

{"body": "&gt; It's not like I don't like my body or anything. I just don't like anybody else seeing it I guess? \n\nOh boy. http://i.imgur.com/NT9MxAZ.png\n\nYou have several different things going on, and they might not be solvable by just getting advice on the internet. \n\nWould you characterize your inability to be naked in front of her - or anyone else - something on the level of a phobia? It's the difference between \"I don't want to get laughed at\" and \"I'll have a panic attack\". \n\nIf it's the latter, you might have some bats up in your belfry that only a professional can clear out. Only you can make that determination. If you are literally terrified of getting naked, and you are still on your parents medical insurance (thanks Obama!), see if they have coverage to see a therapist. Most plans offer some sort of mental health coverage, even if it's not once a week all year long. (Might be something like 6 visits a year). \n\nIf they do, you should consider going no matter what. I personally believe that mental health needs checkups just like physical health anyway. And in this case, you have an actual problem to deal with. \n\nNext step, you gotta suck it up and talk to your woman. You've been dating for four years and you've never had this conversation? Were you going to wait until the wedding day to discuss how you can't be naked with her? \n\nIf you want to get past it, it's going to require some pretty ambitious, terrifying work on your part. Here's what I recommend:\n\n1. Talk to her. Tell her how you feel, what your fears are and how you are desperate to please her, but you have to overcome this phobia of yours. \n\n2. See what she says.  Entertain her suggestions. Don't be negative. There are no bad ideas in brain storming. \n\n3. Progress by inches. Work on it once or twice a week. Strip down as far as you think you can go, if that gets you down to jeans and a t-shirt, then fine. No shoes or socks. Then, put on a blind fold. The blind fold is so you cannot see her reaction. The reason for this is because you are going to be scrutinizing her face to look for signs of disgust or mockery and because you expect it to happen, you will find it, despite her not having any feelings of disgust or mockery for you. \n\nWith your blindfold in place, and strict instructions for her to keep talking to you the whole time, in an even tone, and with lots of encouragement, let her strip you. Start with only the t-shirt. It might be only the t-shirt for a while. \n\nNow, you are going to feel uncomfortable, of course. But fight through it. \n\nIf you feel like you're going to panic, then stop the exercise and re-clothe. Anything short of that, try to continue. Sit on the bed or in a chair with just your shirt. \n\nYou should let your girl talk to you about how she likes seeing your skin and how it excites her that not only are you getting naked, but that you're trusting her to help you get past your issues. \n\nIf you guys like dirty talk, she can use some of that, but don't over do it. You aren't trying to go for gold on the first session. You want to get to the point where you can sit for a long time without your shirt on. \n\nLet her touch your chest. Just fingers first, later kisses and tongue. Have her describe how she feels when she sees you. **You tell her what you're feeling**. Don't be afraid of feeling tense or uncomfortable. Tell her what she can do to make you more comfortable. \"Can you put a towel over my shoulders\" is a good sort of suggestion. Anything except \"put my shirt back on and go get us a pizza\". \n\nDo this for, maybe, 30 minutes at a time. If you guys are used to over-clothes fondling, let her do some of that to you. Have her guide your hand to her breasts or Vajayjay. \n\n*It's important that she doesn't laugh at all. It's important that you don't tell jokes to cover your discomfort. No laughing. You are fighting against your subconscious here. You do not need any more trouble from it. *\n\nAfter you can have sessions where you are shirtless, and you are **relatively** comfortable (this is going to take time, so the goal is not to spend 6 months on each step, but just get to the point where you're not in danger of a panic attack), then move on to the next article: jeans. \n\nReminder: blindfold on. \n\nYou're back to no-touching for a while. She has to keep talking and you have to keep telling her how you feel. That open dialogue is vital to a relationship and will help you to stop feeling self-conscious about talking to her about sex and your bodies. \n\nAnd it progresses like that. Work up to gentle touching, then kissing, then \"heavy petting\" as it were. \n\nHave her disrobe with you. Even though you can't see it, she will be telling you what she's doing. And she can guide your hands to her body to verify it. \n\nNow, when you get to fully naked, you are really going to have to fight against the temptation to just go for broke. If you're doing this right, and you are making progress, you will probably be very hard and very pent up when you get to the naked part (you can masturbate after sessions - don't hold it in forever, you aren't trying for blue balls here. If you let her give you a hand job or blow job already, then feel free to do that as normal, but only after you have called an end to the exercise portion and removed your blindfold. \n\nSpend the same amount of time with her touching and then kissing your body. But this time, let her work up to getting close to your genitals. She wants this as bad as you do, so its' going to be hard for her to not just start sucking your penis. She has to contain herself until you are sure you're ready. \n\nHere's the important part: this thing doesn't end until you are fully naked AND you can take off the blind fold. No sex until you can be in the room with her, fully naked the both of you, and you can see her too. \n\nOnce you get to that stage, you need to go through all the motions to make sure you are comfortable. Keep up the talking. Tell her how much it means to you that she is helping you and how beautiful you think she looks. **Do not self-deprecate**. No negativity from either of you. If you have to stop and get dressed, then tell her, but tell her what your feeling and why you have to get dressed. \n\nIf you can talk to her, face to face, fully naked without panicking, then it's time to work on actual sex stuff. \n\nStart with kissing and foreplay. Let her explore your body as much as you explore hers. Let her teach you how to give her cunnilingus. Talk, in detail, what feels good and what doesn't. \n\nWhen you are ready, you can go for penetration. This comes at the end of a foreplay session (always, not just for the purposes of this exercise). Have all your stuff ready to go. Practice opening and putting on condoms in previous sessions. Get used to her touching your penis with a condom on. Have her give you a hand job to orgasm with a condom on. Practice fingering her while she's giving you a handjob. \n\nProgress, progress, progress. \n\nThe first time you put it in, you are almost certainly going to get instantly soft. Why? Performance anxiety. This happens to almost everyone. It took me three sessions before I could actually enter my girlfriend and thrust. \n\nAfter you can keep it up for more than a few seconds, you aren't going to last long. Hold it for as long as you can, but don't feel bad about cumming quickly. It takes PRACTICE. It's not like you see in pornography. People do not routinely have sex for 30-45 minutes. 3-5 minutes of actual penetration is normal. That's why foreplay is so important. \n\nAfter you cum, try to give her an orgasm with cunnilingus and your fingers. This is going to be guided by your girl completely. Do what she says. Some women can't cum that way. You have to listen to her. \n\nAs you practice, you'll be able to hold longer and longer. \n\nIn your alone time, when you masturbate, don't just blow your load as soon as you feel it come on. There's an exercise called \"edging\". To do this, play with yourself until you come right up to the point of cuming, and then clamp down hard on the muscles that you use to stop your pee flow. Hold it until the urge to cum dies down. Do that again and again until you can't hold it in a second more. \n\nIf you keep practicing edging like that, you'll be able to do it while you're having sex by slowing down your pulling out, clamping down, letting the urge die down (but not so far down that you lose your erection) and then going back at it. \n\nIf you can get to this stage, you will have gone from being petrified of being naked in the same room as her, to a better lover than 99% of all men on the planet. \n\nGood luck. If you can't proceed at all, seriously, go see a therapist. \n\nI have no expertise in psychological medicine, I just know what I have done in the past to overcome my own anxiety.

Quit blaming others for your misfortunes.\n\nDo you have $10,000? why don't (or didn't you) you use that money to get the loans out of default? \n\nYou will need to put down 20% of the purchase price if you want to avoid PMI.\n\n&gt;essentially doing a slow \"flip\" while living there\n\nDon't overestimate the value of the slow flip. If you buy a house for $140K and the market goes up 30% in the time you own it, so does every other house you will be trading up to. The value you get from a paid off house is cash flow in not having to make a house payment. If it's worth a bunch of money, that's great - but you have to sell it or borrow against it to be able to spend the increase.\n\n&gt;The reason behind a 15yr mortgage and not a 30yr mortgage is I'm hoping to save a significant amount of money in the long run. But is it really significant?\n\nNot really, If you pay off a 30 year note  in 10 year versus paying off a 15 year note in 10 years, you will save about $4000 in that decade assuming a half point rate differential on a $140K loan. Not worth getting in too much of a twist over.\n\n&gt;With her income and bad credit, and my good credit and OK income, is that enough? With only $10k down?\n\nYou will be on the fringe of being able to do it / not do it. They will probably exclude her from the application. Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should do it.\n\nContinue to get yourselves out of jeopardy, clean up her credit, save up 20% and you will be fine.

The idea with the \"slow flip\" is to buy a house at $140k-ish that needs simple renovations like granite counter tops, new flooring, etc. that can be done while living there and increasing the value of the home while still watching the market go up after a few years reselling. So if the market goes up 30% while living there, I will be increasing the value of the home another 30% before selling increasing profits to use towards our second home.\n\n3&amp;4. Thank you.

{"body": "It would also reduce crime INFINITELY if the government or medical institutions would provide addicts with their drugs of choice - with the caveat being you have to give your name, and it's going to go on your 'record' - the people who don't want to give their names aren't sick enough to warrant being issued hard drugs medicinally - the people who don't CARE are already in a deep enough hole that they need something like that and it would benefit them more than the risk it poses to them.\n\nNo more heroin dealers, no more crack dealers, no more drug-centric gangs in black and latino youth in the ghettos, no more white kids going into the city to cop, no more white kids dealing in the suburbs or high school(except some pot here and there, maybe some RX pills), but no more homeless junkies spiking up the sidewalks and shitting in alleyways between their cycle of scams/hits/begging/stealing! No more jailed addicts, no more theft to fund the addictions - just enough drugs to satisfy them and let them learn from the experience(that thing all addicts need to learn \"*shit, I'm high and my problems still aren't fixed and my life feels no better to me to lead*, maybe I should figure something else out that would be more gratifying than this\" - they HAVE to be high to learn this - they can't learn in while they're cold and sober and trying to 'get well') and move on - or not - let them maintain and function as homeless people who can actually spend their money on food/clothes/proper things to get back on their feet. No more passing HIV and Hep C between needle users, no more any of that - just people who are being allowed to be adults and make their own adult choices, facilitated by other adults who are trained to help that kind of person specifically - but, as all people in that field know - you can't force help on people, they have to choose/be ready themselves to be done chasing a high/trying to run away from their problems and themselves and hide inside a bag of dope. Make dope of all forms easier to get in a safe, free way, and you totally destroy the drug business, the violence that comes with it, the gang problem associated with it, the poverty caused by it's effects on people, and you give the people who were going to be using anyway a place to do so with medical professionals and you also give the social outreach programs ease of access to their target audiences.\n\nIt's really retarded *not* to do this, because those junkies are already going to be out there making the same choices to use anyway - only in an antisocial way and in a forced, government-created subculture that encourages antisocial behavior. It's not like they weren't going to be doing it anyway, we should all be ashamed of ourselves for going along with the system as it currently is, it's pathetic.\n\nBut then where would the intelligence and military communities get their trillions of dollars in unvouchered cash from every year? Who is going to hit the button that turns off the 2nd or 3rd largest industry in the whole world for our country? no one - that's who. Personally I think that after WWII, the decision was made by a group of people in the US aristocracy to open the US up to the drug trade in a controlled fashion, and that's what happened. Couldn't ever think of destroying both the illegal drug business AND the prison-industrial complex, where would the slave labor come from? *Violent* criminals who *actually* deserve to be in prison for 20 years to life? Who wants them on a work line! Gimme some of those non-violent drug offenders any day and a means to keep them forever. Thanks obama.\n\nAll it really takes is for something that was once rare and hard to get to become plentiful and easily available, and people don't want it anymore. The stigma of being in a government druggy-pacifying program would be even worse than the stigma of being a normal junkie as it is now - because no one is there condemning you for you to rebel against or ignore - it would just be other successful humans trying to help you because you're too dumb not to be a poor drug addict who needs life handed to him on a platter every day and needs to be taken care of.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408647209", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": -1, "controversiality": 1}

Anyway here's the ones I did some research on. \n&gt;\n&gt;___\n&gt;\n&gt;**[Chalmers Face](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/search?q=chalmers+face&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)** - As much as we all hate to love this. We have to acknowledge it. It's origin dates back to Miami visiting the white house. Obama declared, [\"And with that we should take a picture, but make it quick before somebody starts yelling at Mario.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFhE8k-b2wg) The crowd erupted. And so did Mario ([Clip taken at 7 secs](http://i.imgur.com/FKJbYAi.png)). Was mario joking? I don't really know, but we can say \"Thanks Obama\" for the face we all know all to well. \n&gt;\n&gt;/u/donotfeedthemoose made [the snip that changed history](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1v8h92/president_obama_with_a_mario_chalmers_joke/cepwm4f), so ya'll can blame him or /u/pirate_doug for mentioning it could be the new Manning face [which led to the snip we all know and love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1v8h92/president_obama_with_a_mario_chalmers_joke/ceqj1ha?context=3). [Backup Link](http://i.imgur.com/GZVNEjY.png)\n&gt;\n&gt;____\n&gt;\n&gt;**[Slim Reaper](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/search?q=slim+reaper&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)** - Even though [KD himself has dismissed it,](https://twitter.com/kdtrey5/status/426429760382574592) an [$800 2nd round Jeopardy](http://j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=4589) ([Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Q7oX5uH.png)) question and [Grantland has accepted](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-shootaround-dont-fear-the-reaper/) it, so we made it, like no, we literally made it. The origin is actually somewhat well known on /r/nba.\n&gt;\n&gt;During the playoff series of the [Grizz and Thunder](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eaael/game_thread_oklahoma_city_thunder_memphis/c9yb8i9) last year /u/Beardfunk professed [Slim Reaper in the building tonight](http://i.imgur.com/AXwWUJ1.png). Though it only had 3 upvotes, history was made.\n&gt;\n&gt;___\n&gt;\n&gt;**[Big Dick Dray](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/search?q=big+dick+dray&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)** - Though not as popular as the Slim Reaper it maybe the favorite of all nicknames created on here. I have a theory it was first professed during the December 12, 2012 game when he hit that game winner against Miami.\n&gt;\n&gt;/u/No_easy_buckets said it quite a few times in [that game thread](/14r7pc/). His most prominent was a all caps [BIG DICK DRAY](http://i.imgur.com/0jrlXdh.png) with 27 big ones.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I searched through previous rNBA gamethreads in 2012-13 and there was nothing. I did some internet crawling and I found a /sp/ 4chan *gasp* [thread](https://archive.moe/sp/thread/29238002/) quoting \"[Well we just beat the champs with big dick dray](http://i.imgur.com/VwpyxqP.png)\" and upon further review it looks like anon [quoted no_easy_buckets](http://i.imgur.com/gYxiqIs.png) himself. Unless there's some MSU relevance than I'm assuming it was that fateful day. I'm like 90% sure the inventor was no_easy_buckets. [This statement in tandem with his username is topping on the cake. No_Easy_buckets loves dat hustle play.](/14slwd/) I'm not sure where /u/no_easy_buckets has gone, but we thank him for his contribution.\n&gt;\n&gt;___\n&gt;\n&gt;**Literally Haren** - Yea, yea Harden is lazy on defense we know, but when did this surface on /r/nba? Digging back the post that may have set him back has being literally Haren on /r/nba was most [likely this post](/1nnise/). After that post he was under /r/nba's microscope. If there's one thing /r/nba hates, it's lazy players and that thread showed it all. A few days later a flop thread came out and then he [was warned](/1q40dy/) and later [fined for flopping](/1qebuy/). I take it back, flopping is the thing /r/nba despises the most... [pack the bags](/1qet4c/), Harden is toast. Even [NBA Countdown (shoutout to /u/sptguy33) hopped on the Haren Hate bandwagon](/1qqbye/) | [Youtube Vid](http://youtu.be/5SIka5azbrU).

{"body": "I did read the link. It says that it must cover all methods, but it doesn't say it must cover all varieties of each of the methods. My pills are free with my insurance. My roommates are not. She could go with another, similar, free pill but chooses not to. She has a new insurance plan straight from the insurance marketplace. Since personal experience doesn't count for squat, here's some info that meshes with what my pharmacist told me when I was like \"omg it's free now? what? thanks obama!\" I couldn't find any supporting information that says that every FDA approved formula must be covered with $0 copay - just that every FDA approved *method* does.     \n\nHere's a snippit from Planned Parenthood's explanation:  \n*Your insurance plan is only required to cover one type of each birth control method (e.g., implant, IUD, sterilization, and hormonal birth control), but not necessarily all of the products in that category.  For example, if you want use birth control pills, you might be able to get Ortho-Tri-Cyclen at no cost, but not Loestrin. Or they may cover a generic brand of birth control pills at no cost, but require a co-pay for the brand-name version.  \n\nPlans must cover a brand name drug or a specific generic version if there’s a medical reason you need to use it over the version your plan covers. You can ask your nurse or doctor what methods are best for you, and they’ll help you request a “waiver” from your insurance company — this will allow you to use the brand name product or specific generic without a co-pay.  You also want to ask your insurance company to check what the process is.*\n\nThey cover grandfathered plans separately in the same post. Here's the link:  http://plannedparenthood.tumblr.com/post/68942144701/why-isnt-my-birth-control-covered-for-free-under \n\nJezebel wrote about it too: http://jezebel.com/answers-to-all-your-questions-about-obamacares-birth-c-991249620  \n\nBasically google \"free birth control with obamacare\" and you'll see plenty of articles covering why it's not actually a free for all. If it is all supposed to be covered there are some huge gaps in information out there including doctors and pharmacists, which are the two people that have explained it to me incorrectly if it actually is supposed to all be covered.

{"body": "This really isn't a good question. In part this is just obvious ignorance, but underlying it is a basic, well, 'uncritical' approach to the subject. Since you have brought up the comparison of modernity (ie. 'thanks Obama') to the table I'm going to firstly address it in those terms.\n\nIf, in class or in a discussion with peers, would you ever ask 'how does the average 2000s blue-collar Westerner feel about their government?', of course you wouldn't. It's a completely vapid question. Here is where the ignorance enters the equation. Instead of asking about a 10 year period where we have a great deal of information, you are asking about a 1000 year period where for large swathes we have almost no information.\n\nThere is no 'average European peasant in the medieval era' the entire premiss fatally flawed. Defining who *is* a peasant is difficult enough (what about slaves, serfs, servants, artisans, renting city-dwellers, burghers, non-aristocratic landholders, etc.) let alone trying to average it out over 1000 years across an entire continent when societies and economic circumstances changed dramatically and at different rates.\n\nIf you have been looking for primary sources about the 'simple peasant' and instead turning up 'some noble ruler or king' then why do you think that is? It is because these records are largely written documents, and why would the 'average peasant', who is famously illiterate, leave such a record? Primary sources which give us insight into the life of the lower rungs of the socio-economic class are usually either court records or tax records. A close and critical reading can discern aspects of these individuals' lives but, on the whole, they give us only the barest insight into their lives - unlike the socio-economic elite who were the subject of chronicles, histories, and left a rich cultural legacy in the romances and *chanson de geste* which were copied and updated over centuries. Yet even these sources will emerge in societies where a documentary culture has emerged relatively early and survived through the providence of the historical gods. England is one such place, and the detailed legal records that survive from the late twelfth-century are an invaluable, if *still* understudied resource. Unfortunately, these medieval Latin records remain untranscribed, let alone translated, into modern editions. What about countries or regions where we don't have these enviable records? The simple fact is that if we don't have the sources we can't know what is going on in those societies and thus, when we don't have the information, we cannot make generalisations about 'the average European peasant'. We might be able, along the lines of your question, to make a stab at how the average English peasant felt about their king but here we run into another issue.\n\nThis issue, which I would not expect anyone who hasn't an interest in English history to know, is that when our best records about the 'average English peasant' survive is a period of massive anti-government rebellion. This is the fourteenth-century when the socio-economic circumstances led to a series of peasant rebellions most famously encapsulated by the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Here is where numerous texts (most famously *Piers Plowman*) allow insight into the 'peasants' as a distinct class. This is, however, the penultimate century of the 'medieval era' (if we take 1452 or 1485 as the end of medieval history). It is also a heavy bias against attempting to reconstruct the 'average' peasants' opinion of the king (even if, admittedly, they did not blame the king directly but his 'evil' counselors).\n\nAt any rate, you need to read up more generally about medieval history before you think about pursuing a tricky and difficult subject such as the peasantry. If you want a list of resources I'm happy to draft a bibliography but you'll need to be much more precise that 'the medieval era' and, preferably, have a geographical region which you are interested in.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408749511", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Conspiracy theorists engage in this bizarre, macabre pareidolia, where every mistake is a nail in the coffin. You're seeing things that really just aren't there and making connections based on fancy rather than fact. It's always just so convenient that all these clues are left for the astute observer to find. It's not serving anybody but people who just aren't satisfied with their lives and need to blame some higher entity. It's funny how it's always about thinking critically and questioning authority as long as it isn't about their OWN assertions. \n\nThe problem is that no level of proof for things like this will be satisfactory. Until people hold a dead kid in their arms and watch that child's parents melt into misery, they will not be satisfied. So you force people to relive it and argue for it as something that happened over and over and over and over and over because what? Seriously? What are you going to prove? That it's some 'jew lizard government black market religious cult scheme to end/bolster gun control laws and thanks Obama reform' that just HAPPENED to involve just about every media outlet in North America but somehow didn't have the foresight or resources to adequately (allegedly) shop a picture? Are you fucking delusional? \n\nYes. Yes you people are. \n\nLet me tell you something. Crisis is stressful and human memory is faulty enough without added stress. I would have told you that in 2006, cooped up in a 4th floor office, I heard the gunman running along the halls and getting close to the place I was hiding. I would have sworn he sounded like he was feet away from the door, but he never made it anywhere close in reality. What I remember is through a veil of panic, along with tons of others whose stories don't exactly match up. And guess what! There were conspiracies about our shooting too. That the guy was sent in by police, that he was set up because in our case the police responded in something like eight minutes, and there were officers on the scene immediately. We were lucky that people liked to smoke pot outside the entrance he used and were just about the be busted. The cops were cracking down because it was that time in the semester when kids get lax and they wanted to make a few examples. Those facts didn't matter to the people who blamed some higher entity. They looked at the shots, at the people killed. The usual gun law debate came up. Everything for them added up to this kid being set up to further some agenda.\n\nWell, he wasn't. He was just deranged. He had guns legally and he shot a bunch of my classmates because he was having a shitty time. It was a random attack and nothing more. But, because of all the speculation, the story was run over and over and over. I got to hear about it from everybody. They harassed his family and victims were all over the news. People talked about it constantly. People compared notes and worse, people compared how scared they were and how close to danger they were. It was a pissing contest for some people. For me it sucked because my whole notion of safety was thrown out the window, and instead I got to hear people arguing about whether or not we were targeted or if it was completely random. I got to think about whether or not somebody might shoot me just for shits and giggles every time somebody brought it up. \n\nThat's what you're doing to this story, so forgive me if I have little sympathy for those seeking \"the truth.\" You're not looking for truth. You're looking for a particular truth that will help you justify whatever beef you have with the world and since you don't have your own legitimate misery to use as fodder, you're trying to take it from others. It's not fair and it's worse than shoddy, exploitative media coverage. \n\nYou just can't know all the facts of a situation most of the time, especially crises. You're not going to get every angle and you're not going to get to peer into the eyes of a dead kid to confirm your suspicions. Sometimes you just have to take what you're given and accept that something bad and uncontrollable happened. Let these people fucking heal. They don't owe you anything.

{"body": "Because he is doing exactly what he was voted for. Reddit is full of students and internet users. These people were not the focus of his policies. I didn't vote for him, or even like the guy. But all the retarded 'THANKS OBAMA!' style shit that people are doing with Abbott forces me to defend his position. You got the tinfoil hat people saying it is a media conspiracy that one newsgroup brainwashed the entire voting public, and the internet users all pissy about not getting their fast new nationwide upgrade promised by the last party but was so flawed it was doomed from the beginning. Also, in the initial period of his election, he cancelled some gay marriage laws that were basically a stupid loophole that (while giving temporary means for gays to wed now) would make it harder to create any marriage equality laws in the future. GLBT used this as a pitchfork to say he was against marriage equality.\n\nPeople claim his policies were to ruin the Great Barrier reef, but his policies were going to allow roughly 70% less than what the last government planned. \n\nHe removed a stupid mining tax that many saw as a robin hood style tax, stealing from the rich etc. But mining is one of Australias largest exports and the tax was making Australia a bad place to invest in.\n\nHe also removed carbon tax, which people saw as a lever to save the environment for some reason. When it was doing about as much for the environment as global warming deniers.\n\n\nOn top of this, the current governments position is to save money which means the budget for everything is less so that brings out everyone from every industry who lost some money to complain. Bottom line is they will get a bad rep in the media, but they will drastically improve the countries economy, which the public almost never notices because they point at inflation and call it bad economics.\n\nThe irony is that if the previous party was not so terrible, the current one would be much better also.\n\nLet the downvoting begin.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409176690", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
