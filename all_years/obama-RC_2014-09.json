Also abortions are funded by private donations for people who can't afford it, and unless you are one of those people who are donating specifically for that reason, you are not paying for abortions. Also, statistically, girls/women from middle class families are the majority of abortion seekers, and they can usually afford to pay for their very own abortions.\n\nHer response: \"They lie.

I just think that it's better than any alternative that's been tried or suggested.\n\n\nIn America, small businesses employ 80% of the working population.  The men and women who own these companies are never off the clock, and work harder than anyone on the payroll.  They take the big risks and are entitled to the rewards.\n\n\nImagine you own a business, and are thinking of expanding.  Right off the bat that means huge expenses - taxes, mandated health insurance (thanks, Obama), training... And now your payroll has doubled!  Would you take money out of your own pocket to pay this new person?  Or would you come up with an alternative solution, like putting everyone on part-time hours, or giving your existing employees a small raise and increasing their duties?\n\nRemember, if you go out of business, everyone loses- you, your staff, and the community who benefits from your product or service.\n\n\nIt's a fact that competition forces people to preform to their highest abilities.  It's also a fact that without cooperation, the human race wouldn't have gotten very far.  If a company has a cut-throat culture, you can shop around for a job with an environment that suits you better (maybe a restaurant that pools tips and divides them evenly, or a business that has profit sharing).\n\n\nAnyway, I agree that we arent going to come together on this.

He put together a stimulus package, yes, which passed with bipartisan support, so we can infer from this that a similar thing would have happened with a Republican president.\n\nHis stimulus was heavily based on tax cuts and was much smaller than most economists thought was necessary, and the result was that the economy did not recover as fast as it could have, and is STILL far below potential.\n\nThis was largely a result of the team he put together, with Tim Geithner pushing back against stimulus and assuring that we would get back to austerity soon enough, emphasizing the importance of controlling deficits in the middle of a recession and other nonsensical crap. Meanwhile, these same people were handing out money by the shovelful to Wall Street and \"foaming the runway\" for them to ensure that the impact of the huge outstanding liabilities they faced as a result of their massive frauds didn't bite them in the ass.\n\nIn other words, the recovery we got was a recovery for the rich, not for the working class. We can see that in the actual results - all of the gains in productivity, LITERALLY all, have accrued to the super-rich, while the working class has actually LOST wealth.

{"body": "I can see some flaws and improvements that can be made by a quick glance at it. \n\nGonna fully read it through now and give my analysis.\n\nedit:  \nMastery's:\n\nIt can be a good point to skip 3% of the extra ad and pick the extra damage after a spell or auto attack has been made. I think it's a better idea to boost your early game rather than your lategame by 9 extra AD, that will also be repaid back when you use a spell rotation anyways, even more infact.\n\nrunes:\n\nYes you can get through early game with scaling, but you won't be the tank of the team and your early game is more important to scale you into the lategame, to be the nightmare beast you want to be.  \nIMO, Flat is better.  \n\n**EDIT 2:**\nAnyways, flat armor pen. Bad jungle, get flat AD. The reason behind this is that it only comes to effect midgame, by then you probably have a brutalizer, meaning that your armor pen will only take effect later than you want to.\n\nAlso, flat AD helps you invading and scales with 2 of your ability's, together with the tiamat overall better.\n\nA choice of runes that is also fairly popular is the 10% CDR Runes, 9 flat blues and 1 flat CDR Quint, goes together with 5% CDR masteries and with ionian boots of lucidity. Why is that then?  \nWell, you can switch out the 3000 gold Black cleaver for a 3800 gold Infinity edge. THis may seem stupid, but it's actually pretty damn decent, better than decent. It's awesome. 800 gold more for an investment that will give you more strength than black cleaver ever could.\n\nAnd something troubling me...\n\n\"The only time you’d want Flare is in extended fights where you AA a lot, which should only be happening when you’re building tank Rengar. Also, **DON’T BUILD TANK RENGAR. I’m sure you’ve all seen the great “success” LCS teams have had with tank Rengar *cough* Meteos *cough* Still don’t understand why tank Rengar is bad? Here, watch this video. THIS COULD BE YOU IF YOU BUILD TANK RENGAR.**\"\n\n[The circlejerk is strong with this one.](http://gfycat.com/SpiritedBeneficialAfricanwilddog)  \nDo not underestimate Tank-gar, his damage compared to other tanks can go through the roof, same his tankiness when he goes balls to the walls. Tank-gar is indeed very viable, please take a look at his strengths.  \nHowever, the lantern trap and feral flare trap I can agree on.  \nThough, your build. Assassin Rengar is **EXTREMELY** reliant on Tiamat, it's just undistupable. Tiamat is always first item when going assassin Rengar due to the humongous powerspike it gives.\n\nAnd yes, it's a good idea to combine both vamp scepter and tiamat early if you had to buy the 2 early, so to speak.  \nHowever, if you didn't buy the vamp scepter and you're currently sitting on a few doran's blades (Which is why I want the jungle and top segregated), it can be a good idea to sit on a tiamat and take a look at their items.  \nIf they have next to no armor, it can be a good idea to rush youmuu's instead for the extra AD, crit and armor pen with the active.  \nOr why not last whisper if the enemy toplaner is rushing armor items? 2 simple all ins after that (spaced out) and you should be able to kill him or roam after that.  \n\n----\n\nAnother thing disturbing me...\n\n\"Use QuickCast or I will eat your pet turtle.\"\n\n... I don't have a turtle, I have a cat.\n\nHowever, these tips and tricks are solid.\n\n----\n\nAnother thing:  \nUltimate is usually required to gank mid.\n\nNope, it's not. The top bush in river near mid can be used to gank mid, you can stray out from the bush and pounce on a minion and then bola the enemy from there. Or you can go up from behind and bola their asses.  \nStop spreading the lies man! [**IT'S A CONSPIRACY!**](http://gfycat.com/ScholarlyAffectionateHorse)  \n\nAnother thing!  \n1. Kill him at his second Buff  \n2. Lane Gank Bot directly from your first Buff  \n3. Lane Gank Top directly from your first Buff\n\nFirst point, I agree on. Though it's a good idea to first have vision or knowledge of where he is starting. A good way to see is if the enemy botlane is missing some mana when they come to lane. If they do, they have leashed bot buff, if they do not, they haven't and he most likely started top buff.\n\nAlso, take that fucking second buff before ganking!\n\n----\n\nAnother thing:  \n*The absolute worst case scenario is that you get pushed to tower. But that’s not so bad! WRONG. If this happens, you forfeit all control of Top lane because you can’t zone with your bushes.*\n\nGood point, though it can be a better idea to stay away from dueling certain champions on their powerspikes and just stay near turret. Doing something reckless to keep your bushes when they are currently stronger is just stupid.\n\n*You thought wards killed your whole family when you were 7, but really it was Obama with his new “Fuck you Rengar” Legislative Bill. Gee, Thanks Obama.*  \nYeah, Obama is an asshole. Though he's kinda charming.\n\nI like this part.  \n*Only play Rengar bot lane if you are a die-hard, only Rengar*  \nSupport Rengar OP, calling it played at worlds finals and wins the game!\n\n---\n\n*All this boils down to doing one thing:  \n1. Push bot lane or top lane into their inner tower  \n2. Ward the pathways in their jungle  \n3. Sit in a bush that they’ll pass by with 5 Ferocity  \n4. Wait for Doublelift’s new smurf to attempt to farm  \n5. RIP Vayne  \n6. BM in all chat with a yo’ mama joke (required)  \n7. Repeat.*  \n\nThat's one way yes... But don't BM. Please. I beg you.  \nDo that on the flamers instead and put them on the 20 Deaths list, as I like to refer to it.\n\n*You can probably still kill their ADC if he gets left alone. If you have the core 2 items, Youmuu’s and Hydra*\n\nActually, it's tiamat and Youmuu's...  \nHydra is for a sustain lane.\n\nOverall, quite the solid guide, but it could be a lot better if it took itself seriously and wasn't so... I don't know the word...  \n6/10, with a reccomendation of watching it for good pointers. Not something I would reccomend for a starter to watch as his first guide, though does bring up some good points.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410322363", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yeah, it really depends. There's state run places that are free, and sliding scale. Like I said in my novella the state runs ones are almost impossible to get into, and tend to be fairly shitty. There's one good one, but you have to lime up at like 5am everyday to hope to get placed in a bed at 8am. By 8 there's usually a line of 20-25 people, everyday. The sliding scale places tend to be shit, and that's what I did before. They tend to be very jesusy, I got written up for making fun of born again Christians not even making fun just talking about family. I was raised Roman Catholic so lots of good old catholic guilt, but I lost my religion partly due to drug use. Even know I'd say I'm an atheistic agnostic at best, I've gotten over the higher power shit though because I do practice zen and like the idea of reincarnation since when you die you naturally become fertilizer. That to me is reincarnation since my dead body I have no use for can go to help insects and other organisms thrive as a type of second life.\n\nAnyway, I turned 26 and got kicked off my old insurance which had no addiction support. Even my therapist had to bill as general therapy not addiction counseling, and I got 30 sessions every 36 months. My new policy, thanks Obama! No really, thank you, you got one thing right, is pretty damn for $170 a month. I got to pick wherever I wanted to go and I have unlimited mental health and addiction coverage. So once I hit my $1500 deductible I was good. My 2 day detox was $740 out of pocket so that was like half,but they hooked me up on a payment plan and now I pay $20 a day. It's just private practice so they can charge whatever they want, but like I said its a really well respected practice. The doctor that runs it actually created the IOP model and sits on a few boards for addiction and contributed to the DSM-V. So luckily my insurance is picking up most of the cost, and come November and open enrollment I'll be moving to a \"Cadillac platinum plan\" for like $300 but since they're in network I'll pay nothing for my sessions and only $20 for my brand name meds and my generics will be free so it will totally be worth it.\n\nMy program has optional continuing care, for me it's \"extremely strongly recommended\" ie required, and I will do it for 156 weeks or more. The first year will be 2 times a week, and than I'll move to once a week. It's just long term care, and for the people with serious problems, like me yay, they stay with them for a while which is cool. When I started I was like oh god this is ridiculous, but seeing people come into the group and re-intensifying after relapse I see how necessary it, at least for me. In addition I'll continue with NA and maybe SMART too. I think I like NA more, which is also weird. But, I guess I'm really serious about it this time. I'm still sponsor hunting, and I really want to find one so I can start step work. I don't want to rush though.\n\nThat's awesome you're almost done man! Congratulations!! I move down to 3 times a week next week, which was unexpected but they say I'm doing good. So I got that going for me! Haha. I will not have my graduation date set till the week before, but my estimated date I guess would be 10/17 if I continue going down as fast as I have been.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410494233", "subreddit": "OpiatesRecovery", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok a few people have asked what I did, so I'll try and cover it all here. Just a note, I am NOT fully recovered. As I type this I am getting some lower back pain and hip pain (sciatic notch) as well as tightness in my calf.  \n\nIf you're reading this and you have back pain near the spine and pain or tightness in your calf, thigh, hip, or groin please do yourself a favor and go see an Orthopedic Surgeon, you dont have to opt for the surgery but they will get you an MRI scheduled that your insurance should cover (most of) the cost of. I say this because a janky X-ray led a Chiropractor to think I did not have a bulged disc and ended up making it worse.  \n\nOk treatment.  \n\nIn late 2011 I thought it was just some random tightness as I had been running / training a lot for a sprint tri (would have been my first) the trainer I hired insisted I sit out and figure out why my leg was cramping up so bad. At this point the backpain was very background, turns out I have a high pain threshold and it wasn't registering my back. But my thigh and calf were getting tight after swimming, biking, and running.  \n\nIn early 2012 I started a new job about an hours drive away from my house. The leg tightness almost tripled in a few weeks. I started seeking medical advice and eventually (after 6 other drs) landed with a marathon running Chiro who claimed I had a \"Subluxated\" spine. He gave me a 6 month treatment program that included the bone cracking they do, stretching, and massages from an untrained masseuse using a handheld massager. The chiro also gave me a list of daily stretches to do in the morning. After the six months my leg pan was virtually gone, but then again I was getting a massage every other day from them and stretching alot, however, the backpain was now very noticeable.   \n\nI sought out the counsel of an Orthopedic that had awesome online testimonials from professional and amateur athletes alike and that was a back/spine specialist. He gave me a workout routine to try and used an MRI to discover the bulged disc. We immediately did the epidural procedure and scheduled a follow up. The epidural succccccccccccccccccccked. I had a giant needle shoved in my spine and felt pressure all over my back and legs. They said it would last for a few weeks, to be gentle, etc.. and see what happened when it went away. Aside from the pressure I felt my back and legs were pain free and tightness free. No numb toes, no tight calf, no sharp pain in the hip - nothing until mid December when it all came raging back.  \n\nThey wanted to schedule another injection but gave me the warning that there were no guarantees that injections would fix the problem, I could opt instead to do physical training. I was too broke to buy a second injection, so I went with the PT.  \n\nThey gave me a workout routine and suggested various PT's to hire. I hired one but could only afford a month and insurance didn't chip in for some reason I still dont understand (Thanks Obama!). I still follow variations of the workout routine they gave me / the PT taught me.  \n\nCurrent workout plan (it adjusts week to week).  \nDaily:  \nMORNING  \n- Wake up and lay on back, pull knees up to mid chest and hold for 60 seconds (lower back stretch)  \n- Place right ankle on left knee and pull forward, hold 60 seconds and switch (glutes)  \n- Do hamstring stretches (various) hold 60 secs each on problem leg, 45 secs each on normal leg  \n- Do calf stretches (various) hold 60 secs each on problem leg, 45 secs each on normal leg  \n- Do various other leg stretches based on tightness / need (groin, thigh, etc..) Always holding for 60 secs on problem leg, 45 on other  \n- Walk dogs 15-30 minutes  \n  \nDAYTIME (at the office)  \n- Get up and walk for a few minutes every hour.  \n- Stand while preparing lunch / Walk to get lunch  \n- Hydrobed massage at local gym for 10 to 20 minutes  \n- Place heatpad on lower back for 1 hour  \n  \nNIGHT  \n- Lay down on heat pad on couch for 1 hour  \n- Place calf split (for plantar facitis) on right leg and go to bed (makes sleeping suck! dont do it if a lady friend stays over)  \n\nGym:  \nMONDAY  \nBack and Bicep Day all 3 sets of 10 (just listing back workouts)  \n- Lower back extension machine (the one that leans back)  \n- Hyperextensions w/ added weight  \n- Deficit Deadlift  \n- Lat pull down  \n- Bent over row machine  \n- Pull up assist machine  \n  \nTUESDAY  \nChest and Tricep day  \n\nWEDNESDAY  \nCardio Day  \n- Repeat morning stretches  \n- Run with elliptical only for 30 mins  \n- Bike machine for 30 mins  \n- Stairmaster for like not very long because eff that thing  \n  \nTHURSDAY  \nRest in Pain day (lots of ice / icey hot / heat pads involved here. Also a massage if I can get one...)  \n  \nFRIDAY  \nLeg Day  \n  \nSATURDAY  \nRest in Pain day  \n  \nSUNDAY  \nMix (not back and biceps though)  \n\nThings I've never tried:  \n- Seat / sitting pillow for posture correction  \n- Pain blocking electrodes  \n- That thing sold on late night tv  \n- Spinal Fusion surgery  \n- Getting a new mattress  \n- Sticking a plywood board under my mattress  \n- A back brace (you wont believe how many people think this works)  \n- Driving less (supposedly my car isnt helping my recovery...)  \n- Standing desk (I want one though)  \n- Yoga ball desk chair (getting one)  \n- Yoga  \n- In-home decompression (chiro did some weird chin strap neck tug thingy)  \n\nNOTE: I am not a doctor, chiro, or medical professional of any kind. Just a pain sufferer trying to not suffer. None of this should be taken as advice and you should always consult your medical professional of choice first before doing anything. If you have anything else to add, please do. I'd love more tip sharing, etc.. maybe we can start a /r/sciatica sub?

I have now started my own business that has been growing more and more, and hopefully by this time next year i can take these shackles off.\n\nIt sucks, but the best advice i can give you is stick with it, man. Gotta get it, use it to you lose it, [enter trite saying thats supposed to motivate us peasants here]. Just make sure you set your goals to bigger and better things by working your way up, and not cement your ambitions to the first rung of the ladder.\n\nSoon enough, youll be well off and able to help others who are in the position you would have then used to have been in. \n\nFake it til you make it, brother.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410816302", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Birth control used to be expensive (thanks, Obama!) and still takes time/money/energy to pick up, get inserted, take, and/or get prescribed.\n\n* Clothing: Take formal events.

Its particle effects aren't necessarily any better than options less than half its cost, and unlike the more highly traded items at its price tier, it isn't a precursor. So really the only reason it would be traded is if you wanted that one specific skin. \n\nAnd I find this to be an issue with a number of skins, and things in general. Markets tend to die because there is no meaningful \"niche\". For crafting materials, this often means that the material itself isn't useful in enough recipes, and so why buy it? For skins, its often an issue of the skin not being \"worth\" the cost. Since the \"tiers\" of skins aren't really price protected, there is just this general \"no effects/boring skin\" -&gt; \"cool effects/skin\" -&gt; \"precursor\" -&gt; \"legendary\" price plateaus. Only, some skins have prices far above the quality of skin itself, and in rare cases (mainly less liked precursors) they are priced below. \n\nBut overall, I think the market itself is okay. The issue is more that ANet has a constantly evolving game, only certain things have not evolved with it. When the game was released, a lot of these SP weapons were by far the coolest things out there, and so they warranted the generally middle-ground between \"normal\" exotic skins and precursor/legendary skins. However, the game has evolved, we now have things like Ambrite weapons you can craft and a ton of black lion skins, and this has put these other items which are subject to other forces like their crafting components in weird areas. \n\nTL;DR I think the biggest issue that affects the market is items not having worth equal to their cost. Either due to them being overpriced for the quality of the luxury item, due to the item being priced above its use, or because the item simply has no wide use.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411269078", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Lots of good line items already listed here and i don't think i have much i can add there.\n\nA few tips that helped us:\n\n-If you are finding out the sex, don't tell anyone until after the shower (assuming that she is having one).  We didn't find out the sex and got a bunch of unisex things that we actually needed and can now use for siblings.  I have friends that got huge piles of pink/blue clothes because thats what everyone buys if they know it is a girl/boy and had to go buy everything they needed.   Our families and friends showed up at the hospital with piles of clothes and we made out in the end here. \n\n-Formula is killer ($25 a week) so nursing is great, but its a huge pain for mom, that is kind of a personal choice so I won't weigh in much there.   Breast pumps (which she will need if she goes back to work) are now required to be covered under insurance (thanks Obamacare).\n\n-Our budget actually shrank at first because even with the added costs with baby, we stopped going out to eat, the movies, and traveling.  I know it kind of sounds like a buzzkill, but almost everything about your current life is about to change. \n\n-Another tax credit that you don't mention is the childcare tax credit, FSA is almost always better.  However, after the FSA is exhausted you can use this for the last $1k, or if your job doesn't offer a FSA this is is a good 2nd option.  \n\n-If your wife is thinking about going back to work, even part time.  Look for childcare now.  Infant childcare can be a little hard to come by and usually has waiting lists.  We got stuck recently because we needed something quick.  We had to go with our second choice which was more expensive.  There were really only 2 or 3 places in town that fit our needs.  \n\nGood luck.
