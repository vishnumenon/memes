{"body": "Ugh, sorry, wanted to respond to this earlier but broke both my arms. Assuming you're still around, OP, one does not simply explain one of the more complicated ideas in modern theoretical science, but I'm going to do my best. The theory has developed in recent years due to increased research and funding - thanks, Obama - but the core ideas have remained similar since Einstein's hypotheses. Now picture a bundle of sticks, not as OP, but as a single subatomic particle. It exists not at a single point but actually stretches out along a 1 dimensional line in space (such revelation, wow). Each particle existing on a plane like this allows for exponentially more dimensions to the previously-perceived universe - more than three hundred and fiddy in total. This shit is confusing, I don't know what you expected, but the theoretical framework of this string theory can actually be unified and confirmed by something called \"M theory\". Now there are ideas behind solutions of M theory than there are ideas of contents of the safe, but physicists like Stephen Hawking believe it to be the only tenable candidate for a complete theory of the universe.

{"body": "&gt;Everybody seems to love \"the bike scene\", for instance, but I think its almost reached the level of uncomfortable now.\n\nI went back through my post history, and all I can do now is [wring my hands](http://otakuorbit.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/kill-la-kill-16-img-4.png). That said, I guess it's pretty cool that the magic of the internet allows for something retrospective like this- [Ep. 4 discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2ctg7u/this_week_in_anime_summer_week_5/cjj0cqv?context=3)\n\nI mean, good lord, I could draw a more coherent and interesting [thematic read](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2c6d9n/this_week_in_anime_summer_week_4/cjcvon4) of the show closer to it's start than it's end- and that's not how it should be at all. Just... seeing all that whoosh by is heartbreaking.\n\nAnd it's not like the show's ending couldn't have turned out better, even at that late hour! Humour me, but having the ending play out as it did except with Shibazaki *arresting* 9 and 12- maybe have a tacit acknowledgement that 9 and 12 acted out of desperation, that they went too far but didn't know any other means while Shibazaki chastises them for their shortsightedness while considering their unwillingness to cross the moral line of killing people- have him say something to the effect of \"The judge will have to consider that in deciding your sentences\" while he handcuffs them; have that leading to justice being served to all parties, and for dialogue and reformation to prevail instead- yes, maybe it is overly simplistic and twee, and it wouldn't even go all that long a way to fixing the show's problems, but then at least that ending would impart *meaning*.\n\nBecause having Team America, World Police outright martyring them is so *meaningless*. You want to make a political statement about how American military overreaction is unhealthy? You need to be talking about *terrorism* first and how that relates to America, rather than this weird facsimile of domestic \"not-really-terrorism terrorism\" that has almost nothing to do with Japan's international relations. I'm not exactly a fan of American international policy over the past decade either, but that doesn't excuse it's arbitrary use in a narrative that's ostensibly talking about something else.\n\nI get that this is Watanabe's little morality play condemning internal Japanese corruption- that the show's about the ghosts of the past forcing the youth of tomorrow into greater and greater extremes to be heard, and it is up to the present generation to guide, prevent or correct the mistakes of both sides before it's too late- but for that to work there has to be an acknowledgement of the agency of all parties, that everyone has a choice and a part to play.\n\nSlapping a giant \"THANKS OBAMA!\" sticker on the ending- ignoring all the historical context that led Japan to it's current political situation in the first place- that just shoves all the responsibility onto some nebulous malignant foreign entity with unmarked black helicopters. That's just lazy writing, and lazy writing betrays lazy thinking. And that is disappointing, because the resultant narrative becomes just so *meaningless*.\n\n(I find it kinda hilarious that I could derive something more from Aldnoah.Zero, of all things- especially when I had extremely different expectations between the two shows.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412254195", "subreddit": "TrueAnime", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Near the beginning of the Third Age of Humanity, there arose a human leader known as Obama.  He apparently was very quickly deified, for the expression \"Thanks, Obama!\" seems to have taken on a ritualistic significance around this time.  Artifacts and records containing the phrase have been found thousands of miles apart, most of them regarding situations in which the historical Obama could not feasibly have been involved.  Based upon this, historians and archaeologists have concluded that the phrase was designed to appease or invoke Obama, much as we invoke the name of Celestia.  This is the only instance of a Celestia-like figure known to modern Equestrian archaeology, as humans of the Third Age generally despised their leaders -- a fact that strikes most of us ponies as unthinkable.\n\nIn a fascinating development, recent excavations have uncovered evidence of another similar figure, known only as \"Malar's Son\".  This figure seems to have been invoked near-identically to Obama, with ritual utterances of \"Thanks, Malar's Son!\".  However, he apparently received only a small fraction of the worship given to Obama.  This has led some scholars to suggest that Malar's Son may have been the subject of a rival religious order or cult that conflicted with mainstream Obama-worship -- though this is merely conjecture.\n\nEven more mysterious is the entity known as \"Malar\".  To date, archaeologists and historians have found no mention whatsoever of this figure outside of prayers to Malar's Son.  But he is generally assumed to have been a demon of some type, because seriously, just listen to his name.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412265827", "subreddit": "mylittlepony", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

The President is allowing for more research and discussion from the feds and the states.   That seems reasonable to me.  Canada and the Company want to use eminent domain which is pretty scary since it is not USA and it is a private company.  Part of the pause comes from a Bush order;  _\"As usual, the political cauldron has been thoroughly churned during this President’s tenure. Eight years ago, President George Bush issued Executive Order 13406 which stated that the federal government must limit its use of taking private property for public use with just compensation for the purpose of benefiting the general public, wording mirrored in the U.S. Constitution. Bush’s Order 13406 limits the use of eminent domain so it may not be used for the purpose of advancing the economic interest of private parties to be given ownership or use of the property taken. While Bush’s Order applies only to the Feds, it certainly colors the same powers of the States and has an effect on the appellate courts.\"_   \nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2014/02/24/foreign-company-tries-to-seize-u-s-land-for-keystone-pipeline/   \nGranted- I am not well versed in this topic.

{"body": "This is incorrect.  Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg aren't actively *purchasing* more shares of their company.  They own their shares from founding the company.  They may start with 50% or something, but over time will be diluted (via private investment, and IPO).  So, they may end up with some fraction of the company, maybe 25% if they are lucky, maybe more in some rare cases.  Usually companies that big who make it to IPO have had multiple rounds of private financing to reach that point, meaning the founders will have much less than their original share of the company.  Of course this varies on a case-by-case basis.  \n\nAlso, they usually aren't making money through dividends.  First of all, dividends are not taxed at the capital gains rate, they are taxed as income, so you pay at your marginal income tax rate.  Secondly, usually companies like Facebook or Google or Microsoft in its earlier years will not pay out dividends at all, instead opting to reinvest those profits back into the company for more growth.  The way owners of these companies *can* make money that is taxed at the lower capital gains rate is by selling off shares they have held for over one year.  So, someone like Zuckerberg, say he wants to buy some property so he needs some cash,  can sell some of his own shares to a counterparty in the public market who wants to buy shares of facebook at the current price facebook is trading at.\n\nThat isn't to say that these companies don't eventually pay out dividends (Microsoft, for example, has been doing that since 2003), but likely the way these rich people are making money is by selling off shares of their company or shares of other companies they have invested in and have held for over a year.  This way, they can pay the 23.8% (used to be 15%, thanks Obama) capital gains rate instead of the 39.6% marginal tax rate.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413414263", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm an attorney that does Chapter 7 bankruptcies as part of my practice so I know college is more expensive and interest rates are higher for this generation and I know you can't get rid of them in bankruptcy (hardship discharge is nearly impossible to pull off).   This advice is geared to millenials who are staring at doing it mostly on their own, like I did: 1) Do go to college but think carefully about your major and the cost of your college or university.  For example, don't go to an out of state private college with high tuition and do a major that doesn't actually earn much.  Pick your school based on what you actually want to do and if you're not sure, pick a good school with reasonable tuition.  2)  Don't get private loans because they will charge you high interest and have repayment terms that are insane.  Get federal student loans like Stafford and PLUS loans since they have lower fixed rate interest and sane repayment.  Borrow as little as possible and know that there is new legislation that ties your loan payments to actual income so that you  can live after college. No matter what happens in your career, these loans will go away if pay consistently for 25 years or if you do public service (Thanks Obama!).  Why does this matter so much?  Private loans have high payments and they never go away because you can never pay enough to get rid of the interest and they will hunt you down. 3) When you're in school, work some to build work experience and avoid borrowing but not so much that you kill your studying and ruin your social life.  Avoid spending that becomes a loan you'll regret.  Example:  morning coffee at Starbucks.  It adds up and means longer payments when you graduate.  4)  In the past, it was always a good idea to go to college because you almost always made more than a high school grad and it added to your life.  This is still true if you plan carefully.  I had a rough time getting through undergrad and law school because I did it through working and loans with no breaks of any kind.  It took longer and was tougher but I regret nothing.  So please, live your dreams and know that those of us who have been through it and are out there ahead of you will be there to help.

{"body": "Oh Boy. I'm ashamed to say but I am former alumni of the class of 2012. I literally write a novel on what the Hell was wrong with that school but here's a quick rundown of what really chaffed my ass:\n\n1. Despite the fact that I was going to school for a degree in Web Design, they really didn't have the whole program worked out yet and the fact of the matter is, the web design industry changes so quickly and rapidly that when by the time I left, they got rid of the 2 Flash classes I was required to take. So I wasted alot of money on 2 classes that was obsolete in a year and a half.\n\n2. Let's talk about money for a second. I actually was pretty fortunate to walk away with a single monthly loan to pay off as I had requested to get on a student loan forgiveness plan that was introduced by Obama back in 2012. (Thanks Obama!) I wish I can say the same for my fellow classmates because these guys are barely making wages in their current jobs and I can barely pay off the mountain of debt. An associate alone is likely going to be 30k. That's alot of money but think how much that debt is when you can only get a job that pays 20k a year. I graduated with a Bachelor but i'm making 25k and i'm one of the lucky ones.\n\n3. The advisers are not your friend. These guys are fucking vultures and prey on kids and their parents and try everything they can to get kids into this school. I remember sitting in on a graphic design class and one of the students ask me about a piece of art on the screen. I came to find out the guy was colorblind! I couldn't believe it. I started to realize that there were more than alot of these kids at school. Graphic Designers who were color blind. Web Designers who couldn't code HTML or CSS in their second year. Animators that couldn't even draw a line!\n\n4. The school was completely wasteful and shortsighted. I remember back in 2010 when the 6th floor of the Yorktown campus was being converted into a multi-million dollar sound studio with high-tech audio equipment and custom sound absorbing walls. That studio lasted less than 6 months because the campus moved to 59 and Kirby. Ask about it and people look at you like you're crazy.\n\n4. I can maybe think of 2 or 3 teachers from 3 different departments that were actually pretty good. Alot of the teachers there only taught you the bare minimum and gave you a passing grade if you looked ok. My worse teache experience was with a graphic designed teacher that actually fell asleep in class, gave me a hard time when I turned him down on a date, and would constantly make lewd remarks and he still wasn't fired.\n\n**TL/DR** - All in all, I HATED that school. I can't turn back time to get back those 3-4 years of my life back but I sure as Hell will bad mouth that school every chance I get and discourage kids from going there. I'm currently going back to school to get my associates of Science and I would rather proudly say I went to a community college than the Art Institute.\n\n**EDIT** - I'm reading through the comments and I just want to add that i'm currently going to LSC and some of my credits ARE transferable but not a whole lot. I have to retake science and another math class but my core credits like English and History are basically done with.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413676405", "subreddit": "houston", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

If I get some free time today, I'll rewrite it to fix the setting.)\n\nThe battering ram pounded against the gate of the Alamo.  \n\n“Everybody get off the walls!” Lyndon Johnson yelled as the presidents took cover from another barrage of arrows.  “That gate won’t hold much longer!”\n\n“We should retreat into the buildings,” James Buchanan nervously suggested, holding onto his sword with shaking hands.  “We won’t stand a chance in the courtyard.”\n\n“Not an option!” Teddy Roosevelt replied.  The president leaned over the wall and aimed his bow at the enemy army.  Ignoring the projectiles sailing past his head, Roosevelt fired an arrow into the Prime Minister of Kosovo.  “Every building in this fort is engulfed in flames,” Roosevelt continued.  “There’s nowhere for us to run.”  The president turned around and flashed a maniacal grin at his countrymen.  “We have them right where we want them.”\n\n“That’s right!” Ulysses Grant said, sharing Roosevelt’s optimism.  The former general tipped back a bottle of whiskey, swallowed the last drops, and chucked it over the wall.  The glass bottle shattered as it connected with Shinzo Abe’s head.  “It’s time for glory, boys!” Grant said, opening another bottle of whiskey.\n\n“There’s too damn many of them,” Franklin Pierce said through gritted teeth as he held his leg.  An arrow stuck out of his shin.  “I swear we must’ve killed a hundred of them but they keep coming.”\n\n“That’s because there’s 192 of them!” Grant laughed, drunkenly stumbling across the battlements to Pierce’s side.  “Now let’s get that leg amputated and get you back to work, lad!”\n\n“Stay away, you lunatic!” Pierce screamed.  “I don’t even have any more arrows to shoot.  Nixon stole them all.”\n\n“I am not a crook!” Nixon yelled from a few feet away.  “Talk to that swarthy skinned fellow over there.  He’s been hogging all the arrows.  And he stole my last Charleston Chew!”\n\n“Thanks, Obama,” Franklin Pierce said sarcastically.\n\n“Let me be clear,” Obama interjected.  “I took the arrows because Pierce had more than everybody else.  I thought it’d be better for the defense of the fort if we redistributed them more evenly.”\n\n“Don’t start with this crap again!” Nixon yelled, his jowls shaking with rage. \n\n“Why won’t you give up your fair share?” Obama demanded.\n\n“You know, talking like that in my day would’ve gotten you thrown in jail.”\n\n“It was a different time, Richard.”\n\n“No kidding.  I got impeached for wiretapping a couple of phones.  Meanwhile you can get away with the NSA and-”\n\n“Get down!” Johnson interrupted as another barrage of arrows sailed toward the fort.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did not take cover quickly enough and an arrow stuck into his thick chest.\n\n“Roosevelt!” Johnson yelled.\n\n“Don’t worry, Lyndon,” Teddy said as he ripped the arrow from his chest.  “It’ll take more than that to kill a bull moose.”  Roosevelt notched the still-bloody arrow and sent it into the heart of the Prime Minister of Haiti.  \n\nThe gate began to crack under the battering ram’s relentless pounding.\n\nAndrew Jackson stood up and wiped the dust off of his club.  “Nobody kill the Prime Minister of Spain,” he said.  “That man is mine.”\n\n“Everybody to the courtyard!” James Polk yelled to the surviving presidents.  “We make our stand there!  Come on, Pierce!”\n\nPolk grabbed Pierce’s sleeve to help him to his feet.  Polk froze as he realized that another arrow had landed right between Pierce’s eyes.\n\nThere were only nine presidents remaining of the original forty three.  The first casualty was William Henry Harrison, who had contracted pneumonia while the enemy army was on the way and died before the battle started.  \n\nArrows fired during the siege had taken down most of the presidents.  Taft’s corpse looked like a pincushion with all of the arrows sticking out of his enormous belly.\n\nThe international army had managed to place some ladders on the Alamo’s walls and several world leaders successfully reached the top of the wall.  The vicious melee inflicted heavy losses on the Presidents.  Recep Erdogan of Turkey fought like a man possessed.  After stepping off the ladder, he threw a spear through John Adams with so much force that the projectile tore through the president and fatally wounded John Quincy Adams who was standing behind his father.\n\nThe presidents may very well have lost the battle right there had Abraham Lincoln not used his incredible strength to throw the ladders backwards off the wall.\n\nAt last, the Presidents were out of time.  The gate began to crumble as the battering ram punched away.  The surviving Americans formed a line in front of the collapsing gate as the international army poured through.  \n\n“Time to go nukular on this army!” George W Bush yelled, charging forward.  \n\nThe presidents fought for their lives in the courtyard, cutting down leader after leader.  Outnumbered as they were, the remaining Americans were not without advantages.  They still had their two most ferocious fighters, Andrew Jackson and Teddy Roosevelt.  Moreover, their spirits were kept high by the enthusiasm of men like Grant and George W Bush.\n\n“Don’t mess with Texas!” Bush bellowed as he decapitated David Cameron.  \n\nDespite the massive casualties the Americans were inflicting, the international army began to make their presence felt.  Angela Merkel managed to land her sword between Obama’s ribs.  As the President fell to one knee, holding his side, Merkel held her sword above his head.\n\n“This is for reading my e-mail, arschloch,” she said as she decapitated the President.\n\nA few feet away, Mariano Rajoy of Spain and Enrique Nieto of Mexico surrounded Ulysses Grant and cut down the former general.\n\n“Piensas que ellos van a recordar como esto terminó la última vez?” Nieto asked Rajoy.\n\nFrom across the courtyard, George W Bush threw his sword into Nieto’s chest.\n\n“We speak American in this country!” Bush yelled just before Manmohan Singh drove a spear through his throat.\n\nDespite their losses, victory still seemed possible.  But then, disaster struck.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt took aim with his bow and fired a shot into the Prime Minister of Poland.  Suddenly, Roosevelt recognized the figure standing behind the dead Pole.  \n\nIt was Putin.  \n\nThe shirtless Russian had used the Polish Prime Minister as a human shield and now had a bow aimed at Roosevelt.  The bull moose tried to reload as quickly as he could, but it was too late.  Putin’s arrow landed right between Roosevelt’s eyes, shattering his spectacles as it tore through his head.  \n\n“Aroo!” an angry Nixon yelled as he charged Putin.  \n\nPutin drew a sword to parry away Nixon’s attack and launched a devastating kick to the president’s knee, crippling him.  Nixon fell to the ground in pain and James Buchanan attempted to stab Putin in the back.  In one fluid motion, Putin blocked the thrust and drew a mace with his free hand.  The spiked ball swung around and caved in Buchanan’s head.  \n\nThe Russian stood above Nixon, spinning his mace.\n\n“Sock it to me!” Nixon bellowed defiantly.  \n\nPutin obliged him, bringing the mace down on the wounded President.\n\nThe other leaders stopped fighting and gathered around to watch Putin finish off the presidents.  The international army began to chant Putin’s name (except for Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the Ukraine who remained bitterly silent.)\n\nOne at a time, the Presidents fell until, at last, only Jackson remained.  The fatigued President struggled to block Putin’s relentless attacks.  Putin knocked Jackson off his feet and swung down with the mace.  Jackson barely lifted his club in time.  The spiked ball stuck in Jackson’s club and the president attempted to disarm the Russian.  \n\nPutin kicked Jackson in the face and the President fell onto his back.  Without a word, Putin stepped toward the final president.  \n\nJackson had just finished making his peace with God when a miracle happened.  Suddenly, something fell from above and crushed Putin.  Jackson wiped the sweat from his eyes and saw what had killed his enemy.  It was Taft.  \n\nWith a half dozen arrows in him, Taft had summoned the last of his strength, threw himself off the wall, and crushed Vladimir Putin beneath his 300 pound frame.  \n\nWith his dying breath, Taft whispered to Andrew Jackson, “Remember the Alamo.”\n\nJackson rose to his feet and faced the remaining fifty soldiers of the international army.  The final president picked up Putin’s sword and charged with Taft’s last words on his lips.\n\n“Remember the Alamo!” he yelled as he ran towards death.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413903647", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "CARV buff was INSANELY GOOD. Not gonna lie, malorn is a god\n\nStriker sucks dick (pls get buffed)\n\nPounders are outdone by Ravens. NC MAXes are simply better than TR ones in every scenario (Ravens are nearly as good as TR chainguns if not better imo).\n\nTheir aircraft is better (undo Mosquito nerf of 9/2013 pls), their MBT is more useful in 80 % of scenarios after the HE nerfs and Lockdown nerfs which I didn't comprehend until the shield got nerfed, now I can see the reason for it but imo the Prowler's niche is very limited. Also it's ES options are complete garbage and have zero synergy with  the tank itself, it's like they forgot about the existence of the Prowler and only thought about the Harasser.\n\nAR's TR has an advantage imo, lacks variety though compared to any faction\n\nCarbines are even, the addition of the Cougar and Lynx rework addressed most of the issues.\n\nSMGs, Failstorm has it in its name and the Cyclone is love and life. Also the TRAP.. Well to be fair all ES snipers suck.\n\nSo here's your TR biased opinion (I'm not gonna lie, this is very biased and you can argue about at least half of my conclusions based on your point of view). I would like to know, why would YOU play TR? You don't have to be objective, even the most biased opinion in the world would help because right now all I can think of is the Banshee and high ROF for shits and giggles (MCG anyone?). Oh and btw the extra mags are there only because of low bullet damage and high ROF to balance the DPM (damage per mag), so if you bring that up please tie it with the high ROF point.\n\nTL;DR NC is well balanced but just straight up better and has more variety in its gameplay (if we discount the good old shotgun statement). VS has some stupid shit that needs nerfing and is very solid overall. TR is bleeding players, not sure what to do to bring them back. Didn't help that the entire faction got (rightfully) nerfed into oblivion last year and that the gunplay is very stale and centers around randomized horizontal recoil which penalizes player skill (thanks obama).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414164440", "subreddit": "Planetside", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well before jumping to something that may not work for you I would encourage you to stick it out. 4 months on keto is not a long time, and 2 months of weird symptoms makes sense if you're just getting started burning all this fat. \n\nI would suggest talking to your doctor to make sure its not an underlying condition that you were unaware of first, and keep calm keto on for at least another month before you decide to make a change.\n\nOther than that, what scares you about the placement?\n\nHere's how it went down for me. I had been on oral contraceptives for a while, but I was very worried about the fact that if I got sick or forgot it would affect the efficacy. I switched to NuvaRing, but my boyfriend insisted I take it out during sex and there were several times when I *forgot to put it back in*. Also, when I was looking to get it placed I was only 25.. I figured 5 years was not too long a time and that since I wasn't married yet that kids wouldn't be in the picture for a very long while. Plus, you can get it removed and pretty much immediately conceive (compared to something like the implant or the shot). \n\nMy largest fear was that it would fail and come out and I'd be out the $500 I had to spend.\n\nUnlike many people I read about online, my doctor had no qualms giving it to me, even though I was young and had never had children. The insertion goes in 2 stages. First they stick a device into your uterus to see how large it is - this is called sounding. If you've ever had a pap-smear it feels very similar to that.\n\nThe actual placement, however. I nearly passed out. It was a *very intense pain* for a split-second, then it was done. (However, if that's what a pencil-sized object feels like going through there, it makes me question people who have babies without drugs!) After that it just felt like bad cramps. For the first few months, I'd feel a pinching sensation behind my navel every now and then, but not to the point that it was disturbing or highly uncomfortable.\n\nWhen that one \"expired\" they yanked it out and put in a new one in one fell swoop. This time it didn't hurt, some slight cramping, and that's about it.\n\nOverall, its been *amazing.* Totally worth the $500 I spent the first time, and the replacement was free due to the healthcare reform (THANKS OBAMA!)\n\n\nEDIT to ADD: If you're the type of person that doesn't like to get up close and personal with your lady bits, I might steer you away from an IUD, however. For the first couple of months you have to check the placement by checking the strings sticking out of your cervix, which means fingers up in your lady bits. I know that some people get squicked out doing that, so if that's you I would suggest a different form of BC.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414432512", "subreddit": "xxketo", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Excuse the absolutely autistic things I'm about to say, I swear they're relevant somehow. Brianna Wu reminds me of this guy in the competitive Pokemon youtube community (spot the 'tism in that sentence) by the name of Verlisify. He rode a wave of new interest in competitive with the release of XY since people were looking for video guides and he was one of the first people to get competitive guides up. They were fucking terrible and anyone with experience knew it, but the new players didn't want to admit they wasted their time on someone that was actually terrible at the game so they dug out their trenches and shut out any other opinions. How does this matter at all? Well Verlisify was a special kind of person: a chronic victim. \n\nSee, there's a large community of competitive players called Smogon. It exists as a community for the truly autistic among us that want to be the best like no one ever was. However, they're generally pretty nice and are always willing to help out new players. They want the game to be as balanced and skill-based as possible and are the easiest of easy targets whenever anyone gets angry about competitive. \"Fucking Smogon\" is a phrase uttered in a similar way to \"thanks Obama\". So when Smogon players told this Verlisify kid how bad his strategies are and how he's misinforming his sizable fanbase by making them think Smogon is this hive of evil and conformity (when it's really just a site that wants balance and diversity in effective playstyles), he had his scapegoat. \"I'M BEING ATTACKED, I'M SUCH A VICTIM, DONATE TO MY PATREON\" was his response. When people offered to debate or discuss with him, he turned down everyone that wouldn't specifically give him a soapbox. \n\nWhen people were getting even angrier at the now-professional victim, his fans dug deeper trenches and ignored everything that wasn't blind fanaticism. People on the internet want wars but they don't want criticism. A lot of internet culture involves projecting yourself into the world without having to listen to criticism. Brianna Wu and other professional victims thrive on their delusions and think other people deserve to treat them well just for existing even if they've never proven to be worth caring about. The white knights will be there to protect them against all logic, and being a victim is a good way to further a profitable narrative so why should they reflect on their actions? Becoming popular because they got gud would be difficult for useless sacks of human tissue, starting wars on the internet is so much easier.

{"body": "Big Ten checking in.\n\nThe B1G is the oldest conference in the nation at this level, starting up back in the late 1890s. At the time it was a collection of academic and athletic powerhouses. Made up of public schools (except Northwestern), every university in the conference has at least 30,000 students (except Northwestern). \n\nThe B1G is home to some of college football's most storied programs. Several of the schools are in the top of the list for number of championships (claimed). Led by Ohio State, Michigan, Minnesota, Michigan State, Illinois, and Nebraska, the B1G represents 46 national champtionships in football. \n\nStill, in the past couple decades, the B1G has lost some luster. It's been historically known for smash mouth, power football, and despite the influx of modern offenses and southern talent, the B1G just doesn't bring in the best players anymore. I blame the climate; among the main conferences, only the B1G has so little football weather year-round. \n\nThe reason for the current status of the conference is up for speculation. Read deep enough in any thread on /r/CFB and you'll find someone making comments about recruitment, money, aliens, lizard people, Satan, the BCS and the Catholic church conspiring against the B1G.\n\nI think the B1G sees itself as a third place conference when it comes to football. Clearly behind the SEC, maybe behind the PAC or Big XII, whoever is good that year, but ahead of the ACC. The rest of the P5 conferences see the B1G as an aging pushover, and the B1G's inter-conference performance makes it harder to argue.\n\nIn the end, the B1G is the oldest and largest conference, once the most prestigious, but is losing ground the other P5 conferences year by year. \n\nThanks, Obama.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414589921", "subreddit": "CFB", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "At first he thought it was probably just pubic hair. I mean, it's not like the rest of his body is devoid of hair. Befuddled by this new discovery, the man, who's name was Joseph, walked slowly into his office while favoring his morning cup of coffee. Setting it down gently by the monitor, he sat down at the computer. Joseph carefully arranged his keyboard and mouse so that they were properly lined up. \n\nGlancing up at the nearby table, he saw that there were some papers askew, so he got up to rearrange them. Joseph enjoyed this ritual, as it calmed him down to see that everything was in its place. Sitting back down at the computer, he began to ponder the discovery at the drain. He lived alone, he reminded himself. Joseph didn't really need to remind himself of this fact, because his cat Noodles did that for him, cooing as it brushed up against his ankle. \"You forgot to feed me, you blithering fool!\" Noodles seemed to chirp emphatically. It would seem that, although Joseph was meticulous about his own needs and grooming, he had forgotten about Noodles.\n\n\"This is the last straw!\" Noodles looked up at him affectionately. Joseph walked into the kitchen and poured the persistent and cunningly sinister cat some breakfast chow. Before serving it to Noodles, he patted it down until it had a perfect flat surface. Noodles, to his credit, only meowed about 15 times during this procedure. Finally satisfied, Joseph bend down and put the bowl in front of Noodles. The cat went straight to work on the kitty chow.\n\nRelieved to be back online, Joseph felt a rush of endorphins as he started to browse. He starting loading up some tabs. *r/cleaningtips*, *NeatHacks.com*.\n\nJoseph went on reddit to check the news. \"FUNNIEST GIF OF ALL TIME\" -\"PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS THANKS OBAMA\" - \"THE HISTORY CHANNEL LAUNCHES YET ANOTHER ANCIENT ALIENS SERIES\" - \"MUTANT CAT SUSPECTED OF PETTY LARCENY\". \n\nJoseph glanced at the doorway, to see Noodles sitting there innocently. His eyes weren't so innocent, however. They glowed green and red and shimmered iridescently. These were the eyes of the all-powerful Hypnocat, but what was Noodles doing with them? This thought didn't happen to cross Joseph's mind, as he was now staring, mesmerized, into Noodles' compelling visage. \n\nSeeing nothing of interest, Joseph touched a finger to his face broodingly. It was oily. Getting up from the computer, Joseph walked to the bathroom to wash his face. As he stepped on the linoleum tiling he-\n\nNoodelius Formaggio blinked his eyes slowly, getting his bearings with his surroundings. A blue linoleum floor stretched out before him. This bathroom seemed to be all that was standing between him and world domination. Reaching up to touch his now human head he reeled back in disgust as he felt the oily bald pate that was waiting for him. \"Inconceivable!\" he mouthed contemptuously. This would not stand. He strode out of the bathroom.\n\nNoodelius's pulse was rising as he reached the downstairs closet. Soon he would be rid of this place. Carefully feeling for the pressure plate along the back wall, he gave a firm push, and *click* it slid aside to reveal a cat-sized hole. He tried to squeeze through it determinedly, but it was no use. Instead he lunged his arm through the portal and retrieved a medium-sized box. \"Satisfaction will be mine\" he thought to himself.\n\nLooking into the mirror in which he could not recognize himself (he was a cat, after all), Noodelius pushed through the disturbing out of body experience, and got to work. An hour passed. Then another.\n\nFinally satisfied, Noodelius looked contentedly at the displaced image in the mirror. It was finally complete. He pushed the remains of Joseph's pajamas out of the way with his foot, and admired his new fur coat.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414778743", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Interestingly enough, these were made in Australia, but built to withstand frigid temperatures, because it was made in the year 1926, when most of the continent was covered in ice, unlike it's current hot environment today (thanks Obama). They hold exactly 9 rounds of .19 caliber bollettes. Back in the day, the type of material used to make these guns were denoted by its \"gender\". There were 10 total genders of guns, each gender a different material, being made of either tungsten metal, wood, graphene, porcelain, pykrete, piecrust, polymer, solid mercury, glass, Damascus steel,  That fourth one, porcelain, is what your gun in the picture is made of. That's why it's the Glock 7, Gen4, chambered in 9 rounds of .19 cowlibber \"problem solver\" boolitz. History is quite marvelous.

We're not going to have a revolution or an uprising, no matter how many young people wish otherwise.\n\nSo if you don't exercise your right to vote, you don't get to complain about politics.\n\nOur system of government insures that change can be made but at a slow pace to prevent the party in power from upending everything. But I assure you--though I doubt you'll believe me--all candidates are no alike. Look into the candidates for yourself, read about their public appearances and statements, find someone with views you can identify with and support them. Otherwise run yourself, once you meet the few requirements for whichever office you're most interested in. But you must understand, when not painting a complex issue with one wide brush, different issues can be resolved at different levels of government, so know exactly which politician to hold accountable, be it a local alderman, a mayor, a congressman, a senator, etc.  Don't be one of those uninformed people who throw around \"thanks, Obama\"-bullshit without know what the president can and cannot do.
