{"body": "(Coincidentally, I wrote a story a couple months ago that ends in a duel between Andrew Jackson and Putin.)\n\nThe battering ram pounded against the gate of the Alamo.  \n\n“Everybody get off the walls!” Lyndon Johnson yelled as the presidents took cover from another barrage of arrows.  “That gate won’t hold much longer!”\n\n“We should retreat into the buildings,” James Buchanan nervously suggested, holding onto his sword with shaking hands.  “We won’t stand a chance in the courtyard.”\n\n“Not an option!” Teddy Roosevelt replied.  The president leaned over the wall and aimed his bow at the enemy army.  Ignoring the projectiles sailing past his head, Roosevelt fired an arrow into the Prime Minister of Kosovo.  “Every building in this fort is engulfed in flames,” Roosevelt continued.  “There’s nowhere for us to run.”  The president turned around and flashed a maniacal grin at his countrymen.  “We have them right where we want them.”\n\n“That’s right!” Ulysses Grant said, sharing Roosevelt’s optimism.  The former general tipped back a bottle of whiskey, swallowed the last drops, and chucked it over the wall.  The glass bottle shattered as it connected with Shinzo Abe’s head.  “It’s time for glory, boys!” Grant said, opening another bottle of whiskey.\n\n“There’s too damn many of them,” Franklin Pierce said through gritted teeth as he held his leg.  An arrow stuck out of his shin.  “I swear we must’ve killed a hundred of them but they keep coming.”\n\n“That’s because there’s 192 of them!” Grant laughed, drunkenly stumbling across the battlements to Pierce’s side.  “Now let’s get that leg amputated and get you back to work, lad!”\n\n“Stay away, you lunatic!” Pierce screamed.  “I don’t even have any more arrows to shoot.  Nixon stole them all.”\n\n“I am not a crook!” Nixon yelled from a few feet away.  “Talk to that swarthy skinned fellow over there.  He’s been hogging all the arrows.  And he stole my last Charleston Chew!”\n\n“Thanks, Obama,” Franklin Pierce said sarcastically.\n\n“Let me be clear,” Obama interjected.  “I took the arrows because Pierce had more than everybody else.  I thought it’d be better for the defense of the fort if we redistributed them more evenly.”\n\n“Don’t start with this crap again!” Nixon yelled, his jowls shaking with rage. \n\n“Why won’t you give up your fair share?” Obama demanded.\n\n“You know, talking like that in my day would’ve gotten you thrown in jail.”\n\n“It was a different time, Richard.”\n\n“No kidding.  I got impeached for wiretapping a couple of phones.  Meanwhile you can get away with the NSA and-”\n\n“Get down!” Johnson interrupted as another barrage of arrows sailed toward the fort.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt did not take cover quickly enough and an arrow stuck into his thick chest.\n\n“Roosevelt!” Johnson yelled.\n\n“Don’t worry, Lyndon,” Teddy said as he ripped the arrow from his chest.  “It’ll take more than that to kill a bull moose.”  Roosevelt notched the still-bloody arrow and sent it into the heart of the Prime Minister of Haiti.  \n\nThe gate began to crack under the battering ram’s relentless pounding.\n\nAndrew Jackson stood up and wiped the dust off of his club.  “Nobody kill the Prime Minister of Spain,” he said.  “That man is mine.”\n\n“Everybody to the courtyard!” James Polk yelled to the surviving presidents.  “We make our stand there!  Come on, Pierce!”\n\nPolk grabbed Pierce’s sleeve to help him to his feet.  Polk froze as he realized that another arrow had landed right between Pierce’s eyes.\n\nThere were only nine presidents remaining of the original forty three.  The first casualty was William Henry Harrison, who had contracted pneumonia while the enemy army was on the way and died before the battle started.  \n\nArrows fired during the siege had taken down most of the presidents.  Taft’s corpse looked like a pincushion with all of the arrows sticking out of his enormous belly.\n\nThe international army had managed to place some ladders on the Alamo’s walls and several world leaders successfully reached the top of the wall.  The vicious melee inflicted heavy losses on the Presidents.  Recep Erdogan of Turkey fought like a man possessed.  After stepping off the ladder, he threw a spear through John Adams with so much force that the projectile tore through the president and fatally wounded John Quincy Adams who was standing behind his father.\n\nThe presidents may very well have lost the battle right there had Abraham Lincoln not used his incredible strength to throw the ladders backwards off the wall.\n\nAt last, the Presidents were out of time.  The gate began to crumble as the battering ram punched away.  The surviving Americans formed a line in front of the collapsing gate as the international army poured through.  \n\n“Time to go nukular on this army!” George W Bush yelled, charging forward.  \n\nThe presidents fought for their lives in the courtyard, cutting down leader after leader.  Outnumbered as they were, the remaining Americans were not without advantages.  They still had their two most ferocious fighters, Andrew Jackson and Teddy Roosevelt.  Moreover, their spirits were kept high by the enthusiasm of men like Grant and George W Bush.\n\n“Don’t mess with Texas!” Bush bellowed as he decapitated David Cameron.  \n\nDespite the massive casualties the Americans were inflicting, the international army began to make their presence felt.  Angela Merkel managed to land her sword between Obama’s ribs.  As the President fell to one knee, holding his side, Merkel held her sword above his head.\n\n“This is for reading my e-mail, arschloch,” she said as she decapitated the President.\n\nA few feet away, Mariano Rajoy of Spain and Enrique Nieto of Mexico surrounded Ulysses Grant and cut down the former general.\n\n“Piensas que ellos van a recordar como esto terminó la última vez?” Nieto asked Rajoy.\n\nFrom across the courtyard, George W Bush threw his sword into Nieto’s chest.\n\n“We speak American in this country!” Bush yelled just before Manmohan Singh drove a spear through his throat.\n\nDespite their losses, victory still seemed possible.  But then, disaster struck.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt took aim with his bow and fired a shot into the Prime Minister of Poland.  Suddenly, Roosevelt recognized the figure standing behind the dead Pole.  \n\nIt was Putin.  \n\nThe shirtless Russian had used the Polish Prime Minister as a human shield and now had a bow aimed at Roosevelt.  The bull moose tried to reload as quickly as he could, but it was too late.  Putin’s arrow landed right between Roosevelt’s eyes, shattering his spectacles as it tore through his head.  \n\n“Aroo!” an angry Nixon yelled as he charged Putin.  \n\nPutin drew a sword to parry away Nixon’s attack and launched a devastating kick to the president’s knee, crippling him.  Nixon fell to the ground in pain and James Buchanan attempted to stab Putin in the back.  In one fluid motion, Putin blocked the thrust and drew a mace with his free hand.  The spiked ball swung around and caved in Buchanan’s head.  \n\nThe Russian stood above Nixon, spinning his mace.\n\n“Sock it to me!” Nixon bellowed defiantly.  \n\nPutin obliged him, bringing the mace down on the wounded President.\n\nThe other leaders stopped fighting and gathered around to watch Putin finish off the presidents.  The international army began to chant Putin’s name (except for Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the Ukraine who remained bitterly silent.)\n\nOne at a time, the Presidents fell until, at last, only Jackson remained.  The fatigued President struggled to block Putin’s relentless attacks.  Putin knocked Jackson off his feet and swung down with the mace.  Jackson barely lifted his club in time.  The spiked ball stuck in Jackson’s club and the president attempted to disarm the Russian.  \n\nPutin kicked Jackson in the face and the President fell onto his back.  Without a word, Putin stepped toward the final president.  \n\nJackson had just finished making his peace with God when a miracle happened.  Suddenly, something fell from above and crushed Putin.  Jackson wiped the sweat from his eyes and saw what had killed his enemy.  It was Taft.  \n\nWith a half dozen arrows in him, Taft had summoned the last of his strength, threw himself off the wall, and crushed Vladimir Putin beneath his 300 pound frame.  \n\nWith his dying breath, Taft whispered to Andrew Jackson, “Remember the Alamo.”\n\nJackson rose to his feet and faced the remaining fifty soldiers of the international army.  The final president picked up Putin’s sword and charged with Taft’s last words on his lips.\n\n“Remember the Alamo!” he yelled as he ran towards death.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414801944", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You know how people create silly bots like the ones that reply when someone says, \"Thanks, Obama!\" or that convert imperial to metric or...whatever.  Lots of bots on reddit, right?\n\nNot knowing the first thing about programming of any kind, I don't have the first clue how they're written or how they work -- they might be very simple for all I know -- but the point is that individuals are able to write bots that...parse?...reddit and then do whatever it is they're written to do.\n\nSo, does the NSA monitor what's said on reddit?  I think it's likely, in that they have X amount of bots that flag certain things people say that may be worth looking into according to whatever criteria they like.  So, someone reads through what the bot has flagged and goes, \"Meh, not important.  Meh.  Boring.  Oh!  Yeah, we'll check this one out futher.  Meh.  I hate my job.  Meh.\"  And so on and so forth.\n\nOr so I imagine.  I could be 100% off the mark.\n\nEdit:  Of course, if they *do* do something like that, it's probably not all of reddit.  Maybe just certain subreddits, otherwise it'd be way too much.  Probably not too concerned with what they're talking about over in /r/pugs, for example, though there's probably not a great deal of \"subversive\" talk in subs like that, either.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414818429", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I kinda think of myself as a post ancap, because while I accept the moral arguments to a large degree, the economics is way off - basically behavioural economics has come along as a semi serious empirically based discipline and taken a big shit in most previous economic thought.\n\nSimple things like higher pay degrading performance being proven experimentally and so on do put a big cannonball through so much theory. Additionally, people are very easy to manipulate in several key ways and this forms the basis for a lot of mass market economics. \n\nSo we have a shit system no one actually want based on something unpleasantly manipulative. Not coerced, not even really fraud, but more subtle than that. Without some sort of system to mitigate the ability of some to manipulate the many at an unconscious or near unconsious level any free market just become feudalism in very short order, but not based on force, one based on manipulation. \n\nIn some ways I consider this worse. A gun in the face anyone can understand. That they have been only been buying things because of relative shape, size colour and location of adverts and shelf space seems like crazy talk.

I'm a repeat offender when it comes to getting into and falling out of the halo lore (mainly due to time commitments that don't always permit me to spend my time on it), and this guy's videos really help condense huge bits of information or speculation into a very concise video. Plus, like you said, he's extremely resourceful and I'm very glad he's able to put out as many videos as he does. Some days, when I check back into the channel, he has like 5 videos in the span of a week and I'm glad he does it. He enjoys it so much, he has a lot of followers and views and I think he's got a ton of support from casual gamers like me who like the story but don't have the time to spend reading all the books. One of these days, I'll start, but until then, his channel will keep me going. Plus, he sounds like one of my friends and I crack up every time I hear it because that dude doesn't like halo at all. In the beginning, I thought it was my buddy using a pseudonym, but once I saw a video where he showed his face, I realized he definitely wasn't my buddy. Thanks, /u/HaloFollower!

My Company, Inc. has been able to maintain a consistent level of employee contributions by providing employee only coverage at no cost for HMO and PPO plans for many years. At this time, we have no other option but to share some of the increase in our health insurance costs with employees to allow My Company to continue offering health insurance benefits. \n&gt;\n&gt;The cost for the My Company health plans will total close to $500,000 this year. As a result, employees participating in the My Company, Inc. health plans will experience a cost increase in the employee contribution requirement beginning December 1, 2014. \n&gt;\nIn addition to the change in contributions, we are also making a change in our health insurance provider. We were set to experience a 20% overall increase if we stayed with Aetna. We were able to lower the increase by switching to Blue Shield. \n&gt;\n&gt;This announcement is meant to notify employees of expected cost increases for budgeting and planning purposes. Open enrollment will begin on Friday, October 31st and all employees who wish to be covered under the My Company health insurance benefits must make an affirmative election to do so. Failure to complete an election/enrollment during this open enrollment period will result in no health insurance coverage.\n&gt;\n\n&gt;You are encouraged to carefully review the enrollment options to ensure your health insurance selection meets your needs and your budget. Please do not hesitate to contact Human Resources for any questions regarding the plan options available to you or to request additional information. \n\nThanks Obama", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415133481", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm facing the same situation (no kids though) but I'm strongly considering going with an HDHP, since my employer has gradually been pushing all employees to go that way with raising the LDHP's co-insurance and deductible and OOPM.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't just compare premiums, co-insurance, deductible and OOP Max, you also need to consider the tax implications. \n\nPlug your numbers into this HSA spreadsheet. \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2k3k78/trying_to_compare_health_insurance_plans/\n\nIf your marginal tax rate is high, an HSA can have even greater savings by saving you money on your yearly taxes by \"paying yourself\" into an HSA. HSAs have some unique properties that actually make them a pretty decent retirement savings vehicle. I don't think it's outrageous to say funding an HSA before an IRA is a good idea. \n\nSo. Pay less in premiums. If you can afford it, fund an HSA to the max, and invest it. Get tax free returns on the gains, get tax free disbursements to pay medical bills, and lower your yearly income tax burden. A triple bonus. \n\nOf course, if you can't afford to fund the HSA, but you can afford the premiums of the LDHP? And you can have some predictable health care spending saved in an FSA? It becomes murkier. \n\nMy employer's plans, annoyingly, break in favor of the LPHD if I spend $2-3k, but break in favor of the HDHP in all other spending scenarios. By a slight advantage, but still.\n\nReally, HDHP/HSAs are great for rich people. Fully fund an HSA, IRA and 401K, pay for medical expenses out of pocket, and use the \"lookback\" rule to pay yourself in retirement from any eligible documented medical expense since the establishment of the HSA. Yes, if in 2050 you need your HSA funds, you can bring up a $1000 hospital bill from 2015 and get $1000 dollars back. Meanwhile that $1000 has been earning returns, and those returns are not taxed. And, that disbursement doesn't count as income, lowering your income taxes in retirement too. \n\nI've got a well controlled medical condition, so I never considered even looking at an HDHP, since I wasn't a perfectly healthy 21 year old. (and frankly, am female, and healthcare used to be much more expensive for women. Thanks Obama!) Likewise, I would have never considered an HDHP being appropriate for a family. But to quote XKCD, math continues to be the way to determine which of two numbers is larger. \n\nObamacare/ACA has made this more reasonable by making all preventative care no-cost to the patient. Your kids can get their yearly check ups and vaccines, you and your SO get your paps/mammograms/colon cancer screenings and cholesterol labs, all at no cost. If you can go a few years, funding $1000 with a $1000 match, and no major medical events, you're pretty well self-insured against anything happening in the future if you've built up your yearly OOPMax in your HSA. \n\nIt really hinges on if you can cover a large deductible tomorrow with out creating financial chaos, or if you can avoid having several years in a row with large medical expenses.

{"body": "&gt;  \"I'm happy to pay $12,000 a year to avoid $6,000 a year in new taxes.\"\n\nThat...actually sums it up quite nicely. Most of the civilized world is partly run this way already, using taxes as a sort of insurance where people with much money pay more and people with little money pay less and everyone gets the help they need when/if they need it. I've always wondered why americans didn't just implement this, then Obama rolled out the new helthcare system and I got answers in droves.\n\n&gt; I already pay insurance for myself, my wife and our twelve children, now I have to pay for a single mom and her brat too? Thanks Obama!\n\nThere's this idea that sharing costs means stealing from people, and a refusal of the idea that it means pooling resources to benefit those who need it, and that might be you. Taxes are the most affordable helth insurance you can have, yet because some unemployed person might get more out of it than they put in, let's scrap the idea altogether, he's not getting MY money.\n\nIf that's how you want your healthcare system to be you should put $1000 into the kitchen cabinet every month, and hope it takes you long enough to need healthcare that you'll have enough to pay for it by then. This is completely viable, you can make a savings account and have monthly withdrawals from your salary account the day after you get paid. It's just really risky, because you could end up needing more money than you had time to save up. That's why insurance is done by many people together to begin with, to make sure the pile of cash is always big enough to cover those who need it when they need it.

{"body": "&gt; If you and I aren't fuckin', I don't see why your costs are things I should be on the hook for.\n\nAh.\n\nThen you should probably not be a citizen of the US - a privilege which you're free to renounce.  Opting out of the social contract is always a valid move.\n\nWhat?  That's absurd?  No.  What you're describing - being on the hook for others' costs - may fall under the field of \"insurance\", but it can also fall under the category of \"taxation\".  If I don't have kids, why am I on the hook for someone else's genital-spawn?  If I don't drive, why should I pay for roads?  If I don't kayak, why should I pay for a portion of some other stupid schmuck's shoulder surgery?  If I don't use the post, why should I pay to keep some glorified mailboy employed?  If I don't read, what's this expensive library here for?\n\nThen there's the religious argument - which doesn't hold up at all.  It's not like Jews or Muslims can get a tax break equivalent to their share of the Farm Bill that goes to subsidies for raising pork.  It's not as if Jehova's Witnesses can get an exemption from their taxes paying for all government funding of research and funding related to blood transfusions.  Why should Catholics get some kind of exemption from paying into a pool that is also used to keep people from getting diseases and unwantedly-pregnant via contraceptive service?\n\nOh, right.  Because the majority of the SCOTUS is Catholic, and somehow can't separate their religious beliefs from their policy decisions in a secular nation despite the Constitutional mandated to do so.\n\nOn the off chance you're a libertarian or anarchist, rather than a run-of-the-mill conservative:  \n\nThe purpose of the social contract is to enable an entity to have the necessary power to enforce contracts between individuals, since the alternative is to have every dishonest dealer engage in an arms race to maintain power.  The interests of this entity are to maintain peaceful operation of the economy it governs, and to encourage economic growth and discourage threats to that growth.  To this end, the deal it strikes with the population is that, in exchange for taxation, the citizenry gets the right to participate in the process of forming policy.  The power this grants the population is massive, but dilute.\n\nThe \"encourage economic growth and discourage threats to that growth\" portion is particularly important, because what it implies is that if a policy is found to be beneficial to the society at large, the entity is essentially mandated to do it if it is within its power.  Only the population's power trumps this responsibility - if the numbers mandate action, but the populous mandates inaction, the populous wins - however, exercise of this power requires focus to be effective.\n\nThe result is that things like roads, public transport, mail, libraries, and now, healthcare, become regulated or socialized when it's clear that the market has failed.  Specifically in healthcare, the evidence of market failure is staggering.  I won't go into it here; that case has been made repeatedly, and was the impetus for the ACA. The fact that we haven't actually socialized it - e.g., single payer - yet shows me that the character of the failure is that those invested in the current healthcare market have been successfully concentrating wealth in excess of their actual contributions to society to such an extent that they can sway political opinions with their pocket change.  In my opinion, the only real mistake in the ACA is that it didn't consolidate healthcare membership for the previously uninsured under the US' umbrella, via medicare.\n\nIncidentally, after consulting with my insurance, I found I was able to put condom purchases on my HSA.  Thanks, Obama.  And as a fellow taxpayer on the hook for my fuckin', thank you too.\n\nAnd for the roads, and mail, and libraries, and police, and firefighters, scientific research, educational benefits, the maintenance of our nations' poor, and everything else.  Seriously.  That 25% of your personal income feels awful nice on my society, just like the 25% of mine does.\n\nOn a further side note, the \"staying out of my family's vaginas\" bit was actually to do with the oft-proposed mandate to have trans-vaginal ultrasounds become a prerequisite for abortions - not contraception via health insurance.  I don't mind having this chat instead, but if you think XVUS should be required to have an abortion, we can talk about that, too.

This guy doesn't think tax payments for birth control or laws requiring insurers to cover birth control have a foundation in actual rights, but are instead politically expedient handouts! *He shouldn't even be a citizen!111\"\n\n\n&gt;What you're describing - being on the hook for others' costs - may fall under the field of \"insurance\"\n\n*No, because that's not what insurance is* - - Insurance is when people of similar risk profiles pool contributions to a fund so that their risk is distributed - - and the more risky someone is, the more they must contribute because of their greater likelihood of drawing from the fund to cover some risked cost.\n\n\n&gt;but it can also fall under the category of \"taxation\".\n\nExcept what government taxes, and what it spends to provide is the *crux of all arguments in a modern democracy*, particularly one with constitutional law.\n\n\n&gt;If I don't have kids, why am I on the hook for someone else's genital-spawn?\n\nYou aren't always - - only when that interacts with what people on your side of the aisle have decided falls under societal contract is anyone.\n\n\n&gt;If I don't drive, why should I pay for roads? \n\nThis is why tolls and vehicular and fuel taxes exist, and are a much more preferable way to fund highways in the opinion of many, many conservatives.\n\n\n&gt;If I don't kayak, why should I pay for a portion of some other stupid schmuck's shoulder surgery?\n\n*Agreed!*\n\nIn fact, these are all things conservatives wonder about, as we attempt to imagine why individual elective consumption or negligence so often has its negative externalities distributed among people who didn't do those things, as it seemingly invites more of the same.\n\n\n&gt;Why should Catholics get some kind of exemption from paying into a pool that is also used to keep people from getting diseases and unwantedly-pregnant via contraceptive service?\n\nI think more than just Catholics should!\n\n\n&gt;Oh, right. Because the majority of the SCOTUS is Catholic, and somehow can't separate their religious beliefs from their policy decisions in a secular nation despite the Constitutional mandated to do so.\n\n*This is the most egregious misreading I've ever seen* - - the First amendment is bifurcated between a prohibition on the government to establish laws which effect religious norms, and a prohibition on government to author laws which restrict the free practice of religion\n\nCatholics don't have to do shit - - *first amendment cases before the SCOTUS have nearly always been held to strict scrutiny*\n\nWhich is to say that government must be advancing a compelling interest, the law must be narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest, and be the least restrictive alternative, when *any* burden is placed on religious free practice, *even* as a matter of general applicability.\n\nThis is known as the Sherbert Test that SCOTUS employs to explicate strict scrutiny of First amendment interacting law, and it was formally authored as a Federal law constraining Congress pre-emptively by something called RFRA - - and thus laws mandating Catholic organizations to be party to unconvincing statutes as exist in the ACA were tossed.\n\n\nThis isn't checkers, kiddo.\n\n&gt;Incidentally, after consulting with my insurance, I found I was able to put condom purchases on my HSA. Thanks, Obama, and as a fellow taxpayer on the hook for my fuckin', thank you too.\n\nThis is literally why the Senate is now majority Republican.\n\n\nSee you in 2016!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415245702", "subreddit": "Pennsylvania", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hello.\n\nMy name is Abigaile.\n\nI just turned 15 2 weeks ago.\n\nI am now an 8-foot tall, 400 pound, sweaty, hairy, slumpish ogre.\n\nAccording to my dad's favorite conspiracy theory website, a previously underground cabal of fate-bending politicos were experimenting with some dark magick.\n\n*Thanks, Obama.*\n\nSo now everybody on Earth looks on the outside what they used to look like on the inside.  Gah!  *No!*  Not like guts and ewy gross stuff, but, I mean, emotions and personality and junk.  My mom always told me that if I kept running my mouth and crying when I didn't get what I wanted, my appearance would manifest itself into the ugly, bullish beast it was.  Wow, mom, *thanks a lot*.  Well, I guess she had a point.  Don't you just hate it when parents are right?\n\nSo I got off to a good start by panicking and destroying most of my room.  I would say that getting through the doorways was the biggest hassle, but it seems my shitty inner form comes with a bit of muscle mass.  I always wanted to work out more, but I kept hearing that girls get bulky real fast and start to look like men, so I was always scared to do more.  As it turns out, being a rippling pile of power has the advantage of being able to Kool-Aid Man through pretty much any obstacle.  I guess I got that going for me, which is nice.\n\nNow I'm walking to class instead of taking the bus or mini-van as originally intended because I can't fit into anything.  That cute guy, Jordan, from 3rd year middle school always complained about being too tall to fit into anything.  He said he was 6'3\" and he always slouched.  I wonder what he looks like now.  I hope he's still cute.\n\nI saw Jenny running down the sidewalk across the street.  Pretty fast for an old lady.  Her older brother's main complaint about her was that she always worried so much about adult problems, even though she won't have to deal with any of that for years.  That makes me think about a month back when she was on the verge of tears about retirement funds and the possibility of not getting married before her looks start to fade.  Bitch seriously needs to eat like a whole cake and calm the fuck down.  GAWD!\n\nAlright, so I can see the school from around the corner.  It is getting weird all up in here, y'all.  I'm seeing what appear to be scales and ooze and hair and...  *fire?*  How does a living thing produce fire continuously like that?  They must be full of farts and got too close to the heater! lol\n\n\"Abi!  Oh my gosh, what's going on!?\" I heard a grunty, panty voice from my shoulder.  I looked to see who I believe to be Sarah, so low to the ground and so curly-tailed.\n\n\"Sarah, is that you!?  Are you...  Are you a pig!?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes!  YES!  It sucks soooooo much!  I just want all this to be over.  What did I do to deserve this???\"\n\n\"Well...\" I contemplated, \"I mean, you *do* always make lewd comments about the boys in gym class.  Actually, you make lewd comments about all the boys, period.  You're pretty much the most perverted person I know for being a timid, masturbation-less virgin.\"\n\n\"NO!  ABI!  HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT!?\" Sarah paused, \"I- I mean... Well... Ok, *maybe* I have... some things on my mind more often than some people, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME A PIG!\"\n\n\"Uh huh, uh huh.  Nice outfit, by the way.\"\n\n\"Yeah, thanks, I did the best I could with what I had.  This is my baby sister's shirt and some old running shorts I found in the back of my dresser.  I'm afraid it's all going to slide off,\" Sarah hooves closer and whispers, \"I don't have any boobs, but I have all these teets and it's super embarrassing.\"\n\nI tried desperately to stifle my laughter, \"That has to feel so weird...\"\n\n\"Are you wearing towels?\" Sarah tilted her pig-head.\n\n\"Thankfully, my mom, being the clever seamstress she is, whipped up this towel-dress.\"\n\n\"Your mom is so amazing!\" Sarah gushed.\n\n\"Yeah, she's a sweety, alright.  Let's head to homeroom.  This sheet says we go to the same one.\"\n\nEverything was overwhelmingly ridiculous, like the world had become a cartoon.  A teacher I recognized looked like a golden golem, probably because she was known for her gold-digging.  It took her a while to move her rigid joints.  One of the popular kids from 4th year was a literal fairy.  A lot of people suspected him to be gay.  Confirmed.  A boy I think was named Lenny had white wings and a glowing ring around his head.

I should bff him sometime.\n\n\"Yo, Abi and Sarah!\" A tortured voice cried out from the crowd ahead.\n\n\"Dale!  You look normal!  Nothing happened to you?\" Sarah inquisitioned.\n\n\"Uh, not quite...\" Dale said as the crowd opened up, revealing MASSIVE TESTES swaying in grocery bags.\n\nSarah and I let out audible gasps.\n\n\"Yeah, you know how I joked about how I was just going to watch porn and masturbate all summer when I was at my Dad's place?  I think I kinda let the joke become too real and now I'm in a lot of discomfort when I think about porn and don't work it out of the system right away,\" Dale visibly winced.\n\n\"That's terrible, Dale!  But wait...  It's like 8:15 in the morning.  Why would this be a problem now?\" I inquired.\n\n\"That's a very good question, Abigaile, and I'm glad you asked.  Not!  But seriously, my lefty hurts way worse than my righty.  Anyway, it's because I'd set the alarm for right after my dad would leave for work.  Then I'd pour some cereal, get his girlfriend's skin moisturizer, and settle in front of the laptop.  I'd pop one out right away, then wait like 20 minutes to recharge, then find some good stuff.  I'd try to see how long I could go each time.  I think my best jack session was like an hour and forty-seven minutes.  So that would usually bring me through around this time.  I'm afraid that if I don't get this worked out soon, they're going to burst!\"\n\nSarah and I desperately tried to stifle our laughter.\n\n\"Oh my gosh, Dale, honey, you *have* to do something.  I don't want to see you go out in this way,\" Sarah said.\n\nDale eye-*balled* her up and down.  *Er*... front to back (?)\n\n\"Heh.  We all know what's on your mind all the time.  Maybe you could help me out,\" Dale winked.\n\n\"EW!  NO!  You're so gross, Dale!  Inappropriate!\" Sarah squealed.\n\n\"Hahaha!  Fine fine, don't worry about it, Miss Priss.  I know how pretend-conservative you try to come off.  But I'll be around if you need me,\" Dale licked his lips seductively, then cringed furiously as ol' lefty acted up.\n\n\"AUGH!\" Sarah scoffed.\n\n\"Actually, I think I saw a senior dripping with what I can only suspect was semen, so I'm gonna try to find her.  A football team of literal apes were awkwardly following her, so I might have to wait in line.  Hope I can make it in time.  Wish me luck!\" Dale waddled off, balls slapping between legs.\n\n\"This place only gets weirder the more we hang around,\" I say.\n\nSuddenly, a voice burst over the intercom, \"ATTENTION, STUDENTS AND STAFF!  ATTENTION, STUDENTS AND STAFF!  There was an announcement over the radio just now from an unnamed, untitled person claiming the phenomenon we are all subject to will be resolved by the day's end.  We have no reason to believe the voice credible, but we're hoping there's some truth to the message.  Please conduct yourselves appropriately and proceed with the TOTALLY NORMAL school day.  Thank you, and good luck.\"\n\n\"Oh, I so hope it's true!\" Sarah mused.\n\n\"Me, too, Miss Piggy.  Come on.  All this excitement is making me dizzy.  I just want to sit down and run out the day.\"\n\nWith that, we made our way to homeroom and awaited all of the unknowns the rest of this disturbed day would bring.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415400130", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Government regulation created a healthcare system that has virtually zero cost transparency. They restricted trade by putting up many artificial barriers.\n\nWhy do you think those laws were put in place?\n\nTell me, please. Why were those laws written and enacted? *Why?*\n\nI'll tell you why. Those laws were put in place for reasons: *because the free market failed at health care delivery and people were getting fucked.*\n\nThe laws were enacted because the free market was failing. It was an attempt to prop up a diseased business mode, where profits soared when health care was denied.\n\nInsurance sucked, and so laws were written to protect the consumers.\n\n&gt;Compare how easy it is to get car insurance vs health insurance. And so, car insurance is relatively competitive between companies (certainly not off by 5x). And if I need to use my car insurance, getting multiple quotes is not only easy - but encouraged by the insurance company. That doesn't happen in health care. \n\nBullshit. Sorry, I can't say that in any nicer way. That's total bull.\n\nI've been buying my own health insurance for 25+ years. Don't tell me what I could or couldn't do, because I know better. I could easily get multiple quotes on esurance.com. I did it every few years. Before that, I used an insurance broker. The same one who got me my life insurance, my house insurance, my car insurance, all that jazz. He would gather quotes and then give me the info, and I could choose.\n\nIt wasn't hard at all. The hard part--the *impossible* part--was find comparable plans. Because the laws were so loose, there was no bottom line on guaranteed benefits. I couldn't compare apples to apples, I was stuck comparing apples to bricks. There were a shitload of total crap policies out there were happy to take people's money but wouldn't pay much more than pennies when claims were made. They're gone (thanks, Obama).\n\n&gt; If health care was a free market (it isn't) the government wouldn't have to do anything since it would fix itself.\n\nHealth care was a free market in 1800s. Government stepped in with laws because people were getting screwed.\n\nYour free market fucking *killed* people. Jesus Christ. Do you really want to go back to the days of snake-oil sales? No. Fucking. Thank. You. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415406773", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I was told it was nigh impossible for it to be canceled as it would have had to be canceled for the entire group all across the nation. It was great until I got to 0 deductible and then, SURPRISE, it was canceled. The company started with this plan (I think) with the goal of going out of business once they made money for the principles and then changing once they would have faced real costs. They took my money for years and the one time I used it for something minor I had to argue with them for a year to get them to pay the hospital. This was all before the ACA.

{"body": "R1:\n\nThe popular unemployment number is the U-3 rate which only counts people who are employed (FT or PT) or are unemployed but have been looking for work in the past 4 weeks. The U-6 rate counts discouraged workers (those who are not actively looking for work but would want to work) and those working part time for economic reasons (ie who would rather have full time work) in with the U-3 unemployed. The BLS does not try to hide this data, it's just that it's not the one that newspapers write about. You can see a graph here: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/U6RATE\n\nAs you can see, while it is at 11.5% and that is not itself necessarily good, it has come down from a high of 17% just as the U-3 rate has dropped by a similar magnitude. This does not mean that we have fully recovered from the recession, but this along with GDP growth indicates that we are in the process of recovery. \n\nAlso this:\n\n&gt;Unemployment rate dropped to 5.8% for the month of October 2014. Recovery is here, thanks Obama! Except it’s not.

Unfortunately U-6 data only go back to 1994, so we can't compare it with U-3 during particularly bad recessions like the early 80s. While the gap between the two rates is historically high, the ratio between the two is not abnormally large.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/ZtJJJrM", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415651221", "subreddit": "badeconomics", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Thankfully I still have healthcare available to me that isn't nearly this bad.  I am a hug proponent of health insurance, as my son is a high needs kid and has spent an inordinate amount of time at the hospital.  \n\nHe has eosinophilic esophagitis, fructose malabsorption disorder, underdeveloped lungs, and severe allergies including anaphylactic reactions to rare things like milk, meat, and nuts.  He has a g-tube, was diagnosed with failure to thrive and microcephaly when he was an infant.  He wears out very easily and regularly has breathing and lung problems, he has a nebulizer and inhaler, super fun for a child to need to deal with.  We take an epi pen literally everywhere as milk can kill him.  School has been an extreme difficulty, he is in preppy-K, thankfully the school district has done backflips to accommodate us.  We have to test foods individually to insure they are safe, we have never gotten to 20 before needing to pull all food to reset his system.  He is currently off all food.\n\nWe are regulars at the local ER, which is thankfully close.  The local children's hospital is excellent, and so I consider us very lucky.  My son is up to 19 individual stays in this hospital that were at least overnight, stays lasting over a week are common, this number does not include hospital visits where we did not stay overnight.  Had we not been insured through tricare, his first overnight stay would have cost us more than $60,000.  Others would have cost similar, that is not including ER trips, doctors appointments (we have a lot of these), massive amounts of prescriptions and medications. My son is a medical anomaly and most doctors won't touch him, the few that do are completely out of their depth, his health problems are new and rare.\n\nWith the healthcare we had, we were ok.  Again, I am strongly for health insurance.  Then the government decided to get involved.  I don't know when it's going to catch up with my son, but the new mandate has cut my hours from 40+ a week to between 8 and 16.  See, I work in the medical field and with the new mandate my job is no longer covered by insurance cost.  Me doing my part comes directly out of doctor profit.  If the new mandate catches up with my son, I am going to be flat broke in no time.  Without sarcasm I say thanks Obama.  The policies you pushed for since you campaigned for president have hurt me directly and are likely to catch up with my high needs son.  \n\nSide note: every time I try to talk about this subject I seem to attract some hate mail.  Reddit can be a pretty cruel place full of some pretty big assholes.  My son is highly functional, very bright, likes Star Wars, batman, Legos, sword fighting, and playing baseball.  He, like his sister, is the light of my life and I would give my life for him.  Inb4 maybe the universe is telling you your son shouldn't live.  Inb4 maybe you should just let your son die.  I guess telling someone their son should have been aborted is ok if it doesn't fit the narrative.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416419154", "subreddit": "Conservative", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

The whole problem is that false dichotomy in which you think someone asking that women be better represented or minorities asking to be represented fairly, and their tastes occasionally be catered too is equivalent to DRM schemes or pre-orders or whatever (none of which you're actually forced to deal with, as no one is forcing you to purchase the games you mentioned and misspelled). The logic of your comment, such that it is, rests on the idea that one can't ask for those things or critique the medium, and also play video games. \n\n&gt;&gt; But for all their privilege in the sense of not having to queue for foodstamps they have absolutely no social power.

So catering, very not buttfuck.\n\nDude or dudette, I've explained here a view on privilege that you probably have not heard in your Women's Studies lessons, that it's possible to have a \"well-fed-pig privilege\" while not having any \"social influence\" privilege. Gamers have **zero** social influence, besides being pigs to be sold shit to. Think about it.\n\n&gt; The whole problem is that false dichotomy in which you think someone asking that women be better represented or minorities asking to be represented fairly, and their tastes occasionally be catered too is equivalent to DRM schemes or pre-orders or whatever\n\nI've tried to explain how the attempt to push for the better representation of women is __perceived__ as any old attempt to fuck the gamer in the ass.\n\nBecause you have to be careful about it. Now look, I'm not trying to make an equivalence here (and if you accuse me of making an equivalence here I'll just tell you to fuck off), but do you understand why black people are wary of any government health programs after that one where they were infected with syphilis? Well, gamers are wary of anyone saying anything about gaming after being shafted through and through for the last two decades. When someone suddenly gets in and goes full Kanye, \"I'm sorry but your games are misogynist and that's a problem\", they react as expected. That's another shafting from an unexpected direction, is all. With an expected reaction.\n\nIf you want to tell people that maybe women should be better represented, you don't do it like that, you don't break in with what looks like a spiked dildo telling everybody to get down and remove their pants or else.

{"body": "Yeah that's nice. If only the democrats had a supermajority during Obama's first two years as president, and control of both house and senate. The republicans couldn't do anything to stop the democrats if that was true... Oh wait.\n\nBlame the GOP all you want, at least they are more organized than the democrats.\n\nObamacare hasn't been repealed, how many times the republicans have voted to repeal it is irrelevant. They weren't the ones pushing back dates and deadlines. They weren't the ones that told bold faced lies about people being able to keep their policies. The law has been implemented, and it's pretty awful so far.\n\nConsidering this site's demographics redditors should hate the fuck out of obamacare. It basically puts the job of paying for everyone else's healthcare off on the demographic that uses healthcare the least, young males.\n\nIt's not meaningful insurance reform. It completely ignores the actual reasons prices in the US are so crazy.\n\n\"But but... It's the GOPs fault\" is just an excuse you people like to pull out so you can justify supporting something that fucks you coming and going.\n\nThe democrats had their chance. They had years where the republicans couldn't even filibuster to stop them. Look how that turned out?\n\nIf the bill was still bouncing around congress, that'd be one thing, but you can't blame the republicans for a democratic bill that was passed and is already being implemented for the bill itself being broken, just because they never wanted the bill in the first place and wanted to repeal it.\n\nObama has lost more seats in congress than any president since Eisenhower.\n\n\"Thanks Obama\"- the GOP\n\n Eventually you're going to have to admit that he's pretty shit as president. The democrats had their chance. They had control. They had a super majority.

{"body": "The mask was surprisingly easy to come by. I figured I'd have to order the thing off Amazon and have to postpone the robbery for a few days while I waited for the thing to come in. Instead I found it, along with my buddy's, at the comic book store. Cheap too.\n\n\"You ready?\" David asks. His hands tighten on the steering wheel, anxious. His mask is on, and his voice comes out muffled by the cheap rubber.\n\n\"Yeah, J.B., you?\" I ask back. Dave nods. Show time.\n\nWith my empty briefcase in one hand, I open the door of the van and step onto the sidewalk. Immediately I get a few stares from people passing by, but the mask is common enough that they shake their heads in dismay. They're probably assuming I'm just some sort of hooligan. Oh no, I think, I'm far more than that.\n\nI enter through the two sets of front doors, my leather shoes clicking softly against the marble floor. To my right is the receptionist for appointments, and to my left is the line of tellers, hidden behind a tall wall of glass with speaker holes. You can see the old-style vault a few meters behind, opened just enough for customers to see the piles of cash that they show off.\n\nIt's worth noting that if the bank receptionist had any clue, she would have called for security the moment a masked man walked into the bank. But, like I'd hoped, the mask probably made her hesitate.\n\nIs he for real? She was probably thinking.\n\nThere are four other customers in the bank. One receptionist. Four tellers. There are probably other personnel around the corner, where the receptionist is, but I don't count them. They won't get in the way anyway. \n\nI don't stop, walking right to the first teller in the line. She is busy counting money, her eyes diverted from the face of her customer.\n\n\"Hi welcome to Bank of America, how can--\" she looks up into the barrel of a gun.\n\nI pull the trigger and thunder echoes throughout the bank. The teller is thrown back in her chair, the sudden weight tipping it over. For a split-second there is only stunned silence, then screaming.\n\nThe other tellers dive under their desks, and the customers head for the door. I grab a chair from the waiting area, shooting the glass a few more times before throwing it through. The glass rains down around the tellers and me, littering the floor with little knives.\n\nI jump over the counter and slip behind the vault door. Popping my suitcase open, I fill it with as much cash as will fit. Stuffing my pockets as well, I exit the vault and leap back over the counter.\n\nBooking it through the glass doors to the sidewalk, I notice some teenager with his phone out. He's probably recorded the whole thing. \n\nOh man, the mask will made this shit famous, I think.\n\n\"Stay in school, don't do drugs!\" I yell, just as Dave pulls up beside me in the van. I jump in the passenger seat. But before I can slam my door I hear that snarky teenager yell at me: \"Thanks Obama!\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're welcome.\" I retort. Then Dave hits the gas and we speed off.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416592620", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No they're also getting really shitty food. \nDominos employee here. We do school lunches Monday-Thursday. It's a huge contract for any area that gets to do it but this is the first year where we have the new school lunches. We have to order in whole grain, low sodium dough, low fat cheese, low sodium premixed sauce, and low calorie, low sodium pepperoni. The entire process is insanely specific, down to cutting the pizzas perfectly. Each pepperoni pizza slice must contain exactly four pieces of pepperoni arranged in, well, the shape of a dick. Haha. The first two weeks I couldn't stop laughing about it- we're serving dicks to kids! \n\nAhem, anyways. Each pizza must have exactly one pound of cheese. When we bring them to the school, the staff has to weigh the pizza and take its temperature, like a newborn baby. \n\nFor us, it's not a huge deal. We've got the super specific process down by now and just making sure the shit gets out the door and to the school on time is the big part for both us and the school because the pizza is completely unfuckingedible after an hour. \n\nThe complaints we've gotten are glorious. The main complaint is it tastes like nothing/cardboard and the cheese \"fuses\" back together, making it hard to recut. I've eaten it fresh and had to put real cheese on it and slide it back through the oven for the thing to taste even slightly like pizza. Even then, I'll maybe take a bite or two because it's super early and I haven't had any food yet that day and toss the rest. It doesn't stay good the second it starts getting cold.\n\nThe other complaint we get the most is overstock. This is a huge problem. It's basically food waste in mass quantities. Kids don't like the pizza so they get something else or bring their own lunch. The staff has a ton of leftover pizzas that they can't get rid of or give away (because nobody wants them). So they toss an average of 12 pizzas PER DAY. Considering this is the average, four days a week, each school per district on contract, then you have hundreds of thousands per week per state. All because it tastes like shit. \n\nNormally, I'd never give a fuck but pizza was a staple food for any kid growing up in the 80's/90's, myself included. I remember kids going apeshit for pizza day and sometimes the school would run out and you'd barter with kids in the lunchroom who got the last slices. I don't want to live in a world where the pizza tastes so bad that kids grow up thinking that's the way it is and don't give it much of a second thought. \n\nI mean, I guess that's the plan, right? Make it shitty, early. Get the taste for it out at a young age so they'll grow up thinking that's how it is. They get offered pizza at a birthday party and they're like, yuck, no thanks, I'll eat some mini sliders instead or whatever the fuck else you feed kids at those things. They grow up eating cabbage or something. Or maybe they get all rebellious and only eat garbage. I dunno anymore, I'm babbling by this point. The food waste thing bothers me more than people's shitty kids eating shitty food but food waste is so unfortunately common and expected in this ass-backwards, bizarro world.\n\nTLDR: pizza sucks now, your kids are eating cardboard dick pizzas, right in the mouth.

Hold out for a number that is worth your while.\n\n5.

{"body": "This was very informative.  I would like to add a few tips that I have learned in the 41 days that I've had my ostomy (only 4 more months or so before I get my take-down).\n\nHeat is your friend.  \n\nWhen you apply your wafer (I like to call them base plates because it sounds cooler) you should heat a wet/damp washcloth in your microwave for 25-30 seconds and then hold it in place directly over your wafer.  \n\nYou should use a small washcloth both between the heated ziplock and your wafer and the ziplock and your hand.\n\nApply a light but firm pressure (don't push hard, but yet don't just lay your hand on your stomach) and hold it in place for 10 minutes.  This will help activate the adhesive of the wafer and help it to adhere to your skin.  This is best done laying down.  \n\n*Note: chances are that your ostomy will output during the procedure – unless it is painful or suddenly extremely messy keep the hot bag in place until the 10 minutes are up, because if you remove it all the built up heat will escape and your wafer won't adhere as well.*\n\nAfter the 10 minutes if you feel the need you can wipe a Skin Prep cloth around the edge of your wafer and your skin for a little added adhesion help.\n\nOn to your bag.  I only have the bags where you can empty them via the clip on the bottom.  \n\nFirst I would advise you to double wrap the end of the pouch around the clip.  You will trade a small amount of space in the pouch for a large amount of added security against leakage.\n\nNext, inside your bag before you put it on for the first time I would recommend you pour some (the amount you use will have to be up to you based off of trial and error) olive oil into the pouch [if you have the official lubricant stuff go a head and use that instead - since my insurance wont cover it (Thanks, Obamacare) I use olive oil.\n\nAs for cleaning of bags for reuse (which is completely acceptable unless you feel otherwise) just use hot water running from your tap down through the ring and out the bottom.  Just pinch and roll the bag to get the inner surface clean.  When done, don’t forget to thoroughly clean ANY surfaces which your bag or the water that may have splashed has touched.  (I use Comet for this purpose).\n\nThen for drying, and this step is a MUST to ensure that you can reuse the bag (if you don't do this step the insides of the bags seem to “fuse” together (probably something to do with the heat of the water and the remaining fats left from the poop.), set aside some small washcloths (was these seperate and with bleach – so they should be white ones) and place one washcloth down the ring opening and pull it out just slightly of the end opening at the bottom.  Place between two paper towels on the bottom and two on top and allow to dry over night, or until needed.\n\nThese are the major tips I have been taught or have discovered for myself.  If there are any questions I will be more than happy to answer them and provide tips if I have any.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416943360", "subreddit": "ostomy", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "More often than not, Nationalism and racism are but branches and roots of the same name. They feed and profit off each other like a bad marriage. An over-used example would be how Nazi Germany (some cynics might say) picked the Jews as the scrape-goat to build up post-WWI Germany. There Nationalism espoused at the party state level of Aryan racial superiority, soon grew to anti-Semite racism (and of the other 'mongrel races' as well) at ground level. Another more modern day example is America's war against terrorism/independence-seekers (Nationalism at government level) fuels racist at ground level towards Middle-Eastern and darker Eastern Asian people. Controversially one can also say that Western racism was necessary for terrorist nations (or freedom fighting folks) so that at a higher level, their movement would have more impetus and support to fight against a Western backed (mostly American these days) opponent that was militarily stronger. The crusaders in the middle ages also used similar tactics, rallying behind the slogan \"*Deus vult!*\" or \"*God Wills It!*\" to ironically prevent wars from breaking out in European and to enrich their own coffers.\n\nThat said, most countries today definitely do not condone racism to be part of any Nationalistic movement (but of course it still exists). However the points made is that at ground levels, there are plenty of reasons why the local populous would develop or habour anti-western sentiments. \n\nLastly, it is important to note that the places you've visited in Asia are along the infamous drug routes of the 'Golden Triangle' and 'Golden Crescent'. How that is relevant is that a significant amount of raw drugs originate from African and the sub-Sahara region (and now the [middle-east](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-spoils-of-war-afghanistan-s-multibillion-dollar-heroin-trade/91), thanks Obama! s/). That means amidst a meandering sea of oriental features, the negroid drug cartels and their goons stand out quite more so. Therefore it translates into the locals associating African features with crime and violence. (Of course we can't discount plain ignorance and prejudice, but that's true wherever one goes.)  \n\nRacism **is** sometimes founded upon stupidity but it would also be foolish to ignore the context of where said racism is birthed. While it would be easier to attribute human flaws to some fundamental mis-wiring in the psyche, more often than not it's one problem begetting the next.

THANKS OBAMA! place the camp in a spot where you will take care of those needs later. when it expires, just build a clinic, market, and restaurant or whatever in the empty space, and it'll be a smooth transition, people will go to the same part of town, for the same thing, its just an ugly camp at first, and a nice part of town later. \n\nthe important thing is that is saves you money early. you dont need your people literally eating all your profits. doctors are expensive. it may seem like a dick move to let some people be hungry and sick to qualify....but its ok. just use the saved money wisely. invest at first (remember, cash crops, gold mines, that kind of thing) so you get more money coming in, and when it does, start addressing their needs. you can be a benevolent dictator, and your people will love you and appreciate your wisdom. you have to make money to spend money. if you just spend money on things that cost money to make people happy...you will be broke and NO ONE will be happy. Tropico is about balancing and prioritizing those needs and happiness. think *long term*, and dont try to fix everything at once. listen to your people and care for them, but tackle the issues one at a time, as you can...but keep the money coming, so you can keep it up. there is *always* going to be unhappy, complaining people. when you address the basic needs...they start complaining about politics and sheesh. its like they dont appreciate *anything*. \n\nlastly, i recommend making a strong commitment to education fairly on, like the beginning of \"mid game\" i guess. that means building an elementary school and high school (elementary first). kids who go to school learn faster and become better workers, they skill up faster. if you let them grow up and build a school later, its too late...you already have a generation of shitty workers looking for jobs. same for high school. get those young people educated! all the industry stuff and factories that make REAL big money require high school graduates. school will also help with unemployment, because people can be \"Students\" as their occupation, and when they graduate, they can get better jobs.

Not like there are any pro-Western or at least neutral channels to show the other opinion there anyway. \n\nNow there is Internet and there are more anti-government sources in there, and, importantly - there are Ukrainian Russian anti-Putin sources, and there are some Israeli anti-Putin sources, etc etc. I think this maybe the main reason for the rise of different phobias inside Russian society. It was working pretty much fine when Russian government was mocking the USA - the rest of Europe does it, after all. But it gets really weird when Russian sources start (not official sources maybe, but still) mocking Jews, mocking gay, and what is most important - mocking western Christianity. Oh well, my father has recently stated that the Western World is controlled by the Catholics who in turn are controlled by Muslims who want to destroy the only true Christianity branch - Orthodox. Which is represented by former USSR countries of course. And that's why all these pro-Western protests were sponsored by the West, according to him.\n\nThanks, Obama.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417360368", "subreddit": "europe", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}
