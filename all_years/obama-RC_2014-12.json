{"body": "Buying insurance is like buying an extended warranty: it's -EV, which means you should expect to pay more for the insurance than you will ever get back in return from it. But this is OK, because in the cases where the insurance pays out, it will save you from bankruptcy and ruin. If you get into a car wreck and somebody dies (auto insurance), or if you suddenly get sick (health insurance) or if you die and can't support your dependents (term life insurance), a potential financial catastrophe instead becomes a manageable situation.\n\nThe best insurance products to buy (a) pay out large benefits when they do pay out, (b) cover a wide variety of scenarios, and (c) have relatively low premiums. Take term life insurance, for instance. For (a), you can get maybe a million dollars of term life insurance very cheaply. For (b), term life insurance pays out if you die, but it doesn't really matter how you die (unless it's suicide or you're murdered by your beneficiary, generally). It could be cancer, or getting hit by a bus, or even being legally ruled dead when something horrific happens and they can't find your body. It doesn't matter. For (c), there's no way that saving up that money instead will get you any closer to supporting your survivors.\n\nLikewise, ordinary health insurance, even though insurance companies are sometimes crooked, is generally OK. Since Obamacare in the US, health insurance (a) doesn't have lifetime limits--after your deductible, and especially after your out-of-pocket limit, they'll pay virtually unlimited amounts of money, (b) will pay *regardless of what medical condition you end up being treated for*, even if it's pre-existing (thanks Obama), and so forth, and (c) ok, it is expensive but less expensive than paying for all that chemotherapy yourself.\n\nLet's apply this test to supplemental cancer insurance.\n\n(a) How much does it pay out? It's \"supplementary\" insurance, which means they're expecting your normal health insurance to pay what it normally pays. So what does the supplementary insurance pay out? Enough to cover your deductible? Enough to cover your deductible plus the 20% coinsurance you pay up to your out-of-pocket limit? You should save that money in an HSA anyway, and I'd bet you can do that easier if you're not shelling out money for cancer insurance.\n\n(b) This is the real kicker. If you get cancer, they pay out. What if you get diabetes, heart disease, or run over by a truck and your legs crushed? You get nothing! Whereas if you save the money in an HSA or have an ordinary disability policy, it *will* cover this stuff. Sure, cancer is common, but you can get disability policies that cover for missing work regardless of what specific disease, condition, or injury caused you to miss work.\n\n(c) Given the limited scope and payout of this kind of insurance, I don't think the premiums are low enough to matter. You could save that money (maybe in an HSA, maybe not) and be able to spend it on anything at all, or you could pay it to this insurance company. Oh, you get the premiums back after 20 years? This sounds a lot more like they're not in the insurance business, but rather in the business of you giving them an interest-free loan for 20 years and, in the slim chance you get cancer within the next 20 years they pay you back early and maybe give you a little extra.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417621730", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Figure out average payouts, mark up the costs 5% or something in that ballpark, break them into monthly premiums, cover people.  People accept the idea of insurance.\n\n2) Talk to hospitals.  Get hospital businesses to raise their stated prices $X amount.  Say you'll pay them $X/2.  Raise insurance prices to reflect new, higher prices.  Pie inflates artificially, the 5% now represents more money.\n\n3) People now cannot afford the same procedures they could 40 years ago because the prices were raised in collusion.  We are forced to buy insurance in order to prevent total life blowout in the event of a hospital visit.  We're buying health insurance _in fear of healthcare costs_.  The premiums are, to someone just scratching their head in frustration, cheaper than the hospital costs - but are still markedly more expensive than they would have been had insurance _literally never been a part of the equation_.\n\nThere you go.  That's what happened.  Now we have a gigantic industry running off of inflated prices that's too big to fail.  Unless the government shrinks healthcare (which it won't, it just put its finger into that pie and government in the US has never taken its fingers out of a single pie it's stuck them in) or locks prices (which it won't because of lobbyists whispering misinformation and whining in lawmakers' ears), we are doomed to the yoke of 12+% of the average person's income dedicated to healthcare for the duration of our lives.

{"body": "Thank you for posting this. \n\nI'm sick and tired of hearing how Obama's shit doesn't stink by liberals and how his insides are filled with awesomesauce. Fuck him and his 'reform'. Where was he three years ago? He still had to put in his 'border security' bullshit, and if you heard his speech, he talked about how 80% of the people that he deported were criminals and gang members. It's horseshit, but unfortunately you won't find many sources disproving that except for [FactCheck](http://www.factcheck.org/2014/11/behind-the-rising-deportations-of-criminals/), thankfully. But how do I know? \n\nThe protection people within the SRE (Mexican State Department) in the various consulates know the stats because they're the ones who have to process these people and very often get them out of jail when they've been apprehended. They will tell you that the majority are just people who were stopped on a random search and asked for ID, or stopped for jaywalking or any other insignificant crap.\n\n&gt;... independent analysis of deportation data found the increase is driven largely by the removal of individuals “whose most serious conviction was an immigration or traffic violation.”\n\nAny kind of excuse necessary to see if they have information. They're not 'criminals', but thanks Obama for painting my people as violent gang bangers. You uncle tom asshole cabrón.\n\nEdit: My friend /u/Capn_Blackbeard gave me [this article](http://www.thenation.com/article/179099/why-has-president-obama-deported-more-immigrants-any-president-us-history) that gives you further numbers on why Obama has been deporting more people and it supports my assertions.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417757910", "subreddit": "socialism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

My SO kind of hates occasions with \"forced\" giftgiving which I can understand completely. I enjoy giving gifts, but only to a few specific people. My parents are VERY VERY into giftgiving traditions. They give gifts freely and generously but are sticklers for birthdays, Xmas, and anniversaries. They place a lot of stock in giftgiving as a show of love. It's a little icky to be honest and I hate that I've subscribed to that idea for so long.

We're using batteries that aren't even supposed to be used in the manner that we are, we're inhaling a purified concentrated nicotine substance that can be absorbed through the skin (ever see someone die from a sheet of acid and a lil bit of water on the skin? same idea), we're ordering just about every single part imaginable from China and I don't need to talk about how shady that is to begin with, and to be honest I notice the \"kids\" that woman was talking about; not the 5 year olds that touch everything you tell them not to but the 18 year olds who think they know something about anything and being the douchebag they're supposed to be. Sorry but people of my demographic (30 and up) are not really loudly represented (probably by choice). \n\nYou have to understand that our habit, no matter how \"amazing\" it is, has to be regulated just like liquor, just like fast cars, just like safe sex, just like video games, just like the tv programs we watch, just like the books/magazines we read, or the junk food we stuff our faces with. Without some kind of moderation somewhere in the production pipeline you're seriously asking for bad shit to go down. It's just like this diacetyl and the internet vapers going apeshit about it.

{"body": "Yes, that was a joke. \"Thanks Obama\" usually is. Sorry that wasn't clear.\n\nYou're right: it's an excuse. They did eliminate school lunch, however. The school doesn't have a cafeteria or a kitchen. The students eat at their desks. They used to cater boxed lunches, but the price was absurdly high, so only the free lunch kids generally got it. They ended that this year. It's possible there is some requirement for a hot lunch that they just couldn't meet, but I don't know for sure why they canceled school lunch. There is now no food available if you don't pack it.\n\nThey get away with a lot of this because they're a charter school. Technically it's still a public school, but it is in its own district, whose boundaries coincide with the school property. No students are entitled to attend in the same way they are at a \"neighborhood\" school, and if you don't like it, you can leave. The school administrators are also the school board. Because the population of the district is literally zero, there is no way to have an election. The principal and the superintendent are the same person.\n\nThat means no busses, no walking to school (it's in an industrial area, adjacent to the sewage treatment plant, so nobody lives close enough, and there are no sidewalks anyway), no school lunch, no before/after care, and almost no special ed. Because free lunch numbers are often used as a proxy for class, they don't show up on the reports either.\n\nIt also means only 24 students per homeroom class, two teachers per class (technically one is an \"instructor\" not a teacher, so they dodge the reports again) and breakout groups of 6-12 students for math and reading, resulting in a student to teaching-adult ratio of about 10. They have art, music, and technology classes, all well-funded, which is otherwise unheard of in elementary schools in this area.  Parents are required to \"volunteer\" 40 hours per year or, if they cannot, to \"buy-out\" (totally not tuition, right?).\n\nThe result is what you might expect. Poor families can't afford the hours spent volunteering, the transportation, or the time waiting in the 45-minute pickup/dropoff line. It is almost impossible to attend if a student doesn't have a non-working parent available during the day.\n\nMy neighborhood school is majority-minority, but at this school's Christmas concert this year (yes, that means songs about Santa and Jesus) I saw two Black and maybe a dozen Latino students out of at least 350.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418661799", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Listen, I love Colbert as much as the rest of you, but the truth is, that I just couldn't vote for him without knowing more.  Although, like many of you, I would love to do so just to send the message that our system of partisan politics is well...broken.  It needs to change.  But where do we start?\n\nHow do we work against overwhelming odds to vote with enough clout to enact the change we so desperately seek?  I'm seriously asking. I've been watching a lot of West Wing lately, and I woke up to this question after having a dream that I started a political revolution in the United States and wound up in political office.\n\nI'll return to that, but I want to address Colbert, and politicians in general.  \n\nI think there are two primary reasons why younger voters feel so disenfranchised.  The biggest reason is the perception that their vote doesn't matter.  This is derived from the fact that, in today's society, we expect instant gratification.  In no way, shape, or form, does our system of checks and balances allow for that.  Each administrative process derived from our political system is fought over before, during, and afterwards.  The only process that Congress seems to be able to expedite are those in which they chide other organizations for their mistakes.  And even when decisions are finally made, we're so splintered as a nation, that one side rarely gets the chance to celebrate a victory. That is, if either one does at all.  For instance, and I'm just using this as an example, for every person that celebrated that passage of the Affordable Care Act because they felt that it provided reasonably priced health care to those that were unable to have it before, there are ten people screaming in their ear about how it raised their health care prices, or cost them their job, or the such.  Therefore, nobody gets to enjoy it.  Even where there is change (Thanks, Obama.) there's no gratification that comes along with it.  \n\nAlright, now that I'm about two thousand words into a rant about politics, I'm going to address the second reason why I think that young voters are so disenfranchised, and this one actually relates to the question.\n\nI don't know about you, but I feel that I was always taught that politicians are supposed to be something bigger than you or I. Now, I know this is contradictory with the notion that anyone can get elected to politics, but I think that the two notions exist simultaneously in the United States.\n\nRemember honest Abe Lincoln?  Or how George Washington couldn't lie about chopping down the cherry tree (Yes, I know its not necessarily true). Or how about FDR, whose actions in office stood up against much adversity, all while the man himself was permanently seated because of polio?\n\nFrom a young age, we are introduced to these caricatures of past politicians, portraying them to be something more than the men they actually are. For the record, I'm not saying that these weren't great presidents, or even men, for that matter.  But we're really only taught one side of the story; the good side, in fact.  It's like the concept of political spin never ends.  \n\nNo, its more like its  a propaganda system designed to instill all Americans with the notion that their politicians are special men and women elected into office, and solely given the power to enact change.\n\nAnd then we grow up, and we're introduced to our politicians and politics in general.  We're introduced to the Anthony Wieners, Eliot Spitzers,  Ron Calderons, and Ray Nagins of the world. Or how about Bill Clinton?  We see our politicians,  people that we've always been taught are towering pillars of democracy, brought down by seemingly human mistakes. These are not the politicians we were raised to believe in.  They are no longer the best of us; they are simply one of us. We were taught wrong the whole time.\n\nAnd then politics. \n\nI recently moved from Detroit-ish to New Orleans-ish. As a result, I had the pleasure of watching the recent Senate race between Mary Landrieu and Bill Cassidy as it unfolded in its own state.  \nI still can't tell you what either candidate stands for. All the ads ever told me was what the other one didn't do.  Wait, that's not true.  Landreiu does only what Obama does.  I was so disgusted by the mud slinging that I couldn't imagine voting for either candidate.\n\nI would venture a guess that more time and money is spent telling voters about the negative aspects of candidates, than about the positive. \n\nSo, we're educated to only see the positive side of politicians, but we grow up in a system that emphatically focuses on the negative.  And we want to enact change from which we will derive instant gratification in a system that's designed to do anything but.   No wonder we're disenfranchised.\n\nIt all needs to change, but how?\n\nAs for Colbert...right now, he's that caricature of a man that we Americans have been raised to idolize.  Introduce him to real politics and he'll quickly come crashing to Earth.  Then we'll know whether or not to vote for him.\n\nOh, time for a brief return.  Who wants to start a political revolution?!?\n\n\nTL;DR:  Change is not instantaneous no matter how bad we want it. Politicians are no longer the best of us; now they are simply one of us. Stephen Colbert chopped down his father's cherry tree.  Now, lets all go out and start a political revolution.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418748894", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sorry for the long text wall.  \n\nI was going home to California to visit my family during the holidays as I would always do.  My flight was boarded Friday morning in Connecticut and was scheduled to arrive that evening with a brief layover in Texas.\n\nNow I’m a frequent flier and know full well that I tend to get motion sickness so I prepared myself by taking Dramamine, packed ginger chews, and a bottle of water.  Assuming normal flight patterns, I would have been fine.  Upon boarding the plane I asked for a blanket since this was winter after all. And settled in playing my DS.\n\nAs we approached the layover destination, the plane started to go through some rough turbulence.  “OK, I can handle this, it will be over soon” I thought.  Nope. It got worse.  Then the announcement came on that there was a blizzard passing over Houston and the plane would have to circle around a bit before we could safely land.  \n\nBy this point I was feeling a bit woozy so I tried to force myself into a nap, which usually helps.  Now remember that the storm is making the flight feel like a kiddy roller coaster.  Nothing short of chloroform was going to make me pass out.  \n\nAn hour later came another announcement.  The blizzard was not moving so we were going to head for Austin instead.  Sweat was poring from my forehead and my breathing was ragged as I was barely holding on to my lunch through shear will power.  Additional Dramamine had done nothing to relieve my stomach.  \n\nUpon reaching Austin we once again had to circle the airport because there was another plane that had to leave the runway before we could land.  But this was no ordinary plane as it was carrying the president and we had to wait yet another 45 minutes (thanks Obama)  During this time I could feel the stomach churning, it was inevitable.  I reached for one of the puke bags in the seat pouch…. Where is it?  Nooooo.  Wait I’ll just call one of the attendants to bring….BLARRRRGHHH.   Good thing those plane blankets are free because they would not want that back.  Shakily I lifted my weak arm to push the attendant button and got the help I needed to take the puke pile away from me and bring me an actual bag, which I proceeded to spew my innards into as we finally descended, several hours after we were supposed to originally land.  \n\nIt was now past midnight.  Everyone got handed new boarding tickets for the next day.  I was tired and weak so the staff was nice enough to put me in a wheel chair and gave me a voucher for a night at a hotel and a taxi.  There was another lady who also got this since she had just had surgery and could not walk very well.  We both get wheeled over to where the taxi pickup is to wait for a ride.  And then left there.  In the cold.  While it was snowing.  And there we spent for the next hour waiting for the right taxi to come because apparently only one of the many companies will take the vouchers that we were given.  \nIts around 2 in the morning when we’re finally picked up and the lady tells him where to go, and we finally get to the hotel…but it’s the wrong one! And back onto the road we go.  The place we’re looking for is on the other end of town.  On the highway I feel my stomach rage again and I’m too tired to fight anymore. So I weakly ask for a bag and barf again.  As I’m heaving out every last bit of my intestines I notice that my pants feel a bit wet.  I lift the bag.  Lo and behold: theres a hole.  So now both me and the seat are covered in my own gut juices.  Great.  \n\nFinally we arrived at the right hotel around 3 am.  I’m sick, miserable, and tired beyond belief while barely walking in puke pants.  But my night is not over yet.  I have no change of clothes and do not want to have to wear my outfit of putrid shame the next day.  Luckily there is a washer and drier across the hall from my room.  Armed only with a towel and an handful of change I ninja my way across the hall and quickly start my load.  I shower and wait until my clothes are done before I finally can fall asleep.  \n\nThe next day starts at 8 as the first flight to home was at 9:30 so, still feeling exhausted but no longer sick, I call the taxi and make my way back to the airport only to discover that I misread the boarding pass time and missed the first flight out.  FUUUCK.  Again more waiting.  Thankfully the second flight much less eventful than the first and I finally arrived home that afternoon, more than 24 hours after I was originally supposed to.\n\nTL;DR overly delayed flight + blizzard + motion sickness = miserable me.  thanks, obama\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418759953", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I left early to go to an AA meeting.  I'm new to the group and I had spoken with the leader of the group last week and had made a promise to her that I would attend and meet her in person tonight.  I spent over an hour at work trying to figure out the bus schedule to get there because I'm not allowed to drive.  I spent nearly 3 hours on the bus and didn't end up where I needed to be.  Everything I had looked up said I would get where I needed to go, but I guess I read it wrong?  \n\nWhen I finally got home I had a letter from my attorney (pending DUI case) with some recommendations for what I should be doing.  I'm already attending AA and seeing a private therapist, but he wants me to attend an intensive outpatient program and go to AA every night.  I'm already broke from my arrest, I haven't been able to work as much as I used to (I used to work late at night and on weekends and the bus doesn't go there after 6pm or on weekends), and I'm just hemorrhaging money.  I just don't think I need that level of care.  I know I have a problem with alcohol, but I think what I'm doing is working at the moment.  I trust my therapist's evaluation and treatment plan.  If she recommended more I would do more.  I also don't know where I'm supposed to find the time to go for 3 hours 3-5 nights a week when I need to work extra, start doing community service, and go to more meetings.  It's just overwhelming.  How am I supposed to do all this when it takes me 2 hours to get to/from work?\n\nThen I tell my boyfriend about all of this, and he just doesn't care and says that he doesn't know what to say and that he has to go.  All I wanted was for a \"that sucks\" or an \"I understand\".  \n\nToday went from pretty good to pretty shitty real fast.  But tomorrow is a new day.

I also didn't vote for him because as a \"community organizer\" in Chicago the areas he worked in evidently became much, much worse after he arrived.

You would think that some federal agency would be required to document that candidates are in line with constitutional requirements. Either way I didn't like how the issue was skirted by his election effort and in my opinion that was a pretty good precursor as to how he actually operates as President. I didn't vote for him in 2012 because I hated the way the ACA was passed through Congress, and because he lied selling it to the American people. I also didn't vote for him because he didn't fullfill his number 1 promise in his first term which was closing Gitmo. He even made a big deal about it signing an executive order on TV ordering it to close within a year. He did that a few days after being sworn in during his first term. In 2012 Gitmo was still going strong, it just stopped being covered by the news. I didn't agree with shutting it down anyway, but Obama not delivering on his number 1 promise to those who did vote for him just served as yet another example of his true character. He is GW Bush x 10 because the media refuses to hound him the way it did Bush.\n\nI explained this to my black best friend in 2012 and he told me the only reason I didn't like Obama was because I was racist.

Since Republicans and the Right are the root of all evil. Let's completely jump over the fact that these programs have been extended under the Obama administration and instead blame Bush for all of our worries. \n\n&gt;Republicans' gripe is usually that he is too soft and now you are complaining that he didn't withdraw quick enough. Get your story straight. Obama said he would end both wars and he did. He also said it couldn't happen overnight because he don't invade a country and leave it in ruins. We haven't seen that kind of military insight in decades.\n\nI'm not a Republican, so quit making ASSumptions buddy. Military insight from a guy with a fucking embarrassing foreign policy rapsheet. Yeah, he ended both wars and withdrew absolutely amazing didn't he? Didn't leave the country in ruins, but he sure as hell is leaving it in ruins now. ISIS is just gonna be a good leader and government for Iraq, right? Now quit applauding boy toy Obama for withdrawing from Iraq and leaving it to be desecrated like this.

Completely embarassing Democratic-lead House and Senate. \n\nOh look, more blaming of Bush and the Republicans. Dude, you honestly need to change your views to look at both sides of an argument, especially if you're gonna accuse me of being a one-sided Republican that solely watches Fox News. \n\nThe economy is not fixed, but MUH DEFICIT. Yeah, look how fantastic our national debt is right now, mmmm $18 trillion in owed money.

{"body": "To be fair, Bush had great concern for Iraq and building it properly, even if it never should have been invaded in the first place.  He was very involved.  Obama would have stayed in Iraq if he hadn't won on all those campaign promises to leave.   When we left, the Iraqi government expelled the Sunni commanders from the military, creating a bunch of angry military leaders with a lot of experience and support.    \n    \nYou can't blame Bush for Iraq and not blame Obama for Syria and Libya.  We airstriked Libya without putting in the stability required to keep it from running rampant.   Meanwhile we passed out weapons like candy in Syria with no accountability or boots on the ground.   The Obama administration gave IS commanders via Iraq and weapons via Syria.  It  also happens that Sunnis have been oppressed all over the region and are sick of it.   That gave them their army.             \n  \n  \nIt's not a \"Thanks, Obama.\" situation, but give credit where credit is due.   His foreign policy experience was lacking when he made some very bold decisions and it caused a lot of problems.   Yes Iraq was winding down when he took office, but that doesn't mean it was done.  Iraq NEEDS strong leadership to stay stable, and that was what the US provided.  Without the US, the Iraqi government immediately alienated some required powerful individuals and caused them to raise an army against Iraq.      \n    \nMeanwhile, the Kurds free from Saddam, have created a nice nearly first world, equal opportunity state in the north.   Really, in everything we do with IS, our priority should be protecting the Muslim regions that actually like us.\n    \nYou can't go from strong dictatorships in Libya, Syria, and Iraq to democracy immediately, because they'll turn into religious states.  You have to force those countries to appreciate the better parts of secularism.   Japan, Germany, Israel and South Korea were not built overnight.  The US has a strong history of nation building, but it does take time.   \n   \nTLDR: place blame where blame is deserved on both sides.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418995078", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You and me both, brother.\n\nI don't like everything about the ACA, and I really wish it was better and had a public option. In fact, I think it kinda sucks overall, and is a handout of taxpayer dollars to private insurers. But the banning of preexisting condition discrimination was huge. \n\nI have inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis). I had been dreaming of starting my own business, but I was trapped in my job because I knew there was no way in hell I could get my own insurance as long as I had that black mark on my medical records. Insurers know that, while it can sometimes be economical to manage, if the drugs get changed, or if a flare happens, it can get quite costly, so they basically want nothing to do with me. If I had a flare-up without insurance I could have been bankrupted by medical expenses before my business even had a chance to get off the ground. \n\nThis year I was finally able to buy myself some real insurance through the federal marketplace, and I got a pretty good policy too (one of the silver PPO plans). Because of my already-low income, and low earnings expectations for the first 6 months of my business, I was eligible for tax credits and other assistance to give me zero deductibles and a premium of only around $100. My RX copays are manageable too, and seeing my gastro specialist doesn't cripple my monthly budget (got to keep the same one without getting some new HMO-mandated primary care doc involved). I coordinated the start date with when I was finally leaving my previous job and setting out on my own. It was really quite a liberating feeling! It made me feel almost like a normal person, to be treated equally by an insurance company for once and to not be punished for being afflicted with an incurable and chronic illness.\n\n6 months later and I've renewed my plan for next year. The premium went up to around $140, assuming I get to keep my tax credits next year, but some of the copays also went down. Things are finally starting to pick up with business, and I even had a shockingly good month in October where I made more money than I've ever made in a single month at any point in my life. Not all months are that good, and chances are I'll still get to keep all the tax credits for this year (had to spend a lot on getting my business rolling).\n\nAnyway, **TL;DR: Because the ACA banned preexisting condition discrimination, I was finally able to escape from a job I hated so I could start my own business, which now looks like it has a decent chance of success!

(I have five, and can't begin to imagine how much you must have been spending on food and litter!)\n\nThe first thing to realize is that you don't have to find permanent homes for them all right away. You can ask for help with *foster* homes while you pledge to keep working to find permanent homes.\n\nIt will all work better if you can find a rescue organization that will agree to work with you in two key ways: (1) to find foster homes; and (2) to sponsor your cats so they can be listed on [Adopt-a-Pet](http://www.adoptapet.com/) or PetFinder, which only accepts listings from organizations, not individuals. You can find a list of rescue groups in the area through [Columbus Dog Connection](http://www.columbusdogconnection.com/othersvcs.htm) or just Google \"central Ohio cat rescue\".\n\nA good backstory is a big part of what will help find homes for these kitties. You don't have to specify what kind of illness is forcing you to downsize, but you should make clear that you *had* permission to have this many cats until a new landlord changed the rules. You'll want to tout each cat individually, so having a good photo of each one and a short text about the cat's personality is important. (If there are couples among them that should be placed in the same home, present them that way.)\n\nDon't forget to reach out through other local reddits: university and neighborhood reddits are listed in the /r/Columbus sidebar; nearby city reddits are listed in the /r/Ohio sidebar. *Assume* that cat lovers are willing to travel to save a cat -- then make your pitch so convincing that they'll want to do that.\n\nI wish I could help more, but ... we're at capacity ourselves. With luck, if you talk to enough rescuers, you should be able to find one person who will work with you through her rescue group to find them homes.

{"body": "That's a really good idea. I probably should have done something like this before I was injured and taken it to the doctor. My PCP is a great guy and a family friend since he/I were kids but he is admittedly completely stumped by all of this. The doctors at the hospital where I spent a week in July were honestly only focused on fixing my injuries and not so much on what caused them. I need to find a good neurologist but I am between health insurances right now (Thanks Obamacare). \n\nI think the thing that scares me the most is that these suckers can happen out of the blue. And as badly as I was injured I most definitely DO NOT want to experience that again. I honestly don't know if I could survive another one like that. The damage was just so massive. The doctors in the ER in the hospital all called my injuries \"high velocity\" injuries and had a hard time believing that a seizure of any kind had done this to me. I got the feeling that if my wife and kids weren't there to corroborate the fact that I most certainly did not fall off the roof of a three story building, they wouldn't have believed me and probably called for a psych eval, or the police, or both. Hell, I still have a hard time believing it. Thanks for taking your time to read and offer advice. I really do appreciate it.

{"body": "I'm active duty military and I can tell you exactly why. \n\nWith Obama in power the military has been forced towards a politically correct environment and gone from a meritocracy to a system that simply rewards sycophants. Everyone has to cover their asses and if anyone gets offended by anything while you're in command regardless if you had any power over it at all you're relieved of command so that the guy above you can protect his own ass.\n\nI've been in for 12 years and stuff really started changing in 2009. It was crazy, the training and quality of recruits we were getting from boot camp and their follow on schools was just total crap. They were incompetent and unable to perform even the most basic rating tasks. Then came the indoctrination. The mandatory 'you will accept gays and share showers and berthing with them and if you say anything you will be punished' indoctrination that everyone had to attend. Then came the witch hunt for 'rape culture and sexism' in the military. Then the hazing. They basically outlawed any display of certain tradition because a very few people had taken it too far. There was an order that came out some time in 2012 I believe that said that all commanding officers or OIC's had to literally inspect their individuals work and berthing areas for anything that could be considered sexist in nature. So they took the skin mags out of the MALE BATHROOM, IT WAS A MALE ONLY BATHROOM WHY WOULD A FEMALE HAVE A CHANCE TO GET OFFENDED? Oh that's right, because of the 'culture' it perpetuates ... So yeah. The environment that we have to work in now, with the cultural war being waged within the military is extremely hostile to people like myself who lay down the law and demand respect. Now we're hurting people's feelings and getting in trouble for something they used to praise (well disciplined subordinates). The budget cuts, shitty pay raises, scaling back of benefits, and completely embarrassing foreign policy have all shaken our faith in his ability as commander-in-chief to utilize us effectively. Not to mention he traded 5 Taliban for a deserter.\n\nHe is openly despised by many senior ranking personnel. They tried to hide it initially but I've noticed open dissent towards his policies by senior people. Myself being one of them. The military has changed a lot since I've been in and I'm at the point now where almost all of my friends find themselves ... We're going to do our bare minimum to get to retirement and then jump ship. I've got 8 years left which is a lot of time for shit to get worse. I'm just in it for my family now. I've lost most of the pride I used to feel about serving back when it was more than just a job. Now it's like daycare for poorly camouflaged adults.\n\nThanks Obama for taking something I loved and turning it into something I'm learning to hate.\n\nEdit: I felt the need to add more details. With hazing, I served with a Marine infantry unit for my first 5 years. I made E5 and got pinned as a fleet marine warfare specialist in my time there. I was very proud to have my rank 'tacked on' from the Navy and the Marines. I was happy to get my shoulder punched 'to make sure that crow doesn't fly away' by the Navy guys and to get my 'blood stripes' from the Marines. They don't do it if they don't like and respect you so it was a big deal to me to get it from everyone when I became a NCO. Nowadays it's absolutely unheard of. It's just a handshake and a obligatory congrats. The same thing people who hated you used to do when you picked up. When I left the infantry unit I got pinned down and paddled with an oar (enough to hurt a bit but not even close to the spankings I received as a child) they then gave that paddle to me, with intricate 550 cord weaving and mounted medals and a plaque as a farewell and thank you for serving the unit. Every year on my birthday I'd get attacked and have my shirt pulled up and belly slapped however many years old I was at the time. This only happened to people the Marines loved and it's called a pink belly. That shit hurt like you wouldn't believe but it was all in good fun. Before I went on my first deployment I was called a boot and was not allowed to join in any conversations with other Marines except to listen and laugh. I had my head forcefully shaved in Kuwait before we crossed over into Iraq as a right of passage. They told me that when it grew out I'd finally be able to have a 'low reg' haircut because I deserved it. Before that I had to keep a high and tight. These were all rights of passage, I never got seriously hurt and although I did feel isolated as soon as we were on our first pump I felt more than ever part of the team and loved those Marines back! There were Marines who never got the pink belly, who got the handshake and didn't get their head shaved ... Those were the ones we didn't like. They didn't pull their weight, didn't try ... Like I said ... Meritocracy .... There was always a chance at redemption, you could always come back from a fuck up and there was incentive to. As much as Obama liked to talk about a 'teachable moment' his military had very little tolerance for mistakes. I hear officers complain about this daily. So some JO fucked up and accidentally clipped another ship causing probably $100,000 worth of damage. The CO, XO, CMC are all relived of command ... Because they approved the navigation plan. It's shit like that, the zero defect mentality that drives good people away. Instead we're left with the people that only care about themselves. Marines lost a lot of faith in their chain of command when that video emerged of the snipers pissing on corpses, yeah it was done in poor taste but seriously? The commandant (trying to save his own ass) unfairly biased the courts marital to hand down the maximum punishment so they could save face. Don't get me started about the witch hunt with the sexual harassment debacle or the countless hours I've spent in mandatory training about sexual harassment/assault. If you're a male in the military you're walking on egg shells to make sure you never even correct or discipline a female service member on her hair or nails or any misconduct because all she has to do is claim 'harassment' and your career is over. So you just ignore their misconduct and let them get away with it ... This is the price we've been paying since 2009. I lost friends in Iraq and when I left there we were winning. When Obama pulled us out early and declared victory for political reasons a lot of us were upset. When we watched ISIS take over cities we bled for after Obama's 'mission accomplished' moment ... We were enraged.\n\nThere are a billion reasons why this president has had the lowest support of the military ever in the history of poll taking and none of them are racism or anything else they love to claim. It's an organization of pragmatic patriots who obviously realize the damage this idiot is doing.

(No really, that was one of the things he made happen)\n\n\nFurther, something being inexpensive does not mean there cannot be a shortage. Example: this year there was a shortage of saline. It's not as though saline is expensive, it's salty, sterile water, with an average manufacturer's price of ~$1.00. However, there was a shortage because of recalls due to particulate matter in the sterile bags. If you donate plasma, as I did this year, there were measures taken to ration the saline they had on hand -- women received saline to replenish their fluid balance from the plasma removed from their blood, men got a free bottle of Powerade. The controls were put in at point of service, not by increasing the cost of the saline supply. \n\nAnother example is a personal one. I take gabapentin for a chronic pain condition, and my current dose, a month's supply costs  me, without insurance, ~$10. However, there was a shortage of it a few years ago, and my prescription had to be adjusted to compensate, by using a different mg pill size on a different dosing schedule. \n\nSo, it's currently unlikely any major shortage will occur (yay!) but it's something to keep an eye on, given the single supplier issue. And, cost does not reflect availability in all cases. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419655308", "subreddit": "SkincareAddiction", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sorry for the novel, but I can answer this.\n\nI was homeless for five years, hitchhiked a bit, just got fucked up and wasted time.\n\nA year and a half ago I was sick of living in the backroom of a junkie's trailer living to get fucked up and being miserable and put out a call for help on FB. An older former coworker of mine responded and I went to the city he was in; I quit getting fucked up that day and have only had a few beers since. I worked two jobs until I could get back on my feet (70 hour weeks for about six weeks) and then I was fine.\n\nThat was the first time I was sober, stable, and self sufficient in my life, and it took me until I was 22 to pull it off. I wish I hadn't blown alot of chances, I wish I wasn't such a prick to many well meaning people. I've relapsed into a very unhealthy and poor attitude since then with a general malaise and apathy toward my workaday life but since it was pointed out to me, I realized its not enough to get off the fucking streets, you have to change your mentality too. \n\nIt is easy to do if somebody has your back. The guy who helped me wasn't even doing too great himself but he didn't give up on me. It took me three months to get to a point of total nonreliance on him. \n\nSome people don't have anybody like that, so it's not easy. It's actually really fucking hard if you're sleeping outside with little or no access to electricity and clean water. You look rough and people aren't willing to take a chance on you because of it. I got interviews because I had access to a shower and a well charged government phone (thanks, Obama!)\n\nI worked at a pizza place and in a frozen dough factory 6-7 days/week and it fucking sucked but I did make enough money to set my life straight and save up to move. \n\nWas it worth it? Definitely. Like I said, my attitude began to suck dick eventually, and I had to face some hard truths about myself that I didn't like. You don't just flip a switch, the mentality is still there and that's the hardest part to change. All that resentment of people who had normal enough and stable families who didn't cook meth or what have you. \n\nOut on the streets I got asked why I didn't just go home alot. Not everybody has parents who care and some people don't have parents at all, some people don't have family. I wanted to beat the shit out of some people's arrogance when they told me to go home. I didn't have a fucking 'home', that's why I ended up living in a Johnny Hobo song. Social services are sometimes more limited than people would think and vary in quality from place to place.\n\nAlso, addiction isn't easy to kick.

{"body": "My friend is actually currently working at Walmart. He got full time by \"accident\" as they never bothered to hire the right amount of people and kept asking him to stay over. He eventually passed in to full time and has stayed that way ever since. They still don't give him 40 hours a week though. They cut their employees hours all the time to \"save money\" (Really Walmart? Can't afford your extra yachts?). This up coming week he has three days off, all of which are unpaid of course.

{"body": "I have never heard anyone say they have a brother on pluto. The so called 'fallacious claims' you hear on reddit nearly always fall into mere partisan positions such as 'blacks are over-represented in crime', or 'blacks are arrested more for the same offence'. Asking for proof for these is clearly just a time wasting effort, they are normally brought up as part of another argument - that argument should be addressed, addressing the foundations of the argument is as meaningful as saying 'thanks Obama'. We know there is a political left, we know there is a political right, we know they glean different statistics from the same tangibles, we know that this distinciton has been continuing for longer than there has been reddit arguments. We are aware that these statistics can be summoned (if we haven't already read them), and we know that it doesn't progress the argument. Just because these statements are mutually exclusive doesn't mean either is an outlandish claim that needs backing up, it just means you are on one side of a political debate and are refusing to admit the existence of the other side in the debate. The left exists, the right exists, when debating issues nothing will be achieved if the existence of either side itself is the primary argument.\n\nNot every statement is an assertion, claiming it is is a bad faith argument. The easiest way to tell the difference is if it is an assertion they will most likely bring up their statistics, if it isn't they won't. It could be speculation, question, observation etc. The idea that since the other side is not doing what you demand they have lost is a false dilemma.\n\nThe idea that an assertion on reddit needs backing up is a parody of academia. Non of the awful links redditers use would be acceptable. Normal essays can refer to BOOKS, not awful online links. Different subjects have different requirements. Plenty of subjects allow an argument to be made just from the logic of assumptions we already have. \n\nWhen writing an essay if you make an assertion such as 'Samurai in Japan were loyal to their lord', you will refer to a history book etc as evidence. What is or isn't acceptable is already discussed, and what library to use is told, and everyone will move on with their life and read the rest of your essay. On reddit, no link is ever good enough, and if you say something blindingly obvious like 'Samurai used swords, or bows, or spears' your reddit 'teacher' will go argue the merits of your link or an endless dribble of bad reddit links they summon to counter yours.\n\nMaking a statement is not equivalent to writing an essay, it is equivalent to an open classroom discussion (or you know, a normal conversation between respectful adults), if you demanded links in those circumstance it wouldn't be entertained because only on reddit is time an unlimited resource when requested by some anonymous lost misanthrope.\n\nWhen communication breaks down, it doesn't mean you are smarter, it means you are using belittling as a substitute for actual discovery. When you attempt to weaken the other participant rather than just glean the perceived logic and assumptions of their argument, you cede the argument.\n\nIn university you spend time looking for links because you learn and get a degree. On reddit hoarding fistfulls of wiki pages just means you argue stupid reddit beliefs and leave reality behind. If a person doesn't respect another redditer enough to research their position, that makes more sense than two idiots teaching each other bad habits with bad arguments.\n\nThere are arguments for which there are good evidence and good proofs. And there are arguments for which there aren't (the latter make of the majority of reddit). Lots of bad evidence is not superior to no evidence. \n\nWhen a person goes to university they are acknowledging their respect for a scholastic subject, that doesn't mean that all subjects are worthy of respect or given respect. Fortune telling isn't respected, physics is, some other subjects that are adored on reddit fall somewhere in between the two. Posting on reddit doesn't mean someone owes it to you to debate your pet subject, even if it is 'philosophy'.\n\nThe position you (the op) state you have is not in any way anti-reddit, it is very much the default reddit position. \n\nSomeone making a false statement is far less of an imposition than someone demanding they prove it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419854736", "subreddit": "Negareddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Once the deductible for the calender year is met, you mean**. Once the deductible is met. \n\nSo, some person may have to pay the first maybe $5000 each year and after that the insurance kicks in with its coverage. For individuals there is a limit of around $6200 additional dollars in OOP costs (of covered services like the ones you mentioned, non covered services are not limited in any way and are covered at 0% which means not covered) \n\nSo, a single poor person will basically have a potential risk exposure of **$6200 a year plus the premium.**\n\nFor all groups of two or more, even single parent families (OUCH) the OOP limit is $12,600 so as long as they have the premiums (which sometimes will be subsidized in the states with their own exchanges) and that $12,600 much of which will be in the deductible which will rst come at the beginning.. so they might have to pay the doctor their full bill for the first six months or so and pay full retail for drugs and at some point after they meet their deductible their insurance might start paying 60% (or soon 50%) of doctor bills and drug costs.. but once they have paid $12,600 out of pocket (total of both drugs and co-pays) PLUS THE PREMIUMS, which may be subsidized in states with their own exchanges like California.. then the insurance kicks in 100%  So a family that has a subsidized premium of $500 a month will only have to pay a total of around $18,000 a year for covered services, as long as the income earner doesn't get a raise!\n\nAnd **if they stop going to the doctor completely, and dont refill or take any Rx prescriptions, they only have to pay that $500 a month**. \n\nAs many as 17 million Americans were eligible for premium tax credits before those infernal court decisions (Drat!) , I don't know how many are now but its MUCH smaller. So, nobody can say the US is hypocritical, we're eliminating our market barriers. \n\nCalifornia is high visibility.. so low income California residents will still get it because their state has its own exchange. \n\nAt least until 2018. And by then TISA, TTIP, TPP will be in full force so there wont be any threat of affordable healthcare and single payer pushing costs down, here or in other countries like the UK (TISA, TPP, TTIP etc. bars any kind of public health care explicitly and commits signatory countries to following the US model, and eliminating them. (they are framed as BAD monopolies see [this paper](http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/Nick%20Skala%20GAT%20and%20Health%20Reform.pdf) for an explanation of how.)\n\nHooray. Thanks Obama. They (the insurance and drug industry's profits have risen and in the case of Rx drugs - even in the face of what seemed like enormous downward price pressure in 2008 - its completely turned around, drug prices have more than doubled since 2008!\n\nSo the US pharmaceutical, healthcare and insurance industries are booming.
