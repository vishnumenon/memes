{"body": "It's a cold, brisk, morning in D.C. the White House stands proud in the United State's Capital a long day is ahead for Barack Obama. \n\nThe day was nothing special for Barack, he had spent little time with his family over the past few days to try and make up time after the festive period and of course, he was being lambasted with calls and meetings all day and he was getting some solitude in the fact he had managed to have some alone time in the oval office for a good half an hour.\n\nThe President was day dreaming - something he hasn't been able to do for a long, long while. Then, a knock at the door. \"Come in\" he said with a sigh. It was his secretary. \"You have a call Mr. President\" He rolled his eyes \"Thanks, Linda\"\n\nHe picks up the phone and puts on his professional voice not giving away the fact he is completely drained and it is only one in the afternoon. \"This is the President speaking\" *unce unce unce unce* \n\"Hello?\" President said with confusion in his voice. \n\nA feint voice is apparent suddenly through what sounded like rave music \"Is that him?!\" \"Is it really!?\" \"PASS ME THE PHONE!!!\" At this point the President would have normally just put the phone down and demanded how some stupid kids managed to get on the phone line directly to the Oval Office without anyone even batting an eyelid but, he was curious. It had been a long morning after all and a little bit of light conversation might help him through the rest of the day.\n\n\"Who-\" The President is suddenly cut off. \"Baaaaaaraaaaaaaaack\" is said in a light hearted tone, almost like a child. Once again the President, this time more demanding asks \"Who is this!?\" \"It is me you silly goose!\" immediately the President recognises the voice. \"Not this again...\" \n\n\"What is it now, Kim?\" he says with a disappointed tone. \"Hey! That's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un to you!\" the words being slurred out of his mouth and hardly tangible to the President. \n\n\"Okay, bye Kim\" The President goes to hang up the phone. \"Wait, I want to work things out!\" This piques Barack's interest \"I'm listening...\" \n\n\"You see, I have been thinking of this whole thing of North Korea having a hatred for the United State's and its allies thing and I really don't think its fair the way you are always ignoring us!\" \n\n\"Look Kim if yo-\" He is cut off again \"Hey! I said its Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un to you!\" The Korean demands like a child. \n\n\"I don't have time for this Special Leader Kim Jong-Un\" The President said with a grin on his face purposefully trying to antagonise the North Korean Dictator \n\n\"Very funny Barack, HAHA you are sooo funny! You should be a comedian!\" \n\n\"Okay, I really don't have time for this again Kim the last time we spoke you demanded I make Dennis Rodman live with you forever to be, and I quote, best friends forever\" \n\n\"Well, that is why I am calling, the last time Denny was here I offered him a slave from one of those totally legit prison camps where people are completely fine and enjoy serving their time for the crimes they have committed\" Kim weeps down the phone.\n\n\"He won't even respond to the DM's I have sent him on Twitter and I know he's there, Barack he responded to the fake account I made, the Jimmy Dushku one\" \n\n\"I see...\" a bemused Obama responds.\n\n\"If you can get him to talk to me I will only make three Nuclear threats next month instead of the projected twenty I have on my 'Assert World Dominance calendar\"\n\n\"I mean, I'm sorry Kim I can't just force Dennis to talk to you, this is the United States the people are free to talk to whoever they please here\" He said in a surprisingly sorry tone. \n\nA dull silence over takes the call the loud music in Kim's background stops dead. \n\n\"Kim? are you... still there?\"\n\nLight whimpers are heard on the other end of the call.\n\n\"Yeah.. yeah right, haha jokes on you Barack, I am prank calling you. Like I would allow Rodman to come back to Best Korea to shoot hoops and talk about Basketball stuff. I have so much more fun with with my other friends who just want to sit around watching our mighty military parade around all day, thanks Obama!\"\n\n\"Listen... Kim...\" The phone call drops. \n\nIn North Korea Kim Jong-Un is sitting looking through old photos of him and Dennis when he was last in Korea\n\n\"He will never let us be together\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420505832", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 58, "controversiality": 0}

He's a large part of those accomplishments.  He was also outspoken for these ideas often in speeches.  He wasn't politically maneuvered into signing a multi-part bill with these good things in it that he disliked, he was for them from the start.  And speaking to America about it personally helped the democratic party's popularity, so they could push for more of these kinds of bills.  \n\n&gt; NSA overreach, spying on Americans and even congress.\n\nThis is something almost all developed countries are doing, with corruption or not. When it comes to national security, there are alot of things that regular people aren't told about, and that makes judgements of spying more of a guessing game from our points of view.  I know 0% of reddit reading this will agree with me.  What we all can like though is that Obama made stricter limits for the NSA to access people's data.  \n\nThe torture issue is interesting because (and i could be wrong) Obama made real efforts to end torture, but was blocked by Republicans.  People cite later efforts to end torture being half-assed, but I'm skeptical his stance on torture would change.  \n\nYou're probably right about whistleblowers.  Although keep in mind, some people say the information Snowden gave out allowed Russia to know they could attack the Ukraine.  These issues of national and international security seems to me like something easy to judge and want transparency for when a citizen, but when given the knowledge presidents have that we don't, the logical choice can be to spy and keep certain things secret.  There are also victories we don't hear about.  For all we know, multiple 9/11-esque attacks were dodged from these unfavorable policies.  There hasn't been a successful large terrorist attack since 9/11, just saying.  \n\nIdk about the TPP negotiations.  It's probably shitty.

{"body": "I've noticed your from the UK, but here's a half-assed American cultural perspective on why zombies aren't interesting (and really what I've written are just my deranged personal opinions, so feel free to disregard). TL;DR: Thanks Obama (see I told you so).\n\nZombies have been on the decline in cool since their peak in 2007/2008 when large scale \"zombie walks\" were a thing and Max Brooks' *World War Z* was fresh and new. A bit of cultural inertia did them in, but what really killed them was the campaign of Barack Hussein Obama. Seriously. \n\nTraditionally, zombies have represented the left wing's (\"the thinking people\" as we like to think of ourselves) fear of other groups of people - Romero's zombies made the jump from representing communism (*Night of the Living Dead*, 1968) to their polar opposite, rampant consumerism (*Dawn of the Dead*, 1978) in only 10 years. How does this link to Obama? I'm getting to that, but feel free to skip to the next paragraph if you're feeling impatient.\n\nDuring the Bush/Cheney years, zombies represented the republicans in lockstep and \"unthinking/scared\" independents that elected and then *re-elected* the duo. They started wars and oversaw radical increases in executive power, which made many leftists generally afraid of their own countrymen. But then their term limits came up, an election was held, and record numbers of volunteers turned out to support candidates, and engaged in the election. Hope and Change were the words of the day. Apathy was defeated^1 and [zombies lost their cultural relevancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07s-cNFffDM).\n\nI suppose you could try to subvert the trope and flip it so zombies represent the liberal masses. If you're all about that Randian objectivism, go for it I guess. Monologue about moochers or whatever, I'm not here to judge your fun (just you, zombie lover). I wouldn't recommend using zombies to represent their other fears. Living in a postmodern, globalized and pluralistic society has given us a certain perspective where it should be self evident that zombies should not be used to represent immigrants, Muslims, or any other cultural groups that draw ire. Or do so - [Racial Holy War](http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Racial_Holy_War) is right over there, go and fuck yourself with it.\n\nBut what if you wanted to make just the radical Islamists zombies? That could work...the other side of the zombie coin is murder without repercussion, and honestly, I don't think anyone minds to terribly when religious murderers get whats coming to them...But the numbers of such zealots is relatively low compared to the populations at large so the spread of their influence (making more zombies) would still be too near some disgusting cultural biases for many people to want to participate in your game.\n\nIn the end, you're left with the game you've said you want to run, which is really a game about people and zombies just happen to be art of the backdrop. But if I've learned anything about people and gaming, its that people mostly want to relax and play a game, not partake in some extended diatribe about how you think people are bastards with intermittent dice rolling.\n\nNow that all of that is out of the way, keep your eyes peeled for public playtesting of a game called Red Markets sometime this summer. I think it will be right up your alley and possibly an easier sell.\n\n^1 lol nope", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420787370", "subreddit": "rpg", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

My (former) best friend also asked me to be the best man in his wedding; he assured me that all of the expenses would be paid (flight, hotel, tuxedo, etc.), until I found out that he wasn't even *considering* expenses like gas to get to the airport and the wear and tear on my shoes after dancing all night at his over-the-top reception.\n\nSo I cut these toxic, money-wasting people out of my life. As a bonus, without these leeches calling and texting me, I was also able to cancel my cell phone. Since I change jobs at least every month or two (best way to get a raise FTW), I have a pager (ugh, some expenses can't be avoided) for when I get calls for an interview.

Globalization has only helped women worldwide, but lets ignore that for the better purpose of MARGINALIZING MEN!! :D\n\n\" I wonder if it’s possible to be a Republican and a Christian at the same time.\" **Considering that** [every major religion aside from Judaism is mainly Republican](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/02/02/trends-in-party-identification-of-religious-groups-affiliation/) YES YOU CAN!! Nice attempt at slander though.\n\n\"The lost opportunities of the years since September 11 are the stuff of tragedy. Remember the people rallying in sympathy on the streets of Teheran, the famous headline — ‘we are all Americans now.’ Five years later much of the world wonders what America is now. As we face this landscape of failure and disorder, nothing is more urgent than for us to begin again to rebuild a bipartisan consensus to ensure our interests, increase our security and advance our values. It could well start with what our founders had in mind when they pledged ‘a decent respect for the opinions of mankind’ in the Declaration of Independence…This Administration’s choices were false choices. Internationalism versus unilateralism. Realism versus idealism. Is there really any argument that America must remain a preeminent leader for peace and freedom, and yet we must be more willing to work in concert with other nations and international institutions to reach common goals? The American character is both idealistic and realistic: why can’t our government reflect both?\" **This is** actually a fairly strong criticism. But, my rebuttal is, what did you expect? Realism and idealism are a venn diagram with very little overlap. America can't fit into it all the time, sorry.\n\n\"I have a million ideas. The country can’t afford them all.\" **WOW** I really want to vote for your bankrupting ass when the US government debt is now up to 14 trillion. Or did you mean to morally bankrupt us?\n\n\"From her concession speech: Although we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it’s got about 18 million cracks in it…You can be so proud that, from now on, it will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories, unremarkable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee, unremarkable to think that a woman can be the President of the United States. And that is truly remarkable.\" **INB4** people who start shoving Hillary down our throat because if WE DON'T VOTE FOR HER WE ARE GOING TO BE LABELED SEXIST.\n\n\" I’m sick and tired of people who say that if you debate and disagree with this administration, somehow you’re not patriotic. We need to stand up and say we’re Americans, and we have the right to debate and disagree with any administration.\" **THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN OK WITH SOMETHING YOU SAID HOLY SHIT**\n\nEdit: Realized this comment is 7k long, sorry guys :( I can't help myself.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421074320", "subreddit": "MensRights", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Really? Obama has changed the law 50 plus times without congress approval which is unconstitutional I should add and your blaming republicans from a Democrat controlled congress when alot of the changes were made. After it became republican in the house it was the president to change the law.... only thing that's good in the law is pre existing conditions but why the hell is birth control included in what I pay for if I don't use it? It's wealth distribution... I blew out my knee in December I went to the doctor the next day they ordered an MRI I couldn't get one due to obamacares new laws it has to get approved by insurance first. I know this because he flat out said it and how he and all doctor he knows hate the law and have several of his patients have suffered greatly and two even died because they didn't get their treatments approved through insurance soon enough. Regarding my MRI I now have to have surgery and have bolts and screws put in my leg because they waited on the MRI and if they had done an MRI earlier they could have caught the torn tendons and ligaments and put me in a specialized brace but now a month later it's scarred up and has to be cut re attached and break some areas which in the end will cost me much more.... the law will not work flat out its simple economics poor pay nothing they get subsidies so of course crap ton of people with low income sign up well nearly everyone will have to have subsidies well who pays for those? Well middle class and upper class so rates are freaking massive well most can't afford this in the middle class so they just take the penalty and those who can have to fork up more money for some coverage they don't necessarily want like men for women's products... and then that income instead of it being expendable is now forced into Healthcare. High class doesn't really even care they just go to the private markets so then middle suffers even more. Then doctors they don't want to be in it but now they are forced into Obama care weather they want to be or not. It's wrong and unconstitutional nearly every bit of it. Give states the rights let them decide what to do. Let them buy across state lines drive down the cost the right way. Otherwise there will just be more and more taxes like the medical device tax I mean what the hell yeah let's tax the shit out of stuff that help saves lives so more low income hospitals can't afford it!

{"body": "You will have to go to a private school or move to one of the very few states that didn't sign on to Common Core in order to \"avoid\" common core. \n\nAnd, no, CCSS (common core state standards) were not some grand conspiracy designed to take parents out of the picture. It's not some Marxist, socialist, commie, pinko, thanks Obama thing. \n\nMost of the principles behind CCSS are sound. \n\nThere are tons of problems with the implementation. \n\nHave you ever looked at them? One of the biggest problems in my mind is that they are simply asking too much of kids at too young an age. Maybe most 12 year olds just aren't ready to analyze the theme of a book and how that the authors use of rhetoric and character development informs and develops the theme. Maybe most 12 year olds just aren't ready to do the kind of algebra most of us did in freshman year of high school. \n\nIt feels like the standards writers forgot that the entirety of American children make up bell curve, a curve that the creators sit at the high end of. They have no appreciation that teachers have to teach to the entire bell. CCSS leaves even more kids \"behind\" and that's my biggest beef with it. \n\nLook at the standards though, they're easy to go through even though the language is academic masturbation at its finest. They really want your kids to be smarter, sooner, but many kids aren't ready for that. Top that off with many teachers not being ready or knowing how to teach all these new concepts and it's a recipe for disaster. \n\nTake the concept in this post. It's one that most kids naturally develop through standard addition practice. I think that kind of self-discovery is much more powerful than giving the kids a battery of tools they only have a small grasp on.

{"body": "Nice thorough response.  Thanks, I'll try to be thorough also. \n\n&gt; The only plan they want is no-ACA, which is what they tried to push for. That's why you got no viable alternatives from them.\n\nYou have to see how unreasonable that is, right?  Without a plan to replace it, it would mean: Close/defund all online market places. End End subsidies and medicare expansions, thereby taking healthcare away from millions, re-allow insurance companies to deny claims and coverage based on pre-existing conditions.   How could that possibly be considered reasonable? \n\n&gt; Universal single-payer\n\nI'm for it too. \n\n&gt; Opening up the market to inter-state insurance sales, so that there aren't virtual monopolies between a few health providers that selectively certain cover hospitals and doctors.\n\nI like the idea too, but I think it's politically unfeasible. What this means is state level insurance regulations go bye bye.  If insurance isn't regulated by the states, it'd have to be regulated by the feds.  Good luck pushing a plan that takes power from states and hands it to the federal government. \n\n&gt; UBI could be give out along side the current ACA to make sure it doesn't impoverish lower middle class and working class Americans\n\nWhat's UBI?  I've googled and come up blank. \n\n&gt; Expanding Medicare/Medicaid to cover everyone in need\n\nI like this idea too, but again, politically unfeasible. This and single payer are instances where the ACA didn't go far enough.  I agree that it could go farther and should, but this would cost more tax payer dollars. So who pays for this?  \n\n&gt; Creating free, or low cost online diagnostic services for common illnesses where patients enter their relevant information and are connected to health care professionals who advise them. Something like this already exists, but is very limited. Broaden this to save time in doctors offices, reducing costs, increasing the amount of people treated, and making basic care more available\n\nI have Kaiser insurance and this is exactly the system they have, and there's already lots of ideas to improve medical efficiency already in ACA.  Can it be improved? sure. This is a good idea, but it doesn't replace ACA, it just improves it. \n\nQuick story from this past weekend.  Last Friday, my daughter (14)  stayed home from school because she has a soar throat AND she's using the light from her iPod to see the back of her throat and there's obvious swelling and white-puffy nodules. (It was gross). Wife calls the 800 number and speaks to a nurse.  They send us to a nurses clinic to get two swabs taken to test for strep.  7 minute test comes back negative, they send us home to treat it virally and await the second (more accurate) test results. Monday we got a voice message telling us the 2nd test was also negative.  I email the doctor (via the web interface) saying \"what do I do now?\" and attach a picture of my daughters throat. \n\n&gt; Create a state insurance plan in lieu of single payer that competes with private plans in the market, is drastically cheaper, and available to all.\n\nI'm also for a public option, but this wouldn't replace ACA, it would just improve it. \n\n&gt; In theory actually combining all of these would make for a very complete health care reform.\n\nYou can't combine \"single payer\" with \"private markets\" - theses ideas are mutually exclusive. \n\n&gt; The ACA did very little to reform healthcare. Aside from the common sense fixes like \"pre-existing conditions\" it just made a website where you can compare plans, and required you to buy it, giving the very poor some help in affording it.\n\nThat common sense idea doesn't work if healthy people don't buy insurance. You get that, right? That's the point of the mandate.   In your worst case scenario, the guy who makes $30,145 a year and now has insurance for $200 a month. He now has insurance. I get you don't like the idea that he's required to buy something he doesn't want, but he does get something for his money. So how do you feel about people walking around without insurance who just go to the emergency room when something happens? Because that's what we had, and that's what your expecting from 30K dude. Unfunded Universal Emergency Room Service for all (Thanks, Reagan), guaranteed treatment and they'll bill you later. If you don't pay, then the hospital eats the cost. And by hospital I mean all of us.  But because of ACA, this guy, and people like him,  are no longer my or your problem because they're now paying their own way.   Thanks Obama. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421944451", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

We're not doing anything new. \n\n[22nd Jan](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-backed-leader-of-yemen-resigns-amid-rebel-standoff/)\n\n&gt;\"I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ... this strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years,\" Mr. Obama said.\n\n&gt;\"We will continue to operate as normal, albeit with reduced staff,\" according to a State Department statement. \"We are also continuously reassessing the situation on the ground based on our staffing needs.\"\n\nand again on [24th Jan](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/24/us-counterterrorism-operations-in-yemen/)\n\n&gt;“The political instability in Yemen has not forced us to suspend counterterrorism operations,” National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey told Fox News. “We will continue to take action to disrupt the continuing, imminent threats to the United State and our citizens.”\n\n&gt;Earlier Friday, the Washington Post reported the Obama administration has been forced to suspend counterterrorism operations in the county. The paper, citing U.S. officials, reported that Shiite rebels now control Yemeni security services that provided much of the intelligence that helped the U.S. air campaign against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nYet again, same things were said publically 3 days ago as today, the same denial of a report that has already been offically denied a day ago- the only value addition being the generic insight that terrorists thrive in countries with weak governments today. And for the latter, this is the first time I'm saying this with sincerity: Thanks Obama! But the redundancy of the questions surely raises questions unless you are in unquestioning assumption of your assumptions.\n\nRegarding question to Modi- I personally thought it was an irreverent question, and any Indian's answer would've been the same as the one Modi gave, perhaps less eloquent. If you want to want to get into the Environment issue from the Indian perspective, I'll be glad to present it when I find the time and why we think the way we do. We, as in, ofcouse, the dominant mentality that got Modi his 272 seats. But that question really doesn't matter (Modi gave lip service on the real issue just like all world leaders including Obama and China do) and neither is it the real point of my post- which was the Russian angle.\n\n**Edit/Addition**: As another commenter has mentioned before me, both questions are probably scripted. It is in American interests to undermine Russia, and it is in Indian interest to showcase a \"special friendship\" with the USA (Indian reporter's question) to attract more investors, please our growingly influential diaspora and to portray a \"more-than-a-strategic\" partnership to China who're stringing pears around the Indian Ocean which we're hoping to counter with Chabahar/Vietnam/Japan + USA's pivot to Asia.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422221102", "subreddit": "india", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

That's not absolving Bush, but to claim that the 2008 meltdown was *caused* (or even exacerbated) by GOP policies is either disingenuous or ignorant.

His stimulus passed in Feb; and while I will absolutely agree that it kept a lot of states from having to fire a lot of gov't workers which would have made things worse, you would have to work really hard to convince me that 1) this $800B+ spending over ~10 years made much of a dent in our ~$15T economy and 2) That a GOP president wouldn't have passed something similar (for all their bullshit about small gov't, when they were faced with an economic slowdown, they did the same thing in 2002).\n\n**Oh, and you might want to look up who signed the TARP legislation.**  Ill give you a hint, it was signed on October 3, 2008.\n\nJust stop it.

Thanks Obama.\n\nSecond guy wasn't skilled enough to get a class but, probably would be a wizard. Str 13 Dex 12 Con 11 Int 15 Wis 13 Cha 13. He was on the academy table. Complete book nerd.\n\nThird guy started on the life experience table and, uh, yeah. Str 10 Dex 18 Con 11 Int 9 Wis 11 Cha 22. I don't know if it was just lucky rolls or if there are just a lot of +2 to Cha/Dex on this table, but this dude got a lot of them. Rolled half-elf for the race. Pretty sure this guy would end up beating the devil is a rock off.\n\nAlso, I did see there were some rolls on the military table that didn't give +/-, and a few throughout the table that gave other stuff. (i think the bard had one that said Sleight of Hand, saw another roll that said 300gp somewhere in there) Not sure if the no stat modifiers was intentional or not.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422323139", "subreddit": "DnD", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
