{"body": "Yeah that sounds about right. She is prescribed the patches due to back surgery she had a while ago. I don't know how often she smokes that stuff - I only know that she has. I can't speak openly with her YET - the rest of the family is trying to get everything in order - rehab clinics, NA groups, etc. She isn't aware that anyone is on to the severity of her problem yet. Her husband, their 6-year old daughter and she recently moved in with our mother for non-drug related reasons (Oct 2014). Her husband has a problem as well, but it doesn't seem nearly as severe. There's a concern (justified or not) that they might run if we know the severity of the problem. For the 6-year old's sake we're just trying to get all of our options lined up and ready to go ASAP before we broach the topic. I suspect it will only be a few days at this point.\n\nWhen they moved in with my mom they were open about needing some help. She didn't have health insurance and wasn't able to get pain medication \"for her back\" and was probably desperate for relief. She was able to get health insurance (thanks Obama!) and now has her prescriptions again - which I'm of the belief she no longer needs for pain, but her addiction tells her otherwise. Regardless, she might not be as willing to admit the severity of the problem or the need for help, but I don't think it would be hard to get her back to that spot. Her husband will be harder to win over. He moved in with my mom and said he wanted to \"try rehab on his own\".\n\nMy sister is VERY close with our cousin who has had very similar back issues and pain problems, but has stayed away from any addiction problems. Yesterday he expressed that he believes she's been crying out for help to him -- because of this I think her seeking treatment and help is very obtainable.\n\nObviously both her and her husband need to get sober for either of them having the chance to stay sober. I'm looking at treatment centers that can use Suboxone as a method of treatment as I'm of the belief that their addiction isn't simply a matter of willpower or desire, but a neurological and chemical disorder in her brain. Medical treatment needs to be part of her rehab. The best place I've seen, [according to reviews](http://www.rehabs.com/listings/eagleville-hospital-3031988313/#the-reviews), is the [Eagleville Hospital](http://eaglevillehospital.org/) near Norristown, PA. They take private insurance (which my sister has) which is huge as all of this is very expensive.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422752688", "subreddit": "OpiatesRecovery", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I will buy a Starbucks and lift it to him. \n \nI went through menopause, or at this age, premature ovarian failure, at age 16. I was diagnosed at 20 and given Premarin and a separate progesterone prescription. After several months on that, I went in for my yearly examination and my doctor said, \"Why did they put you on that?! Here,\" and handed me a pack of birth control pills and a prescription for same. As someone who has a hard time taking pills, particularly the Premarin uncoated horse pills I had to choke down every day, switching to a single, tiny pill was so much more convenient.\n  \nAnd so it has gone, for the next 20 years. Because of those pills, I had a generally normal body chemistry; I didn't develop osteoporosis; I enjoyed perfectly predictable periods and very little PMS, and there was no such thing as a pregnancy scare in my world (infertile *and* on the Pill? Ain't nothing getting through here). \n \nOver time, though, as what little natural hormones I produced diminished and the monophasic formulation I was using seemed less efficacious in addressing that, I consulted with an endocrinologist. Maybe technology has changed since 1993. He gave me a thorough work up and then prescribed what he felt was the best way to mimic a natural cycle: Ortho Tri Cyclen. \n \nAnd so today, I will go pick that up, for zero copay this time (Thanks, Obama) and remember that I have a strong, healthy body today because of that pill.

{"body": "I've been holding out on vaccination and I'm glad someone finally snapped some sense into me. All it took was a politician telling me what to think and do! Thanks Obama. I was so lost before you came along as a politician supporting positions that deny science:\n\nFetus viability and natural rights as a vulnerable and developing life form, demonstrably unsustainable socialized medicine, the fact marijuana is scheduled incorrectly despite all the science, oh the scientific fact that there's only one race: the human race, also the science that demonstrates the chilling effect pervasive monitoring has on free speech and individual liberty, the science behind whether a bullet, gun, or shooter is responsible for a death, the science screaming for better attention to be paid to mental health rather than the 2nd amendment, the science Iran pursues for nuclear armament, and lest we forget the science behind smoking cigarettes causing harm (did he ever manage to quit?)...\n\nCertainly whenever Obama, any politician, says science deniers are the problem, I think about when people said that about God, too. Look where that led us. At least all the \"known\" science gets amended and corrected each year. In a few years we will be back to global cooling, nuclear winters, insisting there's life waiting to be discovered if we only raise taxes to launch more probes. \n\nWhat a shame he frames it this way. He has a Surgeon General, no? Is there a more credible person that could have issued this statement besides a polarizing political figure running a regime of collectivism and imposed mentalities. If this were a Bush declaring parents should recognize the value religion offers to family units and child stability (scientifically supported) there'd be outrage. \n\nBut this is just kids getting shots whether their parents consent or not. In the interest of securing the majority, a minority must acquiesce and relinquish their liberty to raise their children according to their own principles. \n\nEverything would be so much better if people would stop trying so hard to think for themselves and just let the politicians take care of the details. Pay your taxes and shut your mouth unless you are eating what Michelle O says is good for your kids but not her own. \n\nYeah this is a great stance for a president challenging the balance of power and circumventing a nation's precedent to impose his will. \n\nAs the downvotes pour in, let me remind you that *this* politician might be aligned with your ideals but allowing him such authority means the *next* politician has the precedent to do the same. It won't be Democrats forever. When the tables turn, do you want a precedent of a president having authority in this way? Would you applaud a religious politician talking about the science supporting the traditional family unit over modern same-sex unions? Of course not. Don't applaud this politician for being hostile when people make choices he doesn't agree with. You won't be laughing when the people upset over this manage to put their politician in the White House and aggressively campaign to swing the pendulum back. \n\nStand against politicians purporting to be more than they are. Obama is no scientist. He's a politician and his science is the study of political units, which benefit from rhetorical speeches that raise funding for prepared agendas. A scholar of the constitution telling me to vaccinate is like a CEO saying lower taxes stimulates small business. Sure, there's research to support the claim but should we dive in head first because one says so? No, of course not. We find *other* research to refute the claim. That's natural. When people say it is wrong to be a skeptic, they are telling you to conform and chilling free speech. \n\nThis isn't about vaccines any more than government broadband is about fairness and net neutrality.

In looking at your site, it's very confusing. My question to you is the following: is the basis of your website that participants sign up for a $5 card, shop at the 64k affiliates you have built (who see this as a bulk selling opportunity), and they somehow get discounts? If that's the case, you really have to revamp your presentation and explain WHERE those discounts are coming from. If not and my understanding is incorrect, please feel free to steer me in the right direction...either way, I don't understand your business model. I would imagine that folks who have insurance today (most of the U.S. population, thanks Obama!) are already getting the best price through their carriers contracted amounts and discounts. \n\nTruth be told, I had a similar idea (but differently executed) for a while now. Curious to see where this goes.\n\nP.S.

{"body": "\"These teams had the same record last season--here's why they'll have different records this season. Also, names.\"\n\nGet the fuck out of here, ESPN.\n\n**EDIT:** Okay now I'm actually putting my beer down and looking up stats. Brace yourselves, I'm gonna flex that English degree up in this bitch.\n\n• **C** - Look, I have a personal grudge against Buster Posey. I realize that it's not the most mature opinion to hold, but I'm just upset at the guy constantly for no reason. To me, he is the \"thanks Obama\" of baseball. While Posey has an outstanding line--I can't argue that he's a good player whatsoever, I'm a jackass but I'm not stupid--I feel like Phegley is getting the shit end of the stick here in that he's not even mentioned. He may not be the posterboy Posey is for SF, but goddamn if [this](http://m.mlb.com/video/v29160969/josh-phegley-talks-about-his-awesome-mullet/?query=phegley) doesn't make him fit right in at Oakland.\n\n• **1B** - While Davis had about 100 more AB than Belt in 2014, Davis was consistently better statistically with a notable exception being the GDP and SLG/OPS+ (I usually don't pay attention to those stats, personally--Davis still had nearly double Belt's RBIs last season).\n\n• **2B** - I feel like this section was written first, about a week ago, then the staff got drunk and forgot about it and realized the deadline was in four hours and phoned the rest of the article in.\n\n• **3B** - Lawrie kind of got a TKO on this one, in that he won in them ragging on McGeehee without actually touching on why he's a worthwhile addition to the roster.\n\n• **SS** - if we can just link out of context videos of one player and not mention the other whatsoever and call that a valid argument, then let's just use [this](http://m.mlb.com/video/v32627755/cwschc-semien-makes-great-play-on-grounder-for-out/?query=semien), or [this](http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/78370164/v32410227/tbcws-semien-makes-a-great-diving-stop-at-third/?query=semien). Oh, wait, those were completely ignoring the offensive aspect to him as a player, weren't they? Then here's [this one](http://m.mlb.com/video/v32329483/cwsdet-semien-smashes-a-grand-slam-to-left/?query=semien), too. If we're looking at stats, then yeah, Crawford's got a better line. This will be Semien's third year in the majors--he's got nothing but room to improve. That's not saying Crawford doesn't--though Semien is younger, I'd argue these players are pretty similar.\n\n• **LF** - I don't understand why they're even writing this article and including the \"you know, we don't actually know if these players will be relevant to any discussion involving comparisons, but since we have a quota we're going to count absence as inability and not take into account replacements\" sections. I'm not even going to get into the lines--last season, Blanco and Aoki did better, though Fuld got about half as many AB as they did, so there's less of a sample size to go off of. I think the concession at the end here makes this leave less of a bad taste in my mouth--I'd obviously want to give our guys the edge because they look adorable and do somersaults, but it's close.\n\n• **CF** - one had back surgery, the other is somewhat injury-prone. I think Pagan has a bit of a better arm than my boy, though. But since Pagan may not be a factor initially and ESPN can't be bothered to actually look shit up, I took a look at SF's projected depth chart this season. Their #2 for CF is Aoki, which isn't a bad choice at all, and Blanco is #4. Their #3 is Juan Perez, who wasn't very good at all offensively. He seems fine defensively through 62 games/280 innings (unless the beers are fucking up my math). This is honestly another fairly close one, I think. Aoki is great, and if he's their number two here and they shuffle the OF around I think they'll likely be okay, but while both teams have promise, they aren't superstars.\n\n• **RF** - Eat my ass. \"This is Josh Reddick's walk-up music, we're just listening to it.\" Herr herr herr. Honestly, I say I dislike this dude, but I don't think I actually do. I just think he's a dork, and that goes both ways with me. They're pretty close offensively--Pence has slightly higher BA and OBP, but higher GDP. Their WAR is virtually identical. Honestly, from a managing standpoint I'd say Reddick is the better option because you're getting similar players in terms of personality and playing ability, but one costs five times more than the other.\n\n• **BN** - Again, it's like two different people wrote this article. One person wants to get a good grade in the class because he's there for a degree requirement and the other doesn't care cause he's not footing the bill and his parents don't care.\n\n• **SPs** - Honestly, this is a little bit of a weird one. On one hand, this is gonna be Gray's third year and he's had more play time and a much larger role than Bumgarner did in his first two years, hands down. Even with this information, he's pretty close in a lot of aspects to Bumgarner's most recent MVP season. Obviously, this doesn't at all take into account any offensive stats (like that would even be a contest through divisions like that), but I'm 100% confident that Gray is gonna throw his nuts down on the table and let everybody take it in this season. I can't argue the guy didn't have a great season (and I don't like him either, he just looks slimy as fuck and rubs me the wrong way), but I think Gray's right on his heels.\n\nThe stat guy showed up again for the second slot. I think Kaz is great. He had some trouble at the end of the season, but who didn't, honestly? I'd still go Kaz here, just cause of how nasty he was at the first half and the general stat line being there.\n\nI love Huddy. Dude was there when I was coming up and I can't dislike the dude. But Chavez was *on* and out of nowhere. With more sharpening of that skinny Mexican blade, he's gonna do great things. Both of these guys had trouble in the back half with consistency, so it's a huge factor of what limitations will be imposed on them so they can be most effective.\n\nOur back end is *way* better. While a few guys haven't been around in a bit, I'd take that over Lincecum's steady decline (also, just wouldn't take Lincecum). \n\n**RP** - That Schoenfield is discounting the A's because Doolittle *might* miss the beginning of the season is pretty silly. Guys like Otero and Abad have held that shit down pretty consistently. I know the Giants had some issues in the pen with consistency last season, and I know we had a lot of hit and miss--but our closer was lights-out. I don't think this one is quite as close as it's implicated to be, but it's not a blowout either.\n\n**tl;dr, none of this shit matters because it's all 100% speculative opinion and hypothetical namedrop jerking**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423208023", "subreddit": "OaklandAthletics", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "We're trying to get a podcast/blog/photo site with a supporting Youtube channel.  My husband is a \"Youtuber\" and doing fairly well as it is with his existing channel, and I've worked in Social Media (Moderating, Marketing, and branding) for years, but always under the umbrella of a giant corporation or name that's already doing well.  \nOur biggest challenge has been traffic, or even getting our name out there.  As individuals that already how their names out there for something else, starting fresh (for various reasons *sad face*) and as an unknown is so difficult. We're trying to do this with a set, smaller budget, and it seems like either promoting yourself is against the rules on various outlets, or other places want you to pay.  In some cases these pay-to-promote sites actually violate Youtube policies when driving traffic/hits, so we would actually lose our Monetized Youtube channels...all of them.  \n\nTopics are super hard.  The media seems to be promoting \"Bucket List\" locations.  Which is great for when you want to daydream during your lunch at your crappy job while browsing Pinterest, but impossible to maintain steady traffic on a regular basis.\n\nSince my guy is all about the DIY, he's been coming up with DIY topics regarding travel.  it's a small audience so far, so SEO and targeting certain groups is essential.\n\nOur target group(s) (hopefully) are going to be families, and older travelers.  They seem to be the most loyal.  So we watch our language on our podcasts and blog posts, and we try to avoid overt political stuff (ex. \"Gas is low -Thanks Obama!\" \"Nobody can afford real travel these days because of politicians!\")....\n\nWe are also trying to hit an extremely varied audience, and that's super challenging.  We're going about our travel as van-dwellers and \"I Want Out\" types.  We want to see Roadside America (Rt 66 style).  So that's three different groups right there.

I will not release my username since it is completely fucked and i can never log in to it again. I have been an active member of this sub I remember when fucking Astro_ids got verified. I was a member of Ultimate.ph before this.  It was only this past year i started a pyramid of reselling.  Last month i made close to $8,500 from just reselling.  First, I was in it too help pay for college, then I got too cocky and I was stupid enough to accept orders over snap chat and had too many people working for me.  I was bound to be caught.  Earlier this week i got a phone call from one guy who had started reselling at a college (working for me) that he had a huge order (that i sent him) not arrive but instead got a slip that he had to sign for the package and that there was an attempted delivery.  I thought this is weird since i'm shipping two states away.  I told him to sign for it, its probably his dorm mail room being annoying with some policy. \n\n&gt; Yesterday, I was walking back to my dorm from classes and I had orders to send out. I get a text from a fellow student down the hall from me saying \"Run youre fuckd. Cops!!!!\" Oh shit, right then i became very light headed and sank to my hands and knees. I immediately called my roommate who was my first employ of the whole operation.  He doesn't really resell (Not to be mean but he had no friends to sell to) but instead he runs the tech/payments and automated the reselling business.  He leaves his class and meets me in near our dorm.  We try to be all stealthy and called a third close friend to come and help us.  We sent him towards our dorm and he comes back around five minutes later telling us that this shit is legit, and that there is one police van and two black SUV's with flashing lights.  This is where it all ends. We wiped and destroyed our laptops and destroyed our phones as securely as possible and disposed of them in a very secure location.  All the ids (around 200-300) were in a box in my dorm and all the mail labels were already printed. They had clients and resellers info.  I thought best to call a lawyer and ask for legal advice.  I called him on a pay phone and the firms secretary said they couldn't do shit unless i paid them.  I guess this was the time to say good buy to my free life. I couldn't run anywhere my cash was mostly BTC and the rest was in the dorm.  \n\n&gt; **I gave my roommate my car keys and told him to save himself and I told him how to access my \"stash\" of 30 BTC when he was safe.  I went back to the dorm and turned myself in.  They had a warrant. They had a court Subpoena to access my reddit account and reddit gave them everything.  I spent a night in jail which was the scariest moment of my life. My parents spent what they said was all of my inheritance on bailing me out.  I have court next week and the terms of my bail say i cannot leave my house.  My school news paper and everyone I know whats to know what happened.  I wanted to tell you guys that this OPSEC thing is not a joke. I will never be reselling again.  Fuck The FBI.  Thanks Obama. As for you buyers out there I am sure you are fine. The FBI is known to do shit like this were they take down big dogs in order to scare the little dogs out of the game.  I flew to close to the sun and my holos melted.

{"body": "stream-o'-semi-conscious comments:\n\n**Kate**:  Not surprised, just disappointed.  John helped me get lots of stuff done.  Speaks in the kind of practical language that I understand as a Gen Xer.\n\n**Maxine**:  \"Broken-hearted.\"  I guess I don't get this language, but then, I admittedly don't believe, contra Maxine, that there's a \"true\" church position available to be either acknowledged or ignored by any of the parties in all of this.  Churches, like cultures, are moving targets, and if we don't keep up, our interpretative frameworks become outmoded.  At this point, this is me editorializing rather than liveblogging what Maxine said.  All apologies, returning to the program now...\n\n**Paul**:  IANAL but it's clear out of the gate that we've got one on the panel today ;-) ... Listening to Paul, I'm reminded of the disconnect that made reasoning with Mormons during Prop 8 so tiresome:  unlike Paul, most folks don't have a clear grasp that *harm* has real heft when weighing fairness in policy discussions.\n\n**Maxine**:  \"Each excommunication is unique.\"  Not to be glib, but I suppose that aligns with a corollary belief that every mission calling is unique?  Beginning to think my resistance to understanding where Maxine is coming from is probably baked in and I should probably type about something else.\n\n**Paul**:  If it's opposition to the leadership driving the excommunication, the playbook is coming from the GA level.  \n\n**Kate**:  Sure, each situation is different but there are a lot of similarities.  Thoughtcrime discipline not so unique in how it manifests.  It's always about sacrificing conscience for badge of loyalty.\n\n**Maxine**:  Church is sincerely articulating where lines are in all of this.  Damn, I want some of what Max is smokin'.  Repudiate, denounce vs. personal expression.  It's déjà vu all over again, thanks Obama.  Apparently, holding a view is OK but Heaven forbid you ever popularize it... \n\n**Kate**:  What Chino just typed.  It's OK to have an opinion, just not a popular opinion.  Agrees with Paul's comparison to North Korea.  Speaking of which, anyone else get a chuckle from \"The Interview\"?  Still waiting to hear back from Sony on whether or not it's too soon to orchestrate a similar movie/hacking event in a Mormon context.  Anywho, it's not about Kate or John, it's about the vast numbers of Saints who are bothered by the same questions and concerns.  Church of England FTW?  \n\n**Paul**:  Apostasy charge hasn't changed over the years.  It's always in response to challenges to the LDS leadership.  The apostles own the mendacity, serve a corporate android, if they served God, would live in fear and trembling.  Always viewed church as earthly institution, trust in God keeps leadership's desperation in perspective.\n\n**Kate**:  Initially, excom was a shock, but really, these old farts don't control my happiness.  Authenticity rocks.  Apostates carry on living productive lives.\n\n**Maxine**:  Maybe it is.  I don't know.  Freedom to explore after my excom was a great journey.  The problem is that it puts tension between yourself and the community.  Socially it can be devastating.  So, I'm back in.  And forget Chino's snark about smokin', whatever's on the menu is obviously coming in pill form.\n\n**Paul**:  Whether it's lying for the Lord or lying for one's community, this doesn't end well unless you're true to your conscience.  \n\n**Kate**:  The process is opaque.  If we don't bring more light, leaders will continue to lie about it, as we've seen most recently in John's case.  In any case, the process is not scary.  Speak out.\n\n**Paul**:  There's no accountability without public expression of concerns and views.  If the belief is that the leadership is fallible, policies should reflect that belief.     \n\n**Maxine**:  The church gives wide latitude to public discussion.  Is excommunication a scare tactic?  Probably.  But we need it or we'd get out of line.  At the same time, we need Kate and Paul and we shouldn't be afraid to hear each other.  There's a profound purpose to what Kate and John do.  \n\n**Paul**:  Joseph Smith started the Restoration with a question.  By stifling discussion, the LDS leadership has put the Restoration project on ice.\n\n**Kate**:  In my case, I don't think the LDS leadership knows how to deal with women who don't kowtow.  That needs to change.  Think of a parent-child or other important relationship, and the importance of honest conversations.  Without those, the relationship cannot be healthy.  \n\n**Kate**:  No timeframe for appeal, First Presidency has it in hand, but they're not saying when it will be taken up.\n\nThanks for joining.  \n\n     \n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n        \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423740174", "subreddit": "mormon", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

As I'm sure you've experienced, just giving conservatives facts does not change their minds.  You have to reframe the issue, throw out conservative frames and language, and start over from scratch - start from a new angle.\n\nFor example, with your sister, if she starts going on about Obamacare, don't try to convince her that Obamacare is good or that it's not causing her problems.  Reframe.  An example might be:\n\n**Sister:**  Ah, Obamacare slashed the education budget, I can't afford to feed my kids, thanks Obama!\n\n**You:** Yeah, the government has its priorities mixed up.  Education is so important for the future of this country, and teachers like you are heroes and deserve to bring home good solid paychecks and lots of benefits. Did you know that * *insert Republican governor here* * just cut education funding in our state?  S/he's taking the hard work you do for granted, SMH.\n\nYou'll find that if you don't engage with Republican/Fox News talking points and instead reframe the debate in a direction that will appeal to your sister and her friends, you'll get sooooo much farther. :D  It's fun actually.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423783053", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Meanwhile, DOC is looking through a newspaper.\n\nDOC: This timeline is fascinating, Marty. I only wish we had more time to study it. Do you know that Americans elected a president named Barack Obama? A black president... named Obama! Maybe in this timeline, African names and culture have become trendy...\n\nMARTY: I dunno, Doc. This whole thing seems really strange to me. I just ran into Griff in the diner. I swear, I'm getting this odd sensation of deja vu. You know, it's like some things have really changed a lot, and others haven't changed at all. But I don't feel like we're any closer to figuring out what's going on.\n\nDOC: Marty, I think I may have come across the answer...\n\nDOC, whose expression has turned to one of dread, turns around the newspaper so MARTY can see what it says, as a soft rain begins to fall. In the newspaper is the obituary column, It reads: DOCTOR EMMET BROWN, respected scientist and celebrated philanthropist, has passed away this last Saturday, January 24, due to natural causes. He is survived by his two children. Funeral services are scheduled for 7PM on Thursday, January 29 at the Hill Valley Cemetary, where he is to be buried next to his beloved wife, Clara.\n\nEXT - HILL VALLEY CEMETARY - SUNSET (2015)\n\nVarious well-wishers dressed in black are huddled around the grave as the priest gives his sermon. In lowered voices, DOC and MARTY are talking from a safe distance away where people won't see them. MARTY looks confused, and DOC looks distracted.\n\nMARTY: I don't get it, Doc. I mean, I'm sorry you're... well...\n\nThere is an uncomfortable pause as the only sound to be heard is the soft rain and the muffled voice of the priest off in the background.\n\nMARTY: But... why would it cause the fabric of time to unravel?\n\nDOC: Where are they?\n\nMARTY: What? Doc? Are you listening?\n\nDOC: It doesn't make sense. The obituary said I was survived by two children, but I don't see my boys anywhere. I don't see you either, for that matter.\n\nMARTY: Look, Doc, I know this is all really heavy, but if we don't figure out what's going on, we're not gonna' survive into next *week*, let alone to 2015.\n\nDOC: And who are those girls over there without any parents? Did I volunteer at a school? Or donate to an orphanage?\n\nMARTY looks to where DOC is staring. Right near the coffin are two teenage girls, both dressed in black. One is crying uncontrollably, while the other just has a determined stare.\n\nPRIEST: And now, I want to offer others here a chance to speak on behalf of the departed. Would anyone like to say a few words in honor of Doctor Emmet Brown?\n\nThe PRIEST looks down at the two girls, and the one who was crying wipes her face and walks over to the podium the priest was speaking at. She is visibly putting an effort to control her tears as she speaks.\n\nGIRL: Doctor Emmet Brown... was a great man... but more than that... he was a wonderful, loving father. And he meant the world to my sister and I.\n\nDOC: What!?\n\nGIRL: I love him so much. And I am going to miss him terribly...\n\nPRIEST: That was lovely, dear. Shelly, would you like to say something?\n\nThe PRIEST is speaking to the other girl, also a teenager, but clearly  the younger of the two. She wears thick glasses, and has wild, unkempt black hair in contrast to her sister's well-maintained brown hair. The unkempt girl, SHELLY, crosses her arms, defiant.\n\nSHELLY: He's not dead.\n\nThe brown-haired girl speaks to her firmly but warmly, trying to calm her down\n\nGIRL: Shelly, come on. Dad wouldn't have wanted you to torture yourself like this.\n\nSHELLY: No, Mary! He's not dead! We can get him back!\n\nSHELLY storms off, with MARY following after her. The priest, slightly embarrassed, continues.\n\nPRIEST: Well, the passing on of a loved one can be difficult for anyone... Is there anyone else who would like to say a few words?\n\nDOC (quietly, to himself): Mary... Shelly... Great Scott!\n\nMARTY: Do you know those kids, Doc? What's going on here?\n\nDOC: Mary Shelly.\n\nMARTY: What?\n\nDOC: Clara and I both always wanted two children. We agreed that if they were boys, we'd name them after our favorite author, Jules Verne. If they were girls, we'd name them after our favorite female author, Mary Shelly.\n\nMARTY: So those are your kids?\n\nDOC: Yes. Or... they will be. Or they could be, in another reality.\n\nMARTY: So what do we do now?\n\nDOC: You mean what do *you* do?\n\nINT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\nMARTY is exasperatedly pleading with DOC, while DOC rummages through various pieces of luggage looking for supplies.\n\nMARTY: What? Doc, you can't give up on me now!\n\nDOC: I'm not giving up. Quite the opposite. Marty, it's too much of a coincidence that my death should come one week before a phenomenon that is ripping apart the fabric of the universe. I'm willing to bet that whatever is tearing time apart has *something* to do with my unfortunate demise. Whatever is going on, those two girls are the key. They seem to be the closest to me right now, so maybe one of them has some information about what's going on.\n\nMARTY: Okay, Doc. Well, they're your kids, so why don't *you* talk to them?\n\nDOC: That is the worst possible thing I could do right now, Marty. Don't you remember what happened the first time you traveled through time and spoke with your parents? Whatever is going on now is too important to risk a predestination paradox wherein I cause the very disaster I'm trying to prevent!\n\nMARTY: Well, why is it safe for me to do it and not you?\n\nDOC: If I had my say in the matter neither one of us would do *anything* in this timeline, but we need to do *something* to stop this disaster from occurring. And right now, I believe that me going to visit my daughters, one of whom thinks I'm dead and one of whom seems to think that I'm still alive right now, would be a surefire recipe for disaster.\n\nMARTY: Okay, fine, Doc. I'll do it. What am I doing, again?\n\nDOC: Tomorrow morning, go to their school, follow them around, talk to them. The closer you get to them, the closer *we* get to figuring out what is destroying time!\n\nMARTY: Okay, Doc. And... and what are you gonna' do?\n\nDOC: I'm going to conduct some research. There are some facts here that still aren't adding up. I'll meet with you after school, okay?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423939544", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Yeah. Typical \"thanks Obama\" cliched blaming. The country was \"stable\". After the Anbar awakening? Sure. For a minute. But we knew it wouldn't last. Part of what stabilized Iraq during the surge was that all of those neighborhoods that saw the heaviest ethnic fighting were cleansed along ethnic lines, thus removing the need to fight in the first place. The government was weak and corrupt and largely seen as a puppet to America. As soon as we pulled out we found out that the radicals were just biding their time and building up their power base. To no one's surprise. The same thing happened to Afghanistan after the Soviets left. The Taliban overran the country.\n\nBush fucked things up because he bought into every neo-conservative myth about what post-war Iraq would look like. That we would be greeted as liberators. That Iraq's oil would pay for the cost of the war and that it would pay for reconstruction. That we won't need a large military force and that peak troop levels of 187,000 in 2008 would've been enough. That their wouldn't be ethnic tensions. Etc etc etc.\n\nRomney wouldn't have done anything different than Obama. If you want to blame something blame modern American politics. What we would have needed is 500k-600k + ground force from the get go. We needed a more ruthless strategy to pacify the various provinces since those people only recognize strength.

{"body": "Humor is a weird thing.  It's culturally, age, and gender related, and so it's hard to come up with an explanation that is true in all cases as to what a group of people will find funny.\n\nHowever, one of the most common threads among all forms of humor is the violation of expectations of the world or society.  We expect a ladder to hold firm, when it breaks and someone falls, it's cheated our expectations.  When we're in a silent room and someone cracks a massively loud fart, it's once again unexpected AND socially taboo.  When Barak Obama lets out the curse \"Thanks, Obama\", we find the irony unexpected and giggle.\n\nThe level at which each age group finds certain unexpected elements funny usually deals with adherence to social or religious norms.  For instance, laughing at a situation where someone else is likely in pain appeals to most people, but as we age we tend to regard it as more 'serious', especially if things like that have happened to us or a loved one.  Farts and Butts tend to be social taboos and make adults squeemish, which is one of the reasons why preteens and early teens tend to find them really funny.  Irony and parody/satire (I'm not going to call it ridicule, that tends to offend people's morals because it changes the intent of parody/satire) tends to appeal to a more intellectual expectation of how the world or a situation is \"supposed\" to work, allowing the characters and situations to play out and fulfill our fantasies as to how we kind of want them to work, or explore avenues and extremes that aren't necessarily expected or plausible, but technically possible, and in that realm shed light on modern social issues.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423940588", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'd say that my world view changed long before #GamerGate appeared. There isn't a single event that made me totally a feminist, but after 2 years of reading a ton of stuff on the Internet and self-reflection, I pretty much invested myself into a lot of progressive causes.\n\nI've mentioned before that I was a 4chan regular who used to follow CWC back in the day. Never posted anything, but I lurked CWCki and /cwc/ on krapple/789chan. Considering that back then, I was a college student still trying to work through a huge load of shit (mainly my motivations for being a premed/bio major), yeah, I was a huge edgelord back then. So were many of my peers, though a lot of them also changed their ways, and they did help shape my views to some extent.\n\nI was also a huge follower of /r/TumblrInAction. What turned me away from the sub were posts that turned into huge debates about feminism--far before the sub became an anti-feminist circlejerk. I think it was an article about gay bars that made me throw up my hands and go, \"Fuck it, I'm done.\"\n\nIt still took me a while before I seriously thought about \"SJWs\" and who really uses Tumblr. The people who post things like \"first thing we do, let's kill all the cis white men\" are more likely to be teenagers trying to score \"feminism points.\" And of course, Jim Fucking Sterling, Son also confirmed for me that \"SJW\" = \"person I disagree with,\" and the term just lost its meaning from there.\n\nI think /r/circlebroke and its social justice cousin /r/openbroke definitely helped me open my mind to the problems with reddit and Internet society in general. And they say meta subs aren't constructive.\n\nIf anything, #GG has helped me to continue admitting that I like things that aren't totally good when it comes to gender representation. Things like moe anime, which is pandering to a hardcore audience in much the same way the triple-A game studios have, and still has a long way to go in terms of gender-related tropes. The constant fanservice is also a problem.\n\nDespite #GamerGate, I'm still gonna go out there and enjoy video games, YouTube (though mainly just corgi and Shiba Inu videos now), and reddit. If I ever have time (and a lack of student loan debt), I'll still go to PAX (despite Penny Arcade and its many controversies, I still think the comic has some insightful commentary).\n\nThanks Sarkeesian.

{"body": "k. I was there to play board games. our hillarious friend came along with some other people. They ate the pies. It was very dramatic. The advisor had just been given the job so was celebrating pretty hard. The first political thing was said by them and it was \"So, you must be one total greenie hippy who thinks all Liberals are scum huh?\"\n\nThis annoys me, as I'm sure there are people who look cool and vote for the Libs out there somewhere. \n\nAnyway, I said it was a party and we shouldn't argue politics, and that I was happy for their promotion. (I think maybe someone spilt a drink and I said \"thanks Tony\" like the \"thanks obama\" joke, that's the most I would have done.)\n\nThey reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally wanted to argue though, so I said they could ask me any politics question they wanted for the time it took to smoke one cigarette outside, but they had to agree not to interrupt while I was answering them. \n\nThe pies tasted really good. They were vegan, but there was some sort of textured protein that just rocked my little mind. \n\nWhen we went outside they started by saying Labour had ruined the economy, and I said \"that's odd, becuase they also won international awards, it seems like it's just the murdoch press that's been telling everyone Labour was bad at politics.\" \n\nThey called me a conspiracy theorist and I think the rest of it I've already written about. Only thing to add is that I hadn't said my view on the Liberal party at all, and only after being interrupted idk how many times said \"ok, you've done nothing but cut me off and respond with absolute non-sequiters. If this is indicative of how the Liberal party reasons then yes, I do have a problem with the Liberal party; you've done nothing but accuse me of things and haven't been able to hold a topic for more than two sentences, let alone respond to anything I've said.\" They walked off, I didn't really think anything of it, and later my friend (who was upset because it was *their pies* that got eaten, came and asked me what the hell I'd said to make the other person cry. \"Jesus christ WTSHD, I just had to spend 20 minutes talking that person down after whatever the hell you said to them.\" \n\nSo yeah. Hope you got your jollies out of that, I didn't want to make them cry, and maybe the thing I said was less harsh or shorter? Hope so. Later my pie-friend pointed out that it was probably just that they were drunk.\n\nOdd thing is though, this is two/two times I've had someone working for the Libs who were just dickheads right out of the starting blocks. \n\nI ran into one the other day and yeah, again they kicked it off with \"you just be a greenie who hates Liberals, right?\" which shits me up the wall, but anyhow, this one was working for immigration, specifically in policy. I figured that obvs that's exactly where you'd work if you wanted to make a positive change in the world, but they went straight to the above quote. So I ignored that and I said I was looking at applying for a job in one of the off-shore detention centers. \n\n\".... but I'm worried, you know, with the, um, conditions.\"\n\n\"Oh I'm sure you'll be paid fine for what you do.\"\n\n\"No, I mean the uh.. physical conditions for the...\"\n\n\"Look Naru's not as developed as Australia but it's fine.\"\n\n\"No, I mean in the centre itself.\"\n\n\"Yes, Naru is a bit rougher than Australia.\"\n\n\"I mean it would suck if I was there to do my job x but in doing so had to ignore bigger issues, you know? Like what if I'm there do teach a bongo lesson or whatever, but the toilets are overflowing?\"\n\n\"Naru isn't as developed as Australia but they do have plumbing.\"\n\n\"I mean in the centre! That the conditions for refugees is not good!\"\n\n\"What? No. It's fine. There is no hardship in those centers.\"\n\nAnd then they asked me about my job, which I guess I've already said in other places but I'm worried about doxi dox, and I said I was in a management position and they said \"Why? What? No, there is no management needed in your field. There is only the direct work you do; there would be no reason to organise or plan anything.\" \n\nWhat a jerk. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423997570", "subreddit": "GamerGhazi", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I spent the last decade in Los Angeles, living just on the eastern side of Hollywood. I was inundated with noise and nightlife, and shmoozing... oh, so much shmoozing. But, much like you, every weekend was a rush to get out into nature. Just to get back in touch with the appreciation of simply existing on this organic rock hurtling through the infinite cosmos that has just so happened to have sprouted life somehow. Trees. I fucking missed the trees. After losing a great job (thanks Obama!! /s ) my last year and half there was spent detrimentally underemployed, and through a series of unfortunate events... without a car. Now, despite popular opinion, the transit system in LA is actually not completely horrid. There really are bus stops and subway/rail stations everywhere, from Burbank to Long Beach and everywhere in between. Sure, my schedule was now dictated by busses stuck in LA traffic, but I could still get around relatively well.\n\nBut I couldn't get out. I was imprisoned by concrete and billboards, caught in the air pollution, the light pollution, the noise pollution, and the thought pollution. And, due to lack of funds, all the socializing and interacting became embarrassingly unaffordable to the point where I much preferred staying in than scraping together $8 to go get one beer with a friend. \"Let me but you a beer\" becomes a painful phrase to endure when it's been heard too often.\n\nAlthough I don't know that I would've willingly chosen it under any other circumstances, I actually grew to enjoy the isolation. Even when I did get some extra cash here and there, I preferred staying in now, regardless of my financial situation.  I would still enjoy dinner or drinks and a hangout at a friend's house, but my desire for bars or shows or nightlife... it was gone, and I didn't miss it at all. \n\nI was still stuck though. Consistent distraction and chaotic interactions from the city streets and crowded busses, even just to get to the store and back, with no way to escape to the hills, no camping, no kayaks on the lake, no hikes... none of my places of peace and silence. \n\nIt was weighing me further and further down, so I had to leave. Instead of paying rent one month, I bought a plane ticket, moved out, and buggered off on an adventure to the east coast (I have family there). I landed a low skill job and stayed with family and friends until I bought a cheap ass car and had what I arbitrarily called \"two months salary\" saved up, then I drove to the Pacific Northwest to crash with a friend and sold the car, grateful it had made it across the country. For the past year, I've been living in the middle of the city, but a 45 minute bus ride takes me out to total isolation, and the most beautiful hiking trails with more trees than I could ever need to see. I can walk to a lake and rent a kayak. \n\nBut I still landed in the noise. So next week, I'm moving out into the woods, only 15 miles from the city, to see how I like flipping the program. \n\nInstead of escaping from the city into nature, what happens if I exist in nature, and come in to the city? I'll have to check back in a month or two and let you know if I've found an answer to that question.\n\nI guess, for now, my suggestion (if I may offer one) is that if you're thinking of making a leap out of city life and relocating yourself, choose a location that can easily offer you both sides of the duality you're longing for. All the 80 year olds I've talked to seem to echo the sentiment, in their own unique way, that you'll really only regret the things that you didn't do. Put yourself in a position that both lifestyles can be available to you, and don't resign yourself to feeling like you absolutely have to choose one or the other.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424113605", "subreddit": "Existentialism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Boomers believe in their soul, they can have their cake and they deserve to eat it. And they have the votes to enforce their entitlement. As youngsters they succeeded with Marxist reforms in the US; Medicare et al. They have funded expansion at first through growth in the 60's and 70's and later through debt 70's and on. They preached to me, a Gen X'er, the virtue and righteousness of redistributing other people's money. Many of my fellows and our younger sibs Gen Y's ate this story up. (Thanks Obamacare). While they all thought they were playing Robin Hood, taking from the rich and giving to the poor; in reality they were taking from milleneals and the unborn to aggrandise themselves and some perverse idea about how scarce resources are to be distributed. Principally by political fiat and money market subtrefuge.\n\nLook the market is up double or treble. Therefore we are justified in our policy!\n\nNo its not. You just increased the money supply and bought the market. Enriching the 0.01%, giving free shit to the poorest 50%, and impoverishing all of us. But the worst of it is burdening the unborn with debts in which they had no vote. \n\nTyranny: is taxation without representation. This tyranny has been going on for some time. I myself had no say in Social Security (my grand parents ponzi) and no say in medicare (my parents ponzi) Obamacare is mine to own.\n\nNow while I was raised on the prudence of Marxism, I am raising my own on its record of perversion. I believe I am not alone. It is my son's generation which will rise up against my own to revolt against this present State of social contracts. Boomers power will then have faded.

Who has an easier chance to improve their status, simply by marrying into a higher class?\n\nBut yeah, across the board, men always have it better *just because* they're men.\n\nAs an interesting anecdote, a while back a Trans man posted his story here on Reddit.  He talked about the shock of how different it was, and mentioned that after living as a man for a while, they discovered that they actually had it *a lot* easier as a woman in society. \n\nHe also said he missed the niceties of being a woman, such as random compliments, even from strangers, that were no longer coming, although he really hadn't liked that before.\n\nSociety has much different expectations of men that you don't realize until you become one (it appears), so it really pisses us off when Internet feminists act like it's all champagne and roses. That we're all *so* privileged, and that's why they're always trying to knock us down a few pegs. Hardly.\n\nI wish that was all it took. I still haven't gotten my privilege card in the mail.

The people who voted on the stories?\n\n&gt;Over a 105 million Americans cannot afford the Obamacare, which is technically called the Affordable Care Act.\n\n[Citation required] A collection of anecdotes from a small segment of the population is hardly a proper study. Nor do we have any evidence to support the veracity of folks' claims. Remember when the Crimean secession vote took place and [Russia was sending out waves of sockpuppets](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/russias-online-comment-propaganda-army/280432/)? Hell, even [private industry uses sock puppets](http://androidtechy.com/index.php/8-tech-news/24-heather.html), so we really have no proof that these are all \"true\" stories. And all the comments aren't even stories, as most of the 694 comments are people hurling epithets, making jokes about the rhetoric, and advocating for fully socialized healthcare.\n\nAnd that's one small part of the article, so it's hardly a refutation of the whole thing.\n\n&gt;Hopefully the NP link works.

One day I will move there because I love the Japanese culture. I love the food too. Did I mention that I love their culture? I really do!\" That's how it its. In Japan itself you rarely see any of these Westerners outside of Akihabara because they get to see the real racist, dirty and unfriendly Japan and fly back to the US crying. Actually I think they would be harmless for the country compared to all those expats and English teacher that have infested East Asia. In a few years you will see the same thing that happened to SEA happen to East Asia. White dudes taking the women away because they have some kind of Asian fetish or are outsiders at home. That's when the Japanese etc. will show their real face and finally beat you out of their country for destroying their culture (like it already happened in Korea and Taiwan).

They have already become lighter since the insertion but still untimely.\n\nYou have to remember to reach inside and check the string once in a while. Not a big hassle, but this was my one peeve. I'm very paranoid about it moving, but so far no issues, and I do lots of running, situps, etc. Still hasn't moved.\n\nMirena and other IUDS have been on the market for years. Overall it's a pretty safe contraceptive, even when compared to pills. It lasts 5 years and you don't worry about it.\n\nIf you're in America, another benefit is that it still grants protection from pregnancy  even if you don't have insurance, unlike you paying out of pocket for pills. Mirena insertions are covered by a lot of insurances (Thanks Obama!).\n\nYou will hear horror stories about how someone's IUD pushed through their uterine wall and went for a roam, and frankly, that's a good question for your gyno.

{"body": "A) Systems fail.  Human error. For example - right now on the east coast of the US there are countless residential apartment buildings that use CPVC pipe that are completely *shut down* with the building management running a \"fire watch\" (once an hour walk the building and look for a fire) because pipes froze, broke, and CPVC requires a 24-hour drying period (for the glue) before you put water back on the systems.  I know this because I work in that industry and have been dealing with sites like this all week thanks to the single digit temperatures (Thanks Obama).\n\nSimilarly, from my experience, I've encountered shady hotel managers, shady property managers, and over-confident site engineers who all think of themselves as experts.  They get a problem, they close the control valve, then they go resistor out the tamper switch so their FACP stops beeping.  Seriously... fuck those guys.  They know just enough to put a LOT of people in danger, but not enough to realize what they're doing.  I see sites sabotaging their own protection systems every day.  \n\nThere's no guarantee an unscrupulous or plain old ignorant site engineer hasn't shut a system down for whatever reason.\n\n\nB) That's just silly.\n\nC) That's reassuring that there's at least a fire alarm notification system.  But again refer to A. They could have silenced the panel, disabled points, or even powered down the whole fucking thing because those frequent nuisance alarms were annoying.  I've seen it happen more times than I care to admit.  \n\nI am incredibly interested in what the official reports end up being for this.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424480062", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 46, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It sounds like you're a fellow Korean, and as a fellow Korean, I feel you.\n\nI was a monster of a kid. I went to four different colleges, I failed at most of my ventures, I'm making less than half what most my peers around here at my age, the only reason I have medical coverage is because of the Affordable Health Care Act (THANKS OBAMA!), and my parents constantly lie about me when talking to their friends because, as much as I know they love me, I know they secretly are ashamed of me, as well.\n\nBut I also know a friend, same age as me, who has been a home owner since her mid 20s and is making ridiculous loads of money at Goldman Sachs. Her Facebook page is filled with glamorous photos of her on rented yachts, Tahitian beaches, nights by the Eiffel Tower, camel rides by the Pyramids of Giza, and pretty much everywhere else that anyone has ever dreamed of visiting.\n\nThe last time we met up, she told me that couldn't wait to be laid off from her job.\n\nAs much as I love my line of work (and I do), I'd be a liar if I said I never feel the pressure of being a big earner. It's impossible not to in my area, and it seems like it's impossible in yours, too. That's just how the cookie crumbles when you grow up in Korean American neighborhoods. But I know that somewhere deep down inside, my parents take solace in the fact that they sacrificed for me so that I could live the life that I wanted.\n\nHave you tried speaking to your parents about this? If you haven't, it might be worth trying. If you tell them about all the abuse you've been receiving from extended family and how this has been making you feel, and you tell it to them raw without bothering to filter your emotions for the sake of face, their answers may surprise you.\n\nAbout five years ago, I laid everything out to my parents: all the bullying I had to go through, the effect that their constant shaming had on my ego, my constant thoughts of suicide throughout childhood, the knife I brought to school once because I had planned on killing a few of the classmates who bullied me especially hard, all of it. Towards the end of middle school, my grades started dropping because I went to a racist school. My parents never sued or tried to talk to me. They just shuffled me to different schools, one more racist than the other, thinking that this would magically \"fix\" me.\n\nMy dad just stood there like a statue while my mom was sobbing her eyes out. I had told them all this because I was moving out and I never expected to talk to them again. Then the next day, my mom told me that my father's childhood dream was to become a stand-up comedian. In fact, she told me he even used to do stand-up in college.\n\nI was totally floored. What the FUCK? Then I found out his dad ran out on him soon after he was born (I never knew this -- my parents always told me he died early), he essentially grew up alone (my grandmother put him up at an apartment in a different town), and he never got to pursue his dreams because his mother forced him to become a teacher. The first independent decision he made was to immigrate to America, and even then, his mother gave him hell for it.\n\nI'm glad to see some posts of solidarity here. I'm adding myself into that crowd and if you ever need to vent about it, I am more than happy to through PM cause believe me sister, I know the struggle. But if you haven't already, considering talking to your parents. It may be scary and super awkward but it can be so worth it. The catharsis you get from it may be just the affirmation you need.\n\nAfter that talk with my parents, things are a lot better now. We still have our occasional fights. After all, they're Korean. The day they stop worrying about money is the day I'll be praying over their tombstones, hopefully surrounded by a wife and kids of my own. But now they ultimately support everything that I do, even though the career path I've chosen is not very lucrative.\n\nVent however much you want. We're here for you. But more importantly, your parents are there for you, too, even if they may not realize it themselves. The weird thing about Asian American relationships is that sometimes we're the ones playing the parent figures. I had to translate for my parents all the time when dealing with lawyers, plumbers, teachers, etc. I'm sure you know the feeling, too. Sometimes, in order to get our parents to be parents, we have to be the ones to initiate that awkward conversation.\n\nIt's okay for you to feel hurt and be angry because what happened to you is absolutely not cool. Materialism in the Korean American culture *does* exist and it *is* terrible, don't let anyone tell you different. But like hothotsauce said, you're not alone.

{"body": "(Pissed i typed up a whole thing and right clicked to correct the spelling and it brought me to the front page. Thanks, Obama.)\n\nI agree that contracts are important, and should be respected. Azubu owns any thing that Faker streams that he owns. He owns his voice, image, commentary, etc. Literally every single aspect of the steam besides the gameplay. \n\nSo i'm aware there is a Korea company/entity called Kespo (or something like that) that controls all Korean teams. They made a contract with Azubu. All professional Korean players that stream must do so through Azubu and no other streaming service. Apparently the way Kespo handles things is part of the reason so many Korean players left to go to EU/NA/China. I'm not really in touch with how those things work though, so i wont' pretend that i do. What i just stated was all second hand info. \n\nI do not think there is anything stopping Twtich/Azubu or other streaming services from just making a bot like Lucian did to spectate any player within actual input from them. I agree that in most cases this would be less popular, but since a lot of the foreign players do not speak much in the streams it is not like much is being lost. This is especially true if the audience is only made of English speakers. \n\nAs of right now all of our game play and such is public, but owned by Riot. Anyone can access non-tournament games through third party sites or the League client itself with the tools provided by Riot themselves. I think they may want to add something to the ToS that is only in relation to professional players. I would be fine with having some clause that said we could not steam professional player's video if they themselves were streaming it somewhere else or w/e...its just it is NOT like that now. There is also the issue that one person cannot own/claim a game that takes place with 9 other people. I don't think anyone would really care, but its not an issue that can really be ignored legally. \n\nPerhaps this will all move along since SKT officially asked for the stream to stop.

He's an actual nice guy, I was a self-proclaimed (ok not just self proclaimed) asshole. He was slightly more fit, and a much better person. \n\nI had fun, he's still a virgin. This guy had an obvious crush on my girl at the time, and everybody warned me about him. Funny thing was that this was before RP and I didn't even consider him a threat. He was a non-sexual entity before I even knew what a beta orbiter was. As TRP put it \"He might as well have a vagina \" https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2wtv0r/i_dont_even_think_of_him_as_a_guy_he_might_as/\n\nDon't get me wrong, I was never and probably will never be \"alpha as fuck\" I had my share of insecurities and fears..... just not from this guy. \n\nThis guy was just a better human being than I was. I fought my girl's brother, he paid for his lunch. I was working on LMR in secluded places, he paid for a girl's prom and took her dancing because she couldn't afford it. His life is a series of good deed after good deed. Did it get him laid? Naw. It benefited the people around him but nobody ever gave back to him.  \n\nRed Pill is about expression of value, and I feel that had he learned how to express value, had he learned how to insist, how to cut off the tap of generosity, that had he learned of the true nature of people he might have been as successful if not more than I. \n\nBut he didn't he was nice. Except being nice doesn't equate into getting laid. \n\nBlue Pill slogans may help you become a more \"moral\" person, but they're no sexual strategy. \n\nEven our undecided can agree that RP typically offers more to the butt ugly and the fucked up socially than BP does since it makes sexual relationships their main focus. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424739738", "subreddit": "PurplePillDebate", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Yep, must be his greedy ass influencing politics for his own self-interest.\n\n\n* Obama is a hypocrite for calling out congress for doing nothing all these years and then vetoing this!--Yes, filibustering more than any congress in history, christmas treeing legislation with unacceptable provisions, or even refusing to genuinely come together to compromise is exactly the same as vetoing this bill. (a bill that a historic number of environmentalists rallied in front of the white house to voice their opposition of .)\n\n\n* Obama is obviously against jobs, thats why he killed this.--If this GOP was really about domestic jobs and the future of the US economy, why do they not support domestic education or curb on outsourcing?  They are actually as a result semi-encouraging companies to invest abroad/outsource to nationals of competing Great Powers of China and India.  \n\n\n* Gas prices are going to go back up, thanks Obama.--Gas prices are already going back up, and the whole reason they went down was OPEC (the Saudis) were making it do so.

{"body": "&gt; Every response was the same- so they could get into Heroic Highmaul. \n\nI think that is general Problem that PvE players are forced to do PvP and vice-versa. From the PvE Perspective, you had to cap conquest before Raids opened and some weeks after even as a Hardcore Raider. And as a Casual/Alt PvP was even the best source of PvE gear. For Example, the new Patch 6.1 upgraded Challenge Mode rewards, and introduced a new daily quest to award 655 gear. Thanks Obama, but 660 PvP Items are still better ilvl than the PvE rewards. It is also easier to purchase some Arena boosts than trying to acquire Raidfinder set (2 of 4 wings open atm while you could get 660 stacked form playing PvP)\n\n\nThis goes the other way, too: PvP Items are 690 in combat but PvE gear goes up to 695, with chance to be 701, have extra Gem Socket and Bonus Stats such as Speed or Lifeleech. The Legend Ring is ilvl 710 even.\n\nHas been that way ever since I started playing in cata (pvp gear 390 vs. PvE 410 Trinkets/416 Weapons, with OP special Effects)\n\nOr in Mists Timeless Isle the Raiders could get 588 ilvl and stomp PvPers who had 550 gear. The additional PvP Power/Resilience did not even come halfway to compensate the ilvl difference.\n\n\nI get the Design philosophy that WoW is a single game and players are supposed to have a step in both - pve and pvp - regardless of what type they prefer but it is terribad that doing one of those awards the best potency increase in the other.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424907151", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Look deeper. The core of Sesame Street lies with Bert and Ernie. In an impoverished apartment, they cope with their addictions and abusive homosexual relationship. Sesame Street is their story, told through vivid hallucinations and metaphor. The recurring Big Bird is their inner child, a repressed part of Bert (who also happens to be yellow) yearning for companionship. Big Bird wants to learn, and grow, and fly. He is big because Bert perceives him as big when the rest of the world makes him feel small. \n\nIn a similar vein, Ernie was always perceived as an innocent goodie two shoes growing up. This lead to extensive partying, sex, and drug abuse. Elmo (similar in coloration) represents Ernie's wild side. Unassumingly innocent, Ernie becomes \"Elmo\" when he wants to break free of the depression surrounding his otherwise gloom filled life.\n\nYou may notice Bert and Ernie represent two of the three primary colors. The third primary color, blue, is present as the Cookie Monster. His color and name are no accident. Blue represents the color of Bert and Ernie's despair. The cookies in this case are whatever high the couple are chasing: sex, drugs, anything that makes them feel happy. They devour their hedonism like a child devours cookies. The Cookie Monster is a solemn reminder that the two are slaves to their compulsions.\n\nOther minor characters are simply projected delusions Bert and Ernie come across. The Count is depicted as an obsessive compulsive vampire, perhaps a friend of our main characters who has also succumbed to mental illness. He spends his days in an abandoned warehouse counting, oblivious to the outside world. Oscar the Grouch is clearly a metaphor for the myriad of homeless Bert and Ernie are exposed to. He is depicted as a grouchy \"other\" suggesting the cognitive dissonance and sheer delusion Bert and Ernie share separating themselves from other homeless. \n\nAnd of course Grover represents Obama.

{"body": "Health insurance agent here. Had to create an account because I feel like there is too much misinformation about health insurance in this sub.\nThe guy above is 95% correct and understands it all really good for not being in the business of it. The only thing to note is that the premium (amount you pay per month) is set by the employer. An HSA plan could be $20/month like in his example or it could be $0, $50, $100; a co-pay plan COULD be cheaper for you because the employer wants you to choose it or it could be more expensive for you because the plans themselves are more expensive. Tough part about looking for a job is that employers don't advertise how much the benefits plans cost even though it's a big part of your total compensation. Something you need to ask about in the interview.\nNow to answer your question. You would absolutely use the money in your HSA to pay the $2250. This would be money that you never get taxed on which is why it is beneficial to fund your HSA account - a guaranteed return of whatever tax bracket you sit in. After the deductible ($2250) is met,you and the plan split costs up to the out of pocket max. This is called the copay and is a % of costs. Don't get this \"copay\" confused with a copay plan (aka - HMO or PPO) which assigns a $ value to doc visits, prescriptions and ER visits and calls it a copay. All plans will have an out of pocket max. The highest these can go is $6600 for an individual plan which means you'll never spend more than $6600 on health bills in a calendar year now - literal thanks Obama. Some employers will decide to spend more money to make the out of pocket max lower which means a better health insurance plan for you. And if you don't have enough $$ in the HSA then yes - you would receive a bill for the rest.

{"body": "He didn't start the funding. Funding happened before the merc army was being built. \n\nWhen Reagan got office he went really big with his opportunity to commit another proxy war against Soviets so he went kinda crazy and started that massive merc army, the estimation of that army were 40,000 to 100,000 fighters. The craziest mother fuckers you could find anywhere, all extremists and nicely packed together. Getting introduced to each other and forming ever lasting ties.\n\nSome of those mercs were sent in to hurt Soviets in Afghanistan. Some of them were sent in straight to Moscow to commit terror. And some of that merc army was the initial beginning of Taliban and Al Qaeda. Eventually they lost control of those crazies and the rest is history.\n\nAfter the war, some of them went to Balkans, some of them went to Chechen and some of them joined Taliban and some of them joined OBL. They were dieing out so to speak after the war as there weren't more atrocities committed by the west to feed from, but that problem was solved thanks to US sledgehammer. Thanks Clinton, thanks 2x Bush and thanks Obama. Only difference between Bush and Obama is that Bush tried to capture and torture people while Obama takes no prisoners aka is on a killing spree.\n\nAnd to this day, the same mercs are causing trouble all over the place.

Well, neither the clinic I went to before I got insurance (thanks Obama!) nor my new regular doctor ever once actually felt of it, jut meds and off you go. My Endocrinologist though, the very first visit to him, he bothered to feel of it. Then he made a funny face and kept feeling. Well, he felt something, so he ordered an ultrasound. Apparently they found a couple of lumps, so a biopsy was ordered. As it turns out, I didn't need one just yet? But the 10th of March I go in for a checkup and another ultrasound, and if they've grown, then I'll get that biopsy done. My aunt had thyroid cancer and had her's removed. So...if it does turn out to be that,  I'll face it then, just like I've faced myself.\n\nIts funny, one of the major things that pushed me over the edge of fear and to transition was my fear of dying as someone I never wanted to be. So instead of dying as him, I'm living as myself, finally. And if it does turn out to be cancer, then I'll face that too and kick its ass.

{"body": "\" It is important to draw the distinction between regulation of the Internet, and regulation of *carriers*.\" - Dane Jasper, CEO of SonicNet\n\nFirstly, what precisely do you mean by \"outlawing interconnects\"? In the context of the FCC ruling, the phrase has no meaning.\n\nSecondly, you're being alarmist. Cloud storage, data mangement, web optimization and other such services will not be affected by net neutrality regulation; content providers, ISPs, data handlers and storage facilities will *always* be interested in attaining digital efficiencies, because creating, transmitting and storing more data costs more money for both infrastructure and operations, however you look at it. \n\nThirdly, all those companies you listed should not have to rely on an arbitrary *toll* on data at the hands of crooked ISPs to create an artifical demand for their services. Their products and techniques should be both desirable and economicially viable on their own, without having to lean on the crutch of illegal and anticompetitive ISP behaviour in order to stand upright. Now that the crutch is to be removed, if they fall, it means the company had a dysfunctional business model to begin with, one so broken they were incapable of changing it, and they should rightfully sink without a trace.\n\nFourthly, the *only* institutions that will be detrimentally affected are those ISPs who have been illegally charging for both sides of data transactions, and/or indulging in anticompetitive behavior by not treating all data equally - like discounting their own data streams, and deliberately blocking or throttling those of their competitors. \n\nFifthly, [if the affected ISPs hadn't decided to go crooked and indulge in such anticompetitive practises in the first place, additional FCC regulation wouldn't have been necessary](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Sonic-CEO-I-Welcome-Being-Regulated-As-A-Common-Carrier-132800).

{"body": "I have to admit I am ambivalent about this. I am wallowing in student loan debt I can never pay (and don't/won't), but I knew what the risks were going in. The (at that time) state university I attended required anyone taking out a StuLoan to attend a briefing which discussed default, interest rates, etc., *before* signing loan papers. These new \"instant degree\" colleges don't do that, for obvious reasons. I think they are no better than payday-loan companies.\n\nThe ambivalence comes in because there has been screaming for quite a few years about this problem. Obama has already passed a bill about [forgiveness after 25 years](http://www.finaid.org/loans/ibr.phtml) (woo, thanks Obama) but the point is the information has been out there that you're gonna get fucked hard and long over student loans, no matter what college you attend. So who is responsible? \n\nYes, the for-pay colleges are unethical. Yes, we make our own decisions about what debt we take on. If we don't listen to the people yelling about the debt load they have from years past, we are no better off than people who continue to repeat the mistakes that should have been learned from history, and with the internet and the amount of time we spend on it, and the information readily available to us, we shouldn't BE repeating mistakes.
