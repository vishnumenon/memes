This show has always confined itself to this weird format of giving the characters context *after* their establishment, but the finale this week definitely pulled a lot of weight. I think the performance was something that perfectly captured the youth and free-spirited ambition at this show's core. It can feel like it gets a bit muddled with some uninspiring character work, but it's a show that really knows how to let loose when it wants to. \n\nIt also likes its small asides! Stuff like how they showed the guy giving Misa a replacement pick in the middle of Mamechiyo's breakdown, or during the performance when they briefly show her mother looking back and smiling - it's stuff that I always like to see because it can add a whole bunch of extra nuance to an otherwise already compelling scene. The one that always comes to my mind is Keima sitting on the rooftop from the last episode of The World God Only Knows: Goddesses.

We're good.* Taylor turned round and grabbed the door handle; it didn't turn. They tried again, no success. About to reach for the keychain on the edge of the desk, Taylor realized his door doesn't have a lock. Panic settles in as Taylor's eyes grow wide, palms grow wet, and mouth falls slightly agape. *No. It can't be.* They dove back to their desk and flipped through the papers of column proposals from the last week. There it was, 'On Wednesday, all the doors will shut forever'. Taylor had laughed at such a proposal, but checking the time, they noticed that the clock had just passed 10:45. Checking the sheet, it also said 10:45.\n\n----\n\nAs 11:30 rolled around, Taylor had been on and off the phone with the White House Chief of Staff, the Police, the website's editors, and a contact at the United Nations. Everywhere. *Everywhere.* Doors were shut and windows were unbreakable. Taylor had thrown their chair at the window and had several half-Portuguese shouting conversation with Anthony before they both realized the phones still worked. Taylor sat at their desk, twiddling thumbs, brimming with confusion and excitement. *What does this mean for the world? People will surely starve.* Taylor logged in to the website's executive domain from the password he got the Editor-in-Chief after their rendezvous last Friday night. Deleting everything off the website, Taylor wrote one simple message: 'Doors are shut. Windows are unbreakable. Life may \n\nAt that moment, Taylor realized they hadn't really inhaled in awhile. They looked up and realized Anthony had collapsed to the floor. *The air is trapped too.* Taylor's abundance of plants must have given them a few extra minutes. Taylor had to finish the message. 'Life may be over for anyone not outdoors.' And with those words, Taylor stood and ran, banging on the glass as hard as possible, trying not to scream to save air, but only able to stifle the rage and fear. Taylor turned around and slid with their back against the window, down to the floor. *I guess this is it then.* As Taylor felt their body fade away, suddenly, the air in the room came to life, the window shattered, the doorknob turned and opened. Over a speaker system the building didn't have, the message came across quite clearly: 'This was a test of the Emergency Disease Lockdown System. This was only a test. If you don't want this to actually happen, please vaccinate your children against all diseases for which we currently have vaccines.'

Now I'm just critical everywhere.)\n\nWe've had a conservative party in control for the better part of a decade. Much of that was a Christian party and Libertarian-ish party in coalition. Now the Libertarian-ish party is basically dead because an even further right-populist, anti-immigrant, anti-EU party has been stealing many of its members. They've also been absorbing members from our actual neo-Nazi parties who want to change their image up. We have a number of left-er parties, but they're not likely to take charge of parliament anytime soon, and some of them are pretty out-there themselves. The Left party has some pretty vocal Russophiles from back in the old days, for instance.\n\nWe have mandatory church taxes. The state collects tithes on behalf of the churches. If you were baptized as a baby, you have to go to court and pay to get out of this later in life.\n\nBirth control isn't free even for the insured. (Cheaper and better access in the US--thanks, Obama.) Nor is insurance a single-payer state system like in Canada or the UK; it's the shared responsibility of employers and the insured, also like in America.\n\nNo gay marriage (freaking Alabama has beaten us to it!), and the Christian Democrats refuge to budge on the issue even though the Supreme Court has said they must.\n\nWe didn't have a minimum wage until just this year, and the one we've got has all kinds of exceptions and is still tied up in parliamentary debate by conservatives who want to scrap the whole thing, a lot like Obamacare.\n\nEducation is in a downward spiral of grade inflation, high-stakes testing, underfunding, and utter disrespect for teachers. There's actually a strike beginning in Berlin tomorrow about this.\n\nI'm very obviously nitpicking negative aspects as illustrative because I also had very rose-colored glasses about the political situation before I moved here.

{"body": "\n**OK THIS IS AWESOME** I have been thinking that something like this would be fun to do.  However, I am too lazy to do it.  I am glad there is someone out there that has initiative.  \n\nAnyway, this be a short passage, and so I will navigate it line-by-line…Ahoy, there be problems ahead.\n\n\n\n&gt;From his right, that soft sound again, falling clumps of snow. \n\nWell, I haven't read anything that comes before this.  But King *did* use the word “again.”  So I am going to go ahead and assume that it was already explained that the “soft sound” was “falling clumps of snow.”\n\nYeah…and you know what?  Once I am told what is making a “soft sound” I don’t need to be told again.  \n\nBut I am making an assumption.  And you know what they say about assumptions: “When you assume, then Stephen King wrote something that is bad.”\n\n&gt;He looked over and saw the other two loions, \n\nLook, I know that Stephen Kings writes horror, and *sometimes* strange things happen in horror, but in general *people only see things when they are looking at them.*  You know?  Like, maybe we don’t need to be told that he ‘looked over?’  Maybe… just maybe… the reader can be trusted to work out that he was looking at the thing that he saw?\n\nOr maybe Mr. King's intended readers are aliens from the planet Zlob, who *only* ever see things they are not looking at.\n\nOr it was a Busch-league mistake.  \n\nYou can decide.  \n\n\n&gt;clear of snow now down to their forepaws, side by side, about sixty paces away. The green indentations that were their eyes were fixed on him. \n\nReally?  You can’t just say “their eyes were fixed on him?”  And do lions really have green eyes?   Or is it only *loions*?  Also, if I am going to be freaked out about lions, I am, most decidedly, *not* going to be trying to determine their eye color.  I am going to be wondering if their teeth are really as large as they look.  I mean, I am not worried about them ripping my jugular out with their *eyes.*  They aren’t my ex wife, for Christ's sake.  \n\n&gt;The dog had turned its head.\n\nOh did he?  Great.  Thanks for that bit of critical knowledge, *Stephen King*.  Because I was totally concerned with whether or not the dog’s neck was still working.\n\nHey, while you are going out of your way to note all the muscle movements that the dog is undergoing, perhaps you could also let me know if he was looking where his head was turned?  No?  I guess only humans get that level of treatment?  \n\nStephen King: Specieist.\n\n\n\n&gt;(It only happens when you're not looking.)\n\n*OH HEY GUYS, NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING TO USE ITALICS TO INDICATE THOUGHT, WE WILL USE PARENTHASES TOO!*\n\nAwesome!  I mean, there is certainly no way that the reader could be trusted to catch onto the *either individual convention – which is totally standard in literature.*  Nope, we are going to use *both.*  Because we can.  \n\nThanks Obama.\n\n&gt;\"Oh! Hey-\"  \n&gt;His snowshoes had crossed and he plunged forward into the snow, arms waving uselessly. More snow got inside his hood and down his neck and into the tops of his boots. He struggled out of the snow and tried to get the snowshoes under him, heart hammering crazily now.\n\nHow was it hammering?  \n\nThe problem with this adverb is that it adds *nothing* to the metaphor.  If you tell someone your heart is “hammering” they are going to have the same image as if you told them it was “hammering crazily.”\n\nThe presence of this adverb is an indication that King is too famous to listen to his editor.\n\n&gt;(Secret Agent Man remember you're the Secret Agent)\n\n*WAIT, IS HE THINKING AGAIN?????? I CAN’T TELL!!!!11  MAYBE YOU SHOULD ADD “HE THOUGHT” AFTER, JUST TO BE SAFE.*\n\n&gt;and overbalanced backward. For a moment he lay there looking at the sky, thinking it would be simpler to just give up.\n\nYou know what?  It *would* be simpler.  In fact, nothing is simpler than giving up.  \n\nWhy don’t you use your words to tell us something that we *don’t* know.  Jackass. \n\n&gt;Then he thought of the thing in the concrete tunnel and knew he could not. He gained his feet and stared over at the topiary. \n\n**NO**.  You just “stare at the topiary.”  You don’t stare “over” at it.  It is amateur hour again.  \n\n&gt;All three lions were bunched together now, not forty feet away. \n\n&gt;What is this guys job anyway?  That he can estimate distances with such accuracy *while being stalked by lions?*  Is he in charge of arranging outdoor spaces on the Serengeti?  \n\n&gt;The dog had ranged off to their left, as if to block Danny's retreat. They were bare of snow except for powdery ruffs around their necks and muzzles. They were all staring at him.\n\nHmm…this is the only thing I like.  It builds tension.  And (if we exclude the part discussing the dog’s motor skills again) there are no wasted words.  \n\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nHard to judge anything about the plot or characters here.  But the prose needs serious work.\n\nSomeone needs to tell Mr. King he is never going to get this shit published.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425347128", "subreddit": "WritersChoice", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am god.\n\nOr I think I am, at least. Ever since I found that file on the computer, I never really understood anything anymore. You’re confused, no doubt. Let me start from the beginning.\n\nHi, I’m Tom. I’m thirty-seven, and a Capricorn. I like long walks on the beach and…\n\nWhat? That’s too far back? Okay, I’ll condense it. Consider this the Cliffnotes edition of my story.\n\nSo I am – was – an employee for Innovative Inc., the biggest multibillion company in the world. I was shocked to be honest. I mean, all I had to my name was a degree in computer science from a crappy college and the charisma of a brick. I had no intentions of actually being hired but to my surprise, they approved it after an awkward interview where I may have thrown up at least twice because of anxiety.\n\nAnyway, I was put on the Organization Team. Sounds fancy right? Well, it wasn’t. I sat in a room with four other social rejects while we sorted files on computer for eight hours straight in the dark. And yes, it smelled just as bad as you imagined.\n\nBut I didn’t complain. After all, jobs were hard to come by after the World War III and being part of the OT paid handsomely while also having a great healthcare system. Thanks, Obama.\n\nI truly though my life couldn’t better than what it was. That is, until yesterday.\n\nI was going through the files as normal, not really knowing what I was doing, to be honest. Most of the files were random strings of numbers of letters but I ignored them in a semi-coherent way and never got fired. I assumed I was doing my job right.\n\nWell, while sorting, I noticed something… *unusual*. One of the files was actually legible, named “Master Plan”. At first, I passed it off, assuming my eyes were playing tricks on me. Yet, it remained unchanged as I stared at it. So out of curiosity, I clicked it. I mean, what could go wrong, right?\n\nSpoiler Alert: Lots of things\n\nThe file opened to a program, some fancy database-looking thingy. It seemed legit, so I checked it out some more. After exploring the opening screen, I noticed a search bar. I typed random stuff into it but nothing happened. Then an idea donned on me.\n\nI switched back to my work and found one of the random files that I had yet to sort. Copying its name, I moved it to the search bar and to my surprise, it worked.\n\nIn a second, the screen changed to a detailed report of some woman named “Marie Bonjour” from France. And when I say detailed, I mean *ridiculously* detailed. It was as if every single part of her life was recorded and placed on my computer. It was beyond creepy so I exited.\n\nNeedless to say, I freaked the fuck out but I couldn’t leave it there. I had to try it again.\n\nThe next person was the same. Then the next file name actually belonged to a penguin off the coast of Argentina. The one after that a hibiscus Malaysia.\n\nIt didn’t take me too long to figure out there was a system to everything. Names that started with letters were humans, numbers were animals, and punctuation were plants. And after that, I made an even bigger discovery.\n\nThis was the control center for all life.\n\nMy anxiety came in like a wrecking ball and really hit me in the gut. I remembered the days I had accidently deleted files or changed their names without ever bothering to fix them. What happened to the organism if I did that? What happened to them if I moved their locations? Most importantly, which file was mine?\n\nThe rest of my day was spent copying files from my computer to my secret cloud storage. Sure, it took up hundreds of terabytes but I think it was worth it. After that was done, I feigned sickness (not that hard when leaving the dark room makes you nauseous, anyway) and made my way home as soon as possible.\n\nI stayed up all night, going through the files for myself. I mean, I had to protect or back it up in case one of the buffoons in the room accidently deleted me from history. I bet Jerry would because I didn’t share my Twix one time. Fuck Jerry.\n\nAnyway, while I went through the files, I came across some interesting ones. You know – murderers, child abusers, politicians – and the like. In that moment, I came up with a great idea. Perhaps the best idea I’ve ever had, actually.\n\nI began a massive deleting spree, ridding the world of the bad. Of course, there are ethical problems with this but who cares, I could just get rid of anyone who disagreed with me. And it wasn’t like I got rid of anyone because of a personal bias. Except Jerry. He was too dangerous to leave alive.\n\nOnce I finished my purge of the world’s terrible people, I realized I was no closer to finding myself. Exhausted and proud of my progress, nonetheless, I went to sleep. I had plenty of time the next day and the day after that.\n\nBut when I woke up this morning, I saw that every single news station on the planet was freaking out about the sudden death of thousands. Some people called it the Rapture while others blamed foreign enemies for starting biological warfare. I sighed, turning off the TV and turning on my computer.\n\nLooks like I still got a lot of work to do.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425564662", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As it stands this Convention of States push is just very hard right claptrap. It's ALL republicans coalescing around right-wing republican \"ideas\" to further undermine and exploit flaws in (cheat) our system. Like they do in Pennsylvania where, through redistricting Democrats overall received 52% of votes but won less than a third of districts. Stuff like that all over the country. Here's a thought; let's ask Tom Coburn why he couldn't affect progress all the years he was a career politician.\n\nNational Debt and inequality are big problems. Political will created them and political will could fix them, and that far easier than gloom and doom conservatives, themselves mostly responsible, would have you believe. For example, it's worth noting that throughout the financial crisis of 2007 and the ensuing Great Recession the US bond market didn't even flinch (edit: not even through the republican driven credit rating fiasco). And with the US private sector holding 44% of the debt some Americans are profiting nicely from it. Now why is that? Lastly, under Obama US debt held by China has gone down from 9% to 6%. Thanks Obama!\n\nSo, is this the same \"conservatism\" that effected a bloodless coup in 2000 then ballooned the debt and exploded the Middle East, this after orchestrating 3 decades of wage stagnation and middle class destruction? Of course it is. Fuck that.\n\nFor some real insight into what troubles our politics, this [Matthew Yglesias piece](http://www.vox.com/2015/3/2/8120063/american-democracy-doomed) is far more thought provoking, for example.\n\nTL;DR: Convention Of States is conserv-a-speak for end-run-takeover.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425591689", "subreddit": "texas", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm your friend already. Easy cheesy. \n\nBut, yeah, I understand. It's tough to make new friends when you have a inkiness blurring up your vision and motivation. Harder still when you don't own a friend helmet and friend cannons are so expensive to rent. Thanks, Obama. \n\nI've been in your place, and I've met many people who have been there too. Most of us have at least visited that place for an afternoon. Sometimes I feel that being useful is better than anything else, better than friends. Other people have told me the same. If you don't feel useful, that doesn't mean that's true, and if you quit now you'll never know the truth.\n\nWhen you connect to people, become part of the whole, you can't check out. It's too important. Too many people depend on you pushing though the muck. \n\nIt's probably better that you don't even think about making new friends, but making new connections. For instance, there are people out there who could use your help, even if it was just to lift something they can't lift or to read something to them they can't read. It would be a shame to leave those people in their time of need, and just because you haven't met them yet, doesn't mean you aren't letting them down by checking out before giving it a shot. Could help.\n\nAdd a little education to the mix, and you could help even more people, even more deeply.\n\nI'm not sure, though I'm no expert, that finding a new group of friends will make those thoughts and feelings you are having disappear. But I can tell that if people are being asshats to you in person, people who know your name and your mom's name, then those people are already not your friends. They probably don't know the pain they are causing because people, in general, are pretty dull in that way and have their own hidden pains they are trying to dampen. So, don't take it personally and don't blame them too much. \n\nAnd, though you probably don't want to hear it, you might need a prescription of some sort, and you certainly should spend some time with a medical professional. They know more than you, I promise, and they understand that a faulty bit of brain is no different than a faulty valve somewhere in your body. They want to see you. They would be crestfallen to learn you never gave them a shot.\n\nMost of all, no matter what you think of yourself, consider that you might be wrong. I've been wrong my whole life, and every 10 years or so I look back and see an idiot waving back. I promise you, it's worth the effort to tough it out, to shovel the muck, so that you can continuously experience that kind of hindsight.

It doesn't matter.\n\nAnd there it is: Your crowning moment of stupidity. \n\nIt does matter. Very much, because *you* claimed the reason he left was so that he didn't get thrown in Gitmo. You said this because you either \n\na) were too stupid to know that no US Citizens have ever been put there that weren't captured in the Middle East.\n\nor\n\nb) were desperately hoping I'd just swallow your bullshit fear mongering and not call you out on it. Look out people! If you dare disobey the government, that'll throw you in Gitmo!! \n\n\n\n&gt;There would be nothing stopping the feds from sticking Snowden in some military prison or any one of the black sites the CIA operates. And you're delusional if you think they wouldn't do such a thing.\n\nThat's **exactly** what they should do. Jose Padilla was held in a naval base brig before his trial, and was charged, tried and convicted in plain old Federal Prison. Snowden should have to do the same. Know why? Because he broke the law and did so intentionally with calculated for thought. Don't make it sound like he stumbled onto something. He's said multiple times that he took the job with Booz Allen so he could steal and release NSA data. \n\n&gt;My use of the phrase \"Guantanamo'd\" doesn't have to refer to Guantanamo, it refers to any prison where people get held without trial. \n\noh man, thanks for creating an entirely new phrase because there isn't one that exists already that means just that. Oh shit, wait a minute. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_rendition\n\nThat's Right!! There **is** a phrase that means just what you're talking about and could have easily been used, but again, becuase of reasons A or B above, you didn't use it. I personally think it's A because you've already proven on **multiple** occasions that you're a complete and total fucking idiot. \n\n&gt;Which is \"legal\" now because of the NDAA, by the way. I don't normally say \"Thanks, Obama\" seriously, but he did sign off on the fucking thing.\n\nWow. **WOW**! Just when I think you can't say anything dumber... you do. Indefinite detention was authorized in the 2001 AUMF. I guess Obama authorized that before he was elected, huh? \n\n&gt;If you think the federal government would be above sticking Snowden in some deep, dark, hole somewhere, I've got a bridge to sell you.\n\nYeah, because taking someone who's been featured in movies, news stories, documentaries only a few **hundred thousand** articles and sticking him in a hole would work. Ummm, no. He'd be held in a military prison (as he should be) and tired very publicly where his own statements would be used as evidence against him. He'd get convicted, sentenced and  then he could stand as a symbol for people to look up to. All he is now is a coward and obviously a traitor. \n\n\nSo far this week I've proven you a liar, a blatant shill and *completely* uneducated. If you'd like to go another few rounds, find one of my posts and reply to it because this conversation is done.

{"body": "My opinion on everything if anyone cares:\n\n**Game Threads** - These were perfect last year. The bot worked as it should. Maybe 30 minutes earlier on posting so people wanting to chat long before game can. I don't think we need a designated Pre-Game thread. I think the game chat being up a little earlier can facilitate the pre game needs. These should be stickied so they are not hard to find.\n\n**Merchandise Posts** - See Free Talk Fridays.\n\n**Upvote Parties** - While having the /r/Mariners community involved in circle jerking and celebrating is important, I think they can best be house in the official, bot-made Post-Game chat. That's basically what they are now. It's going to get annoying to have 127 circle jerks this year. That's right people 127-35. Suck it haterzzzz\n\n**Free Talk Fridays** - I think this is the best place to have general conversations whether it's about life, love, or the pursuit of happiness. It's also an awesome place to post a picture of that sweet new hat you picked up or the new Seager jersey you bought at the Team Store. I think the community could greatly benefit from a Free Talk Friday area where you can also post pictures from a game you attended or your King Felix bobblehead sitting in your cubicle. These should be posted by the bot at 4am or so on Friday mornings and stickied so that they are always at the top.\n\n**Flair Request** - I would be happy to do flair requests again this year. Especially with the tagging feature of usernames alerting you without gold (Thanks Obama!) I can see everyone's requests. Remember though, it has to be something that can be easily seen in a 30x30 image. \n\n-------\n\n\n**Reddit Does Mariners** - If you live in the Seattle area, you should try and go to this. I am very jealous of you local fans that can participate in meetups like this. It sounds like a lot of fun and /u/aedeos has put in a lot of work to get great prices and seats for you guys. I can't wait to see the group pictures from all of you!

{"body": "I wrote this about three days ago and posted it on my website, I just hadn't gotten around to responding on reddit. \n\n     Tommy had always been an outgoing kid. He wasn’t afraid of much and would talk to almost anyone who would approach him. He was quite happy-go-lucky and, to his parents’ dismay, loved taking the longer routes home from school. He would frequently walk in circles, along the beach, or even around the park instead of taking the short and direct route home. One day, while walking along the beach, Tommy saw the cutest golden retriever scamper along the shore. He instinctively ran after it, wanting to play with the little pup; he caught up with the dog almost too easily, and right when Tommy went down to pet it, Tommy’s vision went dark.\n\n     He tried yelling but something was covering his mouth. He suddenly felt weightless, like someone was lifting him up. He landed with a loud and painful thud on a metal surface. He felt someone tie his hands up quickly and he heard a door slam shut. It sounded like his mom’s mini-van, but he always got yelled at if he slammed it too hard. The panic set in and Tommy started bawling.\n\n     He heard a door open and close again, the engine start, and tires screech. Tommy had no idea how much time had passed between being thrown in the car and from when the car stopped. He rolled around the back of a large van while terrible Heavy Metal played from the car’s speakers. The more Tommy cried, the louder the music got. It was pure torture for the boy and eventually he ran out of tears.\n\n     The van suddenly came to a screeching halt and Tommy slammed into a metal grate. He hit his head so hard that he couldn’t think straight. Tommy heard a door open, but it didn’t shut. He heard some voices—it sounded like men shouting. There was a loud thud against the car, a man yelled, and then a loud crack. Tommy panicked again, and had a bit of an accident. He had never been this scared in his life. He only wanted to play with a puppy.\n\n     He heard the door slide open and he heard a familiar voice: “Tommy?”\n\n     “…yes,” Tommy replied, still incredibly frightened.\n\n     “I’m here to save you. Don’t worry, I’m going to cut your hands loose and take that bag off your head. Is that okay?” The man asked Tommy. Tommy whimpered something short of a reply, which the man understood as a yes. The man quickly cut the rope off Tommy’s hands and untied the bag. Tommy gasped.\n\n     “Aren’t you the President!?” Tommy asked. He started to panic again and began hyperventilating.\n\n     “Yes, you can call me Barry though, if you’d like. Now listen, I’m going to pick you up and bring you over to my friend over there. He’s going to check you out to make sure you’re okay.” The President pulled Tommy up in his arms and handed him off to a paramedic.\n\n     The President smiled at the young boy, and despite the fact that Tommy was shaking in fear, he opened his mouth to speak. Before he could bring himself to thank the President,Mr. Obama leaped and flew off into the sunset, leaving Tommy even more confused and worrisome than before his abduction.\n\n     Tommy began crying once more; he choked out, “Thanks, Obama.”", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425884665", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Believe me, I'm well aware Stargate is a *very* Canadian show. When I spent a couple weeks up in a shack on a ranch in BC, the only science fiction was Space and the only thing that played was a round robin of all the Stargates followed by (inexplicably) Castle.\n\nAnd yes, I hope that I made it clear in my post that I'm not really focusing on the production (or even the audience, really) so much as I'm talking about the ideals and the tone of the series.\n\nI'd also argue that the prevailing opinion of America in America is cynicism. For many this takes the form of longing for an imaginary golden age. For many others, this just takes the form of jaded non-conformism and a resentment of \"the Man\". Either way, it's not a sense of infallibility anymore. I can't think of a better embodiment of this sentiment than the sarcastic \"Thanks, Obama!\" meme (as it's unironic use berates our president and it's ironic use berates our conservatives. Either way, it's resentful nose-thumbing).\n\nBut this is really just a continuation of the American resentment of \"the Man\" and the importance of the individual. We actively resent our politicians if not the entire political system, but we enter into deep fervor every (presidential) election. We hate our cops, but we love our troops. We hate Hollywood, but we love our blockbusters. We hate the big bad people in power, but we love the rise of the individual. Be it a rags-to-riches tale or a super-powered hero fighting against the masses, we love the individual's plight.\n\nAs for \"why would I think anything else\" I could point to any number of science fictions that aren't too terribly American made in the same timeframe as TOS-TNG that don't exude this Americanness. Quantum Leap, seaQuest, Babylon 5, etc., etc. None of them stand out like Star Trek does in its American-ness.\n\nAnd I don't think it's a matter of \"Do no wrong\" thinking. Star Trek really weighs on grey issues of right and wrong fairly often, so there's always this sense of moral uncertainty or moral difficulty. While Starfleet is presented as idealistic and ultimately on the right track, it's not that they can do no wrong it's that they strive to do what's right (making it about the choices they make rather than the righteousness of the people choosing).\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426121583", "subreddit": "DaystromInstitute", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

There is a body count associated with defunding those programs.\n\n&gt; Over the past 40 years spending on welfare entitlements as a percentage of US GDP has exploded. In the very same period, poverty rates as a percentage of the US population have held constant.\n\nThe population of the United States has also exploded over the last 40 years. Obviously, more social welfare programs are needed to continue to fight poverty in America.\n\n&gt; There is no consistent correlation between entitlement spending and poverty rates, inverse or otherwise. There is quite a bit of evidence, however, suggesting that \"spending to eliminate poverty\" doesn't do a damn thing other than waste money.\n\nWhat evidence?\n\n&gt; (Fun bonus activity: Go look at the poverty-as-percentage-of-population graph again. Notice how every uptick in poverty rate in the under-18 and 18-to-64 demographics is matched by a similar downtick in the over-64 rate? There's Social Security and Medicare in action for you! Take from the young [and worsen their lives] to give to the old [reverse ageism! yay!] because...survey says...old people vote.)\n\nThat's how social welfare programs work. Someone always has to pay for it. I don't mind paying for Social Security for the elderly, because one day I will collect it. I don't mind paying for Medicaid, because if I lose my job, I will still be able to get treatment for my chronic conditions. (Thanks, Obamacare -- no more pre-existing conditions.)

Some places are lucky to have a small doctor's office hours away.  One thing we could do is just give people something like medical vouchers to use at the doctor or hospital of their choice and maintain a private system with public funding.  That's what we do for Medicaid &amp; Medicare (single payer systems for the poor &amp; elderly, respectively), though similar to how it is with certain health insurers doctors cannot be compelled to accept it, and in most cases they would be nuts to accept Medicaid because the reimbursements are so low.  Personally I would like to see the federal government 100% out of the health care business as it's something that I don't believe they have any Constitutional authority to deal with.  If the States want to attempt it, they're free to, but as Vermont has found [that's easier said than done](http://www.salon.com/2014/12/18/vermont_abandons_plan_for_single_payer_health_care/)\n\nI'm highly dubious of any claim that the NHS represents anything close to a success story for the UK.  Before the NHS came into existence there were new hospitals being built every year.  How many have been built since the NHS came into existence?  I don't know the answer to that question answer now, but I do know that it was very close to zero for decades.  Brits have lower quality health care than they would otherwise, but hey, at least it's available to everybody.

Doublefried obtained his Fly Pikachu from some random hobo down the street who kept just poking his Pikachu with the HM until it finally gave in and learned the move.\n3. So the person who had Arcanine Flair was a redditor, and they're on here somewhere. I think, moral of the story is that they were cool and awesome and Arcanine is the best. The person that had Suicune flair was that one person from the subreddit across the street, then they came over and everyone just loved them and then they threw a Suicune at em' and everyone lived happily ever after.\n4. Long ago, the subreddits lived in harmony until /r/thelastairbender attacked. Their was only one subreddit could stop them, but when the world needed them most. It... Um... I guess it never existed. Whatever, this Subreddit was created by someone. That someone ya know? Yeah! That someone.\n5.

My favorite Pokémon would probably be Jirachi, as a child my head was always in the stars and when I first started playing Pokémon GenIII just came out. I remembered watching the movie with Jirachi in it and freaking out! I loved it so much, and I didn't understand why back then.

{"body": "Yep, and they are largely responsible for the devaluation of porn content industry wide, and the reason why in a few years new high quality porn content will be nearly impossible to find. If you prefer seeing crap, well then, I guess you can thank them.\n\nInstead of ranting on about it, I'll post something I posted before in another thread:\n\n&gt; The truth of the matter is that pay rates for adult talent are at the lowest level they have ever been. A few years ago, female talent could easily get $1,000-3,000 per scene and could work 5-10 times per week. Now they are lucky to get $500-600 once a week.\n\n&gt; This is largely because most of the so-called 'tube-sites' actually steal/pirate their content and hide behind the user-uploaded loopholes of the DMCA that allow a service provider to avoid liability when a user uploads content to their site, so long as they remove it when notified by the copyright owner. Rather than make money from sales, these sites earn a profit by selling advertising or directing traffic to more profitable ventures, such as cam sites, pills that supposedly enhance penis size, etc.\n\n&gt; The sneaky part of this is that many of these 'tube-sites' actually pay employees to pretend to be users and upload the content themselves, so when they are notified of infringement, they remove it and just have it re-uploaded.\n\n&gt; All of this piracy has caused adult DVD sales and website subscriptions to completely drop. Many companies have gone out of business as a result. Many of the ones that survived were bought out at bottom dollar prices by the company that spearheaded the whole 'tube-site' movement, MindGeek (formerly known as Manwin &amp; Mansef), which owns brands such as Brazzers. They systematically devalued the entire industry via piracy, then scooped up the devalued properties once the damage was done, consolidating a large chunk of the adult business. They also populate these sites with content from their acquisitions and license legit content from any other remaining companies in order to give the 'feel' of legitimacy to their tube sites, as the licenses can now be obtained at extremely low prices, since the value of produced content has completely dropped to next to nothing thanks to their aforementioned tactics. While the strategy was brilliant on paper, aside from the legally questionable tactics, it's not a good thing over the long run because it creates an environment where people are being conditioned to expect porn for free and over time the sales and value of content will drop to a level where it's no longer worth producing new content.\n\n&gt; Nowadays, most adult talent focus more on doing webcam shows, stripping, and escorting, than they do on performing in scenes, simply because it's more profitable. All in all, the days of adult talent making $100k-200k/year in porn are pretty much gone and likely to never return. It won't be long before the majority of adult content available is older recycled scenes, and tons of amateur content produced via webcam and smart phones, since high quality production houses and their talent will be unable to survive in this new free-porn environment.\n\nIf you get your rocks off to these sites, you're part of the problem and you're doing the opposite of supporting the industry that you rely on for your fap-happy jerk sessions.

As others have said, some are great, some are not so great, like any other school. Suffolk facilities have gotten a lot better even since I was there, thanks to more people attending and more federal funding. (thanks Obama)\n\nI went to Suffolk because I was homeschooled (no HS diploma) and I wasn't sure if I college was right for me. Loved it, got my GED along with my associates through their Ability to Benefit program. (the general ed classes you take for you major add up enough to qualify for a GED) \n\nUnlike many who fall into the SCCC \"apathy\" trap, (the mentality of \"who cares, it's just the 13th grade/not a real school/etc.) I took it seriously. Because I had a 3.9 GPA, I qualified for their scholarship program called the \"Stay on LI Initiative\" Scholarship, which is only for students who have a 3.75 or higher and wish to attend a uni on LI. The scholarships apply to almost all the major universities on LI. Two letters of recommendations, four 250-word essays, and applications to my choice LI colleges later, I was recommended by SCCC out of a pool of applicants, and chosen out of the top three applicants for a three year full-tuition ride to LIU Post. Between going to Suffolk and that scholarship, I have saved well over 100k and will finish my undergrad this spring debt-free. Which is something that very, very, very few people I know can say.\n\nSo yes, do it. High schools love to crap on community colleges, but they really aren't that bad. Avoid the slackers and debbie downers who have been sucked into the apathy trap, bust your ass and you'll save yourself so much money and stress in the long run.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426460946", "subreddit": "longisland", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I'm telling this because the way you wrote, it sounds like you're delusional about so-called secret societies, or think tanks, or lobbies, or any greedy motherfucking goons that believe in magic.\n\nbecause, like it or not, but \"those shadowy guys\", believe in magic, and practise it on a regular basis. Yes, fucking magic. One's will can become a powerful strength not measurable by any physical mean yet have influence on the real world. It all starts in thoughts anyway.\n\nmaybe as a bunch of us, you rather cram this stuff deep in your head, not willing to think about it, not willing to realize that at some points(several points) you lose control over your life(not saying you're a nut that can't do or think shit, but there are unexplainable things all around us, no need for conspiracy to see them. trying to explain is another thing), and you don't like the idea of not being in control of your path, and that's ok.\n\n\nthe minimal thing about those conspiracies are just acknowledge them. There's a line between this, and bringing whatever down to a conspiracy, 'thanks obama'-like.\n\n\nBut yeah, there are some wealthy guys, that have power, influence, at many levels, be it economics, politics, education, religious matters. Those pushed the reasoning beyond, and now have a bunch of ants working for them so they don't need to work and simply grab money.\n\n\nthose are parasites, and by the light tone of your post, just saying those are bullshit you're not helping and actually you're playing THEIR game. Many of us play their game, consciously or not. Please don't.\n\n\nAnd please, if you wanna speak about masons, educate yourself a bit. I won't say Sitchin was the best author i ever read, but it shone a light on some intersting things from the past for sure. So just FYI:\n\n* \"a mason symbol not the illuminati\": illuminati WERE masons, the same thing dude. Illuminatis were masons from germany, this was the name given to their lodge, cuz some lodges have kind of nicknames and slight variations, just like some churches have long names because of slight variations. The name stayed because of the proximity with the concept of \"enlightenment\", simply cuz when light hits you and what surrounds you, you then can see what previously was hidden in the dark.\n\n\n* the all seeing eye is not a masonic symbol. Please. It comes at least from egyptian horus eye, and even in india there are mentions of it in old texts that be like 3k years old. It's the eye of god, whatever you would call god, be it the sun for example. An invisible watcher, a judge, a caretaker. The purpose of fearing a god is to show some respect for moral and human values that the god would purposefully dictate.\n\nand this shit goes on and on. Basically what masons have done with symbols, is just invert them and make them sound/look evil.\n\n\nInvert symbols, invert morals, invert human values, that's what they want, that's what they do. Why? to drive us crazy, to withdraw what can be left of humanity within us. And always along the line of \"do as i say, not as i do\".\n\n\nthe good old capitalist shit, just stomp your opponents and make cash. don't give a fuck. buy back your soul by giving some bucks to poor children in africa, and get those bucks deducted from your revenue tax fee. Yet don't give a fuck about the american homeless guy you come across each day on your walk to the office.\n\n\nRemember the traditional family scheme? Dads and Moms and kids? Check the 'proposition 43' then. It's only a satire, fortunately.\n\nNow you got the 'sexual revolution' where all should be free to fuck whatever they want, the way they want.\n\nDid all those progresses increase the level of happiness among citizens?\n\nIt only brought more and more divorces, more and more abortions mainly because people tend to not be responsible for how the fuck their own body works.\n\nBecause people lost the taste of commitment, that's why.\n\nJust like they begin to lose the taste of thinking, cuz any dumbfuck can sound smart enough to get laid,  cuz when you have access to wikipedia in your Pocket through your cellphone, you don't have to think hard anymore.\n\n\nAnd even if it looks like bullshit to you, the way i see it, the ones you'd call 'tinfoil guys' are actually those who think the hardest, be it ending useful or not.\n\n\nTL;DR: Don't take conspiracies on a light tone, please acknoledge the obvious ones at least. Don't play 'their' game. Read some books about masons, cuz illuminati were masons. The eye symbol is much older than masonry, they only claimed it, and inverted it like they do with symbols.\n\n\nNow back to the game, i stumbled upon a strange realisation: Where is the Rockstar logo? Where?\n\nIn previous game we had R* star systems in the sky, word plays on 'rockstar' (northstar rock anyone?), even a R* shaped pool, plus various subtle references like logo on clothing in SA, or in ads. See the wiki for further information, but previously we had clear references to R*, and nowadays as for V, we got a shitload of mason references. And a Bugstar outfit.

The US economy was in shambles the day he took office. GM and Chrysler were about to go up; people weren't sure if TARP (or the bailouts) were going to work, the Fed was shitting its pants trying to get together some type of workable QE package to keep the economy red-lined (without completely fucking inflation) in order to prevent an economic depression. It wasn't just bad, it was on life support and there was a genuine, real fear that a genuine world-wide cataclysmic economic depression could take shape. Lending tightened, unemployment skyrocketed.\n\n2. They are all better. In every identifiable, objective way based on all observational evidence.\n\n3. Yes. All of them.

While his detractors cried foul (with CATO funding opinions to undermine the legislation,[\\[1\\]](http://cato.org/special/stimulus09/cato_stimulus.pdf) and Republican senators including John McCain screaming \"MONKEYS ON COCAINE, MONKEYS ON COCAINE!!! until they were red in the face)[\\[2\\]](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/08/03/senators.stimulus.spending.hfr/?hpt=Sbin#fbid=ArbgvoCEUuW), hundreds of US economists including nobel laureates lined up to support the stimulus and the most aggressive package legislatively possible was passed, no doubt in due to the super-majority Democratic congress that arrived on Obama's coat-tails following the 2008 election sweep. Obama's leadership on this legislation would lead to the creation of upwards of 2.5 to 3.6 million jobs [\\[3\\]](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/business/economy/17leonhardt.html?_r=0), [\\[4\\]](http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9987/Gregg_Year-by-Year_Stimulus.pdf), vastly decreased unemployment [\\[5\\]](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Recovery-JobLossGain.png), and an expansion on GDP back to potential through an increase on gross domestic spending (AE).

Obama had a direct influence, vision and role in this act's shape and passing.\n\n 2. **Under Obama, the Big-3 American auto-makers were stabilized**. They continue to operate today. This is an easy one. After the US dumped an unprecedented $85 billion in bailout loans for the three, Obama partially nationalized GM (literally socialism) and appointed a Car Czar. Then he fired some folks [\\[8\\]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/17/AR2009051702268.html) and we're getting our loans paid back at a profit. Chrysler even paid theirs back early [\\[9\\]](http://www.freep.com/article/20110524/BUSINESS01/105240399/Chrysler-pay-off-government-loans-today). The Car Czar was eventually scrapped and headed by a Summers/Geithner team, and we extended loans of another $21b, all through Obama.\n\nThese are just two things.

We would have a decent shot at life, our kid would have a fighting chance for a sum that a not insignificant number of people could drop like I drop a buck fifty to buy a newspaper.  It's also insane when I look at what my employer makes off my work.  I'm a programmer, and let's just say that my employer could go ahead and pay off all my debt tomorrow and they'd still be getting a pretty good deal.\n\nMan ... I'm going to go do some job applications.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426802687", "subreddit": "news", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I'm failing to see how writing a comment on reddit is much simpler than adding a reminder on your phone. \n\n2 reasons:  \n\n1. **Ease of Use**: I'm already on reddit, via app or site, and I don't want to be switching around just because I saw something cool, or OP said he would deliver in a couple hours. If I'm on mobile, it's entirely possible that my app will bug out and I will lose my place. If I'm on web, it's an inconvenience.\n2. **Clutter**: I don't want to clutter up my calender with a bunch of reddit-related things.\n\n---\n\n&gt; saying \"RemindMe! 2 days\" adds literally nothing to the discussion. That's spam.\n\nYou're right, and there are two sides to this:\n\n1. **MAYBE IT IS, WHO EVEN CARES?** Reddit is designed as a completely open platform designed for these kinds of things. It's no more spam than the people posting the \"switcharoos\", or response-gifs. The visibility of the content could be considered spam, but it is content nonetheless.\n2. **It's not spam**:\n * It only replies to people posting a request, which means it will never be a top level, and is *very* rarely even a second level. Not only is this a testament to it not being spam, but it goes to show that a majority of people are unlikely to see it if there's actually any legitimate content next to it.\n * It actually *encourages* anyone seeing the post to use a PM instead (via a simplistic link) in order to reduce overall clutter. Even if you call it spam, it's like garbage that's telling other stuff not to turn into garbage.\n\n---\n\nOverall, I guess my point is that whatever way you see it, it's not hurting anyone, and is designed purely with the users' interests at heart.

{"body": "Warning:  This is likely to get a bit depressing.  Do not read if you're having a bad day or a down moment, or are sensitive to depressing stuff currently.  :)\n\nSo.  This morning, as I often do before work, I checked my facebook.\n\nAnd there, smiling her shy little smile at me, is my little sister.  On her crutches, with her right pant leg tied in a knot to keep it from dragging, her head just showing her hair starting to grow back.\n\nCasey-Spam is starting, because she died on March 24th last year.  Three days, and it'll have been a year that she's gone.\n\nOur other sister (The one between us, younger than I but older than Casey) calls it the Deathday Anniversary, I call it the Deathiversary.  Either way, it's the day she left us.\n\nIt was just after 5 AM when she slipped free.  She left while my dad was getting a cup of coffee.  Someone had been with her all night, they sat by her in shifts.  She was full of morphine, so she was sleeping peacefully and comfortably.\n\nShe left when no one was there.  It's just like her.\n\nShe was very quiet, most of the time.  She had crippling social anxiety--Even texts and telephone conversations were enough to give her a panic attack, sometimes.  But when she was in a comfortable place, she'd open up.\n\nShe was 24 when she died.  She was diagnosed with stage 4 osteosarcoma--bone cancer--at 19.  She lost her right leg due to a tumor in her hip the size of a fist.\n\nShe named her tumer \"Boner.\"\n\nShe always laughed.  She loved to laugh.  So we were constantly making jokes about her cancer, anout her missing leg, about her impending death.\n\nI told her that when she died, I was going to start blaming her every time I lost my keys.  Someone who didn't know us as well got seriously offended, so a bunch of our friends chimed in about the things they were going to blame Ghost!Casey for after she died.  We decided that \"Thanks Casey!\" was going to be our new \"Thanks Obama!\"  It was glorious.\n\nI'm still waiting to get the tattoo I have planned in her honor--I just have to find an artist who I think will respect it the way I need.\n\nDon't tell me you're sorry for my loss, please.  I miss her like crazy, but she's much better now.  For the last 5 years, she was in constant pain.  She'd had more surgeries than anyone I'd ever known.  She was on constant cycles of chemo and radiation--Each one giving her another 3-6 months of life, until she finally got sick of that bullshit.\n\nBut she was my little sister.  And I miss her.\n\nAnd when I see that shy, sweet smile, the way she's kind of hunching over as though she's trying to hide from the camera even while she poses, I miss her.\n\nThe last time I lost my key, it ended up being in my garbage bag on the other side of the room.  On the other side of the room from the  ONLY PLACE I HAVE to put down my key.\n\nDammit, Casey.\n\n&lt;3", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426913523", "subreddit": "Random_Acts_Of_Amazon", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I've heard a lot of good stuff about the other stuff, but the octave on that thing was absolutely useless. It just made it sound like you turned your bass to zero, and mids/highs to 15/10.\n\nThere is really funny story about that pedal too. It's kinda long, but I recommend just reading because it was seriously one of the best thing I have ever seen on the internet that wasn't fiction. \n\nKen, owner of Freekish pedals, was selling these super sick boutique over drives for about $200. Hand built, all that good shit. There was a fuckin wait list and everything. People on the boards were drooling to get these pedals. People would make posts like..BEST OVERDRIVE I'VE EVER HEARD!!! He marketed hard on the boards there, and was an active poster. \n\nAt some point one of Ken's customers with 'the best pedal ever' see's this pedal out in the wild, (this was when Joyo wasn't so known by the way) and thinks, 'that looks familiar.' Curious, he gets one, opens it up along with his boutique pedal and there it is. Same guts. \n\nSo, dude posts pics up on thegearpage like, 'Ken...mate...what's going on here this pedal on the right is yours, this one on the left was $30 I got it shipped from China'. And the ultimate shit show ensued. Ken concocts this story something along the lines that his supplier of PCBs broke an agreement and sold boards to Joyo. Incoming about 200 posts along the lines of, \"yeah, but the rest looks exactly the same as well.\" Identical shape, size, dimensions, knob/switch/LED locations. Here comes basically every own of the pedal Ken sells posting gut shots as well. \n\nEventually it was confirmed he was painting Joyo's and selling them as 'boutique' lol, and the boards are going nuts on the guy leading mods to starting deleting any mention of the company because Ken is threatening to sue them. Every one on the thread moved into this new thread at harmonycentral to continue raging, until thegearpage randomly stopped deleting post talking about it but they had to say 'allegedly' or 'in theory' and shit like that. This lead to all these insane posts like, \"In theory, if a scumbag named Kent allegedly re-branded pedals from China should he die in a fire?\" It was outrageously funny. \n\nIf you google 'Freekish BLues Alpha Drive' you can piece the story together, but I can't find the original threads with the juicy shit I wrote out above. Also, Imgur is being a piece of shit so I can't upload any pics, but again google ^. \n\nIf you ever see people saying 'Thanks Ken!' on thegearpage it's in reference to that. It's like the 'Thanks Obama' thing. People still say it to this day and this was a good 3-4 years ago. Anytime someone fouls something up, \"Thanks Ken.'' Still gives me a laugh. \n\n \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426974661", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

However, we can't let that powerlessness carryover and stifle our willingness to do something when we CAN have an impact. \n\nThis is not to say it's easy.

{"body": "A few days ago I built [a little module to produce smart inserters](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/2zsb3l/fullspeed_smart_inserter_production/). That was fun! I decided to pick up a slightly bigger challenge:\n\n*Every kind of science pack in one place, running off raw materials.*\n\nI am bad at picking sensible goals.\n\nStrap on your helmet and get your pickaxe, 'cause this is going to be a ~~fun~~ ~~enjoyable~~ ~~tolerable~~ ~~indescribable~~ describable ride!\n\n----\n\n**The Plan**\n\nI had a few main goals with the design. These may not match up with your goals for playing, and that's cool! We all gotta pick our own playstyles. But if you're wondering why I made certain decisions, well, this is why.\n  \n* **Practical** - All science packs must be made using appropriate technology. That is to say, no Assembly Machine 3's for red science. I want something I can really use in a game.\n\n* **Space-efficient** - The whole machine should fit in as small an area as possible, given other constraints.\n\n* **Self-contained** - Everything must be done on-site to the greatest extent reasonable. The machine's inputs take the form of iron plates, copper plates, coal, water, petroleum gas, and alien artifacts. Yes I could smelt on-site but nobody ships ore around by conveyor, that's silly. Also, everyone does centralized oil processing, so, yeah, just pipe the petroleum in. Everything else, from gear wheels to batteries, is handled by the machine.\n\n* **Cheap** - No modules, no Assembler-3's, minimal use of red belts.\n\n* **Automatic** - No manual intervention required, except obviously for the Alien Artifacts.\n\n* **Fun** - I think logistic bots are boring, so I'm not going to use them.\n\n* And finally, **no borderline exploits** like the belt braiding thing. It's cool, it's clever, it's not my bag, baby.\n\nThe end result is what you see above! If you're planning to use it in a game, here's a few things to know.\n\n----\n\n**Construction**\n\nAll requirements are in addition to the research you'll obviously need just to build the items. No, you cannot build blue science packs without oil processing. There is nothing I can do about this. Also, place your own damn power poles; this should be easy to do and I built this monster with Test Mode/Creative Mode specifically so I didn't have to muck around with power distribution.\n\n* **Red science**: You'll need Automation. (Duh. Of course you'll need Automation.) Build all the red science assemblers to the left of the labs, plus the iron gear wheel assembler and relevant belts connecting them. In the final factory you'll need an Assembler 2 for the iron gears, but for now, just build it as an Assembler 1, and you can use half the inserters too (two input, one output). One conveyor of copper and one of iron is massive overkill. Plan to build 5-10 labs - 5 labs will saturate 10-second research, 10 labs will saturate 20-second research. \n  \n* **Green science**: Add Logistics and Automation 2. Build everything to the west of the labs, and upgrade the iron gear wheel assembler while you're at it. One conveyor of copper and one of iron is still massive overkill. Plan to upgrade to 15 labs - most research from now on is 30-second.\n  \n* **Blue science**: Are you ready to rumble? First, build two Transport Belts. Then build the rest of the factory. You'll need Logistics 2, and if you want to do steel processing on-site (recommended), Material Processing 2. I'm also totally sure you'll need Inserter Item Stack Size 1 but I technically haven't tested it. You'll need to add the second iron conveyor now, plus coal, plus water, plus petroleum. Some projects are now 60-second - if you want to run those at full speed, extend to 30 labs, either via splitters and going north, or via two underground belts and going south.\n  \n* **Purple science**: Rocket Defense, and many of its prerequisites, are 60-second - it is definitely time to upgrade to 30 labs. Yes, this beast will keep 30 labs fully fed. Unless you research Lab Efficiency in which case I think you end up needing only 13 labs? Man, I don't know. Screw Lab Efficiency, labs are cheap, science is expensive, math is hard. I'm watching Die Hard right now and Bruce Willis just tossed an improvised bomb down an elevator shaft. It was fuckin' metal. Just FYI.\n  \n----\n\n**Things you think are broken but aren't**\n\nThanks to the math, many things are produced slightly more rapidly than necessary, and will stack up nicely to assure you that the factory is running at 100%. Not true of everything, though! Batteries are produced at *precisely* the required rate. They will never stack up, assuming you keep using blue science packs at production rate. The same is true of smart inserters.\n\nRed circuits are a bit of a weird case. There are six red circuit assemblers and you'll often notice one of them idle. This is intended! A single copper wire assembler generates precisely the amount of output needed to feed most of a green circuit assembler whose output then produces exactly the right number of red circuits . . . but there's no number of red circuit assemblers that will use exactly this number of copper wires without idling. We end up using five full red circuit assemblers, plus a third of the last assembler, and also the green circuit assembler is only at 2/3 capacity.\n  \nYou also may be looking at the northeast green circuit setup with some skepticism. \"2:3 is the ratio\", you say! \"What's this 3:4 crap?\" And then you look a little more closely and realize it's not even 3:4, it's one 2:2 and one 1:2. And the inserters don't even allow for full utilization! What. The. Hell.\n\nThis is okay! Don't worry about it. The Inserter and Fast Inserter assemblers *together* use 1.5 green circuits per second, which is exactly the output of a single green circuit assembler. One copper wire assembler isn't enough for this, so we put two in. Meanwhile, the Smart Inserter assembler needs 2 green circuits per second; *slightly* above the capabilities of a single green circuit assembler, but still within the capabilities of two copper wire assemblers. The whole mess requires 10.5 copper wire per second, which is 3.5 copper wire assemblers, so we can't do it with 3 copper wire assemblers even if we were to place them appropriately.\n\n*But can't you utilize that copper wire assembler directly to the east, which stalls once in a while* Nope! We need 0.5 red circuits per second, which requires 2 copper wires per second, which is 2/3 of a copper wire assembler 2. So in the end, we're using 4.16 copper wire assemblers in that area, so we need to build five anyway, and we may as well specialize them for the sake of our own sanity. Thanks, Obama.\n\n*blah blah 5:6 red:green assembler ratio* The green modules are built in Assembler 2's, while the red modules are built in Assembler 1's. Since Assembler 2's are 50% faster than Assembler 1's, you get a 5:4 ratio.\n\n----\n\n**Cute stuff Zorba is smug about and wants to point out so he feels awesome**\n\nThe whole factory uses exactly one red conveyor. Can you find it? It's needed to properly compress the copper plates going into the smart inserter section - without that, the smart inserter segment starves (and it's right on the border of working as-is.) Unfortunately I know of no way to preserve full compression when changing a two-lane conveyor into a one-lane conveyor, except using a single tile of higher-speed conveyor or doing something nasty involving splitters and a lot of space.\n\nI mentioned the \"missing\" inserters in the smart inserter section, but there's another reason for one inserter to be missing. If you add an inserter to pick up green circuits on the bottom-left of the Fast Inserter assembler, you'll no longer be able to power all necessary inserters with small electric poles, and will be forced to research Electric Energy Distribution 1. Which you should do anyway because it's awesome (seriously, use those medium poles, they're great) but this way I don't have to force you.\n  \nSee that wacky little iron/copper path that travels *under* the green circuit assembler in the red circuit section, then pops up in the middle of the steel smelters? What's up with that, Zorba? Are you on the marijuana? Ho ho! Yes. Yes I am. But also, that's a vital part of the factory! The one-lane copper pathway is *just barely* enough to reliably feed the smart inserter assembler - it gets overloaded if you try to make copper wires off it too. (This is partly because converting a two-lane conveyor to a one-lane conveyor is a pain.) A similar issue happens with the east-most iron plate conveyor - feeding five steel smelters, plus the smart inserter block's green circuits, plus the iron gear assembler, turns out to be too much.

Unfortunately they never offered any courses in master the Power of the Nova Force so I settled for IT instead before switching over to Business currently.\n\nI didn't know anybody yet so I looked around until I found the \"nerd hangout\" building that had a game room which had two Xboxes and two PS3s and they even had a copy of Marvel for each system that I used to use to body random passerbys in because at that time I had no steady competition.\n\nBut I didn't even know they had Marvel when I first started going and there was a large time gap between classes with nothing for me to do. Usually large groups of these people would gather round the Wiis to play Brawl (not even the good Smashes mind you. they liked Brawl. although they did eventually switched to PM later on thank God for that).\n\nI figure \"eh what the hell. something to kill some time anyway\". I did after all have some experience playing Melee but never got super good with it. I main Luigi.\n\nThere was a random ass tag on the game that said Obama so i thought i'd use it for shits and giggles.

I would literally drop off the ledge, Up+B back on the ledge, and keep dong it over and over again until the last man was standing allowing me to use all four of my stocks to kick his ass and win the game.\n\neventually these people caught on and one guy was like \"HEYYY wait a minute!! this Obama guy is being a cheap asshole and ledge grabbing! let's all call a truce and gang up on him!\"\n\nand so they did. they would kill themselves trying to hit me off. they would kill each other. the entire pace of the game would be slowed down for literally like ten minutes (they had no timer on so this was extra funny) and completely fail trying to stop my troll tactic. it was hilarious and eventually people would give up and ragequit on me when they knew they had to four stock me with only one stock\n\nand yes they all said THANKS OBAMA on several occasions\n\nat this point that one nerd that raged would rage harder and say really funny shit like\n\n\"UHMM HELLO?!

{"body": "&gt;Why did you choose to sterilize?\n\nI got pregnant while using birth control and I had a really fucked up pregnancy that did not leave me in good health.  Even if I wanted another baby (and I don't), I have no business being pregnant again. \n\n&gt;Which procedure did you choose?\n\nEssure, with Mirena as a back-up.\n\n&gt;What were your reasons for choosing that procedure over another?\n\nI didn't want to deal with anesthesia since I am allergic to hydrocodone.  The procedures weren't comfortable, but I didn't need strong pain medication to manage it.\n\n&gt;What age did you undergo the operation?\n\nI was 29\n\n&gt;Did you have any difficulties from your doctors, families, friends? Or even your own thoughts?\n\nI talked to my doctor while pregnant about getting fixed, and he was initially resistant.  After the last month of complications and a nightmare delivery, he signed off on the procedure without hesitation.  My family (especially in-laws) would prefer if we had at least one more child, but they don't push hard on the subject now that it's clear that I not only can't have another, but I shouldn't either.\n\n&gt;What was your recovery like? How long?\n\nI had about 6 hours of minor cramping and spotting after the placement.  I had the check up procedure which was significantly more painful, and I had about 12 hours of cramping after that.\n\n&gt;Any short-term and/or long-term side effects that you would like to share?\n\nI haven't really noticed any.  I only got this thing a few months ago, though.\n\n&gt;Did your insurance cover it?\n\nYes! 100%, even the follow up visit to the doctor.  **Thanks Obama!**\n\n/r/childfree has a list of doctors who are compliant with patient wishes, so consider looking at their sidebar if you are seeking sterilization and haven't found a willing doctor.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427220716", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Any candidate who supports the following:\n\nA reduction in military spending (hardware, not staffing) and funnel that money toward infrastructure and public education improvement. I think we can do with a couple less F-35s and thanks every year, which cost *billions of dollars*, and still maintain am elite military. And by infrastructure, I mean improving roads, bridges, and giving communities high-speed Internet that other countries enjoy without having to deal with Comcast/etc who have de facto monopolies I'm municipalities.\n\nSeriously, think of how much the average teacher makes in this country (although it's not all about salaries) - and how much even a 5% reallocation can go. It would be fantastically dramatic, and you would garner the support of most who value quality education, as well as teachers in general, who used to be a very united voting block.\n\nI would vote for anyone who pledged to not vote for any AUMF with legal loopholes such as the current ISIL AUMF proposed, with no geographical limits. Violence begets violence, and anyone who has in the past two years voted for sending arms to Ukraine (for an example) has to understand that these types of actions will not de-escalate conflict, but will surely increase the rate of other people dying, of which roughly 25% of my earned income *every day* goes to support.\n\nI would vote for anyone willing to state that the intelligence apparatus in this country is out of control, and has ideas on how to reign in the NSA and all of surveillance we have been hearing about.\n\nI would vote for anyone willing to abolish the program which allows local police departments to purchase used military equipment and significant discounts.\n\nI would vote for anyone who vows not vote for a budget (or any other significant legislation) without an amendment to drastically revamp the campaign financing laws in this country (the old adage of getting money out of politics). \n\nI would vote for anyone willing to work to overhaul the health care payment system in this country and bring it into the single-payer world with many other first-wirld nations instead of the gifts to the pharmaceutical industry (Medicare Part D, thanks GWB) and the insurance industry (thanks, Obama).\n\nI tried as best I could to hit points that aren't wedge issues used to divide and distract, but issues that affect a huge swath of demographics. \n\nThe only thing I haven't touched is the banking and student loan problem, of which I have propositions for but would double the length of this post. \n\nTL;DR - I'm not voting for anyone I'm the current establishment. Because the system currently benefits them, and they won't change (history has shown this). So I'm waiting for my age demo (18-34 and some older folks who can see through propaganda and bullshit) to wake the fuck up and challenge some incumbents in primaries, regardless of the D or R near their name.

Also, let's not act like these young adults would simply be added to the ranks of people without insurance, because many of them (say, as many as 80%?) would wind up getting insurance through an employer or university.\n\n&gt;Yes, they technically had \"insurance\", which makes your point semantically correct, but substantively misleading.\n\nCeding the point again.

Interest starts accumulating immediately (thanks obama) so at graduation that 80k is now already 104k, then 3-4 years more residency and that single year of medical school is now 137k.\n\nIf you average it out it's 104+137 = 241/2 = 120.5k average for each year, or **480,000 total**.\n\nNow whether or not it's possible to pay off...**in a specialty? Easily. You can take home 300k starting in plenty of specialties**, leaving you 200k post-tax, live on the equivalent of 75k a year and you can sock 150k away into your debt and be debt free (without living in poverty) in 4 years, with a 700k surplus in another 4 (say buying a house in full in a lot of areas of the country).\n\n**In primary care working with the underserved (say 120k?)? Not really...**Well, if you live the equivalent of 75k a year, you end up being able to sock away 30k into your debt...which is also known as less than the interest. If you make 180k you end up paying the interest (35k) + an additional 35k letting you pay it down after 15 years or so... \n\nI tell people this and they immediately see why there is a primary care shortage. 8 years after working you could have a 700k house and no debt, or be halfway through paying back loans. It's a damn shame.\n\nEDIT: The dirty little secret of medicine is that ~20-25% of med school graduates are debt free, bringing the total average down a ton because of rich doctor parents, military service commitment or MDPhD. Most pre-meds have parents making 100-200k so they can afford to subsidize their kids education a bit too. I'd say typical debt is somewhere around 300k, with the parents paying for 50-100k of it. The debt figures aren't accurate because debt on graduation is 30% more before you actually start working for realsies, and subsidized loans were still in effect until recently.\n\n**Someone with well off parents today can expect to have a debt load of 500k after a 4 year residency if their parents don't help them.

{"body": "When I went to an orthopedic surgeon about my wrist issues (I had started to feel tingling in my fingers), he told me it's really a matter of proper wrist posture, and he recommended the wrist brace. Unfortunately, I don't think correct posture is possible with regular keyboards. You should consider investing in one of these to fix your posture:\n http://amzn.com/B000LVJ9W8\n\nI've been resistant to switching keyboards because I love the versatility of coding on my laptop, so I actually just wear the wrist brace whenever I code and it works ok. I really ought to switch to a proper keyboard though.\n\nThe elbow issue is somewhat separate. I haven't seen a doctor about it so I don't know the exact cause, but I do notice it gets worse when my elbow remains bent for a long time, so I've been wearing the elbow brace when I code, but it's annoying. Right now I don't have health insurance and I have no way of getting it because I missed the open enrollment period, so I'm kinda screwed. (Thanks, Obama)\n\nThis is one of those health issues that you absolutely cannot ignore. You can end up with permanent nerve damage and weakness in your hands, and you'll need surgery to fix it.

{"body": "You could make a very similar, yet, extreme polar opposite statement about democrats. Both are extreme and both are fucking retarded. We obviously need to take religion out of government. This is evident. Let me break down what I think we should do and I encourage constructive criticism. \n\nBan Abortions- I'm pro choice. I don't think the gov't should be able to make that decision for you. Especially for rape and/or if said person is not capable of supporting the child mentally, physically or monetarily. If you cannot provide for a child, you should NOT be allowed to have one. It's extremely selfish and will do nothing except bring another person in the world without the necessities they need to be a productive member of society. \n\nBlock Immigration- I think there is a right way and wrong way to immigrate/emigrate to the United States. Get a visa/green card. Get a sponsor like my great grandfather did. Fun fact, he personally sponsored over 100 other Sicilians over the course of his life. I'm very proud of that and think it's great that people want to live in our great country. To do it legally is entirely different than \"jumping the border\". For those that are living here illegally, fuck them. I don't care that their country sucks. Send them all back to where they came from. Do it the right way as millions of others have. I know it's hard. My first cousin is 30 years old and has been fighting for citizenship her entire life. She was born in Germany while my aunt and uncle were on vacation FYI. \n\nBlock \"African American\" and poor people from voting- This personal opinion may be the one I get the most flack for. I think you should have to take a test to vote. White, black, brown, pink, yellow. You should have a basic understanding of what the fuck is going on in our government. Call it a current events test. One should also have a basic understanding on how the government actually works. That or you should have a high school diploma or at least a GED.\n\nBan marriage between two \"loving people\"- That statement isn't biased at all ;) lol. I'm totally for homosexuals getting hitched. Go for it. Be happy. Do your thing. Raise kids, I don't give a fuck.\n\nAllow discrimination- Now I know discrimination is alive and well in the entire US. Unfortunately, it is a huge part of our history that is still ignorantly engrained in our countries DNA. I say \"our\", because I see it from all races, religions and demographics. Yes, I mean ALL! Poor hate/envy the rich. The rich hate the poor for \"not contributing to society. Religious people hate other people in different religions. Different races hate each other because of the past. With that being said, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. It sucks, but it's a fact. I see interviews of black people that have literally said white people are the devil. I've seen interviews of white people, literally saying African Americans should be hung by their neck. All I've seen out of all of this is a whole bunch of white guilt. From the minority perspective, a sense of being indebted by \"the man\". All I see is intelligent people tip toeing around those issues at hand and the uneducated perpetuating the issue as a whole. Personally, I think it's been around 150 years since the abolition of slavery in the US! Can we move on?! Certain people need to be held accountable and provide for themselves and certain people need to realize that other people are just that, people. I understand it's much more complicated than that but come on...\n\nBan competition and businesses starting up- As a small business owner, this is the one that I probably have the biggest disagreement with. If anything, since starting my business 11 years ago, the Obama administration has made it much more difficult on all small businesses. Every small business owner I've talked to has this same opinion. Unless you own one, please don't throw irreverent opinions around because you don't really know what it's been like. So don't pretend to know the shit I've been through, trying to keep my business running and providing jobs for my employees. The Obama administration has raised taxes and made it more difficult to hire new employees. Which in turn, hurts the middle class and poor. I take very good care of my employees. From insurance, to having a livable/very comfortable wages. Depending on the position and experience of course. We've done everything we can to scrape by the last 11 years and keep our \"snorkels\" from taking on water. My grandfather said he's seen more businesses fail since Obama took office than any other time in his life. I've personally seen many good people that had been in business for over 20-40 years collapse during his tenure. I think the Democratic Party, while he's been in office, has been anything but helpful to small business. At least Bush gave us tax breaks. Not saying he was great by any means, but we got that which was nice. Que the Bill Murray meme. Especially during the shit storm that was the housing collapse. Without that help we would not be around either. \n\nGet rid of weekends- Really? Another extremist idea that is just as extreme as making 20 hour work weeks. It will never happen and we all know that. I also truly believe that the article you took that from was blatant contextomy! \n\nForce people to go to church- First of all, I think you meant \"go to Catholic Church\". Second of all, ain't fucking happening. Lol, I'm as atheist as the most liberal extremist out there. I don't have time to go to church and I don't need it to boost my morale. I feel as though I'm a great person at heart, look out for others in need and almost always put myself last. At least when it comes to family and friends. \n\nBan all religions except Christianity- You do realize this country is run by the Jewish right? They run the media and therefore, they run the opinion of 90% of the uneducated population. Which is, scarily, a very high percentage of the entire population/votes. I mean, there were more votes for the winner of American Idol than there were for the last presidential election. What the fuck!\n\nEasy, simple, non-invasive government- Non invasive is not restricting law abiding citizens the right to own and/or carry a firearm. I live just outside of Chicago and because of that one city in my state, they make it pretty damn difficult to exercise my second amendment rights. If I were to live in this great city that I truly do love, outside of politics, they charge you a ransom for each gun you register. What does that encourage? The answer is not registering your guns. What else am I not happy with? The fact that the employees that I have, that don't want the company insurance, are now \"taxed\" if they don't enroll in Obamacare.... Not only that, but it is more expensive than options that I already offer?! Talk about invasive! They don't even have a choice anymore! I suppose they can choose to take the fine. Thanks Obama ;)\n\nMy point is that both parties have extreme ideologies. Most I strongly disagree with. I strongly believe that every single person should be held accountable for themselves and their families. I strongly believe that laws are in place to allow immigration legally and that there is a right and wrong way to go about emigrating. I strongly believe that, as wrong as discrimination is, it's going to take another 200 years to get through. I also strongly believe that religion is made up bullshit to control the masses and push an agenda. What we need in this country is accountability and a drive to do better for not only ourselves, but as a whole. Too many people rely on others to provide for them. Too many people see something they want and feel entitled to have it without working for it. Too many people take everything they hear in a biased paper, news, radio, TV program as truth. Do your homework. Read/watch both sides of each story. Don't be an ignorant asshole. Try to listen more than speak up and you might learn something.

Adderall is controlled for a reason - it's incredibly more potent than caffeine, something we can get from various foods without even trying. That potency is why people can get high off it with large amounts, and in small (therapeutic) amounts it treats ADHD symptoms, giving a temporary boost to cognition, attention span, focus, etc. On the other hand, caffeine in moderate (therapeutic) amounts just makes you more alert. And as someone who self medicated with caffeine, I know first hand using enough caffeine to feel more than just awake is incredibly bad for your body and will leave you sick.\n\nFor someone who does not have ADHD, the therapeutic levels of adderall are enough to get high from. Not a Cheech and Ching type of high, but more a forced hyperfocus high. All the research I've seen suggests that not only is this dangerously stressful on the body and addictive, it gives no real advantage in the long run. Taking adderall doesn't make a student suddenly better at studying, it just makes it easier for them to hyperfocus on it. Actual non-medical study habits can give this same net benefit at no extra cost or risk - but hey, that requires work. Work, I might add, that I did, and had I been medicated it would have been enough to keep me in school.\n\nBottom line, college kids who steal, buy from others with a prescription for, or lie about their medical needs to get stimulants to \"boost their studying\" are both criminals - by definition - and cheats. They are why I could get a diagnosis while at college, but not treatment for it, thus cheating me out of about 12 grand in tuition costs and a shot at a bachelor's degree. As it stands now I have the treatment (thanks Obama!) but no money to go back and a black mark on my educational record.\n\nSo yes, they are cheaters. And because of them, more college age kids can't get treatment they need just to function, let alone do well in school. And yes, I hate college kids who do this.

I understand it's much more complicated than that but come on...\n\nWell, [1960 Malcom X](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/malcolm-x-in-the-black-country-chris-arnot-revisits-smethwick-where-the-black-power-leader-claimed-coloured-people-were-being-treated-like-the-jews-under-hitler-1495312.html)\n\nWhat do you want people to move on from?  Institutional racism?  Educated people do more of this anyone else. White guilt in it self is the epitome of racism.  \n\nDiscrimination will always be allowed, this is kind of a stupid point. Republicans, like democrats simply want to protect their own.  \n\n\n\n&gt; Ban competition and businesses starting up- As a small business owner, this is the one that I probably have the biggest disagreement with. If anything, since starting my business 11 years ago, the Obama administration has made it much more difficult on all small businesses. Every small business owner I've talked to has this same opinion. Unless you own one, please don't throw irreverent opinions around because you don't really know what it's been like. So don't pretend to know the shit I've been through, trying to keep my business running and providing jobs for my employees. The Obama administration has raised taxes and made it more difficult to hire new employees. Which in turn, hurts the middle class and poor. I take very good care of my employees. From insurance, to having a livable/very comfortable wages. Depending on the position and experience of course. We've done everything we can to scrape by the last 11 years and keep our \"snorkels\" from taking on water. My grandfather said he's seen more businesses fail since Obama took office than any other time in his life. I've personally seen many good people that had been in business for over 20-40 years collapse during his tenure. I think the Democratic Party, while he's been in office, has been anything but helpful to small business. At least Bush gave us tax breaks. Not saying he was great by any means, but we got that which was nice. Que the Bill Murray meme. Especially during the shit storm that was the housing collapse. Without that help we would not be around either.\n\nI really don't know of any Republican mantra like this..   \n\n\n\n&gt; Force people to go to church- First of all, I think you meant \"go to Catholic Church\". Second of all, ain't fucking happening. Lol, I'm as atheist as the most liberal extremist out there. I don't have time to go to church and I don't need it to boost my morale. I feel as though I'm a great person at heart, look out for others in need and almost always put myself last. At least when it comes to family and friends.\n\nhaha  this one made me laugh the most..  Which church? \n\n[we can have church at home](http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-18-20/)\n\n&gt; Ban all religions except Christianity- You do realize this country is run by the Jewish right? They run the media and therefore, they run the opinion of 90% of the uneducated population. Which is, scarily, a very high percentage of the entire population/votes. I mean, there were more votes for the winner of American Idol than there were for the last presidential election. What the fuck!\n\nThe country is not run by Jewish People.  There are Jewish people in power though.  90% that's more than an over exaggeration. \n\n\n&gt; Easy, simple, non-invasive government- Non invasive is not restricting law abiding citizens the right to own and/or carry a firearm. I live just outside of Chicago and because of that one city in my state, they make it pretty damn difficult to exercise my second amendment rights. If I were to live in this great city that I truly do love, outside of politics, they charge you a ransom for each gun you register. What does that encourage? The answer is not registering your guns. What else am I not happy with? The fact that the employees that I have, that don't want the company insurance, are now \"taxed\" if they don't enroll in Obamacare.... Not only that, but it is more expensive than options that I already offer?! Talk about invasive! They don't even have a choice anymore! I suppose they can choose to take the fine. Thanks Obama ;)\n\n\nthe tax is low ;) but yea Obamacare isn't perfect..   \n\n\n&gt; My point is that both parties have extreme ideologies. Most I strongly disagree with. I strongly believe that every single person should be held accountable for themselves and their families. I strongly believe that laws are in place to allow immigration legally and that there is a right and wrong way to go about emigrating. I strongly believe that, as wrong as discrimination is, it's going to take another 200 years to get through. I also strongly believe that religion is made up bullshit to control the masses and push an agenda. What we need in this country is accountability and a drive to do better for not only ourselves, but as a whole. Too many people rely on others to provide for them. Too many people see something they want and feel entitled to have it without working for it. Too many people take everything they hear in a biased paper, news, radio, TV program as truth. Do your homework. Read/watch both sides of each story. Don't be an ignorant asshole. Try to listen more than speak up and you might learn something. Definitely, don't make shit up and be a lying cocksucker.\n\n\nTrue.  We are results based country through and through. No matter what anyone tells you. We'll take care of you when you fall. And if you end up homeless will through you some crumbs from our 200 dollar meals. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427547551", "subreddit": "PoliticalHumor", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This just demonstrates a gross ignorance about what AR-15s are and are not. I can tell you that when I started shopping for a rifle, every checkbox I had was ticked off in favor of the platform. Now, it's replaced my handgun as the go to weapon for home defense. It's just flat out better in every way. \n\nIn the beginning, I wanted something that would primarily be used at the range for target shooting beyond 100 yards. I considered 22LR, but 100 yards is kind of pushing it. Not so with. 223. It's a centerline round, significantly heavier, higher velocity, and dead accurate all the way out to 400-500yd. I also didn't want to be spending a fortune on ammo. That ruled out even heavier, more powerful hunting rounds. 223 is a nice compromise between rimfire and full power rifle calibers. It's fairly affordable as a target shooting round. Especially now. 22 is really hard to find and the cost per round has skyrocketed. (Thanks Obama)\n\nI also liked how configurable it is. Switching stocks, rail-mounted optics, bipods, all take seconds. Changing the muzzle device or even swapping a barrel is something I can do in my garage. I have installed trigger assemblies on my kitchen table. That's how easy the platform is to work with.  In fact, I built my rifle from scratch with zero experience or knowledge beforehand. Started with an 80% blank, milled it out, researched and shopped for every single part, spring, and pin in it. That experience served me well because when I've had a problem, I knew what was wrong and instinctively how to fix it. That kind of build from scratch, modify it on the fly, change caliber even...that's very difficult to find in another platform.\n\nFor hunting, 223 is an excellent varmint round. But, change a barrel and you've got .300 Blackout, a competent round for hunting deer. Using the same magazines even. Another barrel and you've got a. 410 for birdshot. They make barrels for 22LR, 9mm, .50DTC. 14.5“ barrels with a permanent muzzle device, barrels of different profiles, weight, material, lengths out to 24“. Options. Dozens and dozens of options. There's also hundreds of options for stocks, grips, handguards, rails, in every color under the rainbow.\n\nThey are a phenomenally easy gun to shoot, for people of any size. Very configurable for any frame. While some might struggle with the weight or recoil of a more powerful 12ga shotgun, almost anyone can shoot an AR. \n\nAn AR holds no more bullets that literally *any* magazine fed firearm--including handguns. Capacity is determined purely by the magazine, not the rifle.  Here in CA, we're limited to using 10 round magazines. You might argue there's no purpose for so-called \"high capacity\" magazines, but every single police officer would argue against you, as evident by the fact that they carry them every day while on duty and at home. You think cops find themselves facing dangerous criminals that aren't victimizing everyone else? And the average citizen doesn't have the resources, partners, body armor, or backup that your average cop has at their disposal. When a team of swat officers storm into a building to take down the one armed bad guy or crazed shooter not one goddamn person is commenting that they don't really *need* 30 round magazines to kill that one guy. That if they need more that 6 rounds they're a terrible shot. That they picked the AR platform because 'it looks cool'. Not because it's lightweight, maneuverable, accurate, easier to aim, low recoil, or less likely to over penetrate barriers than most handgun rounds or even buckshot.\n\nNot really a practical reason? I'd argue there's no practical reason to own anything else. It's the best all-around, general purpose, ubiquitous firearm that is not only suitable but excels at every purpose. There's a reason they've become the most common rifle in the US. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427699439", "subreddit": "PropagandaPosters", "score": 5, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Finally, finally, finally something that is relevant to my area of study. I'm gonna lay down my knowledge, while trying to leave out my good friends chemical equations. Also I have no idea how to format on reddit. This is my first post. Woo. \n\n\"Ozone, O3, is particularly important to life on Earth because it stops much of the high energy UV radiation (UV-B) from reaching the surface and damaging organisms.\"\n\nNo other atmospheric gas absorbs those wavelengths of radiation. \nWhen left to its own devices, the creation of O3 is about five times faster than its destruction. (as in naturally) \nBut when you introduce free radicals (molecules with unpaired Electrons) this fucks shit up. (that's the technical term) They are highly reactive and in the case of ozone cause even more ozone to be depleted (catalytic).\n\nSide note: low level ozone (in the troposphere) can cause breathing problems. \n\nNow free radicals can reaction with a lot, they do not want to have their unpaired electron. And this can lead to the build up of reservoir species. Molecules that will temporarily hold chlorine radicals, but then release them later. This is important to understand the reason why the ozone hole hangs around so long. \n\nSide note: chlorine radicals get all the bad press, but BFCs (bromo fluro carbons) are so SO much worse for depletion.\n\nWhy does depletion happen at the poles?\n\n\"The localised and seasonal depletion of \r\nozone giving rise to the “ozone hole” arises because of a particular set of geographic\rclimatic and chemical conditions that occur at the Antarctic Pole.\" the cold air provides a surface for these molecules to react. Which leads to big holes at the south Pole and lots of small holes in the north. \n\nSo where do these radicals come from?\n\nThe interaction of sunlight with CFCs break the carbon-chlorine bond homolytically and generate a chlorine and carbon radical. They are in low levels released by natural vegetation and the ocean. Buuuut as we know, used by man. On a massive Scale. In 1988 70 million tons of them were manufactured a year. When you use something that much you're waiting for a goof. \n\nBut why were they used THAT much?\n\n Because they're damn good chemically. An easy to produce, non toxic, non flammable, cheap multi purpose compound? The manufacturers dream. In fact in areas where they are absolutely necessary they are still used, despite the UN protocols. Eg: BFCs are horrendous for the atmosphere, but are some of the best fire extinguishers... In the Wurld. And nuclear subs, aircrafts etc. Would have them to be used. I guarn-damn-tee you that air force one would have a BFC fire extinguisher. Thanks Obama. \n\nSide note: BFCs work because they smother the fire effectively. If anyone else saw that air-speaker extinguisher post on reddit a few weeks back, that would never be used outside a novelty purpose for that same reason. It just wouldn't contain a serious fire. \n\nFurther use of CFCs include:\nAerosols\r\nFoam blowing agents\r\nRefrigeration/Air Con.\r\nSolvents\r\nInhalers\n\nIt's estimated that 90% of the use of these CFCs were released into the atmosphere. So that's hundreds of millions of tons. Before we realised there was a serious problem. \n\nSo the UN conviened and in its one most successful implementation stopped the implementation for CFCs globally. Timeline:\n\"Montreal Protocol\r\n\nUN sponsored agreement (Montreal 1986 onwards) to limit production and consumption \r\nof CFCs and BFCs. \nSince expanded to include all ozone depleting substances. \r\n\n1989 Montreal Protocol came into effect (industrialised production capped)\r\n\n1994 Industrial nations 0% BFCs, 25% CFCs\r\n\n1996 Industrial nations 0% CFCs CCl4, &amp; HCFC production freeze.\r\n\n2010 Developing countries 0% BFCs, CFCs\r\n\n[2015 EU Regulation: 0% HCFC use]\r\n\n2020 0% HCFC Industrial nations\r\n\n2030 All countries: 0% HCFC production (2040 consumption = 0%)\r\n\n[2050-70 Ozone hole expected to recover to 1980 levels]\r\n\nLimited (recycled) use of CFCs and BFCs are allowed for essential purposes. \r\nAnd regulations concerning collection &amp; destruction of fluorocarbons in old equipment.\"\n\nThere's are two really good graphs showing that this has worked and has been effective. But I don't know how to upload them to imgur just on my phone.\n\nBUT: thar be more problems. The replacement HCFCs do cause the same problems just slower. They were interims. HFCs work just fine, don't produce radicals. But then we get the other environmental atmospheric concern: global warming. \n\nIf we take the global warming potential of the big bag CO2 as 1. (arbitrary scale) these CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, Etc. Have a potential of upwards of 1000. So that means they are 1000 or more times worse at contributing to global warming than CO2. Welp. \n\nSo current research is going into things that dissappear relatively quickly in the atmosphere. (HFEs, HFOs) With low global warming potentials and low overall impact on the Atmosphere. Even if something fucks up, it's more okay because it will dissappear in 10 days, vs these CFCs in the atmosphere which take 80 years to dissappear. \n\nSo yeah. Science. Dropping lessons in chemistry Mr white. \n\nAnd just to clear up a few misconceptions \n\nhttp://www.celsias.com/article/how-guide-save-our-ozone-layer/\n\nThat list at the bottom? None of that has anything to do with ozone depletion. It's hilariously bad. You won't find aerosols that deplete ozone anymore. And everything else is not even related. \n\nI spent far too long typing that and now have to catch a train.

{"body": "&gt;USA just announced that they're giving 507 million dollars. Oh shit, they're doing that shit again. **The shit that got them in debt.** Thanks Obama.\n\nIt doesn't matter if they are in debt. They pay back all debt securities in the specified times and have for a very long time. There's a reason they have a AAA rating when it comes to their ability to pay back money (with interest). You think countries hate it when the USA borrows money from them or something? They make interest from this, and the USA has a reputation of being able to pay back what they borrow making it virtually risk-free.\n\nAs for the video, it's unfair for him to say that Russia is \"directly responsible\" for everything happening in Syria. However, Russia is clearly a supporter of Bashar's regime, and that alone gives me a negative view on the Russian gov. The responsibility of everything happening in Syria is ultimately because of Bashar's actions during the 2011 protests.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427828465", "subreddit": "exmuslim", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}
