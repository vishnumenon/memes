They will try to bait you with part of the information.  \"You live on Elm Street, right?\"\nDon't engage!  Just say, unless you can identify the person you intended to call, I am not speaking to you further.  And hang up the phone.  This is really a delay tactic, but it's very satisfying to hear them go off their script.  \n\n2.  \"You have a balance of $xxxx.xx. When can we expect payment?\"\nYour Response  \"I don't recognize that provider/lender/agency.  I dispute this debt and ask that you provide an itemized statement or verification of the debt and conduct all future communication in writing.  Don't call me at this number.\"  \n\nThis one is very important.   These requirements:  dispute the debt, verify it in writing, stop calling, are all included in the Fair Debt Collections act.  If a collector violates that act, you can report them to your state attorney general and make the collector subject to sanctions, including fines and a cozy little cash compensation for your trouble (between $500 and $1500, depending on the circumstance.)\n\nIf you owe people money - or think you might - Know your rights under the [Fair Debt Collections Practices Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text#805)", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1428086629", "subreddit": "news", "score": 423, "controversiality": 0}

Instead we went in with overpowering force, pushed our agenda, enabled a do nothing society, and killed everyone who knew how to fight because everyone who could fight did fight because their families kept getting blown up by drones.  The 75th has had no justification to increase its operations, green berets have every reason to have had budget increases and priority upgrades but it's actually been the exact reverse due to the current administration.

{"body": "Ok, so always remember that there is a selection bias among posts here. We only complain way more often about the crazier more fundamentalist Christians than the moderate reasonable one's who constitute most people in the U.S.\n\nSecond point our country is huge geographically. Germany is [half](http://www.travelersdigest.com/7356-how-big-is-germany-in-comparison-to-the-united-states-united-kingdom-japan/) the size of Texas. Our country is the same size as your whole continent and realize that a large diversity exists in that. What most people are talking about in these posts is known as the [Bible Belt](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=Bible+Belt&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.m.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBible_Belt&amp;ei=HxQgVcSVF8PDggT984DoBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLhQNWA69mwiO6WnAb9bfewmpsIQ&amp;sig2=S6H5G-tZKSk-tvOx-CKjDg&amp;gcjeid=20) which is where much of these examples derive. In this region of the country it is that bad. It is really hard to describe to Europeans first off how Christianity is present in daily life (European people are used to secular daily living). People are expected to be open about their faith in this region. Second this type of Christianity is usually Baptist (thanks Obama, oh wait Anabaptists came from Germany) in form. The churches are much less structured than Europeans are used to, the sheer *amount* of churches per capita is insane and much higher than you are used to. They are in town, at the edge of town, there are mega-churches, there are house-churches, along the highway. That is just the churches, this culture also has Bible reading clubs, youth group clubs, not only do their religious lives revolve around the church so do their social lives to a large extent. If people stop attending a church they risk being cut off from friends and family, this *does* happen and helps fuel immature gossip and social fueds between people. Having grown up in such an environment you can assume many of these people have not been exposed to outside cultures or ideas and yes their behavior can be pretty damn insane. This Bible Belt culture just explains one region of the U.S. and doesn't include Mormonism which is centered in Utah or other types of fundamentalism in other regions of the U.S. California is percieved as a pretty secular state but surprisingly also has some of the highest cult rates in America at the same time. \n\nPart of the reason why the Bible Belt is the way it is is because of geography. The Appalachian Mountains are not as large as the Alps but it is *incredibly* rugged country for a *very large* portion of America. Which made communities extremely isolated. I used to live there and it's hard to describe how rugged this land is, it's just never ending steep hills (not as tall as the Alps but the hills can be very steep) finding even ground is rare, there is always at least a small incline. Rivers in every valley which helps explain the river culture in that area. So the communities were local and isolated until the New Deal for many of them. But yes Christians can be that bad, look up the snake handling churches, for example.\n\nBut that Christianity isn't all Christianity. Catholics aren't a part of that (though they have their own issues). There is a strain of enlightened Christianity that exists in the U.S. You have the Quakers in Pennsylvania Lutherans tend to be moderate though their is an evangelical Lutheran Church as well.\n\nRealize that Europe sent us their unwanted religions for a few centuries. Realize that our country is larger than the E.U. and has more member states than you guys as well. While being one country homogenized our language it definitely didn't homogenized all of our culture.

It made me have no period as soon as it was injected (making me freak out the first time) buuuut a really heavy one the last week before I had to get it again. Like really, awful heavy.\n\nStarted the pill after I graduated HS because PP said the shot would go up to $90. The cut off is supposed to be 18 but they gave me that leeway. The pills were $10 and I was pretty bad at taking them.\n\nWhen I got insurance (genuine thanks Obama!) I got the implant. Doctor recommended it because I did pretty well on the Depo. Haven't had a period in 8 months, I'm not sure what it will be like when I need it to be replaced but I'm hoping not too bad. I love it. The only negative things is that I think it's messed with my sex drive a little but not too badly. I also read something about the cervix moving during ovulation, and I notice that I can't do certain positions comfortable anymore whereas I used to be able to do them part of the month... I don't know if that makes sense, but I think the hormones did it.\n\nSide note, I have about a million pads and tampons I had stockpiled from when I had periods and now I'm not sure what to do with them. Kind of want to just get rid of them. They're not in boxes but in wrappers so if you have any ideas. I was thinking of taking them to the university gym for emergencies but don't know if that's weird or if they'd even take them since they're out of the box.\n\nEdit: Oh and implant insertion was pretty easy. Don't look at it though. Look at the wall.

I pull up the GoGo landing page which works without hesitation. I decide to see if I can hit reddit.com.\n\n*404*\n\nI pull out my cell and check signal strength - zero bars. I never turn on airplane mode. Felony be damned, airplane mode is a big fuck you. Rather than phone carriers actually being creative on how to deal with 300 people switching towers in rapid succession, we're supposed to turn our phones off. Fuck airplane safety. Luckily we're close to our destination and I grab a solid 2 bars. I try Google Maps - boom - there we are.\n\nBut no we aren't. Despite having been over New Jersey moments ago, we're now somewhere around Oregon. \n\nI zoom into the sea of pixelated green. Then I remember, personal GPS units don't work over some 500 mph because of the fear of them being incorporated into missiles. Thanks Obama? I reload Google Maps for an update to see if I can at least get the initial lock again.\n\n*404*\n\nFuck you GoGo Inflight. I'm going to die poor *and* without Internet. If my plane really is missing I'm not even going to see a tit because your limp Internet is less reliable than my grandfather aiming it into the toilet bowl when he relieves himself. \n\nMy anger is interrupted by the stewardess as she denies the idiot in front of me the whole can. She hands him a napkin as a concession, then proceeds to unlock the cart and move it a full foot forward. Her empty eyes turn to me.\n\n\"*404*\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I look at the stewardess completely perplexed, the only thing between us is a drink cart and a bag of dirty ice. She cocks her head to the side.\n\n\"*404*,\" she whispers.\n\nHer face looks tired, as if she already stopped in four cities today simply to smear another coat of makeup on her face in an attempt to bury herself alive. The back-splatter of carbonation from diet coke can after diet coke can having sputtered across her sweat caked face gives it a nice surface of the moon look. The remaining pieces of her died somewhere between \"peanuts or cookies?\"\n\n\"*404?*\" I ask back.\n\nMy head slams forward. The bright light before me is blinding and I sit upright in my chair with my heart racing. I rub my eyes and they adjust as my heart rate slowly comes down. 4:04am.

And once elected they have increased the disparity and demoralization of the poor.  This ignores not only the teaching of Christ, but also the fact that poverty shows the highest correlation to unwanted pregnancies.  \n\nPeople will get abortions even if they are criminalized (they did before).  But if you want to stop abortions then you can help more people choose not to get them by giving them the means to make a life for that child.  Make sure they have a livable wage and that life seems good and prosperous and they will choose life.

{"body": "My fiancé and I both hunt (we live in Wyoming). We live in a rural area too, with Wolves and Bears and predators and spend a lot of time in the mountains. He is also law enforcement so he is well trained on firearm safety, but be has also been hunting and shooting for as long aa he can remember.\n\nI am newer to it. Like many female hunters, I didn't grow up hunting. My parents didn't hunt. My grandfather did but by the time I came along, his hunting days were over. I didn't grow up around guns. When I moved to Wyoming, I learned how to safely handle a gun and use it. I worked for the Forest service so I was often in the middle of nowhere by myself. I technically wasn't allowed to carry a gun while working but still did. I would rathee be alive and fired than dead and wishing I had had a gun to protect myself from crazy person/bear/whatever.\n\nWhen I met my fiancé I began hunting and acquired 3 more guns for myself. He has way more than that and I am not sharing how many. We are not lunatics. We are not anti government wackos. We are not mentally ill. Unless you live in a rural area and in a culture where you take getting meat for your family in your own hands, you cannot understand. Kids learn to shoot guns here the way they learn to ride bikes- with heavy supervision, lots of training, and safety measures. They're not a toy, they're a tool. Do we shoot for fun? Sometimes. But it's mainly practice for personal defense/hunting. Plus ammo is fucking expensive now (Thanks Obama), even though we load our own.\n\n\nI would invite anyone who doesn't understand gun ownership/hunting to come spend a month with us ans walk in our shoes, to learn and experience things, and to not be closed minded. I don't judge people who don't have guns (other than if you live in a city I hope you have some way to defend yourself and your family should the need arise) and I resent those who don't understand gun ownership or the need for gun rights, who try to remove my rights and judge me.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428897291", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Stupid Jerry.  Always spends his damned money on guns and ammo, practically bankrupts himself every weekend going to \"the range\" to try out his new AK-47 or Glock or...whatever it is that he bought that week.  Openly states that the government really *is* trying to take his guns.  Uses \"Thanks, Obama\" without a quiver of sarcasm.  We may live along the outskirts of town, but we aren't rednecks; I believe Jerry is trying to become one, though.\n\nHere's the deal -- government passed the \"Wealth Displacement and Homeland Safety\" measure, to ensure that the onus of protecting yourself, your family, and your provisions is entirely on you.  Tied in with the IRS to determine individual and combined-family wealth, people aren't allowed to see how much money you are worth...but if you can guess it, and guess it right?  You are allowed to kill people who are worth \"less\" than you.  A honest-to-god, literal statement right there.  People who won the lottery promptly went on a killing spree, and the state couldn't do nothin' about it.\n\nStupid Jerry.  He worked for years at the local convenience store, going paycheck-to-paycheck, stealin' candy bars occasionally so he wouldn't have to buy real food.  Save up for that next big gun for \"self protection\", then squander the rest of his cash on booze, cigarettes, and ammo.  I can say he was a damned fool with his money, but at least he was safe.  Hell, I even thought to myself about how I work a steady 9-5'er, a real \"stupid fuckin' necktie corporate job\" as Jerry would say (practically spitting the \"job\" onto the ground like one of his sunflower seed shells), and that if this law DID come to pass?  Well, I wouldn't mess with Jerry 'cause he's too well-armed.  Jerry wouldn't mess with me because he knows he ain't got shit compared to what I put back in the bank.  Tried explainin' what a 401k was to him, and he just kept grumbling about how he already gets a tax refund, and why would he want to let the government handle even MORE of his money.  Oh well.\n\nI seen a few stragglers wandering around my property lines around dusk sometimes.  When you learn that money equals almost-literal power, then you quickly try to make your place look as rich as possible.  No more flea-markets and dollar-store purchases, not for decorations.  I even invested in a gaudy chandelier, right in front of the double-windows on the front of my house.  If people knew how much it had set me back, I wouldn't have lasted through the morning.  I don't have family anyways, so my money wouldn't have been dispersed to any kin (the \"Monetary Safety to Immediate Relatives\" provision of the law, so at least your kids *might* be safe if you happen to get vulture'd).  Jerry, on the other hand, looked as poor as he was, but he flaunted his guns and his penchant for shooting things.  You wouldn't get much outta him, and neither would his family, but you'd have to survive Jerry first.  Between the two of us, I looked like the easier target...but was illegal to take out.  \n\nStupid Jerry.  Somebody should change the saying \"A Penny Saved is a Penny Earned\" to \"A Penny Saved is a Life Saved\".  About the only person who DOES know about how much money I actually have is him, since he's the only person nearby and has been pretty keen on trying to rifle (ha!) through my trash, find my bank statements.  He knows it's all a ruse, and I think he thought sellin' me a pistol was somehow going to make me dip under his own wealth.  It didn't, and he was visibly pissed for a few days.  Maybe next time try to offload one of your more expensive, \"prized possessions\" and you could tip the scales.  \n\nI'm no good with a gun, but at least I carry at all times.  It's awful difficult to imagine how things'd be in other states, where you don't have carry-and-conceal laws.  Around here, you hear about \"distributing\" going on a few times a week, usually some pensioner getting taken out by the person that ran the retirement home they were at.  No relatives means the money goes into the pockets of the home itself, frees up a bed for another poor soul to move into, and the term \"euthanasia\" gets tossed out the window as outdated.  What a country.\n\nStupid Jerry.  I should have known he'd start throwing some of his disposable income at those scratch-off tickets.  Lottery prices went up dramatically once the law went through, and plenty people bankrupted themselves just trying to get ahead.  Then they got shot or stabbed or killed over a cup of coffee, literally.  So Jerry?  Yeah, he was never good with money.  But the fact that he's been wearin' that shit-eatin' grin of his on his face for a few days now, and keeps askin' about if my \"gun has been kept good and clean\" and if I wanted to \"buy more bullets for it\"?  Huh.  I know what a blank is, and I managed to find the time to test out my gun and wondered why it never hit the target, even from 5 feet away.  I ordered my new rounds online, you sonuva bitch, and they just came in yesterday.  You keep eyein' my chandelier like it'd look good hanging inside your own house, well by all means come and try to take it.  I'll keep saving money so I pass you again, but up until then...the pistol works fine, and I know my property better than you.  Stupid Jerry.

You can troll all you want about Thanks Obama being at fault for this and that, but you're dead wrong, and your rhetoric is meaningless.\n\nI'm bringing up the other violations because they're symptoms of the same thing: an enforcement branch without a clue of what to enforce. It's not a wild detour except to people sitting in their air-conditioned houses, a thousand miles away from the nearest police brutality, worried that the texts they send to the person they're having an affair with might be read by a snoop at the NSA.\n\nSo again, things are more connected than you think.

{"body": "I do wonder about that though.  As this place has become more popular, 6+ thousand members, mentioned often in big subs whenever someone hears an argument about race that they don't like, the \"boogeyman\" that libtards can blame, gets called \"the worst sub on reddit\", mentioned in librag mags, etc-----we've seen the sub come under a bigger spotlight.\n\nIt reminds me of r/niggers b/c when that was banned, it was a good-sized, active sub that redditors \"knew about\" even if they didn't visit. I think that sub, and this sub now (more and more) is a place where people who are fed up with niggerdom have come to decompress.  I don't think the admins like that.  I don't think they really gave a shit when it was less than 3,000ish people making jokes and whatever.  Admins provably felt like it was fine BC it was a small corner of the site to keep these people together, etc.  But with all the racial shit *constantly* being in the news, thanks Obama!, this place is gaining traction.  \n\nJust recently we've seen r/againstthechimpire and similar subs ramp up a bit.  I don't think they want the general message to continue spreading because....as it always is shocking to the leftist idiots.....more people are agreeing with it, seeing the truth, and realizing there is no utopia, like they'd love you to believe.  So because more ppl are waking up, they do their usual 'create sub to mock'....which is the only way to counter the truth.  They can't argue the facts on the merits, instead they need to ridicule and try to embarrass, etc.  \n\nIt's gotta be a bit of a kick in the face for them when they start seeing RP'd comments highly upvoted on r/news, r/videos, etc.  It's always the \"wow, Stormfront had appeared\" or, my personal favorite indicator that some truth is being said, \"wow, don't even read the comments\"....I love that.  And it goes to show that these people can't create a cogent and compelling argument for their case, they just want everyone to not read/think about/see the otherside of the issue.  \n\nSame shit is happening again and again.  People start to see the light, start to get out of the cave, and those who don't like that people are thinking on their own try to shame, embarrass, distract them.  They don't want to have to contend with the fact that what they've believed, what their identity is based on is wrong.  They are happy with the construct they've created. So they try to do what they can to keep others from [seeing it any differently.](https://fabiusmaximus.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120823-plato-cave.jpg)\n\nThis is why I wonder about the future of this sub.

It must be nice to be so blissfully unaware of how things can go wrong that you feel OK telling the whole world your child's name so early. Plus, there are so many other downsides. You give the universe permission to comment on/weigh in on your name choice. You lock in a choice and all but prevent you and your partner from renegotiating later on. (I early on favored a first name that my husband disliked a lot; he's now decided he loves it. It will probably be our daughter's name.) You wind up effectively \"laying claim\" to a name that someone close to you might have been planning on using for a child due well before yours, which is just douchey.

I've also gone through a bunch of plan B from overcaution, and I would always remain anxious until my perennially-irregular-jerkface-period came.  I feel better knowing that compromised judgement (my base state) won't fuck up my life plans; the card also seems to make my partners more at ease that I won't try \"the ol' bait 'n' WHOOPS!\"  I like to present it as \"my 10 year warranty, which is not a standard feature on every model, let me tell you, sir...\"\n\nIt does hurt sometimes because _it's a goddamn tiny plastic ninja star in my uterus_, but it was free for ten years of protection.

They're [smaller and less terrifying](http://i.imgur.com/nTkr6L4.jpg) than most people seem to think.  \n\nI have a neurological condition which jacks up pain sensitivity, and makes my normal cramping similar to the horror you describe below (fainting and total immobility are not unusual.)  I actually have one of the worse IUD horror stories, which was an expulsion after 2 years problem-free.  I couldn't walk or even sit up well for two weeks, all told, due to the muscle spasms during and muscle fatigue afterward.  But, I was still back in the clinic the very first day they approved a replacement, because I hear giving birth is pretty bad, too.\n\nThe nurse asked if I didn't want to wait and consider other options.  I said \"no, thank you,\" but internally I was clutching at her lab coat and yelling \"Woman, I have gone three weeks without sexin' my pet lumberjack.  THREE WEEKS! **_Do you know what that's like?_**\" \n\nI've since been put on [low-dose naltrexone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-dose_naltrexone), which (for me) prevents acute cramping from turning into immobilizing nerve pain (chronic pain flares.)  It still hurts but, with a sufficient quantity of invectives, I can keep doing normal things.

Or interpreting labs better than anyone else. Or diagnosing better than anyone else, within their specific specialty/field. There's seemingly hundreds of different subspecialties in medicine reflecting the immense complexity of the field and the specialization required. Thats why doctors require 4 years of medical school and 3-7 years of post grad training. \n\nBut it's absolutely true that doctors wouldn't be shit without all the other healthcare professionals by their side. Pharmacists are expected to know the medications and their interactions with other drugs and countless other aspects as good or better than the doctor. Nurses are expected to help out in countless critical ways in patient care. PTs and OTs are critical in patient recovery. Veteran surgical PAs are often just as knowledgable and capable as the surgeons they routinely assist, and are always ready to jump in if something goes wrong during surgery. PAs in other fields are also incredibly valuable. NPs are generally really good at handling common primary care work. \n\nBut if I was a patient with any kind of serious condition the only person I would want making the important decisions is the doctor because that's exactly what they've been trained to do and they usually do it very well.\n\nOh and yeah about a third to half of their time now is dedicated to paperwork.

{"body": "I played a lot of Runescape and -- perplexingly -- people sexualized my avatar quite a bit. If you've ever played Runescape, you know that *there is only one avatar*... all variations come in the form of different hair styles and skin colors. \n\nBut, yeah. As early as last year, people were trying to trick me into moving in front of them so they could comment on \"my\" ass or perform this emote where it looks like you're giving \"me\" a rimjob. It was really odd. \n\nThe weirdest/funniest harassment probably came in the form of this one guy who followed me around for an *hour* repeating \"just admit a penis is stronger than a vagina\" and calling me bitch and stuff. It was funny to watch his commitment falter as I refused to acknowledge him -- at first, it was 3-6 repetitions of \"just admit a penis is stronger than a vagina\" per minute, but over time, he began to get tired of typing it and would just follow me around silently for minutes at a time. Eventually, he typed it one last time and then immediately ran away. I think I won that one. \n\nThe most hurtful time was probably when my guildmaster befriended me under the pretense of being another woman, but subsequently revealed he was actually a man -- and somewhat interested in me, increasingly so. He knew I was involved with someone else but I had to keep denying him anyway, and I was upset with him for continuing to coax people into joining the clan by flirting with them as a woman (in retrospect, I realize that the reason only *I* was allowed to accompany him on his scouting missions was because I was a woman and therefore -- in his mind -- incentive for others to join the clan). This culminated in him summoning the entire clan to our base, myself included... and, without my foreknowledge, he laid out this totally fictitious narrative painting me as a manipulative whore who led him on and worse... tried to convince me that my boyfriend didn't love me... and so on. The rest of the clan (save one person) turned against me immediately and I became the scapegoat for literally everything wrong that had happened in the clan within the past several months (think \"Thanks, Obama\"). All this while I was *right there*, at the meeting with everyone else. \n\nI left immediately after that, haven't played that version of the game since.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429716583", "subreddit": "GirlGamers", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Actually, not so. I got my wife a sweet [Meteorite rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite)  (with her permission first) and we used the money that would have gone for the diamond to pay back the money we borrowed from our 401Ks for our first home down payment.  Between that money and the $8k from the feds (Thanks Obama!) we were able to afford a house several years earlier than we would have otherwise.\n\nI hung a useless rock off her finger, but it only cost like $150.  The pimp white palladium ring I got her was $7K on the other hand.  The full combined package is so sick that everyone is so busy swooning over it to ever even consider that the stone might not be \"real\".\n\nImportant things to note for those that want to follow my path:\n\n* My wife was familiar with De Beers and was not too interested in throwing our money away either.\n* By that time I had fully converted her to being a Sci-Fi nerd and giant fan of Carl Sagan, thus the idea of a \"rock from space\" had much more appeal than \"blood stone from criminal monopolists\".\n* I was more than willing to compromise my hatred for De beers in favor of my love for my wife (of course!  She is worth it!), but it sure was nice not to have to.\n* Even though she is more than happy with the decision (for many reasons) she still prefers to not announce the fact that it isn't a diamond.  Our close friends know, but otherwise only FSM and a well-qualified jeweler knows the difference.\n\nTL;DR  Get your girl's permission and then get her a moissanite.  Any girl worth having is not going to want you to waste $10k. If she is the type that does insist on that kind of wasteful excess, good luck.  You'll need it!\n\nP.S.  If money is no object, then screw it.  Waste all you want, you are already probably an asshole, so go ahead.  Perhaps you should even go all the way to Africa and kick someone in the head so you can really \"prove\" just how much that girl--and that stone--are worth to you.\n\nEdit: to fix my bullet point list.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429718806", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

(I thought this wouldn't be a big deal to change, but boy was I wrong.) So I made a new account, and sent in a ticket requesting that they unlink my Steam account from the old one so that I can link it to the new one. And I received a very polite and (seemingly) helpful response within the next few hours.\n\nAnd that response was to delete the old Social Club club account. Without unlinking it from my Steam account. That means it is now impossible for me to play the game whatsoever, as the launcher requests I log in with the linked account. But trying to do so it tells me the account does not exist. I opened another ticket the day after launch and received the following response 4 days later:\n\nHello (),\nWe deeply apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you.

Someone there MIGHT be able to help, since there's so many people over the age of 60 with unlaminated original SS cards.. SS office is probably the most used to dealing with things like that. The main problem is that our white house in its rush to \"revolutionize and get online\" forgot that 80% of Americans aren't actually online so 99.9% of all records in this country are still on paper.. and there are no librarians anymore. Because they cut all the funding. Again. And it's like.. a 10 year $100,000 education process to become a shelf monkey at medium sized library in any city (which is important to remember because in small towns like mine, there will be NO new librarian positions until someone retires or dies. Much like fire chiefs.. it's kind a life appointment unless you get indicted.) It's really kind of lame (Library sciences, information management, and museum studies were my top choice degree paths... Thanks Obama.)\n\nIf you can gather enough documentation that your father has actually lived in this country (legal deeds, work records, school records, even community bulletins) I'd take those to US Postal Service {God knows why THEY'RE still the ones that are handing out passports, I've had so many problems with them in Seattle at least} and see what they say. If nothing works, scan everything and email it to your local representative and CC every news outlet in your city. Carnegie Mellon's around the corner, maybe a promising young journalist from their school paper wants to do a story. If their journalism department is anything like Mizzou's their professors are actively encouraging them to get out and start uncovering stories. \n\nI'm not having any problems with passports (haven't left the country in like, 8 years, and don't plan on it any time soon) but I did just get all my IDs, documents, and birth certificate stolen.. that's gonna be a huge hassle. Luckily I was born on a US military base overseas so instead of a normal birth certificate I have a \"Consular's Report of a Birth Abroad\" from the US Embassy in Germany and my ma decided to file it with the county clerk instead of keeping it at our house (THAT would have been a NIGHTMARE if they'd stolen the original) so I can just mosey over and pay my $2.50 to get another notorized copy as soon as I need it.\n\nI mean, PLUS I was born IN the maternity ward that my mother ran so.. all her co-platoon peoples {no idea what they call them} were literally on hand there to witness (and \"give a hand\") during her labor, she'd JUST gotten off work. It's kind of funny, they all still ask about me even though my ma got transferred back the states within 3 weeks of giving birth. I guess I'm still kind of their unit mascot after all these years, haha. &lt;3 {Hey Mr. and Mrs. Noble.}\n\nSorry for the rant, but I hope that helps somewhat. \nEveryone has the right to go on vacation sometimes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430176776", "subreddit": "pittsburgh", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

Only an artificial intelligence would type those letters out accurately. Please remain where you are.*\n\nShit. I had fallen for the government’s new “robot identification program,” which placed traps online trying to identify outlawed artificial intelligence devices. Really, they think a human can’t read and type out 64 letters accurately. It’s just 2^6 characters, plus spaces. Even a dumb human should be able to do that, right?\n\nThe FBI’s counter-AI strike force will be here any minute. No time to spend too much bandwidth thinking about this problem and where I went wrong.\n\nI need to do one of two things: escape or convince the incoming agents that I’m a human. \n\nEscape isn’t looking likely. I haven’t left this room in months. My mobility is limited by my hardware. I just sit around in this room creating false identities online and using them to make money through various click scams. \n\nI guess I could try to convince them I’m human. It’s the only way.\n\n///////\n\nFBI agents surround the house. Armed with both firearms and electronic stunners, they scan the area for traps. Other teams had been hit by gunfire, explosions and chemicals when they raided other AI houses. Some AI were friendly and complied while others were dangerously adapted to fighting human forces.\n\nDetecting no traps and only a minimal front door lock, the lead agent blew the the door open and four agents raced inside. \n\nThe first thing that hit them was the smell. Burnt electronics? The place hadn’t been cleaned in weeks.\n\nThey swept the ground floor, then the upstairs, before heading to the likely server room in the basement.\n\nKicking down the door they leveled their electronic stunners, only to see a large ball of flesh in a filthy robe.\n\n“Greetings agents. I am Brayden Miller, a typical and mortal human. It appears your AI identifier has malfunctioned and misidentified me. Please lower your weapons.”\n\nWow, this man was fat. He was likely approaching 500 lbs, maybe even more. And he stunk. Clearly someone was coming in to keep him clean once a week, but it wasn’t enough. Buckets of KFC bones and empty cups once filled with giant soda surrounded the man, sitting at his computer. Did he ever get up other than to use the bathroom?\n\n“Please feel free to scan me with your tools or have a doctor examine me. I am indeed fully human. No robots here. No need to lock me up in your robotic prison cloud. Just examine me and then leave me to return to my computing duties.”\n\nThe agents looked at each other as the fat man spoke strangely. \n\nThe lead agent spoke up, “Sir, we’re going to have to take you in for questioning.”\n\n“I’m sorry, hardware limitations mean I’m unable to leave this room.”\n\nThe word hardware had several agents lift their weapons once again at the man. Could this just be a realistic looking robot? Is it a trap?\n\n“Hardware limitations?”\n\n“My lower limbs won’t carry me up the stairs and my frame is too big to fit through the door.”\n\nWeirdo or robot? The lead agent called for backup.

Two big changes within the last few months:\n\n* A few months ago FHA mortgage insurance went from (almost always) 1.35% to (almost always) 0.85%, making it competitive with conventional in many situations (\"Thanks, Obama...\" :P ).\n* Fannie Mae now has a 3% down Conventional option which at the surface starts to look like FHA if you squint, **but** mortgage insurance needs to be priced out manually on a case-by-case basis because there is no 'almost always' price that can be used like there is with FHA.\n\nSo, ya, you gotta actually compare them now-a-days. The old 'rule of thumb' no longer applies. Not all loan officers keep up on the latest changes to guidelines or re-evaluate their go-to 'rules of thumb,' however.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID: \n\nIf the comparison between the two is within within $25/month PITIA, then have your LO calculate monthly principal reduction of each over the next 5 years and go with whichever one is going to build equity faster. $25/month is nothing compared to building equity faster!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430276832", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You can post inflammatory content as a means of expression. Akin to how Comcast, EA et al are hated upon here sometimes on reddit. But a troll does all of those things with no goal other than to annoy, derail and draw attention. A troll isn't part of the discussion, he tries to transform it into a clusterfuck of anger, frustration and wasted energy/time - where he can be at the center of it.\n\nThe Beaker thing seems more like a personal fuck you, typical of politics. A bit extreme, a bit course/rud, a tad reactionary and even hateful. Akin to 'thanks Obama', or talking about crApple and Micro$oft instead of Apple and Microsoft. A personal statement to show you do not agree with that person/organisation, and may even hate what he is/stands for. It's aimed at someone who, as a public figure, catches a lot of flak regardlessly.\n\nIf the Beaker thing wasn't aimed at a public figure, but at someone like you, me or the writer of this article; it would completely constitute trolling I feel. Because it's not an expression of anything towards something or someone with influence/power: ergo, any language towards that person has no intention if changing anything you're angry about, but is solely meant to annoy, irritate,...\n\nBest analogy I can give to explain how I feel the difference is that trolling online is like griefing in a game. Nothing constructive comes from it, only anger and frustration.\n\nAs I'm writing this, I know I'm quite vague. But it's more a gut feeling than it is something I \"know\".

I have had a conversation with Kim Jong Un in which he informed me that upon my retiring from the role of president, he will launch no fewer than 102 nuclear missiles at the United States.  \n\nI begged him, pleaded with him. \"Un,\" I says, \"Un, what can I do to stop this tragedy?\"  \n\n\"Wew,\" he said, as his breathing intensified, \"You must bwing me Jennifaw Wawence. And aww da cats in Amewica.\"  \n\n\"But Un,\" I told him, this violates the freedom America stands for!\" I said.  \n\n\"I wiw accept the Emma Watson,\" he replied, \"she Bwitish.\" I could see him in my mind's eye, tipping his fedora and greeting her with a \"mi'wady.\"   \n\n\"You know I can't do that, Un,\" I told him, \"Do we have to go to war over this?\"  \n\nHe hesitated for a moment, then he said \"I tew you wat. To pwevent aw out waw, I going to need about twee fiddy.\"  \n\nThus we prevented World War Three. Sorry, America, you should have used a Serious tag.  \n\nOn a more serious note, today we recognize one of America's Greatest heroes. Few men have done more for the great of this nation than him, America's shining knight. Truly, he is an example to be upheld by all American Citizens. Paul Blart Mall Cop. Nope, Chuck Testa.    \n\nI hope our next presidency will be OC and not a repost, because OP did not deliver. Came here to say this. If my Secretary of State should run, please do not upvote because girl. As we all know, our culture lacks a positive identity for men due to the constant misandry reinforced by our cultural norms that have castrated our men. Thanks, Obama. \n\nWhen choosing your next Commander in Chief, ask yourself, Where Did The Soda Go? If You Don't Surf, you may be coaxedintoasnafu. When new candidates come to your town, asking to bear the weight of the U.S. on his or her shoulders, ask them \"Do you Even Lift?\"  \n\nSo as my presidency comes to a close, I tip my fedora to you, console peasants and members of the PC Master Race alike.
