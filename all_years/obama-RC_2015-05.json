{"body": "&gt; I grew up in rural Austria, right at the border to Germany, born in the year when the Berlin wall came down.\n\nI was married and had a child at that time.  I remember the \"cold war\" well, and find our current leadership is not only putting us back into one, but into some hot ones as well.  Feels like \"Vietnam Part II\"\n\n&gt; the vast majority of central Europeans and beyond have a very good idea [...] In school alone we spend between two and six whole semesters talking about the second world war [...] deceived on such a large scale \n\nAmerican government-run schools used to be like that. But after 30 years or so of \"remembering it\", they decided there were narratives to push, which were more important than all that.  So kids born from the mid-70s onward likely learned little to none of it, nor much of their own country's founding.\n\nSo congrats to EU schools for remembering and teaching. American kids (at large) are exactly as I described them in my last comment, though.  And their ignorance is killing the country.\n\n&gt; So don't take the fact that we like [...] our free health-care, our free education ...\n\nNothing is free.  The money for those things comes from somewhere. \n\n&gt; ... to mean that we accept big government and government overreach\n\nLike/dislike is kind of the wrong verbiage.  More like trust/distrust, from my perspective.\n\nI distrust them (because they are just flawed, corruptible, greedy humans).  If you don't distrust them, then what conclusion is one to make about your feelings for them?\n\n&gt; certain aspects of running a society should be firmly in the hands of a government, as long as that government is really accountable to its people (which in the US seems to be a long gone phantasy). \n\nYes, *certain* ones.  Not too many (as is the current case in the US).  And it's not so long gone that it couldn't be won back, sadly likely at great personal cost, like our forebears did.\n\n&gt; I do agree with you, that the means by which a population can hold its government accountable are eroding in many ways, as any dissent is too easily discredited and crushed or ignored.\n\nYeah. I tend to think our [IMO partisan, complicit, and as such completely worthless] mainstream media needs to be the first thing to go.  That would go a long way towards disarming \"easily discredited\".  I used to think Shakespeare was correct about lawyers, but these days I'd put the media first.\n\n&gt; The American people's awareness that they have a constitution at all might be their strongest defense, but its simultaneous worship as sort of \"perfect document of absolute truth\"\n\nWell that's a bit contradictory.  Most Americans under 35 can't enumerate even 3 of our first 10 amendments, or explain what they mean.  (Once again, \"thanks, government education\" for ensuring the most recent 2 generations are for the most part brainwashed and ignorant).  \n\nAs such, these generations do not by any stretch of the imagination \"worship\" the document, and many are (ignorantly) hateful about it, saying crazy shit like it should be shredded (again, thanks \"govt ed\", but more specifically of late, also \"thanks, Obama\" for calling it \"a flawed document\" in a perfectly orchestrated sound bite designed for the short-attention span kids who believe your crap even though every promise you've made has turned out to be a lie)\n\n&gt; especially things like the 2nd amendment seems a bit medieval from my perspective\n\nOnly because you don't understand it.  I didn't used to understand it, either.\n\n&gt; in todays reality appears to both make the country weaker (by the shear amount of \"accidental\" killings and domestic terror through privately armed people without sufficient training as well as over-equipped and under- or inappropriately trained police forces)\n\nThere is no \"shear amount of \"accidental\" killings\" (and I have no idea why the airquotes, which would seem to imply many are intentional?)   \n\nSorry, but that's just rhetoric that you've been fed.  Hell, American \"progressives\" (a poor word for them, really) are fed it by each other and their biased media choices as well.  The stats behind that rhetoric are cherry-picked lies.  The news exaggerates; they endlessly play and reply gun crimes and deaths, and ignore the thousands of times in the same period in which people used them to defend themselves from violent home invasions, muggings on the street, robberies at their businesses, and so on.\n\nUntrained police are an atrocity. Most citizens, outside of police work, who prefer to keep one handy \"just in case\" are FAR more practiced and judicious with their guns.  Cops have legal immunity, which is why they can accidentally shoot sleeping children through the head, or burn and disfigure them with flashbang grenades, usually at the wrong address, and not lose their jobs for it.  If a citizen shoots someone irresponsibly like that, they would be crucified in the news and put in jail for life. A citizen can't get off scot free for shooting a fleeing person in the back, either, but the cops sure do.\n\n&gt; simultaneously not being enough to give the supposed good populace that would defend the nation against a military overreach by Washington any real power in such a scenario\n\nYes, not everyone would rise to the challenge.  Less than 3% of the population rose up in 1776.  In todays terms, that's &lt;1M people, and comes out to less than 1/5 of the NRA's membership.  I think there are enough people. \n\nMore perspective:  The number of hunters (aka practiced sharp-shooters) in the individual states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania individually have numbers putting them on par with top-10 armies in the world.  Just a few states together would be the largest army in the world.  Sure, their weaponry is outmatched.  Same can be said of all the guerrilla fighters in third-world countries who've done such a good job keeping first-world armies busy and scrambling for decades on end.\n\n&gt; covert, nightly \"snatch and grab\" operations\n\nThat would work for a couple weeks, with likely no more than a few hundred or thousand taken, until word got around.  The other 900000 of them would be very angry, and more than ever would join the fight, likely then exceeding the 3% figure.\n\n&gt; But overall we seem to be on a similar page and I'd expect if we had this discussion in person over a beer or two we'd find a lot of common ground.\n\nTrue that.\n\n&gt; I certainly failed in the \"keep-it-short department\"\n\nLOL, I wasn't going to mention it, but noticed.  I'm guilty of it, too. These subjects simply cannot be discussed in any meaningful way in the \"140 character text bites\" that most people's attention spans are limited to these days.\n\nBack to the (more OT) regulatory conversation... by total coincidence this just came across my desk:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lHuvXiY.jpg\n\nIt's poking fun, of course, but is essentially the counter-argument I was making in my last, long reply.\n\nCheers!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430683443", "subreddit": "restorethefourth", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm not saying that because of what the Democrats did before that they're racist now, I'm saying it's in spite of it. They still haven't learned that treating people differently based on race is wrong, only now they're motivated by guilt rather than power. Republicans, on the other hand never supported segregation, and they still don't. They don't support quotas, affirmative action, or literally any measure that separates the races legislatively. The Republicans were and still are liberal, they just used to be more socialist and Americans forgot what liberal meant.\n\nAnd the reason I don't \"have the basic integrity to admit the republican party has a problem with rampant racism in its ranks\", is because I don't think that's true. If it were, how would they have candidates of more than one race? I can't seem to find a single major ethnic group that isn't allowed, let alone is without a republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDo you have any argument other than \"you look like a pathetic, delusional child\"?

{"body": "You have great stats, and armor skills that will help you learn monsters faster.\n\nTo begin with, make sure you always have 150 max health. Take max potions, or eat for felyne foodie if you like. This is important because with 600 defense and 150 health, you can survive two hits from most monsters. If you get hit, it's nice to have a little breathing room before you need to heal.\n\nSecond, go on a few suicide runs solo. How about 2 with lance and 2 with gunlance? What you want to do is just poke the monster a bit so you can experience both its normal and rage mode timing, and see all of its attacks.\n\nYou've fought Teostra, so let's use that as an example. How many attacks does it have and what new moves does it get in G rank? Let me see how many I can think of:\n\n* Roar: typically signals entering rage mode. Decent opportunity to get a few hits off.\n* Turn: Opening often exploited by burst weapons like hammer or GS. Great because you know the head will be facing you when this move ends.\n* Claw swipe: little to no warning. Applies blast I think. Because of this attack, I never approach the sides of the body or head with a short weapon.\n* Tail sweep: Sufficient opening for whatever you want to hit with. Applies blast in rage mode.\n* Charge: It's a charge. You're in G rank. Figure it out.\n* Curving charge: this was my bane back in MHFU. I think my adaptation was to stay further from a monster's head when it's idle. I can also tell how much it's going to curve now, and quickly decide which way to evade.\n* Ranged nova: new in G rank. goes back on hind legs as if for a roar, and then you die. Haven't seen this much because I haven't done gunning on Teo. Seems like a pain. I don't want to gun Teo.\n* Nova: Happens 100 seconds after entering rage mode. People talk about this a lot. Ask them about it because I just guard point it.\n* Leap: he leaps. Lots of monsters do this. Just remember this move when he stares at you from a mile away and you're thinking \"nah, he can't hit me from here\".\n* Flame breath: a billion knockback. Block if you must. He telegraphs it well and always starts it on his right. Plan accordingly.\n* Explosion breath: rage mode version of flame breath. One stage less knockback. Applies blast. If trying to block this, you should know that it hits directly in front of him on the first explosion, due to the AOE. **Additional note**: While you can block both the first and second (when his head comes back) hit of flame/explosion breath, you only need to block the first. This is useful for getting off your AEDs faster if using a CB.\n* Back hop: leaves a huge cloud of explosive powder where he was. Obstructs your vision. Sometimes he makes it explode right afterwards with his flint bite, other times he charges back through the cloud while you're trying to regain sight on him. Thanks Obama.\n* Flying flamethrower: sometimes he jumps up in the air and starts breathing fire. You can get a few hits off on him if you land a flash bomb in this state. I don't have much else to say on this.\n* Explosive circle: I'm glad they made this easier to read from MHFU. Used to be telegraphed by colours. Now just keep an eye out for a hazy ring when he starts charging up this move. The explosions will follow the ring once he snaps his jaws.\n* Explosive quadrant: in rage mode, he can charge up to deliver a series of explosions in a cone in front of or behind him. I think this will do a lot of damage if it ever hits you, but I also think it's just supposed to be a hassle for gunners. Blademasters are typically near the edge of the cone, so they just roll once or twice and keep attacking his legs.\n\nDid I miss any attacks?\n\n\nOh, as for triple carting in 5-10 minutes, hopefully the above helps, but it sounds less like you're being surprised by moves, and more like you don't care what moves *could* be coming. Don't just berserk. It's generally a good idea to let the monster act first, take advantage of the opening afterwards, and avoid overcommitting after the opening is over. On the other hand, If you're feeling good, it's fun to take a risk now and then, because sometimes you're rewarded for it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430705099", "subreddit": "MonsterHunter", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Peaceful transition of power between political adversaries is the defining feature of a democracy governed by the rule of law. If you do not peacefully transition power, you're not a democracy.\n\nWhile this is true you need to see implications made by you. You are talking about 'the president' but to generalize your point: you are saying 'no person holding a political office' should be prosecuted, if you dont support this statement your idea is violationg the very pinciple on that every state that is based on the rule of law was founded.\n\nThis seems utterly ridiculous. No citizen in my country (Germany) would ever agree on exempting about 2060 mayors and many more 'leaders' of countys and states from the law they have to represent.\n\nLets get into some detail about what the President is: he is the head of the executive branch of a democratic **Republic**. It is important to note that the concepts of republic and state of law or Rechtsstaat in german imply that the law is above the people is some sense and everyone has to play by the rules.\nThe executive branch is the branch executing the law. Now think of it as hypocritical that a branch disrespecting the law is in charge of the law with regard to others. This does not make sense to me.\nWhen you are the one executing the rules, you should be playing by the rules yourself.\n\nI think it is important to note that we might differ in what we view as important in a democratic state. You rate peaceful transition over accountability. I dont. People granted the legitimation by the people they have to represent must be held accountable for every offense that would be an offense if commited by any of said legitimators. Otherwise I dont see a point in having a representative. I want someone who works and behaves by the same values and norms that I view as fundamental to my- and his or her- nation and state. \nIf getting elected means you dont have to face consequenses for your actions regardless what those are the whole purpose of getting people into office to execute the law in a direct and fair manner is void.\n\nWhile I agree that a peacefull transition is important for a working democracy I think that showing accountability is more valuable.\nI dont know about the voting rates in the US. The last time they were around 50%. This means that people dont give a shit about politics.\nIf we took the step and proposed that everyone in office would be held accountable for every offense while in charge ( and before obv.) I think politics would be more appealing to those of us who play by the rules and are pissed of by the government that can do seemingly everything without getting to face cosequenses for their actions. The example of Egypt is not so great in my opinion because the real power lies in the military the entire time. At no point in time the military lost power over the nation.( due to US funds, thanks Obama, thanks Bush, thanks Clinton, thanks another Bush.) \n\nSo its not that big of a deal to convict and punish \"leaders\" who are more like puppets. \n\nIf a nation wants to preserve its national integrety it has to show that it honors its own rules. And the people standing for that nation are the leaders. If people had free reign over what is right and what is wrong other nations would question the ability to act purposefully and responsible in international affairs. If your own laws dont mean anything to your international treatys might not too.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430923038", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Health care reform - the fact is health care costs have slowed more than without the ACA. Also, can't be refused pre-existing conditions and kids on their parents plan to 26. All improvements over what we had.\n\nThe fact that I was paying $198 a month for decent insurance and now I am paying $550 a month for a shit bronze package says a lot in my own personal life. The fact that I have to pay for pap smears and pregnancy related issues as a guy, that so many have lost insurance and now have shit options, and that people are having their religion stepped on to pay for things they do not believe in (right or wrong) says a lot. \n\nAlso, the mandatory tax if you do not have insurance is fucked up in a throw it in the harbor sort of way. [Plus ACA is going to cost even more soon.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/09/14/obamacare-has-failed-to-collapse-but-that-doesnt-make-it-a-success/) Plus it has hurt hundreds of thousands of full time employees by their hours being cut by companies that will not go along with the employer mandate, and the way it let states choose to extend medicaid means that most people fall into \"the gap\" of no subsidy anyway, and to top it all off [by 2019 we will be paying $508 Billion more in taxes a year just to cover it.](https://reason.com/archives/2012/07/09/yes-actually-obamacare-is-the-biggest-ta) Thanks Obama.\n\n&gt;Bin Laden, Ending Wars - Obama is responsible in the same way Bush was responsible for NOT getting the person who perpetrated 9/11.\n\nClose, but not really. It's actually a whole different issue. Ignoring intell when you can kill the most wanted man in the world to feed a war that you wanted for other reasons is pretty fucked up. Which by the way killing Osama would never have ended the war, that war was about vengeance, oil, and getting a larger foothold in the middle east. \n\nSimply being sitting president and not saying no when new intell comes in is admirable, but lets keep the credit to the ones who actually did it. To be fair I wouldn't give Bush any credit here either if he had acted upon it. They are men in suits nodding in rooms that they walk in for 3 minutes tops, this is only a commendable note if you want to kiss an ass or are deep in political worship. The real credit goes to the people getting killed to do this work. \n\n&gt;Saving US Auto Industry - Doesn't matter if it's a Bush plan when all Republicans opposed it. That makes it a win for Dems in the same way the ACA is credited to them despite Romneycare laying the foundation.\n\nBush and his cronies came up with a plan **and began enacting it** and then Obama came along with his cronies and tweaked it some and continued marching along. Maybe they both almost crashed the whole thing but it saved itself, or maybe they are the saviors. Either way they BOTH did their parts but Bush will forever be shit on because the economy did not improve before his time in office ran out. \n\nSo what if the republicans didn't support it, that has nothing to do with Obama's accomplishments and sounds a lot more like your \"Democratic is always right\" feels. Because a republican congress didn't back it, Obama is some holy savior with full credit simply because congress changed to a democratic majority? This is simple narrow minded two party politic thinking. He said, she said. They are right and this one is wrong. That's all stupid bullshit. \n\n&gt;Cuba - You know that North Korea comment is so preposterous it doesn't even warrant a legitimate reply. Remind us how rampant concentration camps are across Cuba?\n\nMaybe Iran 2.0? That still doesn't quite fit tho, maybe worse....lets see..... How about a communist country that would be a great gateway for terrorists and I still don't think they like us very much? A country that isn't exactly our friend and more our enemy? But that still isn't right. It's quite a complicated thing to throw into a one-liner, North Korea 2.0 doesn't fit all that well either. \n\nI guess the totalitarian regime hasn't changed much since Castro days and opening our borders to them may not be the best move, especially with their still present ties to Russia and crazy boy Putin, but that's all speculation of the future and I would need a time machine to know how it will pan out. Either way it will make the lives of many Cubans much better, so that is a good thing. I just hope America's cost to do so is not too great.\n\n&gt;Economy - Obama's recovered so much from what Bush torpedoed at the end of his term. EXCEPTIONALLY so as Republicans fought and filibustered tooth-and-nail. They tried THEIR HARDEST to make him fail. Even publicly announced it! The fact none of you mention this while railing against Obama illustrates a very clear point.\n\nYour mind is skewed if you thought I was rallying against Obama in my last comment. I showed some truth to your \"facts\" is all, if you feel like that is some attack on Obama then you got that MSNBCvsFOX mentality of it's either pro-what-I-say or wrong, which is utter bullshit. My comment on the economy is as stands and is the same as the auto industry with Obama carrying over a Bush plan and getting the vast majority of the credit. No sense in repeating it all again here.\n\n\n&gt;I see you conveniently left out the multitude of these cited examples: http://whattheheckhasobamadonesofar.com/\n\nBecause the whole thing has [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com) and I was being lazy and didn't feel like going to a website where I have to click a button two dozen times to see quick one liners made to impress instead of, ya know, lists of articles and discussion of the pros and cons of all of these issues, all just so I could argue with you over the internet. \n\nThe website has an agenda. Why we gotta get our opinions from websites with an agenda man? Trying to convince people of your side and argue your points with such a site is kinda shitty. I tried to find links for my points that were unbiased as possible in the current media stream of shit we have to choose from and articles that expand on ideas with facts and sources.\n\nI don't want to be right, I just want to be useful.\n\nEDIT: spelling, I am forever a doof.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431046071", "subreddit": "news", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Batman managed to begin the conversation on a high note by volunteering his heroics, but for all of his vast wealth, guts, and intelligence he couldn't figure out how to influence the casual minds of the people. He was a public figure, to be sure, and formally he was the savior of the people, but in the end entertainment was entertainment.\n\nHitler volunteered to try. After all, he was in some ways a political genius, and his ideas had spread across the world, however unpopular they were. It was unfortunate that these ideas had been the main cause of people writing so many prompts about him in the first place. No, Hitler couldn't do anything either.\n\nGod's ideas, or at least how they were interpreted, were widely popular and regularly talked about in holy places, so Hilter turned to him. As a theoretically non-coporeal being, however, God could not provide any material evidence that united the people under one idea of himself. Mentally and spiritually, everyone interpreted the very existence of God in completely different ways, so spreading a message through him would lead to wildly random outcomes, hardly better than the current situation.\n\nOn the other hand, Satan counterbalanced God. Few argued over the definition of punishment, and as a physical creature he had solid evidence of his existence if he ever ascended to Earth. His reputation, unfortunately, was one that made people inclined towards thinking he was trying to mislead them. In fact, if Satan represented the group, it was more likely people would write *more* prompts about the six entities. This additionally excluded the seven deadly sins. The monster under the bed was also seen as a malevolent force, and anyway no one had ever actually found evidence of him existing.\n\nAs the six forces of popularity discussed their situation, there were fewer volunteers for ideas. Slowly their conversation died down, and became punctuated by idiotic and feeble jokes.\n\n\"Anyone else see the number 10 over Hitler's head?\"\n\n\"Very funny, Batman.\"\n\nEventually, one man walked up to the table, frowning. He asked God what was wrong, and upon being told about the situation his frown deepened. \n\n\"Not bad...\n\nHowever, I think I see a solution to your problem. I will spread the message. I am more than capable as an honest, public, popular human in the flesh to spread the message that you fellow citizens want to be left alone.\"\n\nEveryone at the table looked stunned, and there was a minute of solid silence before Batman spoke up.\n\n\"That's a courageous and extremely selfless act, and I'm glad you showed up to solve our problems.

{"body": "Because, in spite of ideological dictums, an economy and society functions best when there is a reasonable balance between conflicting but equally important objectives.  Until recently, i completely would have followed the dictum of having the marketplace set wages as the best way to achieve full employment.  But reality has hit thus dictum over the head with a 2 by 4.  Real wages have fallen for most in society and a large number of working adults with children are stuck in minimum wage or near MW levels, oftentimes working part time ( thanks Obamacare) and without an ability to move up.  Also, changes in the economy, corporate dominance of areas where mom and pops could once prevail, have limited proprietor alternative.  Thus we are having to subsidize wages to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in the form of foodstamps, earned income tax credits, section 8 housing and health care subsidies all the while companies are earning the highest profit margins in history.  But since demand is muted, because wages are suppressed, companies are not investing profits and creating jobs, rather they are cashing in profits through stock buybacks and stock options.\n\nSo, back to balance, the economy is dreadfully out of balance today resulting in poverty on one hand and excessive, noninvested profits on the other.  Thus the traditional theory of market forces should decide has not been working due to dynamic changes in the economy.  Thus, for the good of society, and quite honestly the preservation of a market economy from the crazies who will put into place some socialist destructive alternative if trends continue as they are today, we need to increase wages particularly for low income earners.  And we need to pressure China - force China to revalue their currency as this is a major reason for the collapse in domestic wages.  Thus we need to restore a reasonable balance, even if doing so conflicts somewhat with our economic beliefs and general principles.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431263046", "subreddit": "news", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

They go to the store and buy a shirt with it - no sales tax on clothes where I live - and then the store pays *their* employee with it. Taxed three times! They go and buy a gallon of milk - no tax on food, either - and then someone *else* gets paid. Taxed four times! Maybe that cashier goes and buys some produce at a farmer's market - the farmer has to report that income - taxed four times! Farmer pays *me* to develop a website - I have to report that too **taxed five times!** And it was *my* money a ways back in the chain to begin with! Fucking thanks, Obama. \n\nNo. It doesn't work like that. The person who receives income pays tax on that income. The end.

{"body": "I would just like to say that while primarily a large portion of the film 'zero dark thirty' is a blatant puff piece for the C.I.A. (look how clever our operations are and totally not corrupt in any way, look how devoted to integrity and ethics our top agents are), phew, that all being said.. There is one shining gem in that film.\n\nIt contains one of the most accurate depictions of a top secret government operation. The problem with most classified material is we have no way of knowing the true integrity of the facts presented to us upon declassification of said material. I still take the book and final act of film with a grain of salt as should any informed citizen, but I can't deny it all seems very legit. \n\nIf the guy from that operation who came forward with his depiction of the events, essentially whistleblowing the event of a classified operation, we may never have truly known how that particular mission went down. Due to it's historic precedence we most certainly would not have gotten every detail as accurately as we did. there would have been much more emphasis on a flawless execution rather than the very nail biting circumstances we were actually provided with in real life. \n\nI've actually only seen maybe the first 3/4's of the film once if even, but that last bit.. when the operation get's green lit and carried out so suddenly, the tension and anxiety surrounding the whole scene. It was perfect, I loved it. \n\nI remember where I was that day, that night, the moment it may have very well been going down. Or I don't, who's to say really. The point is, after being jerked around for an hour and a half the film makers were actually able to pull off a well executed scene of american intervention. We were actually able to witness what it would have been like to be a member of the most anticipated american effort of the last decade, and back home each american was finally able to feel a sense of accomplishment in an otherwise seemingly hopeless conflict. \n\nI was working that night at an irish bar in new jersey, and the feeling we all felt when the news broke out that Osama had been taken out was a feeling like no other. In my 25 years I had never felt such a huge sense of national pride. A feeling that had been virtually robbed from us in the early 2000's, and ushered in an era of political dissent and near socio-economic collapse. The bar was packed. shoulder to shoulder and we were all literally cheering, it felt great. It felt like we finally had something to be proud of in an otherwise embarassing situation, and for once our friends and family who had lost their lives on 9/11 almost felt avenged. I place emphasis on the near-total sense of accomplishment because it just isn't the right word to use, there is no peace in revenge. It felt more like the humanity we had been robbed of in 2011 was finally returning.\n\nwe felt as though we might actually be back on the right path, and just possibly there was now finally an end in sight to an otherwise bloody and embarassing conflict. \n\nAnd that was 4 years ago.. 4 long years ago, this month. Still no end in sight. We're all still **tired**, sick and tired of grieving and feeling shame or embarassment. I am fucking **tired** of this shit conflict. If I could say one thing to congress or the gov't in general it would be \"forget yer oil, get yer shit, and get the fuck out\". \n\nThe simple fact is, we had no right to even set foot on that land with malicious intent. Let alone even contemplate the idea of invading a fucking holy land, as if all records from the dark ages just vanished. We are literally repeating the mistakes of past civilizations, just with bigger weapons. \n\nFour god-damn years, and shit is worse. Thanks Obama, \n\nTL;DR - The last act of zero dark thirty is amazing, I remember the moment Osama was eliminated. It felt good, where is that feeling?\n\nHumanity has a habit of viewing time and history through a narrow lense, the present constantly clouded from our vision. - I just hope our children can forgive our ignorance one day.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432152414", "subreddit": "news", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I consider myself neutral, but I also sort of slid that way from a farther pro-GG (not *ultra*-GG mind you, I don't do harassment and letters and the whole nine) stance about six months ago. Part of my reason for doing so was also identity politics, but mainly because I projected that this was going to continue to drag on because the most fervent of both sides have little interest in resolving the conflict and moving on. That has so far been correct.\n\nI grew up in the midwestern US, but I lived in what was popularly called the \"battleground states\", states that are not 100% liberal or conservative. During the 80s, they went for Republican nominees like Reagan and Bush Sr., but in the 90s and 00s, they went for Clinton, Gore, and Obama. Religion still plays an important role in those areas, being more rural and small-town places, but between increasing minority populations and shifts in cultural values, people are voting differently than the past. I grew up in a mostly-conservative family, but before high school, I moved to the northeast. The northeast US is almost always staunchly liberal, save for pockets of some states. I don't think the state I live in has voted a Republican president in over forty years. A lot of the values and ideas I sort of grew up with from other people morphed and changed living among people of different ideologies. I've always been an open-minded person, but I don't just accept things at face value, I read, I dissect, and I form opinions based on what I feel is right. As an adult, my current political views are fiscally conservative, and socially liberal. I believe in smaller government, but I believe in funding social programs smartly and efficiently, because I think both are doable. I am pro-choice, but I also believe that people should be educated to understand the consequences of actions, that even though you have the right to an abortion, you should consider the ramifications of what you're doing, and make an informed decision. I've always supported women's rights because they're *everyone's rights.* I don't really see genders or colors, I see people, and I married a woman who wasn't a damsel-in-distress, we work with our hands together, inside and outside the house.\n\nThe problem I feel you're running in to is you're running in to people who feel that politics HAS to be a part of pro or anti-Gamergate, when it really is, or should be, rather irrelevant. So Gamergate supporters are mostly liberals, why? What purpose does that serve? How does US liberalism affect the modern gamer? Anti-Gamergate accuses pro-Gamergate of being conservative. Why? What purpose does that serve? How does US conservatism affect the modern gamer? You can find answers to these questions, but all you're actually answering are the political opinions and views of modern gamers. How does that explain or affect someone's opinion of how gaming websites have handled the aftermath of TheZoePost? How does that explain or affect feminist groups' accusations of sexism in the gaming community? I would argue the reason politics is relevant in any of this at all, is because for some reason we Americans feel that your political affiliation matters in every, single, conversation, ever, for, all, time. My microwave broke. GODDAMN REPUBLICANS. I got a flat tire driving to work. THANKS, OBAMA. My dog passed away. (actually happened :/) WHY DO YOU LOVE REAGAN SO MUCH? We absolutely cannot stop interjecting our political identities and opinions into conversations, even when they are completely irrelevant to the conversation. We label websites, television channels, and people one or the other, not because they are one or another, or it even matters, but because we need to know whose side you are on. We need to know if you're with us, or against us.\n\nThat is the reason I stepped away from Gamergate and positioned myself neutral. I support the original hashtag, the call for reforms in the gaming press, industry, and community, but I couldn't get behind a lot of these openly-divisive voices that want me to take sides against everyone else. Why should I? Why should you? Why should any of you? I don't like sides, but I especially don't like political sides. I don't vote for people because they belong to a party, I vote for people who I feel bring the best qualifications to the position. You mention Sargon of Akkad, I think he is a very informed man, very in-tune with what is going on around him, and he presents a fair argument to the issues. I don't listen to a lot of his non-Gamergate fare, because it's not in my wheelhouse, but some of the stories he features on This Week in Stupid are pretty silly, and it tends to highlight some of the most willfully ignorant shit people do in our world that should be discussed more often. Gamergate's *darling*, Milo, is also a well-informed man, but unlike Sargon, he is much more interested in attacking and mocking opponents than discussing the issues. I don't really gel with that, and I was among the minority to voted nay for him for the SPJ panel on that KIA thread. Christina Hoff Sommers is often attributed as a conservative, when she is a liberal. I've read *The War Against Boys* and it's a very good book. Not the be-all-to-know-all, but it provides a different perspective to education reforms by feminists in the 1990s.\n\n**TL;DR** US politics has become increasingly watered-down and divisive over the past fifteen years, but especially in the last seven, since Obama took office. But you need to have a further understanding of what each party stands for, and the types of people who affiliate themselves with these parties. It's important never to judge someone by their politics or religion, because not everyone places them ahead of friendship and good-will towards others.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432221136", "subreddit": "AgainstGamerGate", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": ":) thanks for sharing your story. When I had my abortion the worst part of it was that I felt like I couldn't talk about it. Like if I were having my appendix removed I would make a facebook post and people would commiserate with me and we'd bitch about it and laugh and etc. But with my abortion I knew there were women that I knew who had been through this before but I had no way of reaching out to them. How would I find them without \"outing\" myself? It was very isolating. \n\nedit\n\nI happen to live in a very liberal and progressive state where abortions are required to be covered by health insurance along with pre-natal care. I knew I was pregnant. My boobs were HUGE and hurt so bad and my period was a week late but I was in denial. I picked up some tests on my way to work and pissed on the stick in my work bathroom. Goddamnit. I'm fucking pregnant. Hooray? I dunno yet. I called my doctors office and told them:\n\n\"Hay I think I'm pregnant.\"\n\n\"Did you take a test?\"\n\n\"Yeah. It was positive. That's kinda why I think I'm pregnant.\"\n\n\"Ok come in this afternoon.\"\n\nMy fiance came and met me for lunch and I told him I was pregnant and shit shit shit shit shit. He went with me to the doctors appointment and I gave some blood which just confirmed again that I was actually pregnant. I still didn't really believe it. \n\nI called Planned Parenthood and made an appointment for an ultrasound. Based on my own cycle I guessed that I was 5 weeks along. I went to PP the next day and had an ultrasound and I actually kept a copy of it. It's nothing. There's nothing there. It's a grey and white blob of static. I have no emotional reaction. I was 5 weeks along. \n\nFiance and I discussed what we were going to do and decided that now was not the right time. So I called PP and scheduled the abortion for Saturday so I wouldn't have to miss work. I opted for the surgical abortion, vacuum aspiration, because it seemed like it would involve less hassle. Just get it done all at once instead of having to push it out myself for a few hours. I made the right choice here despite what I'm about to write. \n\nSaturday comes and fiance and I go out for pre-abortion brunch and I get a cheeseburger and skip the bloody mary. In hindsight I should have had two bloody marys. Anyway we get to PP and everyone is very professional and kind and medically accurate. I pay my $20 copay (thanks obama!) and we wait. And we wait. And we wait and wait and wait. I fall asleep on the bench in the waiting room. I go in for the tests for rh and they give me the vicodin and xanax. When I go into the procedure room I mention how I don't feel very sedated and they say it's probably just my nerves. They have a chair set up for my fiance to sit in which is faced towards my head away from my feet/the procedure. I crack a joke about ShopVacs and we all laugh. I need to keep still for the procedure though so I hush up. The doctor describes everything to me. \"I'm clamping your cervix.\" \"I'm injecting the lidocaine. This is going to pinch.\" \"I'm going to dilate your cervix now. This may hurt a bit or you may not feel anything at all.\" Queue the most intense and exquisite pain that I have ever experienced in my life. It's *awful*. I can't describe this pain. Thankfully the procedure only took about 3 minutes but at the end of it I was vomiting, my blood pressure had dropped to 60/40, I was barely conscious, and my clothes were soaked in sweat. Holy fuck. I think abortions all hurt the same but the surgical abortion has it all concentrated in 3 minutes while the medical one draws moderate pain out for hours. My poor fiance though, this is the last he sees of me while they literally carry me into the recovery room and usher him out into the waiting room. He must have been so terrified. I laid there in the EZboy cramping hard and eating saltines and cracking jokes for about half an hour until I could get up. Fiance was so relived to see me. After the procedure and cramping was over I felt fine. We walked to the fancy french bakery near our place and I picked up a bunch of treats and then we walked home, a mile and a half total. Got home, ate some treats and took a nap. Took it easy the next day but I didn't really have any cramping or bleeding once it was over. I spent the weekend playing video games and eating coconut cake. Lost maybe a teaspoon of blood and went back to work on Monday. Minor cramping that week and one bout of emotional outburst and I was fine. \n\nWe're planning on having a kid next year.\n\nI still have that ultrasound though...\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432344175", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am from Michigan myself.  The weather is overall much better (this week being the exception apparently) and the economy is way better.  It seems to be the general rule that if you had allergies in Michigan, you'll have less in San Antonio, but if you didn't you might notice a stronger reaction to Ceder here.  Take some Ceder X and that will usually do the trick.  \n\nIf you are from Flint or Detroit, this place will seem great by comparison!  If you're from Grand Rapids, you might actually need to take some of the advice I'm going to lay down here.\n\nIf you're not used to living in a big city, you might notice there is more crime more evenly distributed.  Get ADT and put up some cameras (real or not) and usually you won't have problems.  Find a good street.  Good neighbors on a good street is more important than finding a good neighborhood in my opinion.  But equally important is comparing old Google Earth photos to the current surroundings.  If it looks better on the computer or about as bad, avoid it.  If it looks better in real life, that's a sign curb appeal is changing the area.\n\nThe south side is the area where crime is really a problem and cops won't give a shit about small theft anywhere in town overall.  3 times now I've had to deal with theft reports on my own, do my own detective work and deliver my own justice if you will.  Cops will look the other way if you just save them some paperwork and they won't ask too many questions if it makes the neighborhood better.  Kind of the double-edged sword around here.  Police corruption is going down though.  New cops are more likely to not be ass-hats and police response time is much better in the last couple years thanks to better computer algorithms that predict crime.\n\nProperty taxes were okay but went way up this year.  Almost nobody votes for the small elections so incumbent council members just do whatever they want with no repercussions.  They voted down a gunfire alert system that would have been awesome and opted for more trollies instead of trains.  They also illegalized Uber, feeding the homeless, and in general political things went downhill since Mayor Castro got promoted to DC.\n\nThanks Obama... :P\n\nTagging is not as big a problem though and in general most crime has gone down since I moved here 6 years ago, at least on the West side.  Its MUCH better now!  The city paints over tags much more quickly and effectively than before and they're less likely to occur frequently if you jump on it.  Most tagging here is not related to real gangs.  Its just dumb kids.  Some parents here in SATX come from gangs back in the 70's and just have a horrible mindset about what is acceptable behavior.  I used to do neighborhood watch and I've heard and seen some shit.  One mom tried to tell me what her son did wasn't illegal.  Just... I don't even...\n\nJoin a FB group called La Pulga and San Antonio Neighborhood Watch.  Both are excellent resources for getting justice and sometimes its better than going to the cops.  Together we've found stolen cars, located abusive husbands, you name it.  \n\nIf you're here for work though, you can't ask for a better location.  The base ensures a constant flow of income for a large percentage of the city that kept it on life support during the economic crisis.  Living in San Antonio on a low income is much easier than it is in Michigan and finding one or more jobs is a cinch.\n\nThe weather here is usually amazing!  This is the first year we've seen massive rainfall, but there's lots to do in the area.  And Austin is fun too and not too far.  Its like a giant version of Ann Arbor but with zip lining. \n\nOverall, I think the city would be PERFECT if everyone from Michigan just moved here.  People from Michigan are the best kind of people I've met the world over.  You can always rely on other Michiganders here to keep their word and be true to you.  This is a really friendly city, but some people here have a toxic attitude that you may find alien and offensive.  Lots of machismo over stupid shit happens.  I had a dude punch me in the face when I asked him not to leave his shopping cart next to my truck and to put it back in the corral.  Many people just do not have a deeper sense of shared civic courtesy here, but it DOES get better over time.  Recently this is starting to change.  I have only seen 1 fist fight this year in public versus something like 10 the first year I moved here.  \n\nDon't give money to the homeless.  If someone asks for change, its illegal to give it to them and illegal for them to pan-handle.  There's a reason for the law, albeit its still a dumb law because giving someone food or drink should never EVER be illegal.  Most of them are either homeless by choice, ex criminals still doing their hustle, or drug addicts.  I have worked with a lot of homeless people in the city directly and only 2 of them so far were not an ass-hole to me or a danger to themselves and took REAL help when offered.  One of those guys is totally back on his feet now.  Yes, he's from Michigan.  I can't tell you how many people I offered to give shelter to who just were so stuck on the idea they have to fend for themselves that they wouldn't do it.  \n\nRacism here is worse than in Michigan, but not as bad as the deeper south.  There's lots of casual jokes about Mexican culture and blunt talk about cultural differences.  The N word is used A LOT but not the way you think.  Its become a synonym for dude between close friends of all colors, which is both incredibly annoying to some and in a way kind of accidentally enlightened. Older folks though will use it.  If you're not black, some older white men will use it in your presence at least once as if to test if you are part of the old-boy's club.  Just shoot that down right out and you won't hear it from them twice.  Many older hispanic men and black men assume white people are racist right away.  I've been accused of all kinds of dumb things.  \"White boy/girl\" is sometimes a subtle slur (subtle if you've never experienced racism towards white people) and if you hear it someone is pissed and probably about to start a fight.  \n\nUnlike the rest of Texas, for some reason there are not as many people who are actually carrying guns in this city it seems.  Mostly knives.  If you have a taser, then you'd be adequately prepared to take a nightly stroll through most parts of town.  Some people remember the crime from the 70's and still carry bats, but I think that's a bit excessive.  I've never been mugged, but I also open carry a taser at night that looks a lot like a gun in the holster.  This is the thing I LOVE about Texas.  No matter how many problems your part of town might have, you can still defend yourself and you can pretty much shoot anyone who comes on your property with violent intent knowing the law has your back.  This is not actual legal advice though.  Talk to a lawyer before the cops in dire situations of course, just in case.\n\nIf you're pro-military or like that mindset, this city is all about that.  I've never had so many freebies and thanks you's just because I was in the Air Force.  Its much more welcoming than California was when I was stationed there.    \n\nHEB is a million times better than Meijer for every reason period. \n\nWhat-a-burger is amazing too.  If you miss steak and shake, there might be one in town I think, but for sure Austin has one!  No Tim Hortons yet.  Probably not for a long time if ever.  There might be an A&amp;W too.  I forget.\n\nDriving in San Antonio is akin to Chicago, but not quite as bad.  When it rains after a dry spell, even a sprinkle causes accidents.  Many people here don't know how to drive correctly and the oil from the roads makes it 100 times worse.  The DMV here is hands down the WORST DMV I have EVER seen.  Lines out the door and confusing procedures.\n\nDon't let this paint too grim a picture though.  These are just some culture shock differences you will see.  The worst people in San Antonio are a small percentage and overall its getting better each year in so many ways.  The only way to know if its the right place for you is to come see it yourself and find out.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432453633", "subreddit": "sanantonio", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "#**Continuing from original post**\n___\n#**Traditional Haiku**\n\n**Traditional Japanese haiku**\n\n1. A Japanese haiku in traditional form usually has two rhythmical units, one of about twelve on and one about five, the break between them often marked with a special grammatical device called a kireji, or cutting word.\n\n2. Since the break between the two rhythmical units is equally likely to occur after the first five on or after the first twelve, the normal rhythm of a traditional haiku in Japanese is five, seven, and five onji.\n\n3. The form of traditional haiku originated in the incomplete opening stanza of a longer poem; the haiku form is therefore rhythmically incomplete.\n\n**Traditional form for haiku in English**\n\n1. Overall form: Consists of seven accented syllables, plus unaccented syllables up to a total of about twelve = would yield a rhythmical structure native to English and at the same time approximate the duration of traditional Japanese haiku. A major grammatical pause between the 2nd and 3rd or 5th and 6th accented syllables would provide the sense of division created by kireji\n\n2. While Japanese are used to reading traditional texts in which rhythms are not visually identified, the Western notion of a printed poem-text incorporates the idea of a line of type equaling a rhythmical unit, or verse-line. Therefore: a three-line construction of 2, 3, and two accented syllables (respectively) would established a rhythmical proportions similar to traditional Japanese haiku.\n\n3. The most commonly encountered short structure in traditional English poetry is the heroic couplet with two five-beat lines. The two-three-two-beat structure with a strong grammatical break after the second or fifth beat, as proposed, would yield  a sense of rhythmical incompleteness similar to Japanese haiku.\nGrammar should be stripped to a minimum (but still yielding a reasonable natural feel). Articles (a, an, and the) and prepositions should be used sparingly. \n___\n\n#**Other Notes**\n\n**Format:** Haiku tend to be written in two parts: A fragment on the first or last line, and then there is the body of the haiku.\n\n**Format:** Haiku are not written in three fragments, just one fragment and a phrase on two other lines.\n\n**Time frame:** Haiku is not written in the past and it isn’t longitudinal. It is Zen, in the moment making regular instances amazing and extraordinary.\n\n**Be wary of redundant kidai and kigo:** Multiple kigo in one haiku, for example:\n\n\n    Easter Sunday--\n    hidden candy eggs\n    cradled by leaves\n\nThe kigo which are redundant - \"easter\" and \"hidden candy eggs\". Of course it is Easter if you are hiding eggs! \"Easter\" is not needed in the haiku. The reason why we would not want to omit \"hidden candy eggs\" is because it gives the haiku substance while \"Easter\" just tells, rather than shows.\n\n**Punctuation:** Most haiku do not use capitalization or punctuation. Don’t use periods, periods restrain the haiku. Haiku should be left as if almost unfinished.\n\n**Avoid “list haiku”:** Don’t make a haiku that is stated simply they are boring.\n\n**Avoid \"picture haiku\":** Avoid making haiku that just obsess over a single specific moment with no action.\n\n**Cause and effect:** Haiku should stray away from c&amp;e (once again due to the essence of zen). If there is cause and effect, try to make sure that it is in the same segment. One line should not affect another line. \n\n**Play with Juxtapositions!:** They are amazing for haiku! Not only are they zen, but they are great for imagery and \"hidden in plain sight\" depth.\n\n**Calm and in the moment:** As said before, haiku tend to have a very calm tone, static and in the moment, Zen. Thus it is less concerned with actual emotion, and more so about the moment just existing. That is why:\n\n    my tortured squee\n    under attacking fingers-- \n    tickle fight\n\nIs a rather bad haiku (traditionally) because 'tortured squee' can be conveyed as expressing emotion and attachment while zen is literally detachment to the world. However, it could also be construed to say that 'tortured squee' is just a description, an observation to the moment and thus follows the haiku pretty well.\n\n**Haiku vs. Senryu:** Haiku are traditionally supposed to be connected to seasons and nature. Now when I say 'nature' I mean natural nature, rather than stuff like human nature.. Any \"haiku\" with human nature in it (politics for example) are called Senyru. The primary difference between haiku and senryu is that senryu is more attached to human nature. It's still very argued what is and isn't senryu.\n    \n    Crying about spilled milk\n    as homeless man walks by. . .\n    thanks obama\n\n**Literary devices:** Haiku do not use simile, metaphor, personification, etc. It is about the “zen moment” being stated simply (but not too simply a.ka. no “list haiku”). \n\n___\n\n#**Breaking Format**\n\nUnlike other traditional poetic forms, haiku written in western languages are defined primarily by its essence and philosophical origin.\n\nSometimes, rules are meant to be broken. They are a foundation to crafting a stable piece of work. However, rules are only viable when they are effective in constructing what the writer wants to create. If rules get in the way, disregard them, but if a writer break rules without understanding why they are important or even knowing what they are? That's just poor writing.\n\n&gt; “In literature, intent begets context.”\n\nAgain. One may deviate from the standard rules and traditional format, but you must first understand those rules and **why** they are there in the first place. Only then can you break rules.\n\nBe advised that breaking format rules should be diligently reserved for western linguistic haiku. Japanese traditional haiku has set linguistic formatting and rules that should be maintained within stricter awareness.\n___\n#**My Concerns with Haiku in English**\n\n&gt; *I didn't get it... ...I'm still not quite sure I get it...*\n\nAgain, going back to a part of what my friend said about haiku. My response was:\n\n&gt;*Don't worry about not \"getting it\". The unfortunate truth is that even I don't get it. I don't speak, write, or understand Japanese. I don't understand the cleverness and the original meanings. I still can't understand why the original context of \"the pines of Mount Inaba, as I hear you pine for me\" is so amazingly, breathtakingly, and sadly beautiful. Until a person fluently understands Japanese, they will NEVER understand haiku. That's a fact that, I think very select few wrestle with. My haiku? They aren't haiku. Even if I followed the rigid structure of syllables in my notes (which I clearly don't) they STILL wouldn't be haiku.*\n\n&gt;*The reality and unfortunate truth? My \"haiku\" are frauds. I know, that's harsh to say because there is still something in them. There may be still just as much work and love put into them as much as any Japanese haiku writer would put into their own work. BUT! Their's would be gold, mine would be fool's gold. It is only a minor husk of what it should be.*\n\n&gt;*So, don't worry about not getting it. I have much more problems with that as well.*\n\nI admit that I am not sure whether or not I have learn to fully appreciate my own haiku. Yes, even though I consider what I create as haiku this feeling of disappointment and shame lingers in the back of my mind. Part of the reason is that I am not sure whether or not my haiku are really actually \"haiku\". Do I, the writer modify the meaning and format of haiku? Does a group of like minded people modify the format of haiku? Or does an official organization? Perhaps all of them do.\n\nThis is something I don't really think I'll ever get a concrete answer to.

I had some money saved when I got out because you don't have very many expenses in the Army so I used it as a down payment to buy property that I later ended up renting out when I moved instead of selling.\n\nMy property taxes for the place take up a lot of what I get paid in rent and after repairs/work to the property I generally break even on it. \n\nLiterally when I have a net income from a rental its reported and taxed as income but when I have a loss it doesn't get deducted from my other income. This double standard is something I can deal with in small amounts but when an uninsured $60k building burns down and the IRS essentially says \"you're rich, deal with it\" and I can't even count it as a tax deduction I have to disagree with them.\n\nIt would be different if I was all like \"Obama needs to pay for my garage even though I didn't have insurance\" but just being able to deduct the loss I had to eat on my taxes seems pretty reasonable to me. It would be different if my /net/ pay was $150k or more but with losses I essentially netted almost nothing for the year because I pay about half my gross income in taxes no matter what.\n\nIt's pretty broken and it's easier to sell the property than deal with it.

I know that sounds cold and I'm not trying to be mean but honestly it is.\n\nSecondly, you own property, rentals rarely make positive cashflow once you factor in everything and thats because you're paying off the mortgage so in reality when you factor in your entire estate, you are getting positive flow because your debt is decreasing without you having to do anything about it and the value is increasing.\n\nTo my knowledge there isn't a tax code in the world that allows you to deduct a loss on your income tax because you decided not to insure something and it burnt down.\n\nI'm not sure what the tax code is there but here a rental property and everything associated with it goes into whats essentially the negative income column and the income you get from it goes into the positive. That's why here rental incomes are really good investments and everyone wants one because your mortgage, taxes, maintenance, etc are all considered as costs and your rental income is an income. Since the two cancel out you're just sitting there accumulating wealth at a good rate because you own property that is appreciating in value and costing you nothing.\n\nAs for the thanks Obama, I have no idea how any of this would be Obama's fault.

When you have a crystal clear (No DoF) picture on a screen that's 20 inches away from your face, you are seeing this less \"realistically\" than you would with DoF because there isn't actually any distance between the objects in game since it's just rendered on your screen. Secondly, trying to inhibit the use of an entire word like \"blur\" from the vocabulary relating to games is retarded. Furthermore, motion blur isn't a neccesity of low framerates, it can add perception of motion in a different part of our brain. One part sees an object in one place, then it again in another place, divides by the time passed and calculates it's velocity. Not as discrete units but that's just our inner mathematical perception. Another part of our brain can see things like motion lines and perceives motion on it's own. That's why you could have a two identical scenarios of games running at more fps than could ever matter yet when we see blur lines from things in motion, we will usually perceive them to be moving faster than without. I don't really get what you are trying to argue?\n\nBottom line:\n\nDoF is bad? Okay, that's your opinion...\n\nBlur shouldn't be used in a \"true gamers\" vocabulary?

Though in this current thread you have been providing criticism, I wouldn't call it hateful.  I don't even know whether the attempt to post a shaming Delete Prevention comment was hateful or not.  (in the next point I address another possible meaning you may have had for \"equivalent\" criticism, but it fits better down below.)\n\nOn a technical detail though, either I'm not sure you understand the Fundamental Attribution Error or I'm not understanding you.  The fundamental attribution error has to do with use exaggerating the importance of ourselves in good outcomes and exaggerating the importance of external factors in poor outcomes.  \n\nTake the example of a student taking the test the teacher gave them.  The student who did well would say, \"I did great on that test.  I did well on my merits.\"  Of course, they are forgetting that they \"didn't build that on their own\" (Thanks Obama).  The student who did poorly would say \"The teacher didn't teach well and the test was too hard.\"  Of course, they could have tried harder or prepared better.\n\nIf you're saying that I'm ascribing everything bad to external sources and absolving individuals of blame, I'd point out that I'm doing so uniformly and not just for myself, therefore not committing the error.\n\nYou could be saying that when I say there should be consequences and someone else says that there should be other consequences, that I'm calling my stuff \"critique\" and their stuff \"hate\" thus giving more merits to my idea and less to anothers.  Of course, what I'm saying is substantively different unless you necessarily believe that all consequences are necessarily hateful.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432877960", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Big hospitals, who can't turn away patients, at first for ethical reasons but then for regulatory ones (laws were passed), liked insurance because they knew they would get *something* for treating the patient.  They start billing preferentially because of this, you \"get lower prices since you have insurance\"(they know they are getting paid), and insurance becomes practically a must-have if you want quality treatment.

{"body": "After a crowd of one thousand people vanished from plain sight right after a terrorist bombing in Florida on May 12, 2015, we realized the time travelers existed. Curiously, the government did not try to cover this event up like they supposedly did for 9/11, aliens, and the loch ness monster. As a defender of the real truth, I expected them to feed us lies, but I saw the event myself and the official statement of the US was entirely accurate. \n\nA few days later, millions of familiar, Earthen ships suddenly and instantly filled the skies, giving the impression of a cloudy day until one looked up. As we had only seen the time travelers around a terrorist bombing, we could only assume an event of a far greater magnitude was going to happen. It was surely an event that everyone would remember eternally, for what seemed to be even greater than the population of Earth was observing the events of a single day.\n\nHowever, around midnight, nothing had happened. The ships vanished, and we only saw small groups of travelers whenever something happened. There weren't a lot of historical events in our time, I thought.\n\nOn March 18, 2016, the US government had announced time travel had been invented. Of course, it was far more likely that the men of the future had given them the technology and they claimed it as their own, and I said as much. No one really cared.\n\nThe first project was announced. In exactly two weeks time, the entire world would be sent back to the same day we had seen the great number of ships in the sky. While I knew that the government had been secretly building millions of warships and colonization ships in their preparation to settle in a newly discovered planet that they had decided to hide from the public, it came as a shock to everyone that there was enough room for the entire Earth's population to fit.\n\nOn April 1st, we were sent back about ten months, and everyone had a party in the upper Troposphere. We weren't watching for anything, although I was sure that I would be checking out the recent terrorist event to prove the US faked it, and I was sure that the entire population of the Earth was waiting for something, but everything remained orderly in their world. I slowly realized the governments of the World had pulled the greatest April Fool's prank in history, and that the American President was surely behind this masterminded scheme and floating party.\n\nI shook my head, chuckling to myself.\n\n\"Thanks, Obama.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432996484", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 637, "controversiality": 0}
