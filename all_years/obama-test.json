{"body": "I consider myself neutral, but I also sort of slid that way from a farther pro-GG (not *ultra*-GG mind you, I don't do harassment and letters and the whole nine) stance about six months ago. Part of my reason for doing so was also identity politics, but mainly because I projected that this was going to continue to drag on because the most fervent of both sides have little interest in resolving the conflict and moving on. That has so far been correct.\n\nI grew up in the midwestern US, but I lived in what was popularly called the \"battleground states\", states that are not 100% liberal or conservative. During the 80s, they went for Republican nominees like Reagan and Bush Sr., but in the 90s and 00s, they went for Clinton, Gore, and Obama. Religion still plays an important role in those areas, being more rural and small-town places, but between increasing minority populations and shifts in cultural values, people are voting differently than the past. I grew up in a mostly-conservative family, but before high school, I moved to the northeast. The northeast US is almost always staunchly liberal, save for pockets of some states. I don't think the state I live in has voted a Republican president in over forty years. A lot of the values and ideas I sort of grew up with from other people morphed and changed living among people of different ideologies. I've always been an open-minded person, but I don't just accept things at face value, I read, I dissect, and I form opinions based on what I feel is right. As an adult, my current political views are fiscally conservative, and socially liberal. I believe in smaller government, but I believe in funding social programs smartly and efficiently, because I think both are doable. I am pro-choice, but I also believe that people should be educated to understand the consequences of actions, that even though you have the right to an abortion, you should consider the ramifications of what you're doing, and make an informed decision. I've always supported women's rights because they're *everyone's rights.* I don't really see genders or colors, I see people, and I married a woman who wasn't a damsel-in-distress, we work with our hands together, inside and outside the house.\n\nThe problem I feel you're running in to is you're running in to people who feel that politics HAS to be a part of pro or anti-Gamergate, when it really is, or should be, rather irrelevant. So Gamergate supporters are mostly liberals, why? What purpose does that serve? How does US liberalism affect the modern gamer? Anti-Gamergate accuses pro-Gamergate of being conservative. Why? What purpose does that serve? How does US conservatism affect the modern gamer? You can find answers to these questions, but all you're actually answering are the political opinions and views of modern gamers. How does that explain or affect someone's opinion of how gaming websites have handled the aftermath of TheZoePost? How does that explain or affect feminist groups' accusations of sexism in the gaming community? I would argue the reason politics is relevant in any of this at all, is because for some reason we Americans feel that your political affiliation matters in every, single, conversation, ever, for, all, time. My microwave broke. GODDAMN REPUBLICANS. I got a flat tire driving to work. THANKS, OBAMA. My dog passed away. (actually happened :/) WHY DO YOU LOVE REAGAN SO MUCH? We absolutely cannot stop interjecting our political identities and opinions into conversations, even when they are completely irrelevant to the conversation. We label websites, television channels, and people one or the other, not because they are one or another, or it even matters, but because we need to know whose side you are on. We need to know if you're with us, or against us.\n\nThat is the reason I stepped away from Gamergate and positioned myself neutral. I support the original hashtag, the call for reforms in the gaming press, industry, and community, but I couldn't get behind a lot of these openly-divisive voices that want me to take sides against everyone else. Why should I? Why should you? Why should any of you? I don't like sides, but I especially don't like political sides. I don't vote for people because they belong to a party, I vote for people who I feel bring the best qualifications to the position. You mention Sargon of Akkad, I think he is a very informed man, very in-tune with what is going on around him, and he presents a fair argument to the issues. I don't listen to a lot of his non-Gamergate fare, because it's not in my wheelhouse, but some of the stories he features on This Week in Stupid are pretty silly, and it tends to highlight some of the most willfully ignorant shit people do in our world that should be discussed more often. Gamergate's *darling*, Milo, is also a well-informed man, but unlike Sargon, he is much more interested in attacking and mocking opponents than discussing the issues. I don't really gel with that, and I was among the minority to voted nay for him for the SPJ panel on that KIA thread. Christina Hoff Sommers is often attributed as a conservative, when she is a liberal. I've read *The War Against Boys* and it's a very good book. Not the be-all-to-know-all, but it provides a different perspective to education reforms by feminists in the 1990s.\n\n**TL;DR** US politics has become increasingly watered-down and divisive over the past fifteen years, but especially in the last seven, since Obama took office. But you need to have a further understanding of what each party stands for, and the types of people who affiliate themselves with these parties. It's important never to judge someone by their politics or religion, because not everyone places them ahead of friendship and good-will towards others.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432221136", "subreddit": "AgainstGamerGate", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I love telling this story\n\nso first of all the EMP thing I tacked on in front of Obama because I want to troll Triforce one of these days.\n\nthe Obama part is the real story.\n\nSo I used to go to this college called Northern Virginia Community College also known as NOVA. Unfortunately they never offered any courses in master the Power of the Nova Force so I settled for IT instead before switching over to Business currently.\n\nI didn't know anybody yet so I looked around until I found the \"nerd hangout\" building that had a game room which had two Xboxes and two PS3s and they even had a copy of Marvel for each system that I used to use to body random passerbys in because at that time I had no steady competition.\n\nBut I didn't even know they had Marvel when I first started going and there was a large time gap between classes with nothing for me to do. Usually large groups of these people would gather round the Wiis to play Brawl (not even the good Smashes mind you. they liked Brawl. although they did eventually switched to PM later on thank God for that).\n\nI figure \"eh what the hell. something to kill some time anyway\". I did after all have some experience playing Melee but never got super good with it. I main Luigi.\n\nThere was a random ass tag on the game that said Obama so i thought i'd use it for shits and giggles. Now in the game everyone is super casual so they insist on playing free for all. thankfully the consensus was no items tho.\n\ni'm sitting here thinking \"this is retarded. what am i even doing? i know what i'll do i'll just go hang off the ledge and abuse this game's dumb as fuck invincibility frames and keep refreshing it making myself safe\"\n\nand that shit actually worked. I would literally drop off the ledge, Up+B back on the ledge, and keep dong it over and over again until the last man was standing allowing me to use all four of my stocks to kick his ass and win the game.\n\neventually these people caught on and one guy was like \"HEYYY wait a minute!! this Obama guy is being a cheap asshole and ledge grabbing! let's all call a truce and gang up on him!\"\n\nand so they did. they would kill themselves trying to hit me off. they would kill each other. the entire pace of the game would be slowed down for literally like ten minutes (they had no timer on so this was extra funny) and completely fail trying to stop my troll tactic. it was hilarious and eventually people would give up and ragequit on me when they knew they had to four stock me with only one stock\n\nand yes they all said THANKS OBAMA on several occasions\n\nat this point that one nerd that raged would rage harder and say really funny shit like\n\n\"UHMM HELLO?! OBAMA'S STILL ALIVE!!\"\n\n\"YOU GUYS HAVE TO GET OBAMA HE'S GOING TO WIN AGAIN!!\"\n\n\"WHY ISN'T ANYBODY TAKING OUT OBAMA?! SOMEBODY GET OBAMA!!\"\n\n\"KILL OBAMAAAA!!!!!\"\n\nit was the funniest fucking shit i've ever pulled off and the name just kinda stuck with me and now people refer to me as that Obama guy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427165072", "subreddit": "MvC3", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is painful to type, but it's about time. About exactly a year ago, I was depressed. I just wasn't satisfied with my life. I was bored. I didn't have anything to do in life, I didn't see a purpose. I was depressed, but I wasn't like sad if that makes sense. I was introvertive so that didn't help either. I wanted to kill myself just to get out of the purgatory of my life. I was on facebook about a week or so I had planned to do it, when I saw someone posting the stupidest shit I've ever god damn seen in my entire life. I laughed. I was friends with this girl on facebook, I'm not entirely sure how we officially met to this day, but she was already on my friends list at this time. I looked through her profile and it was extravagant. She lived a punk rock, go out with friends, do stupid shit, goofy, no regrets, lifestyle. I realized that's something I wanted. I never had true friends and I never any memorable moments. Something I wanted. I saw [this movie](http://vimeo.com/36170225) and I realized I want to be able to have nostalgia. After all, these are the best years of my life. I should mention I'm in high school. Grade doesn't matter. Also I'm a guy as that's relatively important I suppose.\n\nSo I message her. Remember folks, I'm on neck beard status when it comes to social skills at this point, so the conversation basically goes,\n&gt;**Me:** Hi\n\n&gt;**Her:** HEY THERE HI\n\n&gt;**Me:** Why is your life so interesting?\n\n&gt;**Her:** Wut\n\nYeah. That was the first thing I said to her, well the first thing she responded to, after saying hi in 14 different languages using translate hoping for a response, then saying \"Thanks Obama\" when I didn't get an immediate one. Anyways, we talked for a while about getting in trouble with the cops and movies we like and I realized that maybe my life wasn't so boring, but it certainly had some improving to do. Throughout the rest of the year I got into skating, punk rock, and different kinds of cultures through which I become more sociable. Without her that wouldn't have happened otherwise, and I wouldn't have met some of my best local friends. (She lives half way across the country evidently.) We were like siblings. We never got romantic ever and neither of us wanted that. I was talking about visiting her, and I had saved up about $500 dollars, and she was down. \n\nIf things had gone that way, well, I wouldn't be typing this right now, and I'd be halfway across the country at this very moment. \n\nAbout a month ago she blocks me on everything without warning.

Not due to the fact I feel like it will make Khamenei or the Iranians, in this instance, not deal with us (in this case we have the rest of the UN behind us, all wanting a deal)... but because of what it allows him to do.\n\nYou just gave the far right segments of Iran - and many places in the world - another rallying cry against the US and Israel.  Now they have one more argument against us, for no reason other than these dumbass Senators decided to try to flap their dicks on the table... and came up horribly short to hitting the edge.\n\nYou people are a fucking embarrassment, a shame, and a goddamn STRATEGIC DRAWBACK.  You just fucking called yourselves out as a legitimately NEGATIVE ASSET in our goal to achieve world stability.  Great fucking job there, dipshits.

It may not be treacherous.. but sometimes its more dangerous to have an utterly incompetent ally than an enemy.\n\nYou brought shame and the needless affliction of doubt to our reputation in a hostile, difficult world that requires COOPERATION and TRUST for us to maintain our edge.  \n\nYou know what?  Thanks, Obama.  Thanks for not being like these psycho pricks.  Jesus christ\n\nGreat job, Senators.  You really did us all proud on this one.  Hope the defense contractor campaign cash was worth it.\n\nPlease, everyone, help get the corruptive influence that caused this bullshit OUT.

But come on folks, everyone across the aisle has to agree this shit with corporate influence having total sway has gone goddamn tooooo far.. Theyre now messing with our lives in a very serious way.

Constitutional amendments often result from campaigns of states to call a Constituational Congress... then Washington politicans see the wind blowing and they hop on board to ride the sails to popularity. \n\nEncourage your state to sign the Wolf-pac resolution, we can get Washington to act...

{"body": "I've been holding out on vaccination and I'm glad someone finally snapped some sense into me. All it took was a politician telling me what to think and do! Thanks Obama. I was so lost before you came along as a politician supporting positions that deny science:\n\nFetus viability and natural rights as a vulnerable and developing life form, demonstrably unsustainable socialized medicine, the fact marijuana is scheduled incorrectly despite all the science, oh the scientific fact that there's only one race: the human race, also the science that demonstrates the chilling effect pervasive monitoring has on free speech and individual liberty, the science behind whether a bullet, gun, or shooter is responsible for a death, the science screaming for better attention to be paid to mental health rather than the 2nd amendment, the science Iran pursues for nuclear armament, and lest we forget the science behind smoking cigarettes causing harm (did he ever manage to quit?)...\n\nCertainly whenever Obama, any politician, says science deniers are the problem, I think about when people said that about God, too. Look where that led us. At least all the \"known\" science gets amended and corrected each year. In a few years we will be back to global cooling, nuclear winters, insisting there's life waiting to be discovered if we only raise taxes to launch more probes. \n\nWhat a shame he frames it this way. He has a Surgeon General, no? Is there a more credible person that could have issued this statement besides a polarizing political figure running a regime of collectivism and imposed mentalities. If this were a Bush declaring parents should recognize the value religion offers to family units and child stability (scientifically supported) there'd be outrage. \n\nBut this is just kids getting shots whether their parents consent or not. In the interest of securing the majority, a minority must acquiesce and relinquish their liberty to raise their children according to their own principles. \n\nEverything would be so much better if people would stop trying so hard to think for themselves and just let the politicians take care of the details. Pay your taxes and shut your mouth unless you are eating what Michelle O says is good for your kids but not her own. \n\nYeah this is a great stance for a president challenging the balance of power and circumventing a nation's precedent to impose his will. \n\nAs the downvotes pour in, let me remind you that *this* politician might be aligned with your ideals but allowing him such authority means the *next* politician has the precedent to do the same. It won't be Democrats forever. When the tables turn, do you want a precedent of a president having authority in this way? Would you applaud a religious politician talking about the science supporting the traditional family unit over modern same-sex unions? Of course not. Don't applaud this politician for being hostile when people make choices he doesn't agree with. You won't be laughing when the people upset over this manage to put their politician in the White House and aggressively campaign to swing the pendulum back. \n\nStand against politicians purporting to be more than they are. Obama is no scientist. He's a politician and his science is the study of political units, which benefit from rhetorical speeches that raise funding for prepared agendas. A scholar of the constitution telling me to vaccinate is like a CEO saying lower taxes stimulates small business. Sure, there's research to support the claim but should we dive in head first because one says so? No, of course not. We find *other* research to refute the claim. That's natural. When people say it is wrong to be a skeptic, they are telling you to conform and chilling free speech. \n\nThis isn't about vaccines any more than government broadband is about fairness and net neutrality.

{"body": "&gt;In Australia where they also have universal healthcare and where it is an order of magnitude more remote than the USA they use light aircraft\n\nThe Australian population is even smaller than yours and they are also now quite a bit wealthier that the USA on a per capita basis (Thanks Obama).  I'd also be interested to know what percentage of their population lives in rural areas compared to the USA.\n\n&gt;I think the logistical problems could easily be overcome, especially for a country like the USA\n\nIf our veterans are dying after months and sometimes over a year of waiting for treatment in our veteran's hospitals, what makes you think that we can do a better job for our entire population?\n\n&gt;How do people in rural America get health assistance currently\n\nIt depends on the area.  Some places are lucky to have a small doctor's office hours away.  One thing we could do is just give people something like medical vouchers to use at the doctor or hospital of their choice and maintain a private system with public funding.  That's what we do for Medicaid &amp; Medicare (single payer systems for the poor &amp; elderly, respectively), though similar to how it is with certain health insurers doctors cannot be compelled to accept it, and in most cases they would be nuts to accept Medicaid because the reimbursements are so low.  Personally I would like to see the federal government 100% out of the health care business as it's something that I don't believe they have any Constitutional authority to deal with.  If the States want to attempt it, they're free to, but as Vermont has found [that's easier said than done](http://www.salon.com/2014/12/18/vermont_abandons_plan_for_single_payer_health_care/)\n\nI'm highly dubious of any claim that the NHS represents anything close to a success story for the UK.  Before the NHS came into existence there were new hospitals being built every year.  How many have been built since the NHS came into existence?  I don't know the answer to that question answer now, but I do know that it was very close to zero for decades.  Brits have lower quality health care than they would otherwise, but hey, at least it's available to everybody.  You have the lowest cancer survival rates in the whole of Europe (not that I think you're actually part of Europe), and we have the highest cancer survival rates in the world.

{"body": "Sorry for the novel, but I can answer this.\n\nI was homeless for five years, hitchhiked a bit, just got fucked up and wasted time.\n\nA year and a half ago I was sick of living in the backroom of a junkie's trailer living to get fucked up and being miserable and put out a call for help on FB. An older former coworker of mine responded and I went to the city he was in; I quit getting fucked up that day and have only had a few beers since. I worked two jobs until I could get back on my feet (70 hour weeks for about six weeks) and then I was fine.\n\nThat was the first time I was sober, stable, and self sufficient in my life, and it took me until I was 22 to pull it off. I wish I hadn't blown alot of chances, I wish I wasn't such a prick to many well meaning people. I've relapsed into a very unhealthy and poor attitude since then with a general malaise and apathy toward my workaday life but since it was pointed out to me, I realized its not enough to get off the fucking streets, you have to change your mentality too. \n\nIt is easy to do if somebody has your back. The guy who helped me wasn't even doing too great himself but he didn't give up on me. It took me three months to get to a point of total nonreliance on him. \n\nSome people don't have anybody like that, so it's not easy. It's actually really fucking hard if you're sleeping outside with little or no access to electricity and clean water. You look rough and people aren't willing to take a chance on you because of it. I got interviews because I had access to a shower and a well charged government phone (thanks, Obama!)\n\nI worked at a pizza place and in a frozen dough factory 6-7 days/week and it fucking sucked but I did make enough money to set my life straight and save up to move. \n\nWas it worth it? Definitely. Like I said, my attitude began to suck dick eventually, and I had to face some hard truths about myself that I didn't like. You don't just flip a switch, the mentality is still there and that's the hardest part to change. All that resentment of people who had normal enough and stable families who didn't cook meth or what have you. \n\nOut on the streets I got asked why I didn't just go home alot. Not everybody has parents who care and some people don't have parents at all, some people don't have family. I wanted to beat the shit out of some people's arrogance when they told me to go home. I didn't have a fucking 'home', that's why I ended up living in a Johnny Hobo song. Social services are sometimes more limited than people would think and vary in quality from place to place.\n\nAlso, addiction isn't easy to kick. It's deepseated in your emotional wounds, it's a coping mechanism. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419700195", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The President is allowing for more research and discussion from the feds and the states.   That seems reasonable to me.

Part of the pause comes from a Bush order;  _\"As usual, the political cauldron has been thoroughly churned during this President’s tenure. Eight years ago, President George Bush issued Executive Order 13406 which stated that the federal government must limit its use of taking private property for public use with just compensation for the purpose of benefiting the general public, wording mirrored in the U.S. Constitution. Bush’s Order 13406 limits the use of eminent domain so it may not be used for the purpose of advancing the economic interest of private parties to be given ownership or use of the property taken. While Bush’s Order applies only to the Feds, it certainly colors the same powers of the States and has an effect on the appellate courts.\"_   \nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2014/02/24/foreign-company-tries-to-seize-u-s-land-for-keystone-pipeline/   \nGranted- I am not well versed in this topic.

{"body": "No they're also getting really shitty food. \nDominos employee here. We do school lunches Monday-Thursday. It's a huge contract for any area that gets to do it but this is the first year where we have the new school lunches. We have to order in whole grain, low sodium dough, low fat cheese, low sodium premixed sauce, and low calorie, low sodium pepperoni. The entire process is insanely specific, down to cutting the pizzas perfectly. Each pepperoni pizza slice must contain exactly four pieces of pepperoni arranged in, well, the shape of a dick. Haha. The first two weeks I couldn't stop laughing about it- we're serving dicks to kids! \n\nAhem, anyways. Each pizza must have exactly one pound of cheese. When we bring them to the school, the staff has to weigh the pizza and take its temperature, like a newborn baby. \n\nFor us, it's not a huge deal. We've got the super specific process down by now and just making sure the shit gets out the door and to the school on time is the big part for both us and the school because the pizza is completely unfuckingedible after an hour. \n\nThe complaints we've gotten are glorious. The main complaint is it tastes like nothing/cardboard and the cheese \"fuses\" back together, making it hard to recut. I've eaten it fresh and had to put real cheese on it and slide it back through the oven for the thing to taste even slightly like pizza. Even then, I'll maybe take a bite or two because it's super early and I haven't had any food yet that day and toss the rest. It doesn't stay good the second it starts getting cold.\n\nThe other complaint we get the most is overstock. This is a huge problem. It's basically food waste in mass quantities. Kids don't like the pizza so they get something else or bring their own lunch. The staff has a ton of leftover pizzas that they can't get rid of or give away (because nobody wants them). So they toss an average of 12 pizzas PER DAY. Considering this is the average, four days a week, each school per district on contract, then you have hundreds of thousands per week per state. All because it tastes like shit. \n\nNormally, I'd never give a fuck but pizza was a staple food for any kid growing up in the 80's/90's, myself included. I remember kids going apeshit for pizza day and sometimes the school would run out and you'd barter with kids in the lunchroom who got the last slices. I don't want to live in a world where the pizza tastes so bad that kids grow up thinking that's the way it is and don't give it much of a second thought. \n\nI mean, I guess that's the plan, right? Make it shitty, early. Get the taste for it out at a young age so they'll grow up thinking that's how it is. They get offered pizza at a birthday party and they're like, yuck, no thanks, I'll eat some mini sliders instead or whatever the fuck else you feed kids at those things. They grow up eating cabbage or something. Or maybe they get all rebellious and only eat garbage. I dunno anymore, I'm babbling by this point. The food waste thing bothers me more than people's shitty kids eating shitty food but food waste is so unfortunately common and expected in this ass-backwards, bizarro world.\n\nTLDR: pizza sucks now, your kids are eating cardboard dick pizzas, right in the mouth.
