{"body": "Point one, Dota 2 keeps to the characters design, for a more realistic approach to how the hero might dress or look. League of legends comes out with Riot themed heroes to self promote and put \"Riot\" gear on. They look nothing like their former selves and just serve to make money from skins.\n\n* Dota 2 lets you reskin your hero with [Bounty Hunter w/o Cosmetics](http://i.imgur.com/zI74OdT.png) and [Bounty Hunter with Cosmetics (The set I like to wear, which is 3 different sets)](http://i.imgur.com/rH3J8Xd.png)\n\nAs I explained. Once a Nasus in a game gets to a certain amount of farm he does so much damage with his Q that he one shots people.
