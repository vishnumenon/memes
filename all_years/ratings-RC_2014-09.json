The fact that you were oblivious to how offensively racist your comment was is evidence to how you are actually racist yourself. Pathetic.\n\n&gt; Because people perceive words differently. Which is how we started this whole mess.\n\nThis started because you can't understand English.

You'll work it out one day, kid.\n\n&gt;I also don't see why you have to feel like I'm a kiddo. \n\nThe fact that you blame everyone for your own lack of education, your racism, and indeed, your actual lack of education and basic ignorance leads me to believe you are a primary school kid. Either that or someone with mental issues, but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt on that one, kid. ;)\n\n&gt;Does it make you feel better to think you're beating up kids on the internet or something?

But it made me want to talk(and I would, quickly) but id be worried the person I was talking to was getting bored of the conversation so id often half way through change the subject.\n\nLsd was strange for me, the first couple times it hit more on the emotions then I wound up taking a larger dose and started seeing halucinations.

I became one with the earth as the grass around my feet became one with me and I rooted myself into the ground. Everything I said was only semi coherent.\n\nLow doses of ketamine made me feel drunk. Higher doses and I wound up walking like johnny depp in fear and loathing eg BIG STEP little step BIG STEP little step. Mind you I fucked up and mixed it with molly at the time.\n\nMOLLY. Is a dance drug. Everything you do is fast and happy. My god I was happy to jusy dance. \n\nMushrooms I wound up laying in boiling hot tent at shambhala for 2 hours with a couple friends while laughing at nothing in particular.\n\nThe speed was an accident as far as I can tell it was supposed to be m.

{"body": "&gt; Pirelli SuperCorsa SP, BridgeStone BT-003, DUNLOP GP-A Pro, Michelin Power Supersport etc. In other words, the most aggressive tires that are not full-slicks.\n\n\nHonestly, these are not a good idea for you. Most of these tires are full on trackday tires, they aren't made to warm up as quickly as a street tire. They are designed for use with warmers, and if you don't use warmers they take longer than a street tire to come up to temp.\n\n\nPlus, if you're asking about tires, it's likely that you *are not fast enough* to work one of these tires hard enough to really use it.\n\n\nIt's not as simple as \"softer is more grippy but wears faster\". Yes, that's an aspect, but that's ignoring warm up time, carcass support, stability vs agility, etc, etc.\n\n\n\nI'd get Dunlop Q3's, Michelin Pilot Power 3's, or Pirelli Supercorsa SP's. [Here's me running a low advanced pace on Dunlop Q3's on a 1043cc bike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evnWm1mZdE0) At :23 you can see the rear tire squirming under acceleration and then lifting the front a little. If anyone is riding this fast on the street, they are either a moron or have some mental issues.\n\n\n\nQ3's have more grip than you'll ever need. They warm up fast(1 lap on the track, or a couple of minutes on the street), grip extremely well, and talk decently well for a street tire.\n\n\n\n\n[When they slide, they usually catch pretty quickly, even in 30 degree weather.](http://youtu.be/k3UqLA_yMuE) Granted, you aren't going to be riding in those kinds of temps, but you can see the tire still has grip even when literally ice cold. \n\n\nFor someone who doesn't ride at the track with full pace, that's important. You don't want to be that guy who buys a race slick thinking it'll give him grip, floors it out of his driveway, and ends up with his shiny Panigale in bits.\n\n\nAnd considering you just [jumped to a 2004 R1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Yamaha/comments/2du5ex/literally_100_stock_pristine_2004_yamaha_r1_red/) after only having ridden a 125 for a year and then a [burgman for 2 years](http://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/263rmv/jump_straight_to_liter_bike/) I'm 100% confident that you would be wasting your money on track tires and would likely not realize all the caveats to a track focused tire.\n\n\n\nSo, TL;DR get the Q3's m8, th'r gr8 i r8 8/8", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410104771", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "And the more news friendly their video is, the more American citizens who will see it first hand. Their message isn't one designed to draw American citizen's sympathy but to enrage Americans. Their demands are not reasonable or of humanitarian nature, it is only inflammatory and leaves no room for even the most neutral americans to say, \"Oh, I see what they mean now, maybe we should make a deal.\"\n\nThey already have the reputation of brutality, so showing it in the video will just take away viewers without adding anything to general opinion of their movement. They want people to be pissed, because when a majority of people feel threatened or injured they know our politicians will be much more likely to put American boots on the ground.\n\nSo to ISIS we should all be saying, \"Gr8 b8, m8. I rel8, str8 appreci8, and congratul8. I r8 this b8 an 8/8. Plz no h8, I'm str8 ir8. Cre8 more, can't w8. We should convers8, I won't ber8, my number is 8888888, ask for N8.

These journalists, who are (imo) generally noble, are taking well known risks by being out there. They are critical to our world of limitless information but their safety is an entirely separate issue than a millennia-old religious war being hijacked by a petty political land grab.\n\nTL;DR: ISIS is a shitposting newfag trying to get a rouse with Shovel Dog and we oldfags need to tell them to lurk moar and keep on with our business.

{"body": "&gt;An anecdote. First time I died in Null, when I had no idea what to expect, my barely fitted Imicus (didn't have cloak &gt;yet, had not mods for doing anything) was tackled and hit by a whole gang from E-Uni and then podded. I understood &gt;the gank but not the pod and asked some of the guys who got me about it and how I died. I was told I didn't do basic &gt;things to survive, that it was clear I was a noob, that I was podded because \"EvE!\" and that they did it because no &gt;one else had come through the gate in hours and they were bored.\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions of this game, especially among new players, is that people specifically target them **all of the time**. While specific entities may target new players because they are unaware of mechanics (this is especially true of some hisec groups), in the situation you described, it could have been literally *anyone in the game*, and they would have killed them. It is very atypical to actually see how old a player is before blowing them up if given the opportunity to do so.  \n  \nI'd also like to address the following:\n\n&gt;Many are now ready to respond with things like \"suck it\" \"good riddance\", \"you don't get EvE\", \"go back to WoW!\" etc. &gt;etc. but that is part of the point... yes it is a sandbox, but if you keep treating newbros like $hit until they learn the &gt;rules and that they have to both deal with and dish out tons of $hit, then you will continue to have trouble retaining &gt;newbros. The environment feels pretty toxic.\n  \nThe use of the word toxic here is fairly asinine. There *is* a lot of harsh criticism in Eve, because the competitive nature of the environment demands a certain level of competency in a lot of situations. Learning to take that criticism in a constructive way, instead of weeping endlessly about the forums about how the community is \"mean\" or \"hurting your feelings\" is one of the major aspects of this sandbox - nobody here is going to hold your hand, and every single entity in the game down to the most new player friendly corporation expects some self sufficiency and actual motivation. This isn't a game that will \"make you like it\". It's a game that you come to understand and appreciate through experiencing the great things that happen with the community and with the other players.  \n  \ntl;dr gr8 b8 m8 8/8", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410207791", "subreddit": "Eve", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

PS: Don't use \"Solo queue toxicity\" as a defense for getting called out wtf rofl. And then you *literally SHOW* Solo queue toxicity at 3:50 by going on a rengar blame game for getting caught ***AGAIN***. *\"I don't know why rengar didnt do anything when i decided to engage...\"*\n\n**Nooooo she engaged on you and solo'd you out. Repeat, you DIDN'T engage; you got CAUGHT.**\n\nWhat you should be saying is \"*I don't know why i didn't respect riven's early levels*[***WITH IGNITE***]*and get caught out*\" and \"*Why didn't I e and flash away from xin into the brush instead of trying to act like a sick cunt and e'ing on riven into the MIDDLE of the lane*\" \n\nIt may have been true rengar could have followed but riven did not use flash to kill you and Xin wasn't shown on the map yet. So at best he would have gotten a kill while Xin cleaned up + Riven assist putting you further behind. \nLike Jesus christ that was played poorly. But what i love the most is that you only won this game *Because* of the rengar. Solo queue success comes from realizing your own mistakes, not continuously pointing out others while paying a blind eye to yourself, that might be one of the reasons you're still struggling with 1000+ games in the lower elo.\n\nAlso although that guy is a dick; he has a point. Set your standards a little lower, at most \"Road to Plat\". Otherwise you will have no followers interested because they would think you're a self entitled prick. It's not like you're Gold 4 with 10 wins, who shows promise to climb.
