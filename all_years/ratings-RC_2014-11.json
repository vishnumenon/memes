Someone who can be funny while getting our points across and just mundanely unfunny (not incredibly or it becomes an anti-joke) if it's about side topics that are uninteresting. That way they would use positive footage, because comedy &gt; both facts and agenda for these programs. \n\nSo it is possible, it just isn't advised for the, frankly for the most part unprepared and unpracticed members of the revolt to participate.\n\nEDIT: I watch the Daily Show a lot. There are people who have come out \"successful\" in the middle-segment short interviews, but without exception they're very funny people who joke about the cause and laugh, but still get their message out.

Having something for the armor to concern themselves with whilst the infantry does their thing of shooting mans might help with the long stints of 'nothing' I felt when waiting for them to secure a town, the separation of infantry and armor at the last assault helped alleviate that problem greatly however, so it might just be up to how the commander handles the situation given to him. We might just need to run the mission another time to see how it's different with another commander.\n\n**Equipment**\n\nWas commanding in a BMP2, had vectors for some reason as well as a 148 and a 117F, ditched the 148 on the LCS as it was just superfluous for the comsig that had been set up, if armor had had their own net on the 148 I might have kept it, but everything was on channel 1 so yeah. Lack of magnified optics kinda bugged me as a commander, I don't get why BIS won't let me use binos when turned out, maybe something we can mod/script in.\n\n**Leadership**\n\nOverall seemed okay, I did notice a bit of confusion at times with the comms and were people were supposed to be, especially in the beginning, most of it was handled well though \"I can neither confirm nor deny that at this time\" became a bit of a joke within the vehicle. As the mission progressed comms slowly tightened up a bit but what I did notice was a general lack of confirmation to things from Sobol 2 and the fact command seemed to forget we were there at times so I elected to stick with Anna as best as I could whilst trying not to shoot too many mans.\n\n**Mission Timeline**\n\nSpawned on the LCS, mass confusion about where the vehicles were at first, took too long to disembark the LCS in the beginning but I think there were some technical issues delaying us, figured out my driver couldn't turn out anymore but that was sorted by using compass bearing orients and then referencing the landmarks he could see with his limited FOV.\n\nTrudged our way through the water, got shot at, shot back, took out a BRDM which was nice, made landfall and dumped our load. Took some time for the squads to get organized and assaulted the first town. Stayed mostly back, gave fire where we thought needed and then hung around whilst people were discussing whether or not the docks had been cleared for about 15 minutes and mans went to look for a sniper with a suppressed rifle.\n\nEventually moved further towards our main objective, no further resistance encountered so we loaded up again and trudged down the road singing our merry tunes of the motherland and made a \"you see Ivan...\" joke here and there.\n\nDumped our load again at another town and supported troop movement once again, witnessed 3/4 of Anna get mowed down by something and rushed forwards past the wounded to try and provide cover and a bigger target for mans to shoot at, eventually got everyone back up and cleared the town before people mounted up again.\n\nMoved further onto the road, took some fire before the final objective but ditched our mans again and proceeded to hold briefly before assaulting along side Sobol 2, moved into an entrenched position behind some friendly and helpful sewage pipes and a barricade that I guess was supposed to stop us but instead got turned into BMP cover as our mans assaulted the town whilst we tried to murder what was trying to murder them, Sobol 2 got taken out by a technical, we got revenge, then silence.\n\nSuddenly hear an engine behind us, and see a flash of a white SUV/Truck door through the trees, get the BMP turned around and into cover on the other end of the sewage pipes and took out a small squad and 3 technicals that were trying to counterattack and instead got on the wrong end of a 30mm cannon. Good times were had by russians, not so much the rebels.\n\nGot shot at by someone on our side who couldn't aim, almost lit up Iron as he came driving in in a technical. Then we moved up to the RP and mission was called after singing glorious soviet national anthem next to the BMP.\n\n**Overall**\n\nHad fun, would like to see some more threats to the armor, ride script got sorted out (dammit Faaaaaaaxxxx!), had plenty of mans to shoot, no zoom to see them with and I think I managed to restrain my bump a bit. Good times. i r8 8/8", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414999344", "subreddit": "ClearBackblast", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Picture this.\n\nA strangely hot day in regularly cold and wet South Wales, I just about win my last game at 89 lp to get into Gold promos, I've never been this close before in my life, panic ensues.\n\nI queue up, lock in Leona (my main) and all is well, no problems so far, game goes well and me and my team obliterate our enemies forcing them to surrender.\n\nThe adrenaline is pumping through my body so I queue up again, this time I'm 5th pick and Morgana isn't banned somehow, manage to lock her in and the game starts. Game goes awfully and everyone on my team feeds (including myself, sucks right?)\n\nI think to myself \"Okay, it's quite late, I should sleep, nah bun that lets go again\"\n\nYou know the deal, get put into ADC. An unfamiliar role but hey, Gold is at the stake with a week to go before season ends, what do I have to lose? Lock in Jinx against Lucian, leggo. Lane goes perfectly and I get almost every CS that comes my way, end lane phase 4-0 (their support wasn't the best) Rest of the game goes okay so we win after about 5 teamfights and a baron steal from our godly jungler.\n\nNow I think to myself \"Yeah.. It's late and I'm literally sweating, time to sleep.\" Dreams filled with game scenarios, yeah I know how sad that is, but I want Gold so it's cool, right? Right.\n\nMorning comes, go into the day with a clean head and my mind set on one thing, Gold.\n\nEat breakfast, shower, change into comfy clothes, sit down at desk, headset on, open League... It's time.\n\nQueue up, lock in Leona. Game is a HUGE struggle, almost 1 hour long after numerous teamfights, my team loses about 75% of them but our Yi backdoors at 56 minutes to get us the win. At this point I'm shaking and sweating more than I ever have before (in a game of League atleast)\n\nQueue up again, lock in Leona... Game was.. Extremely difficult. Mid lane gives first blood, top dies 5 times in Lane and our Jungler refuses to gank \"until he gets feral flare\" \n\nThe most stale and passive bot lane ever, their Blitz blindly throws out pulls and I keep river warded for ganks, Caitlyn and Jinx exchange auto attacks but, nothing exciting.\n\nAbout 50 minutes into the game I spot their Nocturne trying to come up behind us while teamfights form at mid lane, I instantly call him out and get my team to role all over his face, then the enemy team force a fight. Bad mistake for them.\n\nI ult 3 people, pop locket on all my team mates and go in simply shoving myself to their back line and locking up Jinx, never let her out of my sight and keep beating her into a pulp. Behind me the 3v4 teamfight is barely happening, Caitlyn keeps poking and poking away but to no avail, I get jinx go about half health and ping her like crazy, Caitlyn locks in her ult and BOOM, Jinx dies.\n\nGet myself right back into the teamfight and continue to be as obnoxious as possible, the glorious word \"Ace\" gets played into my headphones. Only Caitlyn and I are left on the rift.\n\nWe push down mid, get all nexus defenses and finish the game. Best games of my life.\n\nEdit: tl;dr gr8 games m8 couldnt concentr8 but i r8 8/8", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415616193", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Excuse me? I'm shoving my mindset onto others? I AM shoving it??? If there’s any “shoving” going on, it’s from stupid internet teenagers and overly-tolerant companies such as 2k or Bioware, down the throats of normal people who may be indifferent, or may be, like me, highly intolerant of gays.\n\nWonderful. You admit you're highly tolerant of gay people, but yet that doesn't stop you from projecting your feelings upon everyone else and assuming everyone feels the same. They are being inclusive, tolerant and just plain ol' nice. I don't know why that gets under your skin, though.\n\n&gt;“No one bats an eye at the quest where you have to listen to Roland and Lilith flirting” -- Yeeeah might be because they're normal people? And it’s normal for male and female to flirt around??\n\nIt's normal for *people* to flirt, and the gender shouldn't matter. I'm not saying they should remove that -- it establishes certain characteristics of Lilith and Roland (awkwardness, off the top of my head) -- no, I'm just saying no one gave a fuck, yet Jainey and Athena... well here we are now.\n\n&gt;Gays are by FAR a minority. What’s their overall numbers compared to normal people? 5%? 7% of population?\n\nSauce, bra? I know we're a minority, but dat percentage doe.\n\n&gt;And you dare to demand so much attention and acceptance? No. A bit of attention maybe, alright. \n\n\"So much\"? We would like acceptance, we'd like marriage, we'd like people to not fear getting their ass beaten up for holding hands. With all the things that have happened, I'd say giving us that isn't *so much to ask*. \n\n&gt;One-two not-too-important npc would've been enough. NOT 40% of all characters, including playable. \n\nSauce for that? Also, who gives a flying fuck about sexuality! The game is just that. A game. You are making a big fuss about it, when their sexuality won't determine class balance, skills, etc. If you are repulsed by simply playing an LGBT character, then by GabeN you are fucking intolerant.\n\n&gt;Seriously, what a totally fucked up worlds people of Borderlands and Dragon Age live in where every third one (at least) is gay? \n\ngr8 grammer m8, i r8 8/8.\n\nDude, sauce. The basis of your argument is simply the number of people, yet you don't bother to give accurate numbers. You're exaggerating everything to get your point across.\n\n&gt;And worst of all they fucking have to mention it all the time! Hammerlock couldn’t avoid using the word “boyfriend”. That Rosie npc couldn’t just not mention that her “ex” is also a “her”. Dialogue between Tina and Athena about Springs couldn’t be left out for whatever reason. They HAVE to PUSH, or using your own words, SHOVE their sexuality down player’s throats.\n\nThey are mentioning something about themselves, a relationship between two people. How would 'Lock know some guy was missing? It builds character, dude. The Rosie thing was out of place, I'd say, but maybe it's just to show how precocious she was about all that. She mentioned Gabby not being able to handle it, and herself editing \"several political letters\". Tina and Athena... well would you be complaining if it was a straight person? I've drawn parallels between Scooter and Jainey before. Scooter is even creepier in his methods of wooing ladies, not even quitting when one moved *to a fucking wasteland* to get away from him. Jainey was very coy about telling us \"they\" killed her girlfriend.\n\n&gt;“No one gives a fuck about sexuality” that’s what you want to think. Gays were despised, are despised now and will always be despised and laughed at by great many people.\n\nMany is not all nor is it none. As long as there are ***good*** people supporting, then it shouldn't matter how many give a flying fuck.\n\n&gt;It’s a vocal internet minority that creates an illusion of tolerance.\n\nOh, and anti-gay people are abounds and quiet, with you as the sole voice for a people under threat? Dude, how can you be sure of any of that?\n\n&gt;I have many friends who also post pro-gay shit online and say that they're “perfectly fine” with someone’s sexuality. But when pressed on the matter by me, they cracked that they actually don’t like gays and wouldn’t want to ever see one and definitely wouldn’t want to have any contact with them.\n\n... secondary idea: they didn't want to get into a fight with a bigoted idiot and just nodded and smiled to get the fuck out of whatever zone the pair of you were currently occupying. \n\n- **OR**\n\nYou are talking out of your rectum, through your anus and over the ass cheeks.\n\n &gt;Also, surely mods deleting anti-gay posts and banning people for it, practically forcing people who dislike gays to be quiet, has nothing to do with it either, right?\n\nGot some barbecue **source** for that hefty plate of accusation and assumption?\n\n&gt;Go play an mmo where such rules are not enforced on people and listen to how much tolerant people are and count how often someone’s called a “fag”. You think they using that word out of tolerance and it’s actually a praise? Heh…\n\nPeople say vulgar things online. I can't condone that, but I can't condemn it. I will insult others on a particularly bad day. Sure, they use the word fag, but that's only one of many words they use. I also like how you assume I think that's them being tolerant.\n\n&gt;Keep living your illusion, knowing that every time you sit in cafe with your “boyfriend”, there’s someone looking at you with disgust.\n\nI don't have a boyfriend, sadly. Thank you for thinking that a fellow like me could get someone!\n\n&gt;Anyway… I've made my point\n\nHave you? You've just said a bunch of crap. Words =/= making a point.\n\n&gt;don’t bother with your angry answers\n\nOkay, I'll just be nice, like you! Also, nice, you say you've made your point with an argument that falls to more pieces than a brisket, then you deny any further discussing.\n\n&gt;And oh yes, they will, trust me they will…. Keep your closet ready… You're moving back soon.\n\nParting words that have left me thinking. My closet's full, though. Got jumpers, a courier bag, Family Guy board game and a battleship model in there.

{"body": "Alright girl expert here, I'm gay by the way so this comment has no prior bias.\n\nFirst off you have to realize that girls are indeed people too, but not like men people, men are MUCH more fun and approachable and much less mean all around. So actually women are nothing like people that you are used to, mostly men. Thats ok tho because im going to teach you ow to be with women. \n\nIf you want to approach a women, just think like you're approaching a dude. But forget how you would normally approach a dude because you're not approaching a hot, sexy, handsome, cute, TONED, adorable, FLOWING HAIR, ripped male. You are approaching a female who you have no prior experience with. So try and be calm. \n\nWomen will always go for people who are very attractive over the people who are ass ugly. If you're ugly im sorry you're probably not gonna have a good time. However some women like comedy and others do not. So try and be funny at first but if she doesnt take it just try and be boring as well. If she takes the b8 m8 r8 8/8 meme then she will probably start talking to you. And as chip$ says in the song Detroit 187 by Danny Brown \"If she makes eye contact then the bitch'll fuck\" and I'm guessing that is what you're going for in the first place.\n\nHowever the STD rate for hetreosexal couples are MUCH higher than homosexual couples (cite needed xD) its just a lot smarter to FDB )fuckthat bithc( and then try being gay. I dont think i was born gay but i sure changed into one, might be something my parents did with the whole abuse and stuff (i will reply more about this if someone asks, but i dont want to get too personal).\n\nSo overall, just try and be yourself and she probably wont like you or maybe she will and have sex.\n\n\nEDIT: thanks for the gold sind kranger :33", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415843035", "subreddit": "teenagers", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am no fan of the majority either but for example: NGNL and Aldnoah.Zero were both very much loved animé by the \"mass\" like SAO2 and UBW now. The 'critics' rate both shows lower than the ratehappy mass thus they'd give them both a 5/6 while the mass would r8 8/8 or something like that. You rated NGNL low while Aldnoah.Zero for example pretty high, which is unusual I think.\n\nOverall, you haven't watched a lot of \"strange\" shows or hidden gems which some people purely watch to seem more elitist or at least get that effect so on first glance your list looks a bit like you are dull and mainstream (pls don't interpret that as an insult from me)\n\nBut... As I continued to also look at your (huge) plan to watch, I would like to point out that Katanagatari, Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Eureka Seven are part of my all time favourites, and pretty unknown shows like Suisei no Gargantia and Tales of the Abyss are also really good. To add since you seem to love TTGL (which I haven't watched yet, should I?) you will probably love Diebuster (so in reverse I should watch TTGL by my own logic)\n\nDiebuster is only 6 episodes and the sequel to an '80s show called Gunbuster, both by Gainax. Gunbuster is also 6 episodes and is regarded as one of the defining trendsetters to mecha animé. It may not look too good but it aged pretty well and has a great ending.\n\nDiebuster is the sequel that plays 12,000 years later. You can technically watch it without Gunbuster but Diebuster, while it has the TTGL artstyle, nice characters and a cool story, the ending is where it's at.\n\nThis ending I literally saw 10 minutes ago and it was really good but without having seen Gunbuster it wouldn't have been as great. I don't know what your opinion is towards clannad and afterstory, but most people see clannad as a \"have to go through first sigh\". Gunbuster isn't like that because it's 4 times as short and a pretty good show as of itself that will also fit in with your taste.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417211810", "subreddit": "PostYourMAL", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
