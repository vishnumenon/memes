During the tour, Suyin introduced her sons, Wei and Wing, who were in the midst of playing power disc. Wei was able to score on Wing by hitting the metal disc off a pillar and over his brother's head. Suyin complimented Wei on his shot, and he celebrated by gesturing and declaring that Wing had gone down. Wing showed his frustration by hitting the ground with his fists.\n&gt;They later sat down to dinner with their family, minus their father and eldest brother who were busy with their projects, and guests.

{"body": "Yeah, in the Bay of Plenty. I was there during the 'Enough is Enough' Destiny church marches. We sent teachers along as our representatives and had full-school (Bethlehem College goes from primary to secondary) assemblies detailing why we as Christians should be appalled.\n\nI know the environment was not gay-friendly and very ridiculously heteronormative. The idea that a student was possibly not heterosexual never crossed the schools mind. For example I kissed another boy in school and to the school councillors and teachers dealing with the issue \"I was acting out\". My sexuality was never questioned. \n\nI recall my teacher in English making us do a book report on 'Deadline' which has seriously anti-LGBT themes and very violent themes. This was in Year 8. The protagonists daughter catches HIV and her partner is at fault because he's bisexual. Pretty much the theme is that bisexuality gives AIDs and HIV to the straight population and our teacher told us as such. The disease was also viewed as a punishment for homosexuality by our teacher. \n\nSexual Health focused solely on heterosexuality and abstinence, or waiting until you were married. Masturbation wasn't mentioned and as a student I brought it up and was scolded.\n\nThe school councillor was also known to not keep the confidence of students. So he wasn't a member of staff you could trust.\n\nDuring my time there a principal stepped down so a teacher could keep their job at the school after hitting a student. \n\nOh and the BOT rep refused to represent the international students and was openly a Neo-Nazi. Later he had to apologise in an assembly after getting caught having oral with a girl in the school toilets.\n\n2/10\n3/10 with rice", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417946757", "subreddit": "newzealand", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

My family and I were out chilling at a beach side restaurant after a long day of trekking through the historic town. I, being the excitable, animal-loving 2-3 year old I was, spotted a dog and ran off to go and pet it, without telling my parents of course. When my food arrived, my parents sent my older brother to go and find me. \n\nOf course, my brother found me, minus most of my chin. My brother, being the 5-6 year old he was, ran back to my parents making \"Wee-aw\" noises like an ambulance with his arms swinging wildly above his head. My parents rush to where my brother had told them I was and called the ambulance, having me rushed to a local hospital. When I got to the hospital I had a bunch of stitches put in had my chin repaired by the doctors. All I remember from that day is waking up in a high ceilinged room with plenty of pain in my chin and a huge scar running horizontally across the gap between my chin and bottom lip.\n\n2/10, would not recommend\n\n5/10 with rice, though!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417960972", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This past thanksgiving morning. I woke up to a missed called, and two texts from my ex. We broke up about two months prior, but we both still had feelings for each other. She is one that needs attention, and since she is 3 hours away from me I cant give it to her like the guys around her. So when she moves in, she has the biggest douche bag from our high school class going to the same school. They were on good terms before, and now get closer since they know each other and are around each other. My ex, who was dating me at the time, didn't listen to me when I told her not to speak to douchebag's roommate cause they're all shit people. She doesn't listen, goes over to his room sober, and cheats on me with douchebags roommate. Break up the 29th of September, on and off back and forward blowing up at each other because we both still want to be together but now it won't cause its too much of a mess. I go and fuck my other ex for comfort and to cross it off the list (hadn't fucker her prior, 0/10 would do again, 1/10 with rice). She called me on the Saturday before thanksgiving calling me a hypocrite for sleeping with her and shit and whatever. Didn't Care, I was single and she was slutting it up with guys when she went out on the weekends. \n\nAnyway, thanksgiving morning she tells me she did something she feels guilty about and it wasn't too get back on me. I figure she fucked douchebags roommate and felt crushed by it. I don't know why, but I just did. I was balling my eyes out for like 20 minutes at 7 in the morning before starting my day. I just tell myself to get over it and ignore it. She was in town, so we met up, got some head from her, went home for the night. Text her the next day asking what actually happened. Turns out she fucked douchebag. Who had a thing with my ex's roommate. So they have an incestuous friend group and I lost almost all respect for her since her telling me that.\n\nTl;Dr Women suck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418007028", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Oh boy that movie was so great, I'd recommend it to anyone. One of my friends decided to bring food from outside (which is forbidden, and note getting something to eat is so expensive in cinemas). He sneaks a bag of crisp's by putting it inside his sweater. So we get fairly easy inside and are watching the movie for like an hour. When suddenly my friend decides to eat some crisps. I swear the movie is on all sound all the time, and right when an important moment hits where there is nothing but silence, my mate decides to open the bag and put one big fat crisp in hit mouth. I remember that one bite of him as if it was yesterday. *KKGGRPPP* . I felt embarrassed and joyed at the same time (don't know how to put it). I couldn't resist but to laugh because the sound was just too perfect, but alot of people were looking our way :P \n\nAnyway great movie i r8 it 8/8. I don't know what to exactly link, as it is described as pick a 'product'. I searched the redditgift thingy and couldn't find anything related. However if I do win, i'd like someone (random) else to get it :) I'm feeling generous today.\n\nEdit2: God, i am so stupid. It doesn't have to be a related gift..

{"body": "I think most Americans have a buffet ritual. When it comes to the economy of a buffet, you are paying a set price and the value goes up the more you eat. With Vegas-Style buffets that can include steak and other more expensive dishes, the typical strategy is just gorge on the hot ticket items and avoid things that fill you like bread and vegetables. Here is the strategy that I recommend:\n\nSo, my buffet ritual is to avoid all salads. I don't even get why they offer a salad (well I understand why--they are trying to cheat me out of my money). Go straight for the steak, lobster, sushi cuts, etc. in Plate 1 so you can be sure you maximize your buffet economy.  In baseball, you can usually trust the leadoff hitter to at least make it to base. This will ensure that your meal is off to a good start, and place you ahead of the buffet's finances as far as economy goes. \n\nPlate two is more of plate one, but now you can add in other dishes that look interesting or expensive. If there is a foreign food, now is the time to give it a try. Still avoid any carb-heavy dishes and salad.\n\nPlate 3 is where it can get more interesting. Grab some more of the plate 1 dishes, but now feel free to add anything. Aim for foods you know you enjoy. Plate 2 was to allow you to try new things, and is early enough in the eating order that you won't be too full for an experience. Part of the unseen buffet economy is that you are also paying to taste dishes you otherwise would not have ordered off a menu. Never tried sushi? Give it is a shot in Plate 2 but aim for pieces that don't have the rice. Too much new food can upset your digestive track and cause it to fill with gasses. To prepare for the rest of the meal, plate 3 allows you to go back to what you know and what will agree with your intestinal bacteria.\n\nPlate 4 is some more of plate 1, but now go for appetizer foods. Things you can just eat with your fingers so the fine motor muscles that typically move a fork and knife can have a rest. Dishes with dipping sauces are perfect, as they will help the finger foods slide down your throat easier, and then your throat will be lubricated for the next plate.\n\nPlate 5 is the final plate of main courses. Grab as much steak, lobster, and other expensive items that you can handle. Get more than you think you can handle, and force it down. You want to maintain a good buffet economy. If there was another dish you really enjoyed, get just a small portion of it. Remember, the key is to eat steak and lobster. The buffet economy secret is in the expensive meats.\n\nPlate 6 is the desert plate. Many buffets have slices of cake, pie, cupcakes, or a soft serve. Get at least 2, and load it up with the squirt bottles of chocolate syrup or caramel syrup. You are paying for the syrups, and if you do not use them then it is money down the drain and the buffet is winning. It is advised that you eat a warmer desert than ice cream, as ice cream is cold and will contract the stomach, reducing space.\n\nPlate 7 is plate 1 again. You have now filled up, but if your esophagus isn't to the brim then you can swallow one more lobster tail. At this point in the meal you may have taken your shirt off to allow more room.\n\nPlate 8 is the final plate. If you were doing a good job, this plate will be smaller and be difficult to see behind the tears. This plate should consist of steak and lobster. Remember to avoid cards. Do no grab bread. You should be full enough from the protein to not need carbs, and it may be dangerous to ingest carbs at this rate. If you still feel hungry or not full, then grab more steak and lobster.\n\nSo there you go. This is the ritual to maximize your buffet economy. Using this strategy you can have a\n\n10/10 Buffet experience\n\n7/10 with rice", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418142372", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 264, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I dated a very pretty mtf girl for a couple weeks.. after about a week,I had sex with her 3 times over the course of a couple days. Then she stopped returning my calls.\n\nAnyway, I met her at work when she was there waiting to pick her sister up. She was from brazil and very tan, hot, and exotic looking. I talked to her for about ten minutes, but had no idea of her secret as she was totally feminine and petite in every way... and only about 5'3\" tall.\n\nWhen I said what are you doing tonight, can I get your number? She right away just said \"but I am boy\" ...I'm like whaaa? \"I have penis\" she says. My wiener processed this faster than my mind could; in the half second it took me to figure out what this godess was saying, I could have hammered nails with my shit. I had always fantasized about being with a transexual girl.\n\nSo we went out just about every night, spent a couple nights and days together for a week, then finally did the deed...\n\nIn the past I had had a girlfriend who loved to toss my salad and finger me, and it felt great. I'm the type of person that thinks like if it felt that good, a cock must feel even better. Also, even though I can't see myself ever doing a guy, cocks are pretty neeto in themselves.\n\nSo I get undressed, and my little 5 inch warrior is throbbing at full attention. This cute little tiny girl whips out the cock of a greek god. I'm in awe of it. About 9 scary thick inches of up-curved perfect beauty. A bit of 69 laying on our sides, she fingers me with lube to get me ready...\n\nSoon she is easing her huge member into my little virgin asshole. Very slow and not all of it for a long time. I had taken 3 10 mg percs to deal with some of the pain, but mostly so I wouldn't cum to soon. I did pretty good overall, especially considering I thought I would just bust before she could get it in.\n\nShe pretty much half shafted me for about 10 minutes, as I just couldn't take any more of her. She knew what was up and was obviously pretty good at this... when I said I was going to cum, she quickly worked it all the way in and started doing short strokes really fast. I pretty much had a 5 minute orgasm at that point. It felt like I was cumming the whole time but I couldn't get any fluid out until the end.\n\nThis is the thing though... I was on my feet squatting on the bed while she stood up. She was able to suck my cock while fucking my ass. I wish I could find porn where this is done lol.\n\nI've had sex with a lot of women, but this was by far the most intense thing I have ever experienced. It was like a whole body orgasm that lasted forever. Like my soul was cumming. Beyond anything ever imagined, all 3 times we boned.\n\n10/10 would recommend. ...and of course 11/10 with rice.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418316402", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My personal thoughts of the Top 20 as the show progresses. Keep in mind that these are just my views of the song, and may not reflect your views or /r/trance’s views of the song as a whole.\n\nPre-Show: Aww yiss, GDJB.  Sad note that Markus is skipping the City Compilation this year and instead doing a \"World Tour 2015,\" where he'll release 1 new track every month dedicated to a city.  :(\n\nCurrently Playing: Solarstone &amp; Orkidea - Slowmotion III  mmmmm followed by some \"In The Shadows.\"  But then he follows that with his new track \"Winter Kills Me.\" :-/   Not a big fan.\n\nFinal Thoughts: The addition of \"138\" over the past year or so will *hopefully* affect the Top 20 away from what it has been the past few years, but you never know.  Personal thoughts are that Ping Pong and U will be Top 3.  On Fire should be up there as well.\n\n...here we go!\n\n**ASOT EOYC 2014 Thoughts**\n\n25-21: The tease again this year on what could have been...\n\n25) Dash Berlin...meh.  Decent tune for \"Here Tonight,\" but nothing spectacular.\n\n24) Mmmm, that's more like it. \"L'Absente\" definitely received some votes on our own Top 20 poll, and who can argue with the melody these two have created? Both have definitely been churning out some great tunes the past year or so.\n\n23) Thrillseekers! Good showing with \"This is All We Have.\"  Glad to see it got ranked so highly; hopefully we still have some great tunes to go!\n\n22) What a superb song and remix.  Love Dart Rayne's work this year.  Vocals sound fresh.  And Allen &amp; Envy have just been killing it with remix duties lately.  Well deserved play.\n\n21) Alex M.O.R.P.H. with his yearly \"Angel's Love\" follow-up, and every year it just drifts that much more into \"eh\" that replicating the wonder from a few years ago.  Above average track, but that's about it this year for Mr. MORPH I'm afraid.  \n\nNow the Top 20...\n\nor not...some of Armin's favorites not in Top 20:\n\n50) Sneijder &amp; Bryan Kearney - Next Level.  Armin surprised it's not in Top 20.  Sadly I'm not.\n\n39) Philippe El Sisi &amp; Abstract Vision ft Jilliana Danise - This Time.  Great tune out of place.\n\n83) In Armin's Top 10: Allen Watts - Blackout\n\nNow the\n\n**TOP 20**\n\n20) ...I just can't get into this Aly &amp; Fila // Jaren combination anymore.  Just not my cup of tea.  Decent song in my personal opinion, but doesn't do anything for me.\n\n19) Two songs in, two vocals from Aly &amp; Fila.  Positive: we have 100% more uplifting this year in the Top 20 than the entire last year.  Downside: Looks like Aly &amp; Fila Control The Top 20 this year with their album release. Or maybe that's a positive depending on your view. \n\n18) More vocals.  More mediocre remixes of Armin's work.  Bobina not on form.  Sounds like a ASOT #trancefamily Top 20.  The original wasn't even the best on Armin's last album.  And even if you enjoy Big Room and Trouse (which I'll admit I do), this still is a meh track.  Not inspired by anything whatsoever.\n\n17) Ctrl+C \"The Other Shore\" tracklist.  Ctrl+V \"Top 20 of 2014.\"  Hint to voters: there were other artists that released tracks this year.  Still, great melody and probably one of my favorites on \"The Other Shore\" this year.  Roger Shah back in better form than what he's produced otherwise this year (or last to be honest).  \n\n16) Decent track from MarLo.  Jano's voice is always nice to hear.  Not perhaps MarLo's best work ever, but probably one of the highlights from him this year.   Our vocal trek continues at 5/5.\n\n15) It's true this song is \"One in a Million.\" Doesn't make it any good though. 1/10.  2/10 with rice.\n\n14) Is it the best anthem ever created? Nah.  Cygnus X holds that honor.  Or maybe Rank 1.  Still, definitely a solid production by Jorn that at least has all the right elements for a good anthem in today's era of trance music.\n\n13) Interested to see how Blue Sky Action is (potentially) out-performing \"Sticky Fingers\" from the trio.  Personally I enjoyed Sticky Fingers a lot more than BSA.  Alex's vocals on this really don't do it for me on this track.  Nor the melody that much...nothing special from A&amp;B.\n\n12) Not a fan of Dash Berlin's recent works.  But my gosh does Photographer know how to completely change a track around for the better.  Superb remix.  Definitely highly up-voted here on /r/trance every time it's been posted so far.  Shame it didn't score higher in the Top 20.\n\n11) Another MarLo track.  It's got an interesting breakdown that grew on me over a few listens. Might not be everyone's choice for the 11th best tune of the year (not in my personal Top 30, for example), but hey, there are definitely less deserving tunes that could have been voted here instead.  It's one of those tracks that IMO works 10x better live than over the radio.\n\n10) Another Rayel track.  Not a fan of this shift from 2012 after things like \"550 Senta,\" but I enjoy the vocals on this song.  Definitely one of Rayel's better tracks this year.\n\n9) Apparently I didn't keep up with ASOT as much this year, because I really don't know where the Top 20 Love for Bobina is coming from (Aly &amp; Fila I understand...).  Good piano breakdown on the song; a bit long though.\n\n8) F the haters.  This track rules live.  PING. PONG. (Edit: I know it's not really trance.  Some acid influences, but still...)\n\n7) I'm a fan of the KhoMha remix personally.  Another one of those Armin tunes that should stick with the live play and not radio.  But to be Top 10 is not unexpected on his own show.\n\n6) Love the intro part of this track from Cosmic Gate.  Surprised the Sixma remix was used here.  Despite that, still a decent tune from this year.\n\n5) Armin + Rayel on an ASOT Track? No surprise this made #5.  You can definitely hear more of Rayel's influence I think for the underlying beat with Armin's classic breakdown.  It's good for the big room perhaps.  \n\n4) We get away from the Big Room to go back to some proper uplifting trance.  Surprised this ended up only at #4, considering that it was supposedly in the hunt for #1 a few weeks ago.\n\n\n**2013 Top 3 were played next**\n\n3) Apprehension was a superb tune.\n\n2) RAMelia a bit over-rated and only got there from the story behind the song IMO.\n\n1) Armin van Buuren - Intense probably one of Armin's best from the past few years.\n\n**2012**\n\n1) Never was a fan of Concrete Angel.\n\n**2011**\n\n1) Nor We Control The Sunlight\n\n**2010**\n\n1) But Yuri Kane? Mmmmhmm.\n\n\n**Back to 2014**\n\n3) Surprised to see The Reason up so high.  I still think \"Dreams\" between this duo was their best work.\n\n2) Not the worst Gaia track ever produced (that award goes to Stellar), but I think Humming The Lights surpasses this track by a considerable margin.  The breakdown here is nice though.  Still, it's a Armin and Benno track, so it's getting top places.\n\n1) I'm assuming as I still listen to Gaia in the background that it's going to be Gareth Emery's \"U.\"  Which is disappointing to me since I have the same feelings towards the song that I do towards Concrete Angel: overplayed, uninspired, and meh vocals.  At least Gareth shifted up his vocal crew this time.  For someone who's been dabbling mostly in the Big Room and Electro House scene and recently switched their radio show up to include Deep House as well, it really is amazing how he's claimed the Top Tune of the Year on ASOT 2 of the past 3 years.  Doing something right to the masses.\n\nEdit: The Bryan Kearney remix is being played. Redemption.  \n\n**Overall Thoughts**\n\n13/20 Vocals.  Lot more big room than I was expecting.  Aly &amp; Fila taking the cake this year despite (surprisingly high) showings from Rayel and Bobina.  Armin of course has his tracks place high, but surprisingly not as high as I originally thought.  Bryan Kearney remix saves the end IMO, but still, not a fan of the overall outcome of the Top 20.  \n\nOnce the list of all votes is posted, I'll scroll through and post some highlights on where some popular (and not so popular) songs ended up.\n\n\n**Top 100 Tracks [Here](http://www.astateoftrance.com/news/top-100-tracks-of-the-year-revealed/)**\n\nMy Personal Top 5:\n\nAndrew Bayer - Once Lydain (#32)\nAbove &amp; Beyond - Mariana Trench (Carl Overnet 140 Remix) (Hahaha, no)\nRex Mundi - Static Room (Lol no)\nBart Claessen - Playmo (Aaron Camz Bootleg) (Definitely not)\nSasha - Xpander (Tucandeo Extended Bootleg) (Never to be found)\n\n\nOther interesting Top 100 Tracks:\n\n26) Above &amp; Beyond - Satellite (ilan Bluestone Remix)\n\n37) Omnia - Tomorrow People\n\nThe WTF ones:\n\n38) Simon Patterson - Brush Strokes\n\n48) Armin van Buuren - Beautiful Life \n\n53) Andrew Rayel &amp; Bobina - Sacramentum\n\nNot only were these three songs from *2013*, but the past two made the *Top 15* of 2013.

{"body": "From Michigan.\n\nWent to Tennessee over Thanksgiving. Trying to keep up on working out, so I get a couple of day passes for a Golds gym in Chattanooga. \n\nOne thing I notice right off rip is the level of attractive people in Chattanooga compared to Detroit. I mean everyone in this gym looked good. So I'm with my gf's brother who also came down with his long term gf. We finally got away from the girls and the whole family scene and we are working out upper back, scoping the scene as you do.\n\nI make eye contact with this 8/10 and she smiles at us (probably the brother). Well she is with a typical skinny college dude, full Under Armour gear and wearing a shitty sense of entitlement. He starts giving the girl shit right away.\n\nI am past the age of having anything to prove. So I grab the brother and fuck off to the other side of the gym. We keep working out on some equipment I have never even seen before. \n\nWe round the gym after about 30 min or so and end up at the resistance machine by the bench area and there is college boy and his 10/10 with rice. She is spotting him on the incline. Right away I can tell dude is threatened because he ups his bench two plates for a total of four plates and two quarters. I really pay him no mind and I keep working on delts.\n\nThen I hear \"oh my god\" and this dude is being crushed by the bar. I mean he is half off the bench trying to throw the bar off of him and 7/10 thanks for the suggestion is fumbling at the bar.\n\nInstinct kicks in and I run right over to get the bar off if him and so does this big black dude, we pick up the bar and set it. College's pride was hurt so he couldn't even muster a \"thanks\". We walked away and I heard him giving the girl shit for not spotting him correctly. he backs off the weight 140lbs and keeps pressing. I've had enough at this point and leave.\n\nWe jump in the rental and it pops in my head. \"DO YOU EVEN LIFT RESPONSIBLE, BRO?\" is what I should have said.\n\nTL; DR: shouldn't stink eye people at the gym when you are going to lift too much to impress a chick in tight yoga pants.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419097564", "subreddit": "Fitness", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright. A little late, but here goes.\n\nFriday morning my older brother drove me to school, which was nice because he had only gotten back from college the day before. Because of block scheduling for finals, I had only two classes, only one actual final, and a short day. First \"final\" was choir, so we just had a potluck and exchanged gifts for our Secret Santa (I got a bunch of Magic the Gathering cards from my friend). Some people who were in choir last year and graduated showed up, including my brother, so it was nice to see them again too. \n\nAfter choir, I hung out with a bunch of my friends in the library during the break between finals, including a girl that I sort of half have a crush on. After the break, me and the girl started going to our English final and we ran into my crush. I lent her my calculator for her Physics final and we went on our way. \n\nAfter English (which was boring as fuck but the teacher kept giving us cookies) me and the girl waited out in the back of the school in the rain for my crush to get back my calculator. We waited for a while while my crush went to the opposite end of the school and back looking for me, but when she did show up, she kept thanking me and saying I saved her ass and stuff like that. (Warning: perv alert) Since it was raining out, she kept leaning over to blow off my calculator and wipe it dry, and she was wearing a rather loose shirt, so that was nice. (This perv alert has been completed.) she told me to have a good break and happy holidays and all that. \n\nAfter the two of them left, I went with a bunch of my friends to the McDonalds down the road from my school for lunch. There, we got exactly 200 chicken McNuggets in a biannual celebration that we call Nugmas. After we finished the meal, we sat there singing Nugmas carols around a pile of chicken nugget boxes we called the Nugmas tree and trying not to throw up. \n\nAfter Nugmas was done, I went home and played Brawl with my brother, and then went bowling with a bunch of friends I hadn't seen in a while. \n\n9/10 beginning of break, 10/10 with rice.

The baby slips out the wrap and falls in. She of course tries to catch it, but she throws her arms in trying to get it out. Obviously the baby died horribly and the mother lost both her arms. \n\nEdit: so chicharon is pork skin, I always used to think it was the stomach. Usually, if not always, it will have a layer of meat attached too. You can buy this stuff at any Latin ethnic store, like Northgate Gonzales supermarket, El Super, etc. If you go anywhere else they will probably be processed and packaged like chips, you won't get the good fresh kind.

I know that was supposed to be metaphoric, but the kids constantly talking about 'the match' and mom finally 'wearing the shirt' seemed vague and unrealistic.

If you aren't currently seeing a therapist, I highly recommend it once you're more financially stable--was a positive experience for me just to have a professional confirm that the way I was treated was no way to treat a child. She was actually the one who made me start to feel okay to stop trying for reconciliation.\n\nI hope you will accept assistance such as welfare. Social safety nets are there to help!\n\nWhile I won't say that I think I'll ever reach a day when I'll be able to look back at it all and laugh, I certainly do look back at the time I struck out on my own as a major turning point.
