I could feel some discomfort in my back, as my body told me \"That's enough! Your form on that last rep sucks!\" It's so hard to progress!\n\nI skipped deadlifts, due to my groin being cramped up. I did 1x3 at 60% of my normal work weight just to see how it felt, but I didn't feel like I could add weight to it or do further reps safely.\n\nI completed all my grip work just fine.

{"body": "What's offensive? Stating how the title is confusing, talking down to someone because they were confused, correcting someone, talking down to someone again or making a sarcasting comment.  \n\nAlso, I'd like to point out that a typographical error only covers missspelling words. So when you use the wrong word or words in the wrong order, it is not a typo.  \n\nSee, the goal of a language is to convey messages, and when you don't use language correctly, the message can be interpreted in the wrong way. Then you can consider 2 options, either you point out an error someone made, which could result in them not making that same error again. Or you could not point it out, which makes sure they don't get pissed off, but they might make the same mistake again.  \n\nThen you can consider the type of the error as well. A typo isn't really a problem, the message is still clear and most of the time the person actually knows how to type the word, they merely pressed the wrong button. But using the wrong words or not using a comma when necessary, can severely distort the message, and I think there are cases where it is important to point out.  \n\nNow that you've gotten this far in my comment, I thank you for you time and whish you a happy new year. I also suspect you of trolling, if that is the case: gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8 no h8. If it wasn't, then you might need to work on your hot-headed-ness OR on conveying the right message in written text.

It *annihilates* with anything it touches, pure energy release, total destruction.  If the containment (which is going to have to be magnetic) is breached, it's game over, and not an insignificant amount of 'over'.\n\nhttp://www.edwardmuller.com/right17.htm\n\nPlug in a lot of numbers, but let's go with 200 pounds of antimatter, to 'anti-gravity' a person of similar weight.\n\nYou let that 'go', and you've released 3904 Megatons of TNT.  78 Tsar Bombas, which is worth 50 Megatons each.  13 Hurricane Katrinas, 300 Megatons each.\n\nNobody would let you DO that if you wanted, because of the danger.\n\n---\n\nPast those, the idea of anti-gravity from antimatter is at best only a theory, so until and unless the gravitational attraction (or repulsion) is observed and measured, it's still just a theory.

Solid Defenders and They don't have high attacking workrates except Filipe Luis, which is great (I enjoy playing with a defense that doesn't push itself higher up field.).\n\n\nMidfield: 8/10. Schurrle is good, you can replace Walcott with Sanchez if needed, and Ozil can be replaced on preference. Ramires is a good CDM for BPL, although Yaya is obviously one of the best, if not best person for that position.\n\nForwards: 9/10. You have a clinical finisher (in my opinion) in Robin van Persie, and a good striker in Balotelli. Whenever I used Balotelli, his workrates felt better than low/low and was a great, agressive striker for me!\n\nOverall, the team in my opinion is a 9/10 (10/10 with rice).

{"body": "My girlfriend and I met during Freshman Orientation at our university (she was the freshman, I was a sophomore trying to be social with the possibility of hooking up with any of the newcomers. Yeah I was a toolbag...) and we met by playing a popular icebreaker game called Ninja. The object of the game is to hit your opponent's hands in order to knock them out of the game. Well, that's where we met. Afterwards, we ended up going to the same classes together since we were both involved in the same major (Computer Graphics). Then after a year of being good friends, I came to the realization that I may be only just her friend and nothing else. \nI ignored her super duper subtle advances towards me (random tickling, over excited greetings, etc.). I just thought she was a genuinely nice person with a wonderful personality. We would hang out in my room, in the computer labs, and anywhere else we could be seen in public. This girl was not ticklish by any means (except by her sister, her dad, and a few others could \"kinda\" tickle her). One night, I noticed I was able to tickle her, but only in a certain spot. I noticed that this was kind of weird. Is she only ticklish to those whom she becomes emotionally attached to? IDK, just go with it.\n\nWell, things got pretty intimate one night together. We did everything BUT kiss that night. I was too afraid to lose what relationship we already had together, so instead of making a move, I ASKED if I could kiss her. I still cringe at the thought of doing this. She turned me down because of the fact that she was being on/off with some other guy, and she didn't want to feel like a slut. That was understandable, I guess... until the next night.\n\nThe next night, after myself, her, and our mutual friends had finished playing card and board games all night, we all dispersed except for me and her. I asked her what she wanted to do now, and she suggested a movie at my place. Keep in mind I accepted my friendzone fate from the night before, so I thought nothing of it. We went in to my room, turned on The Incredibles (I had not seen it at the time), and then she does one of her tickle flirting advances again. I retort by tickling back, and that is when the leg gets hiked over my body. How would one react to that? Not the way I did. I sat there staring at her, with her staring at me, waiting for one of us to make the next move. This went on for at least 20 minutes until I verbally said \"Fuck it.\" And the magical first kiss began.\n\nWe are still happily together today, playing video games with each other, encouraging each other to perform better with our artwork, talking about big plans for the future, and we still recreate that first awkward kiss sometimes just for that awesome nostalgic feeling. \n\nNo ragrets! 8/10 would do it again, 9/10 with rice.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420662338", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "UPDATE 2 AND WILL CONTINUE IF ANYBODY CARES.\n\n**Sipping a beer at the counter while talking with my best friend.**\n\nMe:\"I am never visiting this town again, I swear. Scarred for life, bro, scarred for life.\"\n\nFriend: Why? What happened there?\n\nME: Well, this is the story...\n\nMorning. 2 P.M. I'm still lying in my bed, half asleep. As I turn around I get almost blind by the sunlight from the window. \"Fuck, why do I always forget to close my curtains.\" I realize it is already a time normal people are wide awake and have been working for hours now. Hey, don't blame me, I'm jobless, why should I care? Anyway, I'm rolling around like a half dead fish trying to get up but am too tired from all the sleeping. I barely open my eyes and look at my phone. Notification light is turned on. Huh, I guess somebody cares about me. I grab the phone and see 1 unseen e-mail. I open it. \"What is this?\" With still a blurry sight I read the header: \"Congratulations, you are a winner!\".\n\"Ah, fuck that, another shitty fake ad. Spam filter, you had one job! One job!\".\nI put the phone down and decide to rest from the unnecesary physical activity.\nAn hour later and I feel my stomach starts aching. Fuck, I haven't eaten anything. I finally get up and look at the watch. \"Holy shit, 3 P.M. really?!!\"\nI keep muttering how I've lost half a day that could be used doing unproductive shit.\nAfter I leave bathroom and head to the kitchen a phone rings. \"What?\"\nI raise my hand up and look at the caller id. Yes, it's basicly glued to my hand the whole day, I bring it anywhere, even in the shower. God bless people who invented water proof phones, they saved my life. Literally.\nAnyway, I don't recognize the caller but I answer anyway.\n\nMe: \"Hello?\"\n\nCaller: \"Herro, is this a mista Barr? \"\n\nMe: \"Who is this?\"\n\nCaller: \"This is mista Chan from Reddit headquaaatas.\"\n\nMe: \"...What do you need?\"\n\nCaller: \"Congratureizon mista ...\n\nMe: \"For what?\"\n\nCaller: \"You win da main prize! Three days in a city of Reddit!\"\n\nMe: \"What.\"\n\nCaller: \"Uhh maybe you do not remember good, but you entered the competition organized by Reddit inc. and your ticket was serected for a winning trip!\"\n\nMe: \"Huh, would you look at that... I don't remember jack shit but I guess I was a part of it, I often participate wherever I can get something... Free shit is a good shit, right?\"\n\nCaller: \"Right. Your boat will wait for you today at the closest dock at 5 o'clock.\"\n\nMe: \"Today?!!\"\n\nCaller: \"We are eagerry awaiting you mista Barr!\"\n\nCall ended.\n\nI just stay there without moving for a minute. Then I look at the time.\n\"3:56 holy fu*k. I NEED TO GET READY!\"\nAfter taking everything I'll need for the next three days and nearly killing myself during the process I manage to get to the boat in time. It was stationed practicly in the middle of nowhere and that is kind of weird, but whatever. THE TRIP IS FREE.\n\nAfter about an hour of sailing we get to the small island. It looks glorious. I get nearly blind again from the number or lights on the streets. That is how glorious it looks.\nI get out and in front of me there are the main giant doors of the city. Two fine gentlemen with fedoras, dressed full in black with katanas in their hands stand on the both sides of the gates.\nThey let me in. On the other side some shady guy stops me.\n\nGuy: Do you brought some memes with you bro?\n\nMe: \"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\n\nGuy: \"That is a bad start of your stay here.\"\n\nMan, I think I can already see this is going to be very interesting trip.\"\n\n\nI am soon greeted by a guy who represents himself as mr.Chan.\n\nMe: Oh, you must be mister Chan from the phone call, right?\n\nChan: Right mista. Come, ret me show you around.\n\nWe are walking trough the main street. Boy it's long and wide, almost like yo momma.\nAnyway, at the end of the street there is a large main square. They call it a \"Front square\". There are a lot of people here, everybody is laughing and dancing, there are news reporters everywhere, I can see crowd surrounding some guys... They must be some kind of stars here.\nWe jump into a cab and mr.Chan tells me he'll show me around the city museum but first he'll leave me at some restaurant to eat something. Dude I'm hungry as f.\nWe stop at the huuuge building. I read the sign: \"Food\". Well f me, I think it's a genius name. Straight to the point. Chan grabs my hand and pulls me with himself. I can already see my mouth watering. But, HEY! \n\nMe: \"Uh, mister, why did we turn around? The entrance is right HERE?!\"\n\nChan: \"I'm sorry mista, but our agency paid for your food elsewhere\".\n\nMe: \"Oh well... It's still free right? So, it's good with me haha!\"\n\nChan:\"Right.\"\n\nWe stop at the most shittiest little houss I've ever seen in my life. Man, this place is a wreck. And the smell... Oh Goood, oh GOD please tell me this is a joke!\n\nChan:\"don't worry mista, it is smelly jusr on the outside. Come!\"\n\nWe enter and I the waiter points to my seat. But...\n\nMe: \"Wha... who's that kid? Why is he sitting at my table?\"\n\nWaiter: \"We're sorry, all the other tables are full at the moment, be assured you will be just fine and that boy won't bother you.\n\nMe:\"...Fiiine...\"\n\nI sit and greet the kid.\n\nKid: \"Mister, can you help me decide what food should I buy for my tomorrows birthday party for myself?\"\n\nMe:\"Uh... What?\" That was random. \"Uh, I guess an old shoe with a mayo would be a nice meal for you heh.\"\n\nI try not to chuckle.\n\nKid:\"Thank you for your suggestion.\"\n\nMy meal is coming, I can smell it.\nThe waiter opens the pot.\n\nMe:\"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? I AIN'T GONNA EAT THAT!\"\n\nWaiter: \"Oh, but this is \"Shittyfoodporn's\"\nfinest meal!\n\nThis is a fucking chicken soup with gummy bears inside. I am in pure shock.\n\nWaiter: \"We even put a special ingridienf - Mt. Dew!\".\n\nWord cannot find their way out from my mouths.\nAnother waiter comes.\n\nKid: \"Oooh this must be for me!\"\n\nHe opens the cover and is greeted with blue scrambled eggs and something ghat looked like microwaved bull's dick.\n\nMe(with disgusted look on my face):\"... You... you ain't gonna eat that... Right?... Right?\"\n\nKid: \"Why not? And I'll get a shitton of gold for it!\"\n\nMe:\"What? Gold?\"\n\nKid:\"And look! To be honest, I would say it tastes for 2/10, BUT! I get some rice in my pocket! Nowww watch... Uh huuuh... I put the rice ALL over it and now... Let's see... Munch munch munch... \nIt's 6/10 with rice!\"\n\nI am trying not to puke.\n\nI run outside of the shitstaurant and search for a cab. Mr. Chan is already waiting for me. \n\nChan: \"How was your runch, sir?\"\n\nMe: \"Go fuck yourself\":\n\nChan: \"Very well then.\"\n\nOk, this is the part which I would rather never ever mention again.\nWe arrive at the Reddit's museum of Great Users.\nThere is all kinds of shit inside, and I see some statues of \"Users with the most karma's\", whatever that means.\nMr.Chan escorts me to some hotel and I get a decent room this time. Nothing much happens anymore that day.\n\n\nDay 2:\n\n\nI wake up and decide to go by myself and search for some interesting places around the city. In front of the hotel there is a large park. I can see a lot of people with their pets there. I look at the street's name on the wall. \n\"Aww\"... I don't even bother anymore. I move across the street and head to some bench to rest a little and enjoy the view. \n\n\"Dude, those guys were completely nuts! They all danced together, laughed, smoked some joint and petted their pets. You could hear awwwing from everywhere. I found it creepy as fck and walked away.\"\n\nAnyway, I continue walking. I see some building on my left called \"Getmotivated\". I enter to see what's going on. It turns out there are just some lame teenagers sitting in circles and passing some potraits and landscapes between themselves, with quotes slapped on them and all that shit.\n\nMe: \"Hey guys, this is all BULLSHIT. Do you hear me? Stop wasting your time and go do something PRODUCTIVE\" Lol I know, I am the last one who should be saying something like that but whatever.\n\nSome girl turns her head and looks at me, gets up and yells.\n\nGirl: \"I AM 14 AND THIS IS DEEP, OK?!!\".\n\nFine with me, why do I even care!\n\nAfter quite some walking and finding nothing particularly interesting I call a cab and tell the driver to drive me around and show me some interesting places. We are driving for some time and I notice huge fun park through the window and tell him to stop there.\nI get out and head to the park. It's called \"Funny\". Well let me tell you something. This place was the most unfunniest place I have ever been to. I rage quited the fun ride and walked away.\nI am just walking, minding my own business when some fat kid jump rights in front of me and whispers to me.\n\nFat kid: \"Mister, can you please tell me I'm fat? And please tell it loud so everybody can hear it.\"\n\nMe: \"Seriously, what's wrong with you kids... Ok. GET OFF MY WAY YOU FATTY FATTY BOY!\"\n\nFat kid: \"THAT IS NOT WHAT YOUR MOTHER SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT!\"\n\nHe proceeds to make some lame street sign with his short fat fingers and runs away, followed by some skinny kid with a camera, yelling at him \"That was SO thug bro! We will get tons of karma!\"\n\nSeriously, what the fuck is up with that \"karma\" here, huh?\n\n\n------------\nStill just a beggining, hell I might post it later as a whole story for some critical feedback.\nUpdates coming soon.\n\n-------------------\nThis is just starting, but I'll post it now because I won't be able to continue writing. I hope somebody will read it and like it.\n\nEDIT HOLY SHIT 3 UPVOTES. Ok I'll finish the story when I get home.

{"body": "It was my 4th visit. My friend Dan had been living here for over a year now and kept bragging how mankind had finally created a true democratic society. He wanted me to move in but I remained skeptical. These new Web-Towns we’re emerging all over the world but I still had a bitter taste in my mouth from that three months experience in Los Google.  Having to share all my private life with city officials every time I needed to take a piss wasn’t my definition of ‘’enhanced services’’.\n\n‘’Stop looking so grim, New Reddit is nothing like that shit hole you tried last year.’’ Dan said as we reached our destination.\n\nI looked at the large marble arch in front of us, r/AskReddit was carved in it.\n\n‘’What’s so special about this place?’’ I replied.\n\n‘’I’m telling you man, this neighborhood will blow your mind. Anything you could possibly wonder, someone here will be able to answer it.’’ He said with such enthusiasm that I finally smiled.\n\nWe started walking around but I felt like such a tourist. The place looked like a giant fair. Everywhere we went, someone was standing on a little stage with a sign in his hands. What movie has the worst ending? What is career suicide in your industry? What sentence do you know that can start an internet war?\n\nI couldn’t understand why these questions mattered to anyone but the crowd seemed to love it. Hundreds of them gathered around each stage, shouting their answers.\n\n‘’Chewing gum!’’\n\n‘’Oranges!’’\n\n‘’Pancakes!’’\n\nI must have been pretty hungry. Out of everything being yelled around us, food caught my attention. This Asian kid was sitting at a table, in the center of a stage. To his left, the biggest pot of rice I’d seen in my life. To his right, a bunch of random food people gave him.\n\nWas this some sort of social experiment? This kid was asking his fellow citizen for disgusting food ideas to eat over rice and rating it on a scale of 1 to 10. It was so silly but oddly entertaining. I found myself watching him for over thirty minutes while he tested Nutella, Jelly beans and Spaghetti on top of rice.\n\n‘’C’mon buddy, there’s plenty more stuff I want to show you today’’ Dan said while dragging me away from this hypnotizing spectacle. \n\nWe resumed our walk, while he continued to sing the praise of New Reddit. It was just a few blocks later that we both stopped again but… not because of a stage act this time. \n\nA gorgeous blond girl in high heels, wearing the shortest of skirts and a slim white shirt was coming our way. ‘I love New Reddit’ the shirt said. How clever.\n\n‘’Damn man look at her, she’s a 9!’’ he said in awe.\n\nI couldn't help it.\n\n‘’10/10 with rice’’\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420742411", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

The onions were kinda meh, some really tough pieces from the outer part of the onion were used that I had to pull off.  \nPickles, ketchup, and mayo, were all in the direct center of the burger so the edges weren't covered but that is typical of all fast food so whatever.  \nThe patty was very good, not too greasy but also not dry and tough. Good flavor but I still prefer the flavor of BK's beef.  \nThe bacon was exceptional. Not as much bacon as I would hope but the bacon's taste was far better than most fast food bacon.  \nThe bread was also very high quality. Nicely toasted on the insides and not covered in grease like a Wendy's burger.  \nThe fries were a let down. Kinda dry but not crispy either. Fries usually aren't my thing though so it isn't that big of a deal for me.  \n\nOverall I'd give it a 7/10 fast food quality. \n(8/10 with rice Thank you for the suggestion)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421174557", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "check your facts.\n\nIOS scans are indeed better than taking impressions, which incidentally two points are at play: impressions often times have voids and bubbles and lead to unsealed margins or poor fits. in-office milling units often are limited to 3-axis movement which all by itself constricts and constrains the dentist prep. patterson outright LIES to the dentist about the cost of manufacturing but i won't go into that here. when dentists don't want to be told how to prep they find out that these in-office units just can't make their crowns fit and often break down. milled units such as zirconia and emax (if you want milled emax) are often best left to the far FAR more expensive and capable lab milling units. these often can perform full 5 axis motion and resolve into single micron accuracy (compared to in office units nearing 100um accuracy), which directly translates to more precise and better overall fits. 10/10 from lab, 11/10 with rice.\n\nnow, triple trays leave the bite open. every. time. every. single. time. patients who are numb VERY often cannot get into CO, and think they are fully closed when in fact they are so droopy from numbing agent they are several mm open on one side. funny thing that nerve business. the whole muscle memory thing doesnt exist for the jaw. too bad.  triple trays are the bane of every lab; when you have a free end bridge, you take one (you arent supposed to) and leave 0 ability to find a bite with adjacent 2 teeth. they were designed to be used when you don't want to spend 30$ on an impression. not for making c+b.\n\nanyone who uses triple trays should be shot.\n\noffices that use algenate often let \"subordinates\" take impressions, meaning there is 0 ability to quality control. any lab that pours algenates should be a lab in a basement that caters only to the upstairs doc. if the trays go out accross town they will warp en route. will, not may. will. this is the sign of a bad practice.\n\nimpressions taken with algenate are suitable for two things; making custom trays and spreading bloody hazards. every denture when it is made by amateurs begins with an algenate and custom tray. those with experience and who know what they are doing don't send this to a lab to be done, but do it themselves. theres a name given to these people, theyre called Denturists, they kinda work everywhere instead of a primary lab, and only call upon labs when they need custom titanium frames. but i'm going on a tangent.\n\ni may be pessimistic, you may be correct, but labs do care about quality; because the more work goes out the door *and doesnt come back for remake because of any of the reasons above* the better. slow payer or not, the lowest remake factor wins.\n\nbtw, IOS should be baseline used for diagnostic impressions, because the more comfortable the patient is while you are diagnosing, the easier it is to say you need to cause discomfort.\n\nnow, as far as milled restorations go emax is not its best when milled. it is 10% better flexuarally, and much easier to shade when its pressed. also the cost is far lower to produce by press.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421292040", "subreddit": "Dentistry", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

And Bill was a big fan of Olives, he liked to put them on almost everything he ate, except rice - he rated it a 3/10 with rice but that's beside the point. So Bill starts hearing more about this Olive guy and he's ~~sexually~~ interested. So he joins CivCraft to try and see him, because I mean he loves Olives in real life he probably will move them in a video game too. So when he gets to Tel Aviv he hears the guy talking in chat.\n\nAt this point Bill is fucking sweating madly, because he's about to actually meet this Olive guy that's been filling his dreams recently. So he asks the guy where he's at and Olive responds that he's over by a chicken piano. While Bill briefly questions the legality of such a thing, he pushes the thought out because if the Olive guy thinks its good, then it has to be.\n\nWhen Bill finally gets to the place he was talking about, he's in fucking abject horror. This Olive guy, the man he'd been dreaming and fantasizing about for a solid week now.\n\n**HE WASN'T A FUCKING OLIVE.  \nHE WAS A JEW.**\n\nSo Bill is obviously very distraught, he briefly questions suicide - but no! Bill knows exactly what he's going to do.\n\n*He's going to wreck this fuckers elegos.*\n\nThat's right, but he couldn't let the imposter know it was him. So Bill goes around the land trying to find the nearest soul other than that filthy imposter. Eventually he finds himself in a place called New Leningrad, and some guy named blowtheball or something like that was in the city. So Bill tells blowtheball that this place called Tel Aviv,\n \nIT HATES HIM.\n\nAND HIS CITY.\n\nAfter saying this, Bill is pretty sure that this blowtheball guy is about to call up his mates and kick the olive imposter's elegos TO. THE. FUCKING. GROUND.\n\nContent with himself, Bill walks back somewhere near Tel Aviv, to a place he's pretty sure won't be reached by the sea of lava that will soon coat the entire area, and logs off.\n\nI'm pretty sure that's more or less how the situation went.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421465547", "subreddit": "Civcraft", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Also if you wanted a 24 hour free trial style server that could go down great since for an example,  \n  \nLirik (Just going by memory not who i watch) could do a live stream event with his veiwers and give away a 24 hour access code to a private server allowing anyone that dose not own the game a chance to play it with his favorite streamer boosting the chance of actually buying in to EA.  \n  \nSorry for the bad spelling and grammar i'm very ill and tired.  \n  \nLove the game and so far i rate it 10/10 with rice  \n  \nEDIT: If this is a legit idea try not to leave out the smaller guys on twitch maybe have a requirement of say 500 viewers average to gain access to these free trial servers.

Per farti un esempio, i commenti in /r/AskReddit sono una cosa illeggibile: ci sono storie che sono così finte che fanno male agli occhi, ma che sono confezionate in maniera tale da riscuotere un successo enorme (es. tutti gli uomini col pugno di ferro e la morale incorruttibile che non perdonano mai chi tradisce la loro fiducia... oppure tutti i classici circlejerk tipo Comcast etc).

It was pretty fantastic, and I would still be there were it not for some shady circumstances surrounding my \"verbal\" lease agreement and 90+ year old land lady who moved back in to the building, brought bed bugs and nearly burned the building down a few times...\n\n\nAnyway, the good: la vita mia pizza and new good one Chinese on 24th obviate the need for seamless if you want pizza or Chinese. Both places are top notch. Same goes for Othello's deli, which is a great 24 hour drunk food option. The Astoria Park Liquor store is family owned and fantastic as well. Even though I'm a mile away and have 20 other liquor stores closer, those guys still get my business. The \"real\" beer garden is so close it's dangerous, Astoria park is only 3/10ths of a mile away, and you are in that sweet spot from the subway where you can't really hear it but are only a 5 minute walk to either Ditmars or Astoria blvd (protip if you have a long commute, go to Ditmars for a guaranteed seat, even during rush hour). 28th was one of a few blocks in the area that didn't lose power for more than a couple hours after hurricane Sandy. I have no idea why but I sure wasn't complaining! Finally, 23rd ave over there is phenomenal, from the new, like the Bonnie and the nyc bagel coffee house to the old(er), like zorbas, tellys and the coffee pot.\n\nThe bad: on street parking is better than most of Astoria, but it still sucks if you're trying to find alternate side after 5pm on Sunday or Monday nights. There is (or was) a very sketchy, very douchy house about 5 buildings north of 24th, that kept parking their suv on the sidewalk, and once tried to start a fight with me for literally no reason other than I walked past one of them. My apartment was attempted to be broken into 3 years ago, and my neighbor got his apartment ransacked in the same event, but the 114th did their jobs (they seem to get a bad rap, but I've only had one bad experience with them) and caught the guy.\n\nOverall, I give the area a 10/10. 11/10 with rice.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422248106", "subreddit": "astoria", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Abuse - noun - Ah-boose:** \nEssentially abuse is what happens when someone is a relationship mistreats someone else (friendship, coworker, subordinate, partner). You can't abuse someone over the internet, in my mind. That's what harassment is.\n\n**Harassment - noun - Her-Azz-mint:**\nWhen someone gives someone repeated contact against the contactee's will. It is primarily exists in a negative context. Spam also counts.\n\nExample of polite discourse: Anita, I can't help but discount your findings as pseudo-scientific. Your characterization of men is hate-mongering.\n\nExample of Harassment: Anita, you fucking kike Pig-sow. You feminazi bitch. Go strangle yourself with your plaid.\n\n\n**SJW (Social Justice Warrior) - Noun - Es-Jayh-UU:**\nI find the term a bit polarizing. But I find it synonymous with liberal authoritarianism. These are people that want change, and are willing to hate mob, shame, and bully people into, with a lack of healthy discourse. I apply this term conservatively.\n\n**MRA (Men's Rights Activist) - Noun - Ehm-ARRR!-Aye:** \nThese are men and women that work toward alleviating over-conviction of males, men's custody rights, raising male sexual assault awareness, etc. These aren't anti-feminists, or red-pillers, or channers. \n\n**Misogyny - Overused Noun - Muh-Soggy-Knees:**\nAn attempt to victimize a woman because she's a woman. This isn't criticism, this isn't even reactionary vitriol to someone you disagree with. It has to be gender based victimization.\n\nExample of Vitriol: You're a fucking idiot, your ideas lack any semblance of realistic thought.\n\nExample of Misogyny: Women do not deserve X because of their gender.\n\n\n**Seal-Lioning - Verb - Arf-Arf:**\nI had to look this term up. Its when people are trying to get someone to back up their claims. I don't think someone should be expected to defend their opinions constantly, but that if they are willing to state something without backing it up, they either need to endeavor to elaborate. If they are not willing, people shouldn't spam them with \"invitations for pleasant discourse,\" just mark them down as an ideologue that spews unsubstantiated claims.\n\n**Rape/Death Threat - Noun - Gr8 B8 M8, I r8 8/8:**\nA fucking threat on someone's life or a threat to force them into some kind of sexual intercourse. Here's the difference between an actionable threat and an empty one.\n\nEmpty: \"I'll fucking kill you fag, why don't you go off and die.\" \n\nCredible/Actionable: \"I know you live at 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I am coming, I will gut you like a fish Mr. Sherman.\"\n\nThe difference between the latter and the former is that the former is just noise and hate that can be easily avoided and ignored. All manor of internet-goers realize this pretty early. I have been on the receiving on the internet death threats dozens of times. But it's ridiculous to call them anything other than negative noise.\n\n**Hate Group - Noun - Nothing clever this time:**\nPeople that rally around the idea that some group needs to be defeated or are lesser. They are extremists that hate people for bigoted reasons. (Black, White, Yellow, Brown, Women, Jew, Muslim, etc). Misogynists are part of a hate group. Misandrists are a hate group. Hating people is pretty base emotion, and hating them for such bigoted reasons is what makes a hate group.\n\nI think I've not colored either group unfairly.

After we were sufficiently drunk of our asses, we went to my room and the clothes came off which is where she stopped me and said \"wait let's do something fun\"\n\nSo i went, naked, into the kitchen and grabbed my roommates bottle of Hershey's chocolate syrup. I threw her on the bed and proceeded to coat her in it. Not in sexy amounts, but in amounts that pretty much emptied the almost new bottle. Then I proceeded to eat it off of her almost entirely. We then proceeded to have the most sticky sex of my life.\n\nA little later we were in doggy style on the edge of my bed and she said \"harder\", so I thrusted really hard and she ended up flying face first off the bed and into my desk. \n\nChocolate syrup 5/10 probably would do again if asked.\n\nAccidentally shoving her into the desk and laughing  9/10 would do again.\n\nWhole thing, 7/10. 9/10 with rice.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422383401", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said.

You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at that; seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro.\n\nWait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This banana for scale gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download an ayy lmao. woosh.\n\nSince rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle.

{"body": "&gt;Use full powerscaling for him\n\nWhich is completely reasonable in DBZ. In a Superman vs Thor, we can take in account of Thor's magic for the fight. In Goku vs Cell, what do these guys use? Ki. And that's it. One feat of using ki can be replicated for another character with more ki.\n\n&gt;Restrict Superman to objective feats\n\nBecause \"lifting infinity\" is hella vague and not even possible/quantifiable.\n\n&gt;Disregard Superman's \"outliers\" (which is increasingly becoming interchangeable with \" I don't like that feat\") and I'm not talking about lifting infinity\n\nLike? Oh wait, just more bitching.\n\n&gt;Separate Superman's speed into \"travel\" and \"combat\", as if he's blindly plowing through every celestial object in his path when he's zooming through space at massively faster than light speeds. Seriously, wtf\n\nDo you even know what acceleration is?\n\n&gt;Justify Goku's phyiscal strength through nebulous arguments such as \" he made Frieza bleed and Frieza survived an exploding planet so he has planet busting punches\". All my wut. This leads to:\n\nActually no, the argument is that Frieza has planetary level durability, due to his survival of a planetary+ level explosion. Is this really that hard for you people to understand?\n\n&gt;Treating durability with respect to energy and physical force as the same thing. I've yet to see any proof that energy translates exactly to physical force. Using this logic Thor has universe busting physical strength because he cracked Galactus' armor, and Superman has solar system busting punches because he made Wonder Woman bleed. Obviously this is bullshit, so why is it tolerated when this argument is made for Goku?\n\nExcept Frieza's physical durability is explicitly shown by an objective feat. Something this guy has been bitching DBZ fans don't use (while conveniently ignoring the evidence). It is then shown *that a completely physical attack* one-shotted him. How is this nebulous?\n\n&gt;This is obviously BS, even though some stuff I said is true. I conveniently left out that Starfire's regular blasts aren't planet busting, used the \"hurts a character who tanked an X blast\" argument for her physical strength, used an energy durability feat and twisted it into physical durability, and handwaved away Thor's gigantic strength and durability advantage. Starfire is a bit faster than Thor, but that won't mean shit because Thor completely outclasses her physically.\n\nAnd his whole argument is complete shit. See, in comics and other mediums, there is generally other factors at play. Look at Majin Buu. Why was he so dangerous? Vegeta was kicking his ass six ways to Sunday. He even blasted holes through him. His *special ability* made him a complete bitch to put down. There were other factors at play.\n\n**However** 99% of the time in DBZ there is ki. There is no hard counter to ability. It's literally A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D&gt;E. Unless you think that Saiyan Saga piccolo &gt; SSJ God Goku since Piccolo has better feats. It's completely asinine that DC fans don't take in the medium of writing when making their arguments. It'd save me so many headaches. \n\nAlso, a mother fucking planet exploding is physical. Do people not understand what an explosion is? Holy shit. He destabilized the freaking core and forced it to explode. It wasn't a ki attack that he tanked.\n\nSo not only does his argument not take in account of how DBZ actually works, it's like he didn't even read the scans and then tried arguing against them.\n\n&gt;If I seriously tried to make that argument, I'd get laughed out of the thread (and rightfully so), but replace \"Starfire' with \"Vegeta\" and people will take me seriously. Search Vegeta vs Thor, we've all seen it.\n\nYes, for reasons stated above. Just because you don't put the five minutes of reading readily available scans/argumentation for them, doesn't mean that's our problem. There are completely **physical** feats that DBZ characters have.\n\n&gt;There's like this magic thing that happens during DBZ vs Comics debates, where the absolutely obscene strength advantages of S-tiers either become mere afterthoughts or are thrown out the window entirely, when in other threads strength is given the consideration it deserves.\n\nExcept even piccolo has better destruction feats than anything Superman has ever shown. Please show me some scans of superman actually punching a planet apart, or even a moon, without moving at MFTL travel speeds that take him time to get up to that point. Exactly. Don't give me that bullshit.\n\n&gt; If I made Spider-Man vs Aquaman thread, the top response will be \"Aquaman is way stronger, he wins\". You won't see people pontificating about how Spider-Man has better reflexes and he punched Hulk who took Silver Surfers' blast which was planet-busting that one time so he obviously can take Aquaman.\n\nAgain, does this guy even know what he's talking about?\n\n1) Aquaman is way stronger, he wins\n\nYes, by feats. But let's look at One Punch Man. As far as I know he hasn't actually bench pressed anything, but we use the *durability feats* of his enemies in order to estimate his damage output. Sound familiar? Oh shit, that's exactly what we do for DBZ. Fucking crazy, huh?\n\n2) You won't see people pontificating about how Spider-Man has better reflexes and he punched Hulk who took Silver Surfers' blast which was planet-busting that one time so he obviously can take Aquaman.\n\nOh my, it's almost like Hulk has an ability where he grows stronger as time progresses. Maybe by putting in context to his actual position would be better. If Spider-Man was punching WWH, and other characters that tier, on a regular basis, you can bet your sweet ass that Spider-Man &gt; Aquaman.\n\n&gt;Even if we go insane with the fan calcs and power levels (which are crap according to Toriyama himself), no one in DBZ has anywhere the physical strength and durability of \"weaker\" S-tiers like Etrigan and Lobo (who can casually juggle trillions of tons), let alone Superman, Thor, Wonder Woman, Hyperion, etc.\n\nHmm, well how about you show me some of their damage output? Pure destructive/defensive capabilities? Or are we just taking [claims](http://i.imgur.com/Z5ifmLp.jpg) [seriously](http://i.imgur.com/2foL7HN.jpg) now? Because we still don't have any feats of superman just casually blowing up moons or tanking that amount of damage in return. Yet even Raditz can tank moon+ blasts like there is no tomorrow.\n\n&gt;Let's put it this way: if Goku punched Superman with all his strength, he would make Superman bleed and knock him into orbit at best. If Superman did the same, Goku and spacetime itself would explode.\n\nHaha fanwank much?\n\n&gt;To be clear, I'm not against powerscaling during these debates. What I am against is treating DBZ like a special snowflake work of fiction that deserves to operate with different rules, \n\nHe does know that Anime =/= Comics? These are completely different mediums. Toriyama isn't going to insert a block of text saying \"And it is stated that Vegeta's ki blast has a bajillion gigajoules of force.\" Not that it matters, considering we have objective feats to fall back on. \n\n&gt;where powerscaling\n\ncompletely valid, unless you literally have 0 idea of how Ki works.\n\n&gt;character statements\n\nHave I used a character claim this entire time? Nope. Don't even need to. But let's touch on this. Cell's \"Solar Busting Claim\" has been confirmed via Word of God in the *Daizenshuu*. Many of the \"feats\" that Comic fans use come from the Narrative Text Box, so why isn't Cell's valid? Oh yeah, because they don't like it.\n\n&gt;and ABC logic are used with reckless abandon\n\nAgain, completely valid in DBZ because of how Ki works. Unless again Saiyan Saga Piccolo &gt; SSJ God Goku, which if you claim you might be retarded.\n\n&gt;If we're using feats, Superman stomps\n\nActually Piccolo does, he shits all over Superman with a single Ki blast.\n\n&gt;If we're using feats and powerscaling, Superman stomps.\n\nStill Piccolo.\n\n&gt;If we use the /r/whowouldwin[1] special method of coddling DBZ, where we limit Superman to objective feats, tiptoe around Superman's ridiculous strength advantage and pretend it doesn't exist, liberally use the terms \"PIS\" and \"outlier\" wrt Superman, use powerscaling for Goku, separate travel speed and reaction speed, and generously assume Goku is marginally faster than Superman, Goku has a decent chance.\n\nAnd once more, Piccolo.\n\nSee, easy \n\n***\n\nSeriously, this guy sounds like he's never read DBZ in his life. He's pretty much the emulation of the DBZ anti-circle jerk. He sounds like he never actually took the time to read arguments against his position, he provides no actual evidence to support his position, he straw mans that shit out of the other side, a completely disingenuous argument.\n\n0/10\n\n4/10 with rice.\n\nThanks for the suggestion.

Stack evasion, and it'll be hard for spellcasters to hit you.\n\nPhase Acro would give 30% Spell Dodge, along with whatever evade chance you have. For the sake of calculation, we'll assume you have a 50% evade chance for non-projectile attacks.\n\nWhen dodge is applied, you have a (1 - .3) * 100% = 70% chance to be hit with spells. Since Evasion (in this case, at least) and Dodge are effectively \"less chance to hit\" multipliers as far as spells are concerned, after evasion is applied, you'll have a (.7 * .5) * 100% = 35% chance to be hit by spells.\n\nAdditionally, if it were used with Vaal Grace (assuming lv20) and Phase Acro, you'd have 64% chance to dodge, along with whatever evade chance you have. When all this is applied, you'd have a ((1 - .64) * .5)* 100% = 18% chance to be hit. A 16% Spell Dodge Atziri's Step lowers the chance further to 10%. Vaal Grace can last for 15.90s with both Increased Duration clusters and either a 21/20 or 20/23 Inc. Duration gem. \n\nIt's an interesting idea, but I think this skill would actually be severly overpowered as-is. I don't really think there's any way to balance this so that it's still useful without being blatantly and outright overpowered.\n\nI *think* i did my math right...\n\nTL;DR 10% chance to be hit by spells with 50% evade chance using this, Phase Acro, Vaal Grace, and Atziri boots for potentially 16 secs.\n\nPS: Ondar's Phase abbreviates to OP. gr8 name m8, i r8 8/8", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422524547", "subreddit": "pathofexile", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
