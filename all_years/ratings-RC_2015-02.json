He also tipped the bouncer 20 to hold yet another 100 for the taxi guy to bring me back.\n\nI blacked in-and-out through the whole experience but I would give it a 2/10. 4/10 with rice.\n\nFor clarification, the net finances were:\nme: -220 (my money, spent by roomie on my behalf)\nlady of the night: +60\nbouncer: +20\ntaxi guy: +140\nRoomie: whatever drinks he charged on my card while I was occupied.\n\nLesson: If you're going to pay for it, be sober.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422930700", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Supports 44.1/48/96 kHz sample rates (96 is only available in stereo -- you need to drop to 44.1 or 48 for 4-channel) and 16- or 24-bit sample size.  It can also be used as a limited-capability sound card.

The bakery up the hill from my apartment is hiring, so I'm taking the food handler's course so I can get my license and hopefully work there soon. That's really about it...I reckon y'all can ask me anything else you'd like to know!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423105174", "subreddit": "millionairemakers", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; While I agree that disclosure is good, the only reason you ever minded that was that there were women involved. Anyway, disclosure is pretty much the point where I agree.\n\nThis is a good reason why you should educate yourself before you pick a side. There were many rumblings of corruption in gaming journalism prior to Ms. Quinn's situation. Honestly, I don't think it matters the gender or race of the tipping point; corruption is corruption. The gaming journalists made it a gender thing... A curious position considering they just got called out. Also interesting, why has Mr. Gjoni been gagged and Ms. Quinn isn't pressing charges for slander/libel. There must be some truth there.\n\n&gt; And yet that's how journalism tends to work. When there's a story, outlets all pile on to it.\n\nNo, this is not how journalism works at all. Journalists should never be close with those who they report on. Ask any respectable journalist and they will say it's a big no-no. If you actually think these relationships are okay, then you've answered my initial question.\n\n&gt; Now that makes absolutely zero sense. If devs were concerned about being manipulated through metacritic, they'd just stop using metacritic to determine payment. AAA devs have journalists in their pockets, as many journalists have tried to tell you already. You have it completely the other way around.\n\nWhat are you talking about? Their entire career relies souly on how it is received. It can be the greatest game ever played, but if it was systematically given poor reviews by multiple gaming journalists, then it's toast. You can't be serious in not understanding this dynamic.\n\n&gt; Strangely you guys don't seem to mind calling McIntosh \"cuck\", calling Brianna \"he\" or \"flynt\" with zero proof of anything, calling srhbutts a \"dogfucker\" with zero proof as well, supporting a stalker like Fart, a harasser like Rogue, or a bully like Cernovich.\n\nNot everyone. I've even seen 8chan Gamergate supporters get on others for doing this. Even the stream of Rev60 yesterday did not call out Mrs. Wu I'm that fashion. It seems you have a preconception of what you think is going on without acknowledging the many instances where it's the contrary.\n\n&gt; Are they really? Or are they putting on an act because they know how the world sees them? It seems that as soon as they switch board, they also switch attitude. Or don't all the people in /baphomet/ talking about how GG are poor poor babies who don't deserve to be harassed strike you as odd regarding the general attitude of that sub?\n\nAnd aGG call us foil hats? This is hilarious. While Gamergate supporters have provided substantial evidence for corruption, this unicorn thread/convo of hidden scheming against women should be concerning, not accepted. Every thread started on targeting an individual is met with \"gr8 b8 m8, I r8 8/8.\"\n\nAs for baph, they have called us out a number of times for trying to stand firm and not play into the label that gaming journalists have put on us. Gamergate does nothing with baph because they are a loose cannon.\n\n&gt; My position is based on your proof being insubstantial and motivated by personal vendettas against the opinions of certain journalists who are the only ones whose \"ethics\" get checked, and by the attitudes I've seen you guys espouse.\n\nWe hold every gaming publication accountable, and even ourselves. You talk as if you haven't even read what KiA and /gamergate/ has said, just followed what others have said.

So she may have continuous wide AOE fire attacks at her disposal that would prevent Elsa's minions from getting into range to fire iron.

{"body": "So basically at the rip young age of a 7th grader I was at home on a unnaturally beautiful sunday, the temperature was perfect, I had a decent day and was overall really exited for the steak we were marinating. ( i never got to eat it :(  )\n\nI was taking out the trash when the sirens came on, luckily there was a siren extremely close to where i lived. If you googled st. pauls church I was within that surrounding couple of miles. \n\nour family has had and still has a great plan when the sirens go off. Grab all living things and pile in the basement, and if given the opportunity and time grab things like cell phones, wallets, car keys, (not that keys were useful ) and keep those in the basement as well. Then wait as a loud and obnoxious thunderstorm rolled through, but that night was different to say the least. \n\nBefore we knew the severity of the storm my father and I heard a loud pop from the main floor and he went up to check on it. Turns out the Tv in our living rooms capacitors popped from overvoltage or something along those lines, (i wasnt extremely concerned about it at the time, you know, more important matters) He has told me that after he checked the tv he almost went to check something in the kitchen but decided to come back downstairs instead, and I am very glad he did because he could have gotten really hurt.\n\nHe came back downstairs and I mentioned that I was hearing quiet the rumbling off in the distance, I had noticed it for a minute or two But it was so quiet i thought I may be hearing things. Boy was I wrong. \n\nEventually we figured out that the 747 trying to land on our house was in fact an EF5 tornado and hopped in the bathroom down there. Rode out the storm with my parents, my dog, and my frog. \n\nThe exceptionally weird thing about the whole experience down there was how my senses kicked into overdrive. The actual tornado was probably over our house for about 30-40 seconds in total. But it felt closer to 5 minutes. \n\nIt is surreal to be able to recognize the sound of the house you have built your life in for the past 7 years ripping apart by a natural force. It is insane because in my mind I could very clearly make out the large crash of our vehicle (although i didnt know it was a vehicle, just something big) crashing through the wall into my room, I could hear electronics popping and transformers blowing, I could hear the roof peeling away from our house. the thing that amazed me is that I could hear all of this as clear as day while the tornado blew over. Hearing everything separate, but also together. \n\nAfter the storm was over we came out to assess the damage and saw that it was just as the pictures show. FUBAR. It is very hard on a person to experience something like watching and listening your own home be ripped to shreds while you are inside of it. But it is harder to see once the adrenaline stops. There was mass destruction everywhere. Luckily no gas leaks within my area. \n\nMy family went into damage control mode. We gathered all of our clothes and everything that was of sentimental value and started to pile it up in our basement so that they wouldnt get too wet. It rained for quiet a while after the tornado.\n\nThat night my uncle came and picked us up and we had to walk about two miles to get to his car from where he was forced to park. We lived with him for six weeks out in mount vernon until we found a home also in joplin and moved back. (also with a basement, of course) \n\nThe entire experience gave me a few new feelings.\n\n1. the feeling of community about the town was insane. for a short while, everyone was family. You saw someone and you offered everything you had to help. My father went out to my neighbors house and helped them out of their basement because there house was flattened where as ours still had quiet a few walls. He literally gave that man the shirt he was wearing because the our neighbor wasnt wearing one and his blew away. My father has always been one of my heros but he definitely made me a happy boy then. They dont say joplin strong for nothing anymore.\n\n2. The feeling of how frail we are as humans. That life is fragile and can be stripped from us without warning in an instant. It has really made me value what I have more as a person. \n\n3. The feeling of strength, to oppose the above feeling, I feel like now that I have survived this traumatic event, I am a much stronger person.\n\nIt has been a few years now, Im sixteen and a junior in highschool. I have maintained a 3.92 GPA and am in the top 7% of my class. I think the entire experience really shaped who I am today. probably for the better. \n\nBut not a day goes by when I dont think about how lucky I am that my entire family was ok.\nThat is why I never cried, I never shed a tear, I never really showed much emotion at all. But on the inside I was beyond happy that I was ok, and my family was ok.\n\n\nFunny thing is, and you probably wont believe it, but the hardest part about the entire thing was that my grandparents house burnt down the next day. That was the hardest thing about it all, because They had nowhere to go, but they are old. They have nothing of what they used to. And that was the first time I saw my father cry. \n\nLife can really deal you a shit deck of cards sometimes, but just remember it all gets better eventually.\n\n\nTL;DR Tornado was not fun, 1/10, 2/10 with rice, keep your family close, enjoy life, always have a plan. and Read the damn post\n\n\nheres a link to that essay with a few different details and hopefully better grammar. ( maybe, my writing skills are pretty terrible)\n\nedit : I forgot to edit out credentials on the picture, BRB\n\nedit 2 http://imgur.com/safx7bk\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423793016", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was a slow weekend for gaming, but I do believe I've converted 2 more to our flock.\n\n**Keyflower**We went over to our son's babysitter's house to play, and they had invited over another couple (also parents) for games. We had converted our babysitter and her husband to the hobby with**Splendor** and **Lords of Waterdeep**, and they had been talking big game to the other couple about how they were going to clean house at **LoW**.\n\nUnfortunately, LoW only plays 5, and there were 6 of us. I had brought along **Rise of Augustus** in case they were timid gamers, and **Keyflower** if they were down to compete. Everyone agreed to Keyflower, so I set it up and got  to explaining how to play.\n\nExplaining this game took what seemed like hours, mostly due to the fact we are all parents and someone was always leaving to make sure a baby was still asleep, or using the bathroom, or fetching beer. We finally made it through and the game was afoot.\n\nThis group caught on fast. New mom asked a lot of questions throughout the game and halfway through Summer season was saying she wanted to play this again already (she made 4th place). Babysitter took awhile to figure out moving goods and upgrades but finally caught on by Winter. She ended up with the most aesthetically pleasing village and 2nd to last. Babysitter's husband (always wins LoW) came in last by 1 point with his 3 tile village, focusing on gold hoarding for VP.  \n\nThe top 3 players were about 15-20 points of the losing group. I came in 3rd with a strong emphasis on transport tiles (I had the boat that doubled them and got the winter boat for VP for transport, very luckily). My wife took 2nd -1 point more than me- with no set strategy. She picked up the boat that let her bid on tiles with whatever colors, which nabbed her good winter tiles. The winner was new mom's husband, first by 1 point over my wife. He nabbed the mines early and was shoveling coal into his coal warehouse for 3vp each. He would have had more points from that but misplaced his warehouse 2 tiles away from his mine instead of next to it.\n\nTeaching this and playing with 4 new players took a loooong time, but everyone enjoyed themselves. I have yet to win this game and still love every minute of it. 10/10, 11/10 with rice, 12/10 with less interruptions.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424711200", "subreddit": "boardgames", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "hey man, i'm a videographer myself and i enjoyed your stuff. if you don't mind i'd like to put in a bit of feedback based around the cinematography and editing. i watched and rewatched your video a few times focusing on different elements\n\n1) first, i love the look of acceptance as he crabbed and took a dive. however i feel like that could have been a nice transition from the high pace part of the song to the much slower section.\n\n2) small nitpick - but the focus shift boat on the slings felt weird. i feel like it should have been towards the camera - being both more pleasant and almost bringing the audience in more.\n\n3) personally, i think a song such as this is a little (i hate to say it like this) mainstream sounding and doesn't fit as well (just the way it sounds when combined with rowing doesn't fly with me for some reason - although it is in my steady state playlist). the shot transitions after the drop were pleasantly timed though. before that was a little random and inconsistent with the song (hence less pleasing). the transition from the first drop to when the guy is holding the oar felt mis-timed (wait to cut to him). obviously, you cut to the music and put the calmer shots when the music was itself calmer - which was well done.\n\n4) the shot angle of the singles racing at 1:17 and 2:17 is tight. however, after the second timecode - you switch to a single with a low stroke rate, which feels misplaced (i would keep the high paced pieces in the high paced section of the song). however, i understand training trips usually consist of low stroke rates with high amount of focus on technique. because of this - the song i would choose would need to reflect the style of the trip (perhaps something with less drops?). personally i'll spend about a week finding the song that could accurately represent the overall feel of the trip. it is very difficult to work with footage that is mostly low paced and fit it to a high paced song. \n\ndoing a very quick search through some of my music, i found a song that to use as an example (so you can see where i'm coming from) and represents something that could capture what is a training trip and be fun to edit to - [Rather Be ft. Jess Glynne \\(Merk &amp; Kremont Remix\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKiJMxGBZi8)(personally i would take out the first 30 seconds). it has only 2 main drops that could be filled with quicker rowing pace and the rest isn't too fast for slower establishing, \"team having fun\", and rowing shots.\n\n5) gopro shot at 3:12! oh boy love those (basically my main method of filming) - eg. [something i made 2 and a half years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4SGvpytYlM). The thing with them is the color correction. they require a fair amount of attention to get pleasant coloring, let alone any style of the film you're trying to attain. at the very end, try to match the whites with the shot before it. same thing goes with almost all of the shots in general. a good mixing of colors can really make a video pop and please the audience and film kids like me. it will help make it look more natural and less... gopro-y. if you know about dynamic stretching, it works wonders on when we mount on boats (since it is a fixed viewpoint).\n\n6) gopro aside, i'm pumped you used an actual camera (i'd be interested to know all the details most wouldn't). it looks really pretty\n\n7) title zoom off the shirt at the end - brilliantly done. took me a second look to realize what you did\n\nOverall 8.9/10, 9.9/10 with rice.\n\nI wrote this review for an hour instead of doing my homework.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424843010", "subreddit": "Rowing", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
